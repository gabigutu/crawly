		<shortDescription>..most people missed the point the movie is not present-day..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to stop reading the commentaries, because some people thought they were attorneys and rambled-on about injustice. My Friends, in the era this film is about, none of the story would be unusual. There are prejudices much worse even now - I was amazed that one person actually compared this wonderful film to "Crash": give the world a break!! If "Crash"...Ugh!...proved anything, is was to reassure EVERYONE racism is still America's cancer.I am from Biloxi, Mississippi - along the Gulf Coast. That city has always been a melting-pot, so many different races live together. In my youth, it was Czechs and other European races. Today, can you believe, it is Vietnamese ! The city has also always been a tourist-area, and always had some form of gambling before it became The Las Vegas of the South - perhaps that has tempered the people there from the state's interior's citizens. Canton - during the '60s - would have been just as it is portrayed in this film.Because of the many TV-courtroom sitcoms, etc., today's population would wonder why there was no strongly-worded assurance the district attorney planned "to appeal". What? We are not talking about modern-day justice in this film - Shamefully, this is Mississippi at its worst, and I know about that. We didn't have this kind of racism in Biloxi then, perhaps because African-Americans "stayed in their place", a shameful statement if there ever were one. All the foreigners and citizens of other states who are not aware of those days - how can you comment on the film, except to give a critique ? Like many of the people who wrote commentaries, I can watch this film once-a-month. ALL of the cast gave a superb performance; the story did not drag; the places that were filmed were true-to-life; to some folk's surprise, there ARE people who live in the state who do not speak like idiots: people think I'm English!; Mathew Mc was astounding and Sandra Bullock's performance was exactly as it should have been, as an activist "little rich girl"; Southern gave a true performance of a alcoholic lawyer; Sam Jackson was masterful and expressed the difference in being "white" and "black"; Kevin Stacy's portrayal of a Southern lawyer with all the connections, right on; I can think of no one who wasn't brilliantly cast.Missed by many people who made comments, this film is a statement that today we are brutally MEAN to one another: "Crash" re-states this fact, although it is not nearly as poetic. Do I own this film? You betcha!! I'll most likely have to buy another, and it will be money well-spent. Grishom knows how to get our attention, and "A Time to Kill" clearly demonstrates all who were involved in its making were determined to keep his story pure. Wake-up, People - many parts of our world are not pretty today......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Strong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A truly tense film that takes place in present-day Mississippi. A young African-American girl has been raped by two backwoods white men. Her father (Samuel L. Jackson) takes the law into his own hands and kills the two. Now the small town becomes a hot-bed of controversy as a murder trial starts that gets national attention. There is the defense attorney (Matthew McConaughey) and his bright-eyed assistant (Sandra Bullock) against prosecutor supreme Kevin Spacey. A really solid film that works because of a screenplay that pulls no punches and revolutionary direction by Joel Schumacher. A great ensemble cast all excel here and the film captures a place that has turned into a media circus very well. A film that you will watch with clenched fists. An intense experience. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was surprised this movie was this good after reading the book.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very much drawn into the book, and thought that it would be hard to get the same feeling out in a movie.At the beginning I thought I was right. From the beginning I was thinking "they left out a whole mess of details." I was irritated that they did not develop the characters better like in the book.But by the 3rd quarter of the movie this was the last thought in my mind. And by the end I understood that the screenwriter had very skillfully budgeted his (limited) screen time for the most important parts of the movie, where it is well spent.I think the acting of the principals was very good, and I found especially for Sandra Bullock as Ellen Roark - who was the most believable character. Although the rest of the acting was very good, I felt she was the most believable.Which raises the main weakness of the movie, as good as it was, having read the book, I could not help being reminded that most of the characters were in fact, actors in a movie. Except for Ms. Bullock, there was a bit of woodeness to the "folk" in this small southern town. Also the plot is a bit contrived (but true to the novel). Most important is that (for me) it worked. I was moved. Its a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure why I didn't see this film when it came out, but I watched it for the first time last week and was blown away. "A time to kill" is not only very well done, but it shows the way racism is dealt with in an intertesting way. Every character is not only well developed, but the actors playing them make it totally believable. Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson, who remain two of the finest American actors are definetly one of the best parts of the film. I'm not really sure how this film was received when it was released, but I consider it to be one of the most well done films I've seen recently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining spectacle with a nice comment on justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Courtroom dramas are well known for providing thrilling films, and that is exactly what 'A Time to Kill' thrives on; entertainment value. It is clear that the film, in spite of having some very potent themes, puts most of it's focus on being entertaining and it's actually not a bad film for it. Sometimes, films that want to be entertaining and have themes fall down because they're too entertaining and the themes get left by the wayside; but A Time to Kill puts its cards on the table from the start, and it's always clear what this film wants to do with itself. The plot follows a man who, after his daughter is raped and almost murdered, decides to take the law into his own hands. However, this man is also a black man living in a white supremacy state, and so the film injects a racism theme into it's plot, which is always going to mean that it will have some sort of social commentary within it. However, that isn't the most interesting comment that the film wants to make; as that plaudit falls to the idea of justice, and exactly what justice is.The film, based on a novel by crime writer John Grisham, presents an impossible situation to the viewer and central characters; what do you do when justice will prevail whatever the verdict? The viewer and the characters must then make a choice between the law and general morality, and it is there where the film draws it's most interesting plot point from. While, as mentioned, it's always clear that this movie is meant to entertain you; it's always nice to be given something to think about as well. A Time to Kill benefits immensely from an absolutely fabulous cast, which includes the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock, Kevin Spacey, Kiefer Sutherland, his father Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd, Chris Cooper and more, all of which are lead by Matthew McConaughey. It is the lead that most lets the film down, as although McConaughey can definitely act, he's not quite charismatic enough to deliver a lead performance in front of that cast. Still, the movie is definitely very decent and although you probably wont hurt your brain watching it, it will entertain you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I had seen in ten years! One of the ten best I've ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie dealt with such a deplorable subject.. such a sickening act, without so much as one single gratuitously violent scene in the whole perfectly realised masterpiece.It's a chilling, thought-provoking, hard-hitting piece that's taut, absorbing, and impeccably well-paced.There are jaw-dropping performances by numerous top-flight actors here, not a-one letting the ball drop even once. Not one actor's time or talents were wasted in this extremely well thought-out project.. not one actor wasted a cent of the money we paid to see it.Matthew McConaughey's "Jake Brigance" was an incredibly lucky shot of an acting debut that he took and ran with like the wind, turning in an amazing, heart-stopping, truly star-making performance, which may prove to be the crowning achievement of his entire career when all is said and done.. It will be a treacherous climb to try and top it, certainly.Class act Donald Sutherland is superbly cast in a quiet, and profound role, as "Jake"'s, {now no longer practicing}, professor, a perfect fit, this role, for a man of such rare eloquence~ There is a sizzling sub-story going on between "Jake", a devoted family man, and Sandra Bullock's character that could not have been tighter, steamier, nor more well written and played out.I recommend this movie to anyone who believes in justice, who has a child, or only knows one.You want cheap, tawdry, sleazy, violent 'entertainment'? There's not one thing here for you~Killing cannot be considered "right" by any means; but sometimes it's just not as simple as "THOU SHALT NOT KILL". So many of us say, "I would kill for my children, {or other loved one's}!".. but would we? ..Would we be in the "right"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here's a tough revenge film that tells it like it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This tough filming of Grisham's novel about a black man's revenge for the brutal rape of his daughter by whites might lead one to some maxims for guidance of anyone in such a situation. Don't wait for the law to help when you know it won't. But, if you act on your own, be prepared for the worst. Don't always assume that someone different is automatically your enemy. That's racist mentality no matter from which end of the color spectrum you are observing. There are probably others one might deduce. This is a powerful and thought provoking film, well acted and produced. It puts the KKK in a true perspective as a bunch of neo-nazi thugs, and, mirabile dictu, there are no "obligatory sex scenes", at least not in the version I saw. My only cavil is the "happy" ending. It seems unlikely in the given environment, but then again maybe not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding actors, timeless story, a must-see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this is actually one of the best movies I've ever seen, not only 'cause of the great performances of all main- and supporting actors, but most of it all because of the message and the feelings it gave me while I was watching it and even still gives me. People are watching movies for the same reason they listen to music or look at paintings, they wanna feel. We all have to come along with people of different colors, nationalities and whatever. The best and most peaceful way to do that, like it's mentioned in the movie, is to listen to our hearts, which for me is the message that the director and screenplay-writer wanted to bring along. I hope I got the message, on any account it made me cry several times which is a thing not many movies have achieved yet. For me as a German who dealt a lot with the history of his own country and also a little with the history of the Ku-Klux-Clan, it was good to see that those people are shown as just what they are: A bunch of mind-sick, dumb and dangerous Nazis. The whole situation in the movie in my opinion stands at the appropriate rate to reality of that time in the south of the United States,what makes it very authentic and traceable. The reason I call it a timeless story although it's certainly set in a special time is that everyone is almost forced to think, at least subconsciously, about the way he or she is dealing with those problems of difference that are always gonna exist. I highly recommend this movie but I will not say enjoy or have fun 'cause you won't find these things in "A time to kill". I also love the title 'cause when you think about it, everyone can become a murderer in the right circumstances. But what you're gonna find is a captivating story, acting on its highest level and strong emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contrived and heavy-handed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Time To Kill is based on John Grisham's first novel, the one he wrote before he was famous, and the one that didn't skyrocket him to fame. (That would be accomplished by "The Firm"). That's why this movie didn't get made until much later, after Grisham was off churning out meaningless books with the movie dollar signs fresh in his head. Unlike most of those, this book was actually about something. It had meat, it had weight, and it had heart.But it also had a fatal flaw, and this fatal flaw gets translated into the movie. Namely, "A Time To Kill" sets you up.Here we have a black man (Jackson), on trial for the murder of two white men who brutally raped and tortured his 10-year-old daughter. We have an underdog lawyer (McConaughey) battling the big bad system to save his client. And oh, by the way, the whole thing is set against the backdrop of racism in Mississippi, complete with hooded KKK men burning crosses.In other words, we're supposed to sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We're supposed to believe that a father who loves his daughter is justified in killing the men who raped her. We're supposed to feel the injustice of a system where a racist all-white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge a brutal crime. We're supposed feel like we're standing alongside the people chanting "Free Carl Lee".But the racism issue is a smokescreen, and the whole thing is contrived. Carl Lee Hailey was a vigilante. Yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he wasn't innocent. This would have been true no matter what his skin colour, or the skin colour of the assailants of his daughter, the judge, the jury, or anyone else.And what's so heavy-handed about this film is that it paints anyone who believes Carl Lee should have been convicted is a racist. The message seems to be that if you believe that the law shouldn't be taken into people's own hands, then you might as well be burning crosses on a lawn somewhere wearing a hood.This isn't the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is inserted into a story like this, and it won't be the last. As a movie, A Time To Kill stays pretty faithful to the book, and the acting isn't half bad. But it played the hand it had been dealt, really. Even a good cast can't elevate bad source material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made, well-acted, but deeply flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are other reviews here expressing similar views, but I still feel impelled to add my comments. The film is generally well-made from a technical point of view, apart from possibly being too long. The acting is mostly very good, although Kevin Spacey isn't given much space to explain his character's motivation (apparently ambition rather than racism), and Sandra Bullock's only function seems to be as eye candy, which she admittedly manages very well.At a fundamental level the film's heart is in the right place in being opposed to racism, and I get the impression that it tried to set out to be some kind of definitive treatment of racism, perhaps why so many famous names agreed to be in it. However, it seems the writers bit off far more than they could chew (I haven't read the book, so I don't know how much of that is down to Grisham). The biggest problem, as many others have said, is that it ends up advocating vigilante justice. Aside from the fact that I don't agree with that position, I don't think that such a view actually helps the anti-racist cause at all - it's more likely to be applied to acquit white defendants who kill black victims. At the end the prosecutor invites the jury (and the audience) to imagine that the raped girl was white - but follow that through and imagine the defendant to be a white man who murdered black rapists ... in the end the message seems to be that it's OK to kill someone as long as you hate them enough. It's also convenient that the man killed was presented as totally evil and his guilt was in no doubt, which removes any of the moral ambiguity likely in a real case.Samuel L Jackson gives an excellent performance, but unfortunately this also undermines the plot - he comes across as someone with considerable integrity, but it's hard to believe that he would be willing to hide behind an insanity plea (and indeed he doesn't, when push comes to shove). We're presumably supposed to think that it's because he faces the death penalty, but in fact at one point he's offered a plea of manslaughter, although if you blink you might miss it. Why not take it, given that he must know his chances of acquittal are slim? Or if he wants to make a stand in court, why plead insanity?There are less serious flaws too. The medical experts, on whose testimony the case supposedly rests, are jokes - both are discredited for highly implausible reasons, and neither of them offers any real psychiatric diagnosis. The message seems to be that expert witnesses will say whatever they're asked to say, and shouldn't be believed. The fact that the injured policeman supports Jackson is moderately plausible, but still a bit convenient (and what if he had died?) I find it hard to believe that the KKK would march down the street in broad daylight. Other apparently serious crimes (riot, arson, kidnapping, attempted murder) go by without any visible attempt to detect or prosecute them. And the scene where the dog comes bounding back is ludicrous.My final reaction is to be left feeling rather dirty - as though I must be a racist because I disagree with the resolution. It may be that the film intended to explore different viewpoints and leave the audience to decide, but if so they seem to have forgotten it by the time they got to the end. The film did make me think about my views, read what other people thought here and add my own opinion, so at some level maybe it succeeded - but I worry that it may have re-inforced highly illiberal views in some people, which I hope is the opposite of what it intended.Final thought - try watching Law and Order, it covers issues like this with much more depth in about 38 minutes of screen time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glossy legal thriller with a rotten core</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Time To Kill" is based on the John Grisham novel - in Mississippi two drunken rednecks brutally rape and attempt to murder a young black girl. Her father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) in his grief and anger shoots both men as they enter the courthouse for their pre-trial hearing and faces a trial that could lead to his execution if he is found guilty of their murder. An ambitious young lawyer, Jake Tyler Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) takes on his defence no matter what the cost to his family and friends who are under threat from the Klu Klux Klan.The problem with the central premise is that Carl Lee Hailey guns down the two men before their trial so we don't know for certain they are going to get away with their terrible crime - and with the evidence against them it would be a racist jury indeed who found them innocent. This takes away a lot of the empathy for his plight as he clearly premeditates the killing and he is prepared to leave his family destitute if he receives life imprisonment or the death penalty. The only defence really offered is that it is racist to consider his actions unjustified, even though he manages to badly wound a police officer (leading to the amputation of his leg) - clearly an accident, but firing guns in crowded rooms is bound to cause that kind of mishap. The direction and editing do not help, with pointless scenes such as those that set to prove that Lee Hailey killed the men - a fact that wasn't in doubt. The handling of the whole racism issue is clumsily handled, as we are frequently told that the area is racist and yet they elected a black sheriff.Brigance is hardly a sympathetic character either, spending the evening before the start of the biggest trial of his career getting drunk and flirting with one of his helpers while his wife is out of town. The cast of the film is hard to fault, with even minor roles portrayed by famous artists such as Sandra Bullock, Kevin Spacey, Donald and Kiefer Sutherland and Patrick McGoohan. This tends to be a distraction as very few of the supporting cast have much to do. There is a strong script and fine acting all round, though McConaughey in his breakthrough role is somewhat overshadowed by the rest of the starry cast. The script is strong, in particular the closing speech of the trial is very powerful as it describes in greater detail the full horror of the actions of the murdered men. However the script in the main is heavily biased towards a very specific agenda and is highly manipulative.Overall the film left a bad taste in my mouth when the credits rolled as the message it seemed to be delivering was that it is okay to be a vigilante and anyone who thinks Lee Hailey deserved punishment for his actions is a racist. While I felt sorry for him and did not think he deserved the death penalty, allowing him to get away scot-free was going too far in my opinion. Not having read the novel I am unable to say where exactly the fault lies, but the cast despite their best efforts are unable to raise the material beyond its limitations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap, exploitative, tasteless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the worst kind of film.The plot is ludicrous, the characters are unrealistic stereotypes who never look like they believe it themselves. Are white people such monsters that they will continue to call two white child rapists in their 20s "good boys" and need to be persuaded that this might be grounds for provocation? Are black people universally inspiring? Do the Ku Klux Klan really stand outside court rooms shooting at lawyers with nobody intervening? Do judges really think that a fair trial can be conducted when the jury can hear a mob outside shouting "Kill him"? Do black people really stand shoulder to shoulder with the Klan waiting to hear the verdict? Do wives really take several months to realise that their husband might be defending a man from unfair hanging because he knew might have done the same thing? Do juries really acquit people of murder because they feel sorry for them? Do lawyers really use a defense of sanity in order to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? Worst of all, any high-minded principles of this film were lost to the completely exploitative and gratuitous use of sexual crime to titillate the audience. Was the subject of rape, let alone child gang rape, really in competent hands here? Is it really a subject that belongs in Hollywood hands? And if so, why the completely gratuitous kidnap and stripping of Sandra Bullock? And the completely pointless statutory rape charge against one of the witnesses? Seems like the director didn't feel THAT strongly about sex crime after all.This was taking the excellent plot of To Kill a Mockingbird and making a crass, shallow, tasteless money-spinner from it. Shame on them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very taut racial thriller !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one had me sitting on the edge of my seat. The 90s weren't as polite as the late 50s/ early 60s when we were riveted by "To Kill a Mockingbird", a book and film that author John Grisham credits as an influence to this story. Two "Good Ol Boy" racists go on a red-neck spree, disrespecting all things Black...men, women, and children. Their beer guzzling binge culminates in the rape and near murder of a 10 year old black girl. Samuel L Jackson plays her father...and he goes out for revenge, killing the two miscreants and seriously wounding a deputy sheriff in the process. The film there-after revolves around the very basic points : A. Can a Black man receive a fair trial even in the so-called "New South" after killing two white men...even though their crime was and is considered reprehensible by every decent human being? And B: Will the Black man receive competent legal representation and receive justice irrespective of his "vigilante" action which appears to many to be justified? What will be the fallout? Matt McConaughey's performance as the lawyer is slightly reminiscent of Gregory Peck in "Mockingbird". He has a moralistic reverence for the law, and endures the taunts of the townsfolk and his other encumbrances with fortitude. Sandra Bullock is convincing as the law student who wants to chime in and lend a hand for the experience. Don and Keifer Sutherland deliver solid support...the elder being a dis-barred lawyer who is ready with advice, the younger playing a racist Klansman out to get revenge for the two dead rednecks. The atmosphere hinges on the explosive as the racial tension builds, and it is a movie that is worth watching with a message worth pondering and remembering. See the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polished but thoughtless (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a young black girl is raped and left for dead, the police easily arrest the rednecks that committed the crime. However with a recent case resulting in an acquittal, her father Carl Lee takes matters into his own hands and kills the two men, wounding a marshal at the same time. When he is taken up into court for murder bright young lawyer Jake Brigance takes up the case while the racial tensions rise daily in the southern town.The last time I paid to see a Joel Schumacher film was `Batman &amp; Robin' and this type of film is the reason for that decision. Here we have the perfect example of a bad Schumacher film ? a highly professional film that is lacking in sense, logic and thought. The plot on paper seems reasonable but it has been turned into an extreme love song to violent vigilantism. Nobody can condone the rape of anyone, far less a child (of ANY colour) however neither can I condone the premeditated murder of anyone.The film tries to have it too many ways. Firstly we are sold on the murder on the basis that the town is so racist that the two rapists would be released was a given. But yet at the same time the same town is not so racist to find a black man guilty ? not to mention the fact that this supposedly racist town has appointed a black sheriff! The tasteless bit of the film is the fact that it isn't just a courtroom thriller and nor is it merely making the point that how awful rape is, on top of this it is a love song to vigilantism. The film makes it very clear (by having Carl Lee tell Jake that he's going to do something) that this was clear cut murder despite the actual trial claiming insanity. So we are asked to get behind someone who planned the murder of two men. I agreed there were mitigating circumstances but even with all the tricks in Schumacher's book I couldn't raise a smile when Carl Lee was freed on all charges!This political stance is typical for a film that portrays Jake as a liberal but then has him rant about using the death penalty for those HE feels deserve it! If that is a liberal then is it any wonder the film is so confused about it's politics! Yes, this is very professional and polished and you'll enjoy it while you're watching it, but really Schumacher is throwing up a smokescreen using a big budget, a big cast, issues of race etc to try and hide the fact that he is saying that some people deserve a good killing. Perhaps he would like to form his own lynching squad and go around dispensing justice to those HE feels deserve it?The cast is great and full of names, however this is another smokescreen designed to buy this film a nice new suit of clothes. McConaughey is quite good in the lead but he is unconvincing as a lawyer. Spacey is wasted with little to do except sit silently and lose a case that couldn't have been made easier for him. Bullock is strangely given top billing but has nothing to do; her character (indeed a lot of the characters) is pointless to the plot and seems to have been added to allow more famous faces. To facilitate her character, Judd is sent away halfway through the film to allow Bullock and McConaughey to get all sweet on each other. Likewise Sutherland (both of them), Platt, Dutton, McGoohan, Fricker et al tend to be underused or portrayed to one extreme or the other. Jackson has one very good scene but he doesn't leave much grey area in his performance due to the direction and script he has to work from.Overall this looks like a big Hollywood film for that is what it is. However all the budget, music, big name cast and directors in the world can only hide a confused standpoint for so long. I was hoodwinked for a while but as I thought about what I was being sold the whole thing became increasingly distasteful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Grisham and Joel Schumacher are two men who've never much cared whether the stories they tell make sense, and it shows.We're supposed to believe that a small Mississippi town is BOTH progressive and liberal enough to elect a black sheriff AND so racist that a black crime victim can never get justice. ANybody else see a contradiction here?Samuel L. Jackson's character claims the right to kill the men who attacked his daughter, because he insists black people can't get justice from a white jury. But later, a white jury acquits him... which proves he was WRONG, which means his action was NOT justified!Then there's the Kevin Spacey character, who makes no sense at all. Even in the Deep South, there is NO WAY that prosecuting a man for avenging the rape of his daughter could be a good career move. An ambitious politician would steer clear of such a case. He'd NEVER embrace it as a stepping stone to higher office.Grisham and Schumacher don't seem to grasp that this isn't 1890 any more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad I am ashamed of it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie endorses self-justice! It grants freedom to a black man who killed the men who raped his daughter and in the end he gets of scat-free! Despicable enough as this may be, there is also adultery in this film. The Connaughey character has the hots for the Bullock character and the film has some of those stereotypes of trial films (like the important news brought to the court in the nick of time)that make every aesthetically demanding film-goer such as me sick! I really cannot believe that someone liked this junk. It is a film so bad and holding up false ideals that I am unable to put my critic in an eloquently pleasing way. When will the American people wake up and find out that they are being manipulated 24/7 by films like these that turn reality into some BS where there is justice for all if only they take it into their hands. This cowboy attitude just makes me sick and in my eyes it represents everything that is wrong with America!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big overwrought stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10-year-old Mississippi girl Tonya Hailey is viciously raped by rednecks James Louis Willard and Billy Ray Cobb. They are taken into custody by Sheriff Ozzie Walls (Charles S. Dutton), but the girl's father Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) takes matters into his own hands killing both men and wounding a police officer. Jake Tyler Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) knows Carl and takes on his defense. Kevin Spacey plays D.A. Rufus Buckley, and Donald Sutherland is Jake's drunken partner Lucien Wilbanks. Freddie Lee Cobb (Kiefer Sutherland) leads a local rebirth of the KKK. Law student Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock) offers to help Jake.It's a John Grisham novel directed by Joel Schumacher. It's a lot of drama with very little tension. None of these characters especially Carl is worth our sympathies. Also there are a lot of ridiculous things like Carl visiting the injured cop in the hospital. It would never happen like that. It would help out Carl's character if the cop didn't get in the line of fire. It would clean up the morality mess and line up the ethical question better. It would also help to have Carl exhibit some mental problems so the insanity defense has some purchase.The story is hitting all the big stereotypes, and plays every race card. It's overwrought when it's unnecessary. There is no cross unburnt. There is no hood unworn. The NAACP is corrupt. And with so many big Hollywood actors, a lot of this feels fake. This is not a subtle movie. Then there is the ending. I cannot abide by it no matter how it's argued. But even if I agree, the closing argument by Jake was just hitting all the wrong notes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clichéd, formulaic claptrap and an insult to blacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the face of it A Time To Kill is the story of justice done, irrespective of race or ethnicity. Actually, it's nothing of the sort: it's just another piece of sentimental feelgood Hollywood schlock which is, at heart not just dishonest but quite immoral.When Samuel Jackson's hardworking black mill worker guns down in cold blood the two white trash low-lifes who, high on dope and booze, raped, tortured and tried to murder his ten-year-old daughter, we are meant to cheer. The trouble is, the film tells us, that because of latent Deep Southern racism, those two white men would most likely have walked out of court free men when they were brought to trial. So at least the murders ensured that 'justice was done'.Enter Mathew McConaughey's young, reasonably idealistic young lawyer who takes on the case of trying to defend Jackson because he, too, has a young daughter, and he, too, could see himself doing exactly the same to anyone who did her harm. McConaughey's first and only strategy is to argue that Jackson was temporarily insane when he gunned down the two white trash (in the courthouse in front of quite a crowd), but he comes unstuck when Kevin Spacey's ruthlessly ambitious district attorney manages to dig up dirt on the psychiatrist the defence puts on the stand and discredits his testimony.But anyway, the jury ? white to a man and woman - were anxious to get home, and unbeknown to everyone ? except us, the viewer, who listens in as they plot ? determine to find Jackson guilty come what may and get back to their white picket fences.However, justice ? or rather Tinseltown's fake take on justice ? prevails, and a last-minute summation by our idealistic young lawyer wins the day, the jury, the white biased judge and even the cynically ambitious DA. Jackson walks free, even though he had ? and had admitted he had -murdered two men in cold blood. Well, as we say in my neck of the woods, pass the sickbag.Just before starting to write this review, I looked up the statistics of blacks banged up in US jails. It seems that although they make up just around 13pc of the US population, they make up a staggering 40pc of prison inmates. I bet they wish they had a handful of cynical Hollywood producers and director Joel Schumacher around to ensure their brush with the law gets a happy ending. As it is, they can dream on, it ain't going to happen. Oh, and another statistic: with 2.1 million of its citizens banged up in jail, the US has a higher proportion of its citizens behind bars than any other country in the world. It makes the US proud boast of being 'the land of the free' look rather threadbare.The film's cockeyed view of what justice is and how the lot of the black man can apparently be ameliorated in just under ten minutes with the help of a good script and a couple of actors is not its only fault.At the end of the day and despite high production values ? Kevin Spacey, Samuel Jackson, Mathew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock and Donald and Kiefer Sutherland don't come cheap ? it is lazily and sloppily made. Every single character is at best two-dimensional and could have been played by anyone. Some characters are even, at the end of the day, redundant.We don't actually need either one of the Sutherlands to get the film moving. The entire film is shockingly formulaic, with the 'plot' so well-worn and hackneyed, you can get them four for a dollar down the market.Plot points are thrown in and forgotten ? the Ku Klux Klan, long thought dead and gone, not only show themselves but burn down a house and hold a public demonstration in the streets ? turn up but play little further part in the proceedings, even though the town of Canton where it all takes place, is flooded with National Guard armed to the teeth.There's a curious sub-plot where the idealistic lawyer almost ? almost ? has an affair with Sandra Bullock's brainy law intern even though he loves his wife and his family deeply. And Donald Sutherland is totally redundant. All he does is, unconvincingly, play a one-time hell of a lawyer who is now disbarred and an alcoholic. He is consulted once or twice by the young idealist, and despite once vowing never to enter a courtroom again ? don't you know it ? does so to witness the idealist rousing summation. Clichéd claptrap.The users rating of this at the time of writing is 7.4: that mystifies me. You will have seen this film, whether in the cinema or on TV, several hundred times before. And if you like this kind of schlock, don't worry ? it follows its inevitable path to the letter and you won't be disappointed.Me, I didn't like it at all, and only watched it to the end knowing that its dishonesty irritated me so much that I would be writing a review and felt I had to see the whole film. This is not good film-making in the slightest. It is Friday night fodder. Even the film's title is gratuitous rubbish: what does it mean? What does it refer to?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Time to Kill (1996): Dir: Joel Schumacher / Cast: Matthew McConaughey, Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey: Corrupt drama eager to manipulate to please the crowd. Instead of concentrating on racial issues, it tries to make a case for one's sanity. It is an over hyped mess pitting revenge against justice where the audience is unfairly placed as the jury. A young black girl is raped and urinated upon by two white males. Her father shoots them both dead at the courthouse and is placed on trial. When a white lawyer chooses to represent him the Ku Klux Klan become riled. Directed by Joel Schumacher who dealt with similar themes in The Client. Samuel L. Jackson plays a father with redeeming regret. Matthew McConaughey is very good as his lawyer who faces the wrath of the Klan. Unfortunately the supporting roles are chalk full of dumb stereotypes including Kiefer Sutherland playing the redneck Klan leader. Why these concealed villains are portrayed as ragged seems like a forced portrayal as oppose to fact. Sandra Bullock is an unnecessary romantic prop whose purpose is to bandage up McConaughey and glance at his ass because he just happens to be wearing no underwear. Kevin Spacey plays a quick witted opposing lawyer who is suppose to fail because of the twisted message. Standard courtroom drama giving viewers time to kill. Score: 5 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Populist Silliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of 'A Time to Kill' is relatively simple: little black girl is raped by big white men, bigger black father (played by designated scary black man Samuel L. Jackson) is vexed by said rape and in retaliation kills the offending white males (and injures a white officer of the peace in the process), and the media (mostly white), district attorney (white), and Ku Klux Klan (white, surprisingly) descend upon him like vultures. Jack Brigance, a hotshot lawyer who doesn't play by the rules (though would rather get Sandra Bullock to break them for him), takes black father's case. Of course, with a simple premise comes a need for substantial queries: can a single man or a state better serve justice, and should a judiciary be designed around idealistic or pragmatic sentiments? The problem is, though, that the film tries to answers these questions. From 'A Time to Kill's opening moments the audience is made painfully aware of the director's adamancy that we invest our sympathies with Jackson's character. The quick-cutting and distorted angles of the film's introductory rape sequence offer vicarious punishment for the viewer that makes us not only feel nothing but emphatic passion for the raped child, but also unconditional hatred towards her attackers (who are by no means the most difficult people to despise). This means that, regardless of the odd Horatian jab at insincere affirmative action advocates, Joel Schumacher clearly wants us to feel that the cosmically correct outcome of this trial is for the father of the victim to be found innocent of charges that were very rightly made. In other words, this film might as well be called 'Vigilante Justice: The Wave of the Future'.The filmmakers go even further by forcing the audience to be diametrically opposed to and even repelled by all parties featured in the film who are opposed to Schumacher's desired conclusion, even if they are parties of a somewhat honourable disposition (such as the son of the policeman who gets shot). By doing this, 'A Time to Kill' supports fascist ideals of vigilante justice, thus is conservative propaganda. Yet it tries to cover this up by throwing the race card on the proverbial table (a card which essentially permits persecuted minority groups to be placed above the law). This means that 'A Time to Kill' combines two of the worst attributes of both sides of the American political spectrum and in the process becomes a frightening hybrid of oligarchic ideologies and victim mentalities that nobody in their right mind would want to take credit. Despite all this, 'A Time to Kill' is strangely dynamic drama. Maybe it's the thrill of watching Armageddon fall upon a small and decidedly fragile town, with white supremacists having Molotov cocktails thrown at them and courtrooms playing host to drunkards and snide doctors; or maybe it's because Schumacher actually does a pretty good job of directing some utterly wonderful supporting actors (Donald Sutherland, Kevin Spacey, Kurtwood Smith, Oliver Platt) and some rather mediocre main ones (Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock). At any rate, this piece of populist exploitation works like an inexplicable charm. Unlike Grisham's novel, the film hooks you from the get-go and keeps you practically on the edge of your set until the beautifully delivered closing statement by McConaughey (his talent did not live through the 90's, but this scene is at least a marvelous requiem to it), after which things starting getting a bit anti-climatic.Ultimately, 'A Time to Kill' is a very solid film that does not deserve to be condemned purely on the basis of its fallacious morals. Not as intelligent or well made as 'The Pelican Brief', but certainly just as thrilling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ammunition for the Racist...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Grisham's novels were all the rage in Hollywood back in the 90s, and it was obviously felt that any of his works would be a sure-fire success, irrespective of content, which is perhaps why so little attention seems to have been paid to the implications of the story being told here and the opinions and assertions of the main characters.Basically, the film argues that murder is acceptable under certain circumstances. The killer ? a black man played by Samuel L. Jackson who guns down the redneck rapists of his ten-year-old daughter ? is defended by a slick but struggling white southern lawyer (Matthew McConaughy) who claims his defendant was temporarily insane when he turned his shotgun on his victims on the courtroom steps. What is fatally flawed about his argument ? and which is referred to in the film before being quietly dropped ? is that Jackson visited McConaughy some (indeterminate) time before the killings and calmly intimated to him that he was considering killing the men, thereby blowing apart the argument that he was operating under such unimaginable stress that he was incapable of rational, coherent thought.When McConaughy almost tearfully delivers his closing speech in court he convinces a jury that had already unanimously voted in secret to vote guilty to change their vote with a poignant recounting of the crimes inflicted on Jackson's daughter before urging the jury to 'now imagine if she had been white.' The implication here is that all whites are racists, the biggest ammunition any well-meaning fool can ever hand to the true racist; it's like arguing for a conviction by saying 'imagine if those good ol' white boys had been black and the gunman white.' This glaring miscalculation is merely the biggest symptom of a malaise that runs through the entire film which, it has to be said, is typically well-produced, and which entertains even as it infuriates. McConaughy plays his role with the kind of roguish charm that could just as easily be assigned to a charismatic villain ? a fact which, under the circumstances, is quite appropriate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised that this film was made. The spirit is fine the guilty are made to pay. Inside the law, murder is not condoned as an aspect of mitigation. Yes they were guilty, but so was the individual seeking revenge .In the spirit of staying within the law, the story had to be different. If you want death wish 19 fine. The thing is the audience cheer, great, but within the law revenge cannot be condoned, if the assailant is guilty. Make of it what you will, if this story could be passed by the legal profession, Abe, will fall out of his chair. Why are ten lines insisted on, surely its the conciseness,and the quality of the message that matters. The fact remains, the film is promoted on a legal platform, and yet violates its credibility by not being legally correct.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cast, pushes all the buttons, maybe too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For an excellent analysis of this film, scroll on down to Daniel R. Baker's review, he hits almost every nail right on the head. This was a pretty good film in some ways, largely due to the excellent cast. Some of the fake Southern accents were a little distracting, but I've certainly heard worse. A lot worse. At least they tried. As I say the acting was almost all excellent, and the director pushes every button really, really hard. That's where the film begins to pall. I read Grisham's book some years back, and cannot remember every detail, but it seems that he went into a lot of detail about being a young Southern lawyer, and that there was a lot more distrust between Brigance and Hailey than was shown in the film. However, you have to lose a lot of nuances to turn a 600 page novel into a movie, even if a fairly long one. (2.5 hrs) But the movie is excessively preachy about race. Yes, I know that race is the main subject. But, even in Mississippi, by 1996 the two racist, yahoo, rapists were not going to get a walk on a brutal rape and attempted murder of a 10 year old girl, even if she WAS black. Perhaps if this film had been set in the '70's, that premise might have worked better. That's why the "Now, imagine she's white." line is, in my opinion, offensive to whites AND blacks. One more point: I don't know about Mississippi law, but in most states when one is acquitted of murder by reason of insanity, one spends at least SOME time in a mental institution, and isn't out celebrating with family and lawyers the next day. Overall the film is worth seeing once. Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Time to Stop Letting Joel Schumacher Make Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joel Schumacher is a terrible director under the best of circumstances, but he can scrape together moderately competent films when he's dealing in pulpy genre pictures like "Flatliners" or "Phone Booth." God help us all, though, when he decides to get serious and make socially "important" films like "A Time to Kill." This screen adaptation of the John Grisham novel takes on race relations in America's deep South, and Schumacher and company commit themselves so eagerly to the sub-par material it's almost sad they couldn't manage to make a better movie out of it. Sandra Bullock looks completely uncomfortable exploring this dramatic material; Matthew McConaughey doesn't have the gravitas required for his role. He gets a big courtroom soliloquy at the end, and you can almost hear him whispering "Please nominate me for an Oscar" during each dramatic pause.Schumacher underlines and italicizes every emotion we're supposed to feel so that we're not required to do any work for ourselves. There's nothing more irritating than a film director who thinks he needs to hold his audience's hand.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misguiding Moral Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came away from this film fairly angry. I thought the several talented actors all gave strong performances, the direction was good and in general a pretty well done production. My main problem with the movie was on a moral standpoint.Samuel L Jackson plays a man living in the prejudiced south who's daughters are raped by two white bigots. In search of revenge he goes after them and kills them. The main part of the movie centers around Jackson's trial. McConaghey is the heroic lawyer for the defense and Kevin Spacey is the oily prosecutor. Sandra Bullock, and Keifer and Donald Sutherland round out the talented cast. After a heated trial and many looks at the ugly racism of the south, even in present day, Jackson is acquitted. In our society a man must be punished for his crimes. You are not allowed to kill another man period. I deeply empathize with Jackson's position, I might have done the same myself, but if we allow the public to take law into their own hands, we will create a vigilante society where no one is safe and the law means nothing. No matter how evil those two men were and how much they deserved to be punished, they needed to be punished by the law, not Jackson. I agree that sometimes the law does not always fulfill its duty but that is something we must fix with the legal system. We cannot use that as an excuse to allow civilian killings. I also think racism is a problem still and is something else we as a society must address, but this movie gives the message that killing in revenge is OK, and killing is never OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not "To Kill A Mocking Bird " or "In the heat Of the Night, two films that forcefully and righteously took on racism in the The South before the Civil Rights movement retired Jim Crowe. This "movie"(I cannot call it a "film "as it would give it the respect it does not earn.) No doubt "A Time To Kill" does justice to the Grisham book in the sense it portrays the fictional novel correctly. However the movie and the book is laughable with it's stereotypically characters, stretched plot line and paper thin believability. . Starting with the story line. Set in apparently modern day rural Mississippi, A black ten year old girl's brutally attacked, raped and left for dead by a pair of viscously depraved racists (needlessly to say white) The father, fearing his daughter's assailants would not get justice from the white jury, guns down the rapists before their trial. The main characters.are so cartoonishly evil or saintly good one would expect they would have horns and halos on their heads. The racists rapists are rednecks who drive pickup trucks and are as stupid morons only Hollywood could dream up (Openly bragging about their deeds in a county with a black sheriff?) The father of the victim is desperately poor but stands proudly with the dignity of the righteous. One has to support him despite his murdering of two unarmed, shackled men and the careless maiming of an innocent deputy sheriff . Anything less could be viewed as support for the most vilest of human scum. The loopholes in are overwhelming. The father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) believes his daughter's rapists will be acquitted by a white jury, the same white people who elected a black man for sheriff(a position of power in a rural county) And are viewers expected to believe a prosecutor with an eye for higher office, bring charge of first degree murder to a father of a brutally raged child? Only people who have biased view of Southerners, have never set foot in any state south of the Mason Dixon line or is Joel Schumacher, the director who ruined the Batman movie franchise with the insipidly bad "Batman &amp; Robin" would find this plausible. Even the at the height (or should that be the depths) of the days of Segegation the most ardent Segregationist wouldn't condone the rape of an ten year old child. But this is fiction, terribly bad fiction and the movie's plot demands villains and the political atmosphere for them to thrive, no matter how ridiculous. Another small but incredulous point is a how does a dirt poor family in the Mississippi Delta region afford an M-16(Ar-14?) but not an lawyer? An very expensive weapon that is not likely to be hanging from the walls of a poor black family. A real Carl Lee Hailey would more likely have an old family shotgun. Could the director be making a point about gun control at the expense of character creditability. In THIS movie? You betcha. Every good story has a lesson to be learned. With "To Kill A Mocking Bird " the point is clear. For true justice to be obtained, the law must be color blind. What is the message the audience of "A Time To Kill" are left to learn? That taking the law into one's hands is good, only if one's prejudices and the racial cause is politically correct? One need only to switch the color of the skin of the protagonists and see what "justice" is according to them. The makers of this piece of work have made the case for racial vigilantism, whether they intended to or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The storyline is compelling, the acting; very good, the direction; impressive, the only problem I have with this film is in the character of Sandra Bullock's, Ellen Roark. Her part was pathetically overwritten. If this was intentional to secure the interests of Ms. Bullock, then this is the movie's failing. I have nothing against Ms. Bullock as an actor, I have enjoyed her performances in numerous roles, however this happens to not be one of them. She is almost a comic book caricature of herself and it detracts from the impact of the story immensely. She professes to be a student of law, yet at many twists and turns she appears to be more knowledgeable of the law than her counterpart, the lead counselor for the defense (Matthew McConaughey), a bona fide licensed, practicing attorney. She also appears to possess a degree in medicine based on a scene where a simple "band aid" would seem counter-indicative considering the nature, source and force of the injury she simply 'dresses'.The closing argument (summation scene) is very emotional and should win this movie critical acclaim based on that merit alone, although this is somewhat jaded by some of the unrealistic, outlandish events which precede it and therefore merely lend toward relegating this film to cinematic mediocrity. It appears to be a bit melodramatic in some places and Donald Sutherland's role is weak, underdeveloped and unimpressive (pity because I really like Mr. Sutherland as an actor). All in all, it's definitely worth the watch for the compelling storyline, if nothing else, about racial injustice, but if you happen to miss it, you won't regret too much. Matthew McConaughey is excellent in his role as the inexperienced, though passionate, lead defense attorney and deserves all due praise.</fullReview>

Though flawed, the book was one of Grisham's only that I truly liked, especially how it captured the flavor of a deep south small town, a slightly different world to a coastal urbanite such as myself. I also loved the matter-of-factness, naturalness of what occurs in the book. In the movie characters are given a "nobility" of personality that seemed so stilted. The villains and foils are flat and 1 dimensional. But as with so much of Joel Schumacher's work, genuineness and authenticity are conspicuously absent, and every point must be delivered via sledgehammer to the midsection. So preachy, stilted, and superficial about so horrendous a tragedy, I wish someone would do a remake and get the story a little more right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read "A Time to Kill" by John Grisham, and perhaps that would have helped understand the film better. But perhaps not. I hear this is the most faithful Grisham adaption yet, and if that is true, I can see why so many publishers turned down the novel when Grisham introduced it as his first work."A Time to Kill" is one of those films that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. It wants to be a suspenseful crowd-pleasing thriller and, at the same time, a film dedicated to exploring certain social and moral questions. Let's face it, those two types of films do not go together in Hollywood, which is why "Dead Man Walking" had to be made independently.The story involves a young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConaughy) out to defend a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson) from murdering two hillbillies that brutally raped his young daughter. The day before the rapists' trial, Carl hid in a closet in the courthouse and when the rapists were brought through the building, he charged out and shot both of them dead. To help out with the defense, Jack accepts the help of a former law student (Sandra Bullock), who proves that her role in this film was totally unnecessary, and put in the film only for marketing purposes.Meanwhile, one of the rapist's kid brother (Kiefer Sutherland) was angered that a black man killed his brother and decided to act out a revenge. All of this leads to a shooting in front of the courthouse, a kidnapping, a brutal beating, and race riot. I'll admit that all of this held my attention greatly throughout the film, in addition to the courtroom scenes. What I later objected to was the film's handling of ethical questions and its use of formulas in the plot.The main question that the film constantly asks, over and over again, is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. Sure they can, but that doesn't mean that the man has to be acquitted in order for the trial to be fair. This film, however, doesn't seem to think so. Besides that, there several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences. For example, there is an unknown character called Mickey Mouse, who is a member of the Klan, and, for reasons unknown, is helping the members of the defense team escape from serious dangers of the other members of the Klan. After Bullock is kidnapped by Sutherland and company, and left for dead in the wilderness, this unknown person comes and saves her---and we NEVER find out who he is and why he is helping out the people he should be terrorizing.And speaking of the Sutherland character's reign of terror, it's amazing how witless the police and the Bullock character are in stopping him throughout the film. There's a scene when Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake as he comes out, shooting one of the guards instead. Now you'd think since there are dozens of police around, it would be easy to surround and capture the sniper. No such luck. From what we could see, no one seemed to even care that a sniper was still on the loose. Even after Bullock, was rescued by Mickey Mouse, she never, ever mentioned who her kidnapper was, nor was it even questioned. Why was this? Simple. The Sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continual suspense, although logically, he should have been out of the picture.Besides Bullock's character, there another thankless character. He is Jake's assistant played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be one reason for his character to be in the movie--to supply a number of one-liners for the audience. In my opinion, one-liners show a major weakness in "serious" films when used. It demonstrates that the filmmakers are not confident that the story and dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention, and so use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining film.But enough of the film's many minor problems. What about the film's message here? It is clear that Carl is indeed guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. The lawyers argue that it was temporary insanity, etc that caused him to kill. In desperation, Jake asks the jury to close their eyes as he recounts the rape in detail as part of his closing arguement. After describing everything that took place, he adds on one final line..."The girl is white". We then see members of the jury with tears in their eyes.In the very next scene, a girl comes out yelling "He's free! He's free!". Wait a minute! Do juries base their verdicts on their emotions or on the facts? Most of all, why weren't there any scenes that showed the jury deliberating and what they were really thinking after their emotions worn off. I'll tell you why. They couldn't show the delibertion because NO JURY could acquit a man of such a crime, no matter how much the defense's closing arguements touched their hearts. What is the message? That someone is justified in killing if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime done to them?This film should have had the courage to say that murder is NOT OK in this situation, because in reality, there would not be an acquittal. But since dollars were at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned about sparing the audiences' feelings than they were about presenting a responsible message. If people start killing as a form of revenge, the makers of this film should be held responsible. What a socially irresponsible film this is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'A Time To Kill' is without doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie is so subjective so it's beyond endurance. The director Joel Schumacher tries to force his own terms on the audience.The movie so obviously pictures the character of Carl Lee (Samuel L. Jackson) as a very sympathetic person who is as good and innocent as the nice little boy next door. But this is a man who murdered two men with cold blood. I can't have sympathy for him for committing murder, even though the guys he murdered raped his daughter. Of course Carl Lee has to be punished for what he has done - in my opinion. Yet the director forces his own terms on us - that we have to have sympathy with Carl Lee. And if you can't agree with that the whole movie falls apart. The director makes the big mistake to force his own opinions upon the audience instead of letting people think themselves.Therefore, I really can't recommend this piece of trash as I can't have any respect for the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's incredible: Schumacher seems genuinely unaware that in exacting revenge on the two rapists, Hailey has done anything wrong. There's not a hint of recognition. If "A Time to Kill" had merely glorified violence, it would have been a much less despicable production; after all, it's possible to glorify something without endorsing it.Although Hailey is a much nicer person than the two men who rape his daughter, he has committed a greater crime than they have. For one thing he kills the two rapists BEFORE their trial. They MIGHT, after all, be convicted; indeed, there's no indication that their won't be: the most anyone says is that they `might' get off. Hailey doesn't even wait and see. He simply strides into the town courtroom - the COURTROOM: if THIS isn't a crime against society, I'd like to know what is - and shoots away, incidentally wounding a police officer and causing him to lose his leg. (If part of the rapists' crime was that they maimed an innocent person, well, Hailey also maims an innocent person.) He's subsequently tried for murder (but of course!) and the fundamentally dishonest show trial that follows ignites a riot in which one person is killed, others are injured, and an incalculable amount of ill feeling is generated.There is almost comedy in the fact that Hailey justifies himself by talking about his responsibilities as a father. ALMOST comedy, because Schumacher is too dense to notice comedy when it arises. Hailey has three or four children APART from the one who was raped. What about THEM? By indulging his desire for revenge he risks being imprisoned, which would hurt them, collectively, more than it would hurt him. And if by some fluke he ISN'T imprisoned he has hardly set his children a good example.It's the casual way Schumacher assumes that we will be on Hailey's side, and on the side of the shyster lawyer who subverts the legal system as much as possible in defending him, that really grates. It doesn't even occur to him that anyone in the audience might see things differently (i.e., correctly). If anyone DOESN'T share Schumacher's apparent view that the courts exists solely to gratify our desire for revenge, and that we might as well exact revenge ourselves if the courts fail to exact it on our behalf - well, then, that person is left in the cold. Apart from being stupid and evil the film is utterly unremarkable. It's like the Canadian national anthem, or a group of unattractive cheerleaders: it won't stir you in the least if you're not already on the side it's so mindlessly supporting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simmering courtroom drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahh, the courtroom drama. Or, in Joel Schumacher's A Time To Kill's case, the fired up courtroom scorcher. A massive team of actors gather together here to tell the hot blooded tale of one African American man on trial for a brutal murder that is seen by many as justified, but to the prosecutor working the case is just another statistic that will help him vault over the pole to his next suit &amp; tie victory. It's based on a book by John Grisham, and Schumacher also adapted his story The Client, with admirable but less energetic results. This is one my favourite courtroom films, mainly due to the feverish energy of the American South that thrums beneath events like a heart ready to beat out of its chest. Every character has a mad glint in their eye and an epic film of sweat drenching them, and it's easy to see why when you examine the high stakes, hot tempered powder keg of a trial they are involved in. Samuel L. Jackson is brilliant as Carl Lee, a simple African man accused of mercilessly gunning down two cracker asses (one of which is a grimy Kiefer Sutherland). These two punks are responsible for the rape and prolonged brutalization of Carl's twelve year old daughter. A righteous knee jerk reaction for anyone, right? Try convincing a jury in the South of that. Conflict flares up faster than the fire adorning the crosses left on lawns by the arriving KKK, and soon the pressure is on to find the perfect prosecutor and defender for his case. Young upstart Jake Brigans (Matthew McConaughey) is picked to defend, facing off against a seasoned and annoyingly smug prick played by Kevin Spacey. Jake is blessed with the ingenuity and intuition of a law clerk (Sandra Bullock, excellent) and the sagely patronage of a veteran lawman played by a salty Donald Sutherland. It's a tricky case though, with tempers and racial tension running high and a near constant air of danger for people on both sides of the table. Lee stands by his choice and boils in righteous fury that doesn't quell the hurt once it's simmered down, something which Jackson achingly imparts. Jake is swept up in the spectacle of it all, until his relationship with his wife (Ashley Judd) and finally his very life are at stake. Bullock brings the sanity of the big city to this backwater set melodrama and gives some of the best work of the film. Morality is tentatively explored, even though it's clear as day that Lee was completely justified in his actions, and the outcome of the trial should reflect this. That sentiment is right there with the film's title. But does it? You'll have to watch and see. The epic cast lineup also includes work from Oliver Platt, Brenda Fricker, Kurtwood Smith, Charles S. Dutton, Patrick McGoohan, Nicky Katt, Beth Grant, Anthony Heald, Octavia Spencer, M. Emmett Walsh and a moving Chris Cooper in a small role. It's a long film, but it sustains its energy and pace for the duration, with McConaughey's refusal to buck the horse and throw the trial a key asset in letting us feel the hurt of a community torn inside out in one act of flagrant evil. It's up to him and his crew not to right that wrong (realism dictates that it's too late), but to give a modicum of solace to those further endangered by the very same evil. A winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All-star cast in a solid racially-charged crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1996 and based on John Grisham's book, "A Time to Kill" chronicles events in Canton, Mississippi when an honest black man (Samuel L. Jackson) takes the law into his own hands after a couple of beer-guzzling white rednecks brutally rape his 10 year-old daughter. Matthew McConaughey plays his lawyer, Sandra Bullock his uber-liberal assistant, Ashley Judd his wife and Oliver Platt his friend. Donald Sutherland in on hand as an alcoholic defrocked lawyer while Kevin Spacey plays the staunch prosecuting attorney. Patrick McGoohan appears as the dubious judge while Kiefer Sutherland is on hand as a friend of the rednecks who gets the Klan involved. "A Time to Kill" is essentially a mishmash of 1988's "Mississippi Burning" and 1992's "A few Good Men." Although it's not excellent like the former film it's about on par with the latter and you can't beat the all-star cast. The weakness is the first act where events come across a bit too contrived, smelling of political correctness rather than reality (more on this below). But the story pulls you in during the second act. And the viewer's sympathies are definitely with Jackson's character. A timeline for the events is never provided so it's assumed that they take place during the mid-90s when the movie was released (if not, they'd have to take place around 1989 when the book was published). This presents a believability problem for the rednecks' rampage in a rural black community during the opening. Would several strong black men really tolerate the disrespectful antics of these white scumbags in their own communities in the mid-90s or late 80s? Then there's the problem of the entire scenario being one-sided: The ultra-evil characters are white men, but all blacks are virtuous. I'm white and was held up in the deep south in 1990 (the general timeline of events in the movie) by three young black guys with guns, who stole all my money &amp; camera equipment and then took off with my car (thankfully, they let me live and my car was found abandoned shortly later). You'll see none of this in "A Time to Kill." Young white dudes are the problem. Poppycock. I'm not saying there isn't white trash out there, but how about some evenhandedness more akin to reality? At least 2004's "Crash" had the integrity to show the awful truth right out of the gate.Despite my criticisms, this is a worthy crime thriller if you appreciate the aforementioned movies. The movie runs 149 minutes and was shot in Canton &amp; Jackson, Mississippi; Tampa, Florida; and London, Ontario.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Expected a thriller...But this was alright, especially near the end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a big trial with other racist stuff going on in the background. The thing that drives this movie is how the case is going to turn out, not because you want it to turn out one way or the other. But because of the situation of it all, since one way human justice prevails and the other way it turns out justice still prevails. Mathew Matthew McConaughey is good at playing a lawyer, Samuel L. Jackson is good at what he does in roles like this and Kevin Spacey was perfect for the role he is given. I didn't really find the movie to be engrossing or gripping since I seen a lot of movies like this. Nor did I find it interesting or entertaining but it's still a pretty big case. I am not sure if this movie is based on a true story but if it was it would have been a well made movie but I wasn't sure if it was a true story or not while watching. Some parts show the difficulties of situations such as what this movie portrays. Especially with the stuff that happens in the background and the situations the characters must face to overcome certain obstacles. Racism is a ugly thing and this movie really does show the ugliness of it and what it can lead to. The title of this movie didn't really fit what is going on all that much in my opinion, I was expecting more of a thriller. But this has some good dramatic moments especially as the movie comes close to the end. The premise of how the odds are against certain characters with the situation and all, especially because of where the court takes place and the judge. Was well done although not all that gripping and heartfelt until it comes close to the end. But the way the characters overcome certain obstacles inside and outside of the courtroom even some putting themselves and loved one in jeopardy to do what they thinks they had to do no matter what the cost. Especially when it came to the protagonist in this story. The final speech in the court is really gripping though and is a bit of a tear jerking moment. Since it comes from the heart and not flashy lawyering.6.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not as if the trial of a black man in the racist South hasn't been done before - To Kill A Mocking Bird leaps out, and that is a better film (and book) than A Time To Kill.But that's not to say that this film should be discounted. One of the earliest screen adaptations of one of Grisham's earliest novels, it is a good yarn, exciting, steamy and atmospheric, filled with well-drawn characters, and containing a terrific courtroom sequence. When you add to that the fact that the film is populated with a terrific cast, star quality from start to finish, and then take into account the fact that the movie also has some worthwhile points to make, then you have a film which is well worth watching.Finally, and this is where my personal viewpoint comes in, I have always felt that Grisham's heart was in this story: subsequent books often had the feel of product for the market, but this one felt as if he meant it, and that comes across on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to Fill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you have two and a half hours to fill you might as well fill it with lots of stars and that's exactly what they did. The problem was that at the heart of it they put Matthew McConaughey. Set against Samuel, Donald, Kevin and even Sandra and Oliver..... the boy just don't cut it. There's a big empty hole where the film slips through. The plot of course has enough holes to make a colander, so between these two problems, it can never stay in one piece.Fortunately you can enjoy the morsels of your choice without feeling too guilty about missing the rest of the mashed-up meal. I've 'watched' this movie several times now and Patrick McGoohan's Judge, Omar Noose, is getting better with the watching. He's excellent in the earliest court scenes, revitalising an already flagging tale. His keynote scene is, of course in the outside world, on the balcony of his home, painting. That's when his judge's chirpy legal cynicism (as in realism), comes most clearly to the foreground. However, watching it again the other night I'm beginning to enjoy his later scenes in court as well, where he doesn't get to do that much apart from twitch and bang his gavel and growl threateningly at his noisy courtroom........ and sense the wind of change that blows his legal ship towards a more politically correct shore.He didn't get so many plaudits for this one as he did for 'Braveheart', but I'm starting to like both performances, as much as each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good story - Mixed results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that the story serving as a basis for this film was a good one if a little contrived. I also thought that bringing the race issue into it was unnecessary and gave the impression the author was being one sided. The question I ask is : could the film have been made, would it have had any success if the colours had been reversed, i.e. small white girl raped by two black men, white father kills black men in anger, white man acquitted because the crime of rape was so horrible. I am sincerely not sure that such a film could have been made, due to Political Correctness which has infested the USA which means that any type of film dealing with the racial issue will automatically portray the bad guys as white and the good guys as black, or if indeed there is a bad black guy, there will always be another good one to contrast with this. So the race issue would have been best left out of this because as we all know, no race is free from killers and loonies and rapists. The more interesting question is whether you can take the law into your own hands to resolve a problem which you think at the time the justice system will not be able to resolve for you. This is the interesting part of the film and I would for one side with Matthew McConaughey whom I thought gave the most convincing performance in the film, although I do reproach many of his dialogue as being incomprehensible ( bad diction - strong and slurred accent ). The same goes for Samuel Jackson. Kevin Spacey, though, was brilliant and clearly audible in the role of the unrelenting procureur. On the other hand I was extremely annoyed by bleeding heart liberal Sandra Bullock ranting on against the death penalty and wondered what the point of having her in the film was. The more I see this woman in films, the less I like here - here characters are shallow and lack depth. She was out of place in this film, and apart from miraculously uncovering information about the state physician, contributed little to the proceedings. At least she was taught a lesson by the KKK, whose intervention on other levels seemed very violent and unpleasant - but I would have preferred the whole "race" aspect - KKK and all - to have been absent from the film. I am not sure in what period the film is set, and don't know how active the KKK is today. Anyway, these problems were dealt with far better in the film Mississippi Burning with Gene Hackman which was a great film. My main beef, though, remains the quality of the dialogues and the intelligibility of the speech which really was below par. I liked the happy ending and was pleased to see Matthew McConaughey and his family visiting Samuel Jackson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I re watched this the other night on a slow TV night "A Time To Kill" is already 11 years old, which you realize pretty quickly when you see Matthew McConaughey is playing a lead role in a serious movie. Not only that, but he's pretty much the glue holding the whole movie together, and being fair, he does it really well. Not sure what he did after this to send his career down the toilet, but he showed here he's got some skills, especially reflected in his final summation, one of the greatest 10 movie scenes of all-time.The movie is about a father (Jackson), who takes justice into his own hands after a couple of hillbillies rape his 10 year old daughter. What was supposed to be the trial of these two villains becomes the trial of a father who sought, and executed, revenge. Complicating the case is that it's in the deep south, in a town where there is a brewing underbelly of white supremacists who don't want to see a black man go free. The further the case goes, the bigger the rise of the white supremacists, culminating in the comeback of the KKK (probably the most annoying part of the movie and a storyline they didn't need to go for). Will Matthew McConaughey be able to free Samuel L Jackson, or will racism win? A great story, very well executed by one of the strongest casts in memory. You've got your Matthew McConaughey's and your Samuel L Jackson's, but you've also got your Sandra Bullock's, your Ashley Judd's, your Kiefer Sutherland's (in the post "Young Guns 2", pre "24" period),your Donald Sutherland's, your Kevin Spacey's plus a stack of "hey it's that guy's".Thought provoking and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

Instead the characters were 1 dimensional comic book characters lacking the depth from the book. It is hard to make a movie about a blockbuster book from such a talented author as John Grisham, and Joel Schumacher failed. Instead of a brilliant combination of acting, action and harrowing court-room drama the movie felt rewritten, overworked and under acted.

		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) A young lawyer defends a black man accused of murdering two men who raped his 10-year-old daughter, sparking a rebirth of the KKK. This movie sparked up interest on my end because of the all star cast. I didn't really have any expectations for it, despite the solid rating on IMDb. I can't say i was disappointed, since I didn't have that many expectations for it to begin with. It's technically well done, just lacking tension in all the required areas. Don't get me wrong, the rape scene at the beginning is very uncomfortable and visibly disturbed me. The rape of a 10 year old girl is unfathomable to me. I would have done the exact same thing Jackson did in this movie. You gotta avenge your daughter in a horrible situation like that. You shove all moral beliefs aside. That's when things begin to go downhill. McConaughey is very good, as are Jackson, Bullock, Sutherland, etc. The acting was fantastic, I just stopped caring at about an hour in and it lost me. It's way too long as well. It's worth a look, but I'd keep the expectations low if I were you5.6/10</fullReview>

I am not from Mississippi, but my family is from the South (mom from Arkansas, dad from North Carolina), and I grew up in NC. While things have come a long way and my parents were not even close to being racist, some people still think it's Reconstruction, or at least segregation. It's sick. And people don't think I'm from the South either from the way I speak...I've had people ask if I am from Canada! Another thing I have heard commented on is the way women are portrayed...you can see more of this in the book than in the movie, but I noticed the way that Sandra Bullock's character was sort of 'talked down to' by Harry Rex and sometimes by others...in the book, there is a lot of talk about women being submissive...it might seem offensive offhand, but that too is fairly common in the South, where calling someone 'honey' or 'sweetie' isn't uncommon or meant to be rude. And I don't know if it is clear from the book or movie, but the story is set in 1984, not today. That was explicitly stated in another Grisham novel, The Chamber, but looking back I could see from the book that it was set in the past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not completely interested in all parts to the story, I think it is just the court case I like. Basically, the young daughter of Carl Lee Hailey (Golden Globe nominated Samuel L. Jackson) is horrifically beaten, raped and hanged to die (which she didn't), and he kills the men responsible for this crime. But this is what creates the court case. Carl Lee Hailey wants justice for the crime that the men committed, and lawyer Jake Tyler Brigance (Matthew McConaughey, the film that launched his career, three years before Edtv) is determined to help him. The opposition, D.A. Rufus Buckley (Kevin Spacey) is determined to show everyone that he did still carry out an unlawful act against two men who were going to have justice brought to them.

		<shortDescription>Good type of movie, but not perfectly executed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Didn't like how they kept using the "n" word, and the plot structure wasn't perfect, but these types of social comment movies need to be made. To Kill a Mockingbird is a near perfect book and Movie on the same subject, buy both today and broaden your mind.These movies all seem to be made in the south of the 60's, a sweaty cesspool of blind hatred and inherited racism, as depicted on film. Maybe there were bright spots in the south then, and maybe intolerance was practiced elsewhere in America, but movies set in other North American locales in this type of movie don't come to mind. The ensemble cast attracts viewers to the movie, but distracts by busying the plot to accommodate them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quote at end of movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a great quote at the end of the movie which wasn't included here but I took it from the movie and decided to put it up here for future reference."What is the truth? That he's a disgraced liar? But what if I told you that the woman he was accused of raping was 17, he was 23, that she later became his wife, bore his child, and is still married to the man today. Does that make his testimony more or less true? What is it in us that seeks the truth? Is it our minds or is it our hearts? I set out to prove a black man could receive a fair trial in the South. That we are all equal in the eyes of the law. That's not the truth because the eyes of the law are human eyes. Yours and mine and until we can see each other as equals, justice is never going to be even-handed. It will remain nothing more than a reflection of our own prejudices. So until that day, we have a duty under God to seek the truth. Not with our eyes, not with your minds where fear and hate turn commonality into prejudice...but with our hearts. Where we don't know better." - Jake Tyler Brigance This is a great movie and I definitely suggest that you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a great movie, it has everything: a great cast, a terrific story with twists, turns and yes conflicts, and a point (which some movies don't have). The cast is awesome, McConaughey is THE BEST! I think I first saw him in EdTv and I loved that movie too, but I saw him in this and I'm like OMG, that's Ed. He is brilliant, amazing, and so was Samuel L. Jackson who i've loved since the day I was born. Sandra Bullock is amazing, Kevin Spacey, wow! The story is one a kind, words can't even express, you have to see it, it's got twists, turns, conflicts, great characters, and the best part about the movie is it has a point. It has a great message that was carried throughout the whole movie. Watch for Donald and Keifer Sutherland too, great spot for the father and son team. I gave this movie 9 out of 10 stars, now the only reason why it didn't make 10, is because it was a bit tooo gruesome. It's based on a John Grisham novel, which I read after watching the movie, and loved the book too. All in all it's a great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think many people are missing the point about this film. It's not about the merits of revenge killing and vigilantism. That's a secondary theme at best. It's about racism, primarily, and the way the white populace judges Hailey's motives through the prism of their prejudice.His lawyer's triumph is to get the white jury to see the rape of Hailey's daughter, and its impact on her family, as being as much of a crime as the rape of a white girl. The prosecutor's ultimately unsucessful tactic was to appeal to their notion of a savage black man taking the law into his own hands and undermining civilised white society.Ultimately the jury realised that Hailey had just as profound and human an attachment to his daughter as they did to their children. Enough that he could be driven to temporary insanity.Oh, what did I think of the film? 7/10. Lifted above the average by the strong performances of the lead actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Legal drama about race relations in 1990s Mississippi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from Grisham's first (and arguably most substantial) novel in which he addresses changing race relations in the South. The plum acting role went to Samuel L. Jackson, which he carries off well. He plays the father of a very young girl who is very raped, barbarously brutalized and miraculously survives. He kills the perps, and comes up for trial, around which the drama hinges. Things end up better than they would have in the 1960s, but Mississippi cannot yet be mistaken for a land of justice and equality. McConnaughey and Bullock characters are a little slick and shallow, but what can one expect from Hollywood? The story has more substance and thought than in many films, even though much is unavoidably lost from the condensation of the lengthy novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>TO: the creative "team" behind A TIME TO KILL (1996)This film I recently viewed on VHS doesn't do much for your reputations except for the "Hollywood"-ization of ethics in the era of "shout-out" conflict management. The Grisham "premiere" novel had its shock value as far as how Americans view the different victims (your raped daughter, my raped daughter) but some of the "teeth" have been pulled from the book's climactic finish by telegraphing its "race-card" so, so, so many times throughout. Was this meant to be a retort to Oliver Stone's flair for film making (NATURAL BORN KILLERS) in that justice wins, wins, wins in A TIME TO KILL contra the hedonistic, cynical style of Mr. Stone (director/screenplay/producer)?If you're working together to "package" SKIPPING CHRISTMAS (Grisham's 2001 bestseller). . . DON'T focus so much on "message" -- go with strengths in character development and more genuine dialogue, dare to use actors whose accents are not faked and inconsistent !!! Use the same social/racial milieu throughout and DON'T jump around as if that is just something extrinsic and trivial! Provide Americans with something that will further the dialogue about Capital Punishment (THE CHAMBER), Finders/Keepers ethical dilemmas (THE SUMMONS) and other germane Equal Treatment under the Law issues rather than such a shallow treatment of modern Mississippi community life as this 1996 film exemplifies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think Mr.Baker missed the point of the exercise. (mini spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Time to Kill was one of the better films released in 1996, it achieved both critical and commercial success as it became one of the top ten highest grossing movies for the year.The film is based on the John Grisham novel of the same name. It tells the story of a black man, Carl Lee Hailey, who is put on trial for murder after killing the two red necks who were responsible for the rape of his 11 year-old daughter. Coming to Hailey's aid is the arrogant young atourney Jake Brigance, who with the help of a rather useless female appendage named Ellen Roark decides to try the case.That is pretty much the same telling of events that you will get if you read the review by the somewhat intellectually challenged Daniel. R. Baker. Where our points of view deviate is on the films ending. I think that it has quite a powerful and worthwhile ending, whereas Daniel seemed to miss the point.For those of you who haven't seen the film it ends with Brigance graphically describing the rape of Hailey's daughter to the predominantly white jury and then adding at the end of it 'Imagine that she's white.' In Mr. Baker's review he states that any decent human being wouldn't care what colour she is anyway. And that this is therefore a flaw in the story.Not only is this a shocking generalisation, but it misses the entire point of the film. It's BECAUSE he and his daughter are black that he is on trial at all. What Brigance is saying is that if a white man had shot up two black bums who had raped is daughter this trial wouldn't even had made it to court. One of the main stories in the film was the KKKs involvement with the case, so therefore the colour of the girl's skin was in fact right at the heart of the issue. I don't think that it should take a rocket scientist to point that out.Therefore the problem here is that Mr. Baker has obviously watched this film with both of his eyes shut in order to draw such a ridiculous and naive conclusion from a very complex and powerful film.</fullReview>

In my opinion, Jake (Matthew McConaughey) was the perfect choice for Carl Lee's attorney. This was because he was a young and experienced attorney.

It is one of my favorites right now. Afterwards i read the book, and i loved it too. I think that i would not love the book if i didn't saw the movie first. After "Time to kill" and "Pelican brief" (the only ones i read and saw the movies) i think Grisham is a great writer and his books can be nicely adapt to the cinema.About the movie, i think that what happened should not happen anywhere around the world. I think that raping is a proof of cowards. That was a movie about a raping that turned in a fight against the racism, and racism is avoidable.If you like an excelent story, i simply say ... go and watch "Time to Kill". It can change your life forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotional clap trap that throws up profound questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A time to kill is certainly an interesting movie. It has very fine actors who have given their best. However, a discerning viewer can sense the pretentiousness of emotional clap trap masquerading as civility and human intelligence. The summation speech for all its emotional power (pretty well delivered Matthew McConaughey), is based on the extremely flawed premise that moral decisions should be made from the heart until the time that civilisation has progressed to make man perfect. In fact, it is for the very reason that human emotion can quell justice, that justice must be delivered from the mind and based on sound rational thought. The story line must be credited for confronting the audience with such profound dilemma. I wish the ending was one in which the defendant would be punished to some extent. Leaving the audience with the "sweet justice" of a not guilty verdict is absolutely condescending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not going to bother wasting any good time on the problems within the film's directorial or productional techniques, but am going to focus a moment on the film's message - the film's roots. It seems, (esp. in the end during McConnehay's speech,) that it wants us to believe that if you're a Black American, and you feel victimized by some hillbilly honkey, then you are justified in killing, injuring, or harming them in any way you feel necessary... Who cares about the law? Who cares about social order? Who cares about the latter consequences of our actions? Who cares about the other 5/6 family members we may have other than the one victimized one? And if you are white American, even if you're victimized by the reverse, you are never justified in avenging yourself or enforcing the law properly, because blacks (esp. among the criminal community) are still righteous and it's immoral for you to do anything about it.This film is absolute trash. It stresses more on gimmick and hype than it does on talent or anything else; including logic or realism. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You gotta love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Grisham's best book was transformed into the best movie based on his work. This movie is perfect in the most important aspect: casting. Matthew McConaughey, Samuel L.Jackson, Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Keifer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland, Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks from Braveheart), Sandra Bullock, Brenda Fricker, Charles S. Dutton, Chris Cooper, Ashley Judd... All wonderful in their respective roles. Unfortunately at the helm of this movie is inept filmmaker Joel Schumacher who manages to pump the movie with as much saccharine sweet moments as he can. Luckily his performers and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman are able to keep the movie real.  Jackson is the real star of this movie. His powerful stare and smokey voice radiate with electricity that only a truly great screen presence possesses. His speech of distrust toward white people in the south has fallen under criticism, but I argue that this speech is the cruch of this movie that keeps it from falling into the abyss of the happy ending to all racial tensions. His statement that Brigance is "one of the bad guys" is Goldsman's way of keeping the audience's racial crusading mentality in check. The observation that Brigance, who considers himself to be a liberal, has never visited Hailey's home to have their daughters play together is a reminder of how geographically separated the races are. This heavy dose of reality is what allows the fun stuff to ensue. Oliver Platt is sleazy and loveable, The sutherlands break out their usual roles the elder playing a distinguished southern gentleman and the younger playing a racist psychopath, and Kevin Spacey couldn't have played a better shark if he had large teeth and a dorsal fin. This movie is rousing and enjoyable, but does not stray from reality. That is what sets it apart from the usual "cause movie" fare.</fullReview>

Unfortunately his vigilantism leads to his own trial where he faces murder charges and finds himself being represented by a young but genius attorney who gets him acquitted of the crime.This was the right verdict in my opinion.

		<shortDescription>Reflection about prejudice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another court movie, "A time to kill" stars Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock and Samuel L. Jackson. They all give good performances, but it's not the highest point of the movie. What really makes it special is the script that allows us to have a good reflection.The movie is about a little girl who is raped by two guys. Since there were reasons to believe that the trial wouldn't be fair, the girl's father kills them. He is arrested and a young lawyer is called to defend him, but the trial calls the whole country's attention because of the simple fact that the little girl is black and the two guys were white.From this point on, the movie stars to expose the racist American society. And that's the movie's value, after watching it, people can reflect about how stupid is to treat someone differently just because of the color of his skin. I've recently had a discussion about this theme with a History teacher (Ivan) and he tried to convince me that the Brazilian society is also impregnated with this ignorant thing. I can't deny that, but I still think that it's easier to extinguish the racism in Brazil than in United States. Specially because of L. Jackson last speech, when he tells McConaughey "we are not friends, we could never be friends, our children don't play together." In U.S.A., black people can have the same rights as white people, but they will always be treated like they were different. On the other hand, in a fancy neighbourhood in Brazil, more than 90% of the people are white and most of the black people are pour, but the 10% that are rich don't suffer racism, the prejudice can happen between rich people and pour people, not because of their color, but their social position. Another point in our favour is that no one here, absolutely no one, can be sure that they are 100% white or 100% black, it's impossible, it's not an issue to black people to marry white people here. That's why I believe that if we can ever make this huge economical difference disappear, we will make the racism also disappear. However, in the United States, black people will always have their separate quarter.It causes indignation to see prejudice in any form, so it's nice to see that people worry about this issue and make movies about it. As a movie, it's not the greatest production, but just the fact that it can makes us think about it, it's worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A feeble attempt to justify vigilante justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really do not know what offended me more about this overly preachy and entirely predictable tale of southern justice. Was it that the movie tried so dam hard to get us to believe that the Samual L Jackson character was justified in killing the two men accused of raping his daughter? Or was it that the entire movie played out exactly as we could expect it to, up until the anti-climatic ending. In this movie a black man is charge with killing two white men. We are led to believe that these two men are a couple of trashy, long haired idiots, which of course plays up to the movie's attempt to make us hate them. The suspect also wounds a deputy sheriff, a crime we are not supposed to care that much about.He is defended by an idealistic but conservative lawyer. And the lawyer is aided by the kind hearted but tough norther liberal Sandra Bullock.To further enlist our sympathy, the film shows the kin folk of the victims, led by Keifer Sutherland, as being stereotypical, dumb white bigots who go to the KKK for support. The courtroom tension is occasionally broken by a brewing race riot. Inside the courtroom, a opportunistic prosecutor, played by Kevin Spacey shoots the works to try to get poor(???) Samual Jackson to justice.So where this this well intentioned little movie go wrong? Perhaps, for starters it was to try to vilify the victims. Wouldn't this film have been better if there was a surprise end? Perhaps it would have been better if we find out that the murdered victims were in fact innocent and another person is found to be the rapist? Well this movie is not about surprises. No, this is no "Life of David Gail".I remember well a movie called "Revenge for a rape" in which Chuck Connors goes on a rampage after his wife is molested by a group of back woodsmen, only to find the men he killed were innocent of the crime. Maybe a little lesson in humility could be learned in this story as well.Or worse yet, it was that I could tell from the very beginning what was to happen at the end. Or still worse, it was that the racially charged morality play hits you over the head with a sledge hammer of self Righteousness.So what this movies boils down to is a "death wish" in black face as Samual L Jackson takes the law into his own hands. I myself feel cheated for wasting 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor take on racism and murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS AHEAD.)Regardless of whether or not the central theme of the story was Grisham or Schumacher's, its focus is confused at best. Add a muddled take on the interpretation of the law, and the film quickly goes from bad to worse.The all-star cast does its best with the material, but it's not enough to make much of it work. By the end of this film, the audience is apparently meant to believe that due process and US law should be waived in favor of vigilante justice (the rapists of the film never make it to court); that those who murder criminals are justified; that racism against one race justifies the murder of another; that believing a person's heart is more important than carefully weighing evidence; and that we should applaud the release of a vigilante murderer because -- why?On one hand, a person cannot minimize the horror of the rape nor the injustice racism wrought on millions of innocent lives. Rape and racism are evil and wrong. But so is murder -- and while anyone can sympathize with Jackson's character, it does not change his crime. Not even the script in this film upholds the insanity plea -- so what is the basis for this man's release?There are far too many legal plot holes as well as manipulative plot devises for this film to have much credibility in its claims. Too many characters act in contradiction to their professed beliefs (Maconohay's character, to name one: "kill the rapists because I have a daughter, too, but let their murderer walk because I'd have done the same thing and besides, this man's black")And then, of all things, this movie tries to say that it's not about racism at all! ("Now imagine she's white." Is that supposed to change our perception of Jackson's character as a black man? Perhaps, but it doesn't change our perception of him as a murderer -- what if he were a white man on trial, then, and the roles were reversed? Would we accept that as an answer?I seriously doubt it.)It's impossible to sort out the mess of political representations and moral quandaries. The sappy-sweet ending attempts to make us all feel better about what's just happened, but the fact is that a professed murderer walked. So, is it because he's black? Because his daughter was raped? Or because his method of justice is legitimate?Premeditated murder, like rape, deserves punishment, no matter how much one might sympathize with what motivated the act. Jackson's character was clearly not insane, clearly not defending himself, clearly doing what he thought was right in the moment. But, thankfully, in the real world that last point is not the basis for the law.For some whites in the pre-Civil Rights movement, they justified their vigilante actions with the same kind of flawed logic employed by this film -- and it would be wrong to condone their actions just as it should be wrong to condone the actions of Jackson's character as well.The film fails to satisfy an answer to any of these questions, and contradicts its own message in the process. The audience is apparently expected to agree with ... whatever the film is trying to say, as we're repeatedly hit over the head with the idea that we should just totally sympathize with Jackson's character and excuse his actions. The production quality is high, the acting is fair, but the resolution of this story is a complete mess and waste of time. No recommendation here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morally irresponsible filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd like to place the blame for this abominable movie at John Grisham's feet, but in view of Joel Schumacher's history of morally irresponsible filmmaking, he probably deserves it more.This courtroom drama follows the case of a black man (Jackson) who murders the two white men accused of raping and killing his daughter. An idealistic young lawyer (McConaughey) picks up the case and slogs through opposition from a horde of stereotypical white southern bigots. Schumacher sets up the blocks and knocks them down in the bluntest way imaginable. From the get-go, it's the bad (Klansmen, aristocrats) versus the good (simple black folks, "enlightened" white folks), and not a moment of ambiguity for the whole two and half excruciating hours. Do we ever wonder if the victims were the rapists? Nope, we aren't allowed to. If we were, we might draw different conclusions about how justifiable homicide is and whether or not Jackson's character is innocent.Worse than that, the courtroom action is sluggish and poorly executed. McConaughey's lawyer shows no qualms about using underhanded technique; but then the message of the film is if you're doing it for the right reason, any means are justified. He gets the prosecution psychologist to admit to an indiscretion (gasp!), wheedles an accusational statement about the victims from the sheriff (wow!), badgers one of the victims' mothers (yikes!), and, best of all, completely abandons the insanity plea during closing statements and basically says, "If the little girl were white, you'd have done the killing yourself." Which side feels more like a lynch mob to you?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racism Is Bad -- But Only Mean Rednecks Must Pay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem I have with this movie is not that a black father loses his cool and shoots two white men who raped his daughter. What bothers me is the idea that "racism" -- a complex reality involving a host of different cultural, economic, and political problems -- can be summed up as "mean rednecks who drive pickup trucks attacking black children at random." This kind of oversimplification doesn't really solve anyone's problems, black or white. But liberal Hollywood has been employing this approach ever since TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. And it's not hard to see why. Because if racism is simply a matter of the poorest, most ignorant whites committing open acts of violence, then the rich whites who run the film industry, and the legal profession, and the media, are inherently on the right side of the issue. And every other issue, too.In the end, it's not really about racial justice, it's about class prejudice and liberal hypocrisy. And this is not just a southern problem.For example, some years ago, there was a deplorable racial murder in Bensonhurst, an Italian section of Brooklyn. And famed "liberal" columnist Anna Quindlen (who is half Italian) wrote a very frosty column, essentially dismissing the entire neighborhood (the entire class) as ignorant Goombahs who should all be in jail. Evidently when you go to college and move to Manhattan you become one of the good guys. And it doesn't matter whether you send your kids to exclusive private schools and associate only with affluent whites -- at least you don't hunt black children from pickup trucks or club people with baseball bats. Because that's racism, and racism is bad.But class privilege, self-congratulation and hypocrisy are okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repulsive and dangerous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly repellent film, and one that is all too representative of the deeply pernicious influence that John Grisham has wielded over cultural life in America. It attempts to paper over its rabidly right-wing approach to justice with the usual flabby soft-liberal posturings over race. Ironically, however, its racial attitudes are almost as objectionable as its unabashed endorsement of vigilante violence; here, patronising smugness is taken to new lows. This film is in the not-so-proud Hollywood tradition of stories about heroic white men riding to the rescue of noble but ineffectual black men, and seldom has this tradition been affirmed as explicitly as it is here. In the form of representatives of the N.A.A.C.P., black people do indeed offer their support to Jackson's character, but this is rejected in favour of Matthew McConaughey's bland young lawyer. In place of the political clout and legal expertise the N.A.A.C.P. are able to supply, Carl Lee Hailey (Jackson) instead sticks to the inexperienced idealism of the crusading Caucasian protagonist. Know your place, black folks! Don't you know there's a dashing, photogenic white hero in the building? Move along now, and leave the rescuing to this poor man's Atticus Finch. Good white people do battle with bad white people, and the only appropriate place for black people in all of this is at the sidelines, looking stoical and dignified. Another point to make against this odious trash is that the assertion of the individual's right to seek violent retribution is not so different from the basic assumptions of the Ku Klux Klan, the villains of the piece. But such subtleties are hardly the type of stuff that the likes of Grisham and Schumacher can be expected to trifle with. It beggars belief how the former can have had the audacity to accuse Oliver Stone of encouraging violence when that is precisely what this dangerous rubbish does. Films like 'A Time to Kill', which champion personal vengeance, no matter how bloody, contribute to the kind of political climate in which leading politicians can express sympathy with crazed loons who murder judges. Apart from its warped values, the film is shoddily written, lamely paced and atrociously acted, with one of the worst collections of hammy 'Southern' accents ever assembled. The cinematography is nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>back to the Middle Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the worst films I have ever seen! It is basically a propaganda for blood vengeance and also, in the dialogs, for death penalty. Maybe it is a cultural reason that I, as a European, am a little sensitive about those topics and felt totally disgusted. But the film also has not much to tell beyond these central points. With a big portion of emotionalism it merely tries to cover its plot's weakness and, even more, to capture its viewers with its opinion. The obvious intention is to make the audience heartily agreeing with the offered judgment. This is dangerous, it is the way propaganda works. Could the action be seen as a kind of justified manslaughter? No! It was in the European Middle Ages when vengeance as an accepted form of criminal punishment was abolished. And this should not be changed! I'd like to advise everyone to watch this film again and, as an experiment, to replace the raped daughter with a raped 70-year-old mother. I doubt that shooting the rapist will be equally approved. Anyway, the film has to get at least 1 out of 10, maybe for the musical score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film - that vigilante justice is acceptable - is justifiable, I was more insulted by McConaughey's closing statement. In a courtroom drama, the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film, and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one, the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury. This basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl. I for one find this very insulting. As for the rest, I found the acting reasonable, with the exception of Sandra Bullock, who seems to be playing her usual bubbly self (doesn't really work in a courtroom drama), but what's the point when the film's message is as poor as this one. It tells you that vigilante justice is fine, and accuses you of racism if you disagree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killing Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sympathetic to the crime of a local African American who shot dead two men who raped his preteen daughter, a Mississippi lawyer tries to get his client off the hook by pleading temporary insanity in this courtroom drama. The key issue highlighted here is whether the murderer, played by Samuel L. Jackson, can get a fair trial in such a deeply racist community, and the film's most potent scenes are dedicated to a KKK rebirth as the trial stirs up division. The film trips up though by making racism (not ethics) the central issue and by making the local D.A. such a condescending, despicable character that his argued logic (individuals should not take the law into their own hands) gets buried beneath his smarminess. Examined objectively, Jackson is unquestionably guilty. Having hinted to his lawyer what he intended to do beforehand, it is unethical for the lawyer to plead temporary insanity, quite aside from the fact that rape (no matter how brutal) is seldom ever argued as grounds for justifiable homicide. With all this in mind, the movie becomes very uncomfortable to watch as we are positioned to root for Jackson to get off, simply because it would be a triumph over racism. The unanswered question that lingers in the air is whether Jackson would have gotten off were he Caucasian because then the jury would not feel racist if they voted 'guilty'. And yet, while deeply flawed, 'A Time to Kill' is always engaging to view. The performances are uniformly excellent, tension frequently abounds and the telling final shot is great -- but one's moral compass may well waver while watching the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"In conditions where everything is stacked against the majority, 'playing fair' amounts to accepting a position of disadvantage. In fighting for fairness, one doesn't have 'play fair'. It's the classic problem of Liberals - taking the moral high ground and leaving it at that. Power doesn't play by those rules. If you are looking to change the rules, why start by abiding by them?" - Mark Fisher Based on a novel by John Grisham, and directed by Joel Schumacher, "A Time to Kill" opens with a pair of stereotypical racists driving a pick-up truck into a poor African-American neighbourhood. The duo then assault and rape a young African-American girl. Later the girl's father, Carl Lee (Samuel L Jackson), shoots the culprits dead on the steps of a courthouse. These murders are justifiable, Lee's attorney (Matthew McConaughey) argues, because "the law is racist", would have pardoned the killers and would not have delivered justice to a black father. As a representative from the NAACP says, "Carl Lee's freeing for the killing of two white men would do more for black people in this land than anything since civil-rights integration." On one hand, "A Time to Kill" is your typical Liberal Deep South Lawyer Movie. Our heroes are righteous, upstanding and stand up for marginalised black folk. On the other hand, the film argues passionately for vigilantism (a trait usually associated with "conservative" films). For Grisham, vigilantism is fine when executed by the oppressed. Encapsulating these themes are the film's opening and closing sequences; Schumacher opens with racists spitting in the face of an African-American man and ends with an African-American woman spitting in the face of a white racist. What was once condemned, is finally embraced."A Time to Kill's" philosophical gymnastics and racial inversions are interesting. But they don't make up for the rest of Schumacher's picture. This is ultimately a cartoonish portrait of the Deep South. And like most films "about racism", "A Time to Kill" trades entirely in racial caricatures, with its goofy, "churchgoing black folk", "gospel choirs" and "mad rednecks". Sandra Bullock co-stars as a law student who exists only to get lynched on a tree and prove McConaughey's fidelity to his wife (Ashley Judd).7/10 ? Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

KKK stuff was a bit much if you ask me,, but I guess it was needed to drive home the point of the sickening hatred that the clan has, and had for the African American.. This movie has a ton of star power,, Matthew McCgonahey, Sandra Bullock, the Sutherlands.. there's so many I can't think of them all , Civil Rights in Mississippi isn't quite taking hold as a pair of racist white boys rape and almost kill a 10 yr old black girl.. the girl's father,, played by Samuel L. Jackson.. takes the law into his own hands and kills the 2 boys,, but in the process takes out the knee of the local sheriff, I would have done the same thing.. except try to have better aim,, I guess this movie is all about morality, and what would you do given that situation. justice is served either way,, whatever the verdict comes out... what I thought was interesting was at the courthouse scene,, you have the NAACP, and the black people on one side, and the KKK on the other side,, and in the middle of the st.. armed National Guard.. what a frightening scene.. excellent movie.. just hard to watch some of the extreme measures of the KKK.</fullReview>

It is without a doubt a stain on the history of our nation. However, this wasn't one of them. I think its entirely over the top for the times that it was set in. To me it promotes racial division rather than harmony, as well as vigilante justice. I can't envision any prosecutor in the 1990's seeking the gas chamber and first degree murder charges against Carl Lee, nor the reprehensible acts of the two lowlifes who raped his daughter to spark the rebirth of a KKK to defend them or want to avenge their deaths. Yes there will always be idiot racists and lunatic fringe groups, but the fabric of society in this movie would have been a lot more believable had it been set in the 60's. Matthew McConaughey overacted and like many of the others seemed afflicted with a case of sort of over the top white guilt, Sandra Bullock's character was completely pointless and just seemed to be forced into the movie for eye candy purposes, Samuel L Jackson was good portraying a sympathetic character....... but overall it was more everyone's response to the situation that derailed this movie and made it an overdone and overdramatized picture of race relations in 1990's America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far-fetched and over the top, but good entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes on IMDb, reviewers take the movies too seriously. They analyze the plot development and plausibility and compare on-screen characters with real life examples such as their next door neighbors or as in the case of "A Time to Kill" the people of the American South.The movie was based on a John Grisham novel of the same name, and this author has become famous for writing engrossing legal thrillers with memorable characters. "A Time to Kill" was one of his more sensational novels and tugs on the heart strings more than the rest, such as "The Client" or "The Rainmaker."Joel Schumacher directed, which gives the movie a popcorn entertainment, comic-book feel. After all, this is the same guy who directed the first two "Men in Black" movies and "Batman Forever/Batman and Robin." He manages to create some stirring images, such as when Carl Lee carries his bloodied daughter Tanya out the front door of the house and toward the ambulance, with the whole neighborhood looking on. Yes, we know that such a thing would never happen in real life (paramedics would have put her on a gurney in the living room) but the anguish and rage on Carl Lee's (Samuel L. Jackson) face packs a wallop.Charles S. Dutton shows the world he can be a tough hombre in his role as Sheriff Walls, an ex NFL player for the Rams. Another powerful scene shows him invading a bar to collect the two boys who have raped and ravaged Tanya. And after Carl Lee has murdered the two boys who have damaged his daughter, Sheriff Walls wearily leads a police motorcade to Carl Lee's house, where the only dialog is "See you Gwen."This movie contains the first major role for Matthew McConnaughey and an Oscar-worthy performance from Kevin Spacey as Rufus Buckley a DA with gubernatorial aspirations. Sparks fly from the screen because of the sexual chemistry between McConnaughey and Sandra Bullock, who plays Ellen Roark, an idealistic law student who volunteers to help with the case. Other surprises include a delightful turn from Oliver Platt as a caddish southern divorce lawyer and Jake Brigance's (McConnaughey) close friend.In other directorial hands, the movie could have been a simple courtroom drama, but Joel Schumacher emphasizes the subplot of the rise of the "new" Ku Klux Klan as a response to the murder of the two boys by a black man. The Klan violently clashes with the townsfolk, a whole National Guard battalion gets called in and "A Time to Kill" ends up filled with the most action ever for a John Grisham adaptation.Of course, the ending satisfies, too. This is the kind of movie that can be watched over and over again the way an intricate painting can be enjoyed over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, I'm speechless. This is such a strong film that will make you reflect all the while. The story begins with two white punks raping a black man's daughter. Before that, they go to a bar and call the n word for the black dudes in there. After that, Samuel L Jackson's character decides to make his own revenge; he goes to the court and shoots the two rapists many times-- sadly, he mercilessly ends up also shooting a police officer, for apparently, no reason whatsoever. After some scenes we figure out that he's friends with the shot officer and the officer forgives him. The film is filled with many references to the shameful Ku Klux Klan-- an organization that should be forgot and buried in the US history. In Brazil there are few groups of this nature, but fortunately police and judiciary punish these people very hard. I am proud of myself that my best friend is a black guy and I put all my trust in him; I am also proud to affirm I never made a black guy feel bad for being black. I really hope the prejudice in the rest of the world is as small and restrained as it is in Brazil-- at least in the city I live in. Also, I'm in the second year of law school, and I've never really understood what's the real reason for the existence of jury, even after going to some of them. After seeing this, I deeply understood! Joel Schumacher shows how good director he is once again; In my opinion, he's currently one of the best Hollywood directors.

It reaches levels of brilliance no other Grisham film ever has; except for Runaway Jury. I do not say this lightly as I am a huge The Firm fan. Grisham films have a tendency of well...disappoint. They are (almost) all great but not as great as they should be (coming from Grisham).A Time To Kill is indeed the exception. I rather dislike the title, as it comes across as cliché but other than that there are few things I would want to change in this movie. The whole cast is almost literally on fire, Matthew McConnaughy in particular deserves praise. I've always considered him a B-actor but he's truly remarkable as Jake Tyler Brigance. He brings the character to live splendidly. Sam L. Jackson plays another angry black man, and I cant' help but feel he's being type casted an awful lot. Don't get me wrong, the man's brilliant but maybe he should do less and better movies( not talking about this movie, just discussing his overall movie career.)Well worth the watch, even if you're not into law thrillers...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intense and Moving Courtroom Drama that takes an unflattering look at southern bigotry....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A compelling story and first-rate performances make A TIME TO KILL a minor classic. This engrossing story is about an idealistic young white attorney, practically just of out of law school, who agrees to defend a black factory worker on trial for murdering the two men who raped his daughter. A richly complex story has been constructed here that gives equal times to all sides, but most importantly, raises the veil on bigotry in the south and gives us an unsettling look at vigilante justice and things we'd like to believe don't exist anymore, like the KKK. Akiva Goldman's screenplay, based on a novel buy John Grisham, presents a disturbing story populated with characters painted in shades of gray. The cast is superb...Matthew McConaughey snagged the role of his career as Jake Briganst, the young lawyer who has divided a town and put his family in danger, as well as his own life, by taking this case; McConaughey has never topped this performance and probably never will; Samuel L. Jackson delivers his accustomed powerhouse performance as Carl Lee Haley, the tortured defendant; Kevin Spacey is brilliant as the prosecuting attorney; Sandra Bullock is the idealistic law student who agrees to assist Briganst; Donald Sutherland is Jake's alcoholic mentor; Brenda Fricker is Jake's secretary; future Oscar winner Chris Cooper is a cop caught in the line of fire; and Keifer Sutherland completely inhabits the unsympathetic role of a KKK supporter whose brother was one of Carl Lee's victims. There's also a stylish turn by TV legend Patrick McGoohan as the judge that deserves mention. Thanks to inspired direction by Joel Schumacher(definitely one of his better efforts),this is s compelling and deeply moving motion picture that will have you riveted to the screen. Don't miss this one. As far as I know, the only film in which father and son Donald and Keifer Sutherland appear together, though they share no scenes.</fullReview>

I had to work on it to believe it but there you are, against all my good intentions I can't do better than this. I only hope being aware of it makes me a better person. It would be nice to be able to switch such ingrown feelings like one switches the light on. However any person with some desire for a little of honesty would admit it's not so. I'm not too worried about the outcome of the story and don't have this purity of soul to share these ideals for justice that will defend any villain, and punish every crime. To me justice is what is done about a case not how it's done. I wish that we see thing with more simplicity. I'm not sure either if I agree with the idea that it's better to let go ten guilty rather than being wrong with an innocent. War, natural disaster and diseases take innocents all the time. And yes error is human and error takes a lot of lives in many fields. Thus as long as justice has done all and the best it can. I think I'd be happy with this. I'm comfortable with the ending even if I understand that it creates precedent. A time to kill, for me was not a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reification of Reproduction - Nuclear Family Uber-Alles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The subtext of a woman's value residing in her reproductive capacity reduces what could and should have been a fine film into a morality tale. The nefariousness of emphasizing Tonya Hailey's (Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly) permanent damage, that she'll never bear children of her own, and likewise, the undertow of Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock) as probable spinster to be, mars an otherwise laudable tale of social justice. Roark isn't invited to the party at the end - and Tonya is the first to greet the Brigance's daughter, Hannah (Alexandra Kyle) - as if she lready knows that she has some work to do if she wants to make her way in this world. Tonya's existence resides in its disparity from Hannah's; one girl is disadvantaged in every conceivable way, whereas Hannah is the golden child of parents (McConnaughey and Judd) who prove paragons of virtue in a fashion that smacks of class-based Post-Commune Parisian didacticism. Carl Lee Hailey's righteous vigilante revenge nonetheless fails to eradicate the truth of the "damage" to Tonya's maternal capacity that is highlighted in the courtroom scenes, and which sways the jury only because they imagine a little white girl similarly damaged as Jake Brigance utilizes an impromptu guided imagery exercise based on Carl Lee Hailey's revelation that he, Jake, by oxymoronic virtue of his white guilt, is therefore the only man who can save the accused. Silently, unwittingly, however, the viewer is drawn into finding both Roark and young Tanya guilty of nulliparous existence. Freud once asked what women want. Freedom from this kind of insidious cultural shaming would be a nice start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid dramatic feature with legal aspects...in the style of Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solid drama that delivers a believable point of view towards justice and injustice on the legal and human aspects. The film is not exactly about revenge, in fact, it deals more with the legal definition of mental illness; something that could happen to anyone under severe state of mental crisis caused by a specific event. Carl Lee Hailey was under a mental crisis when he saw what they were doing to his daughter. He killed both white teens because he couldn't defend his daughter in other way; he was blinded by rage. Legally, it was a justified action but in Mississipi, at that time, the racist campaign wouldn't help his situation. The Afro American community help Hailey's cause with a fund raised by church and also by finding him an attorney. It's Jake Tyler Brigance who takes the case. A young white man who has little practice but is very secure about his request for justice and for his ideals. Soon after he takes the case, horrible things start to surround the trial's atmosphere. The KKK is against Hailey's freedom, so does part of the jury, the judge, and the District Attorney. Jake soon finds the aid with his mentor, a colleague, and a sexy recent graduate. The case gets violent even to the point that it takes the lifes of innocent people and causes severe damages. Those who are against Carl Lee will do anything to prevent him from his freedom. Now it's up for Jack Brigance and his legal "team" to make their best and try to save Carl Lee Hailey. Overall this is a very solid, powerful, and moving drama with legal aspects that are strongly supported by a great, great cast and a brilliant direction by Joel Schumacher. The situations are very well done but sometimes rely on the Hollywood factor. I mean, non-credible manners in order to solve important matters.Matthew McConaughey delivers a solid, believable performance. Sandra Bullock demonstrates her acting skills and looks sexy as hell! Samuel L. Jackson is a great actor and delivers a dramatic lesson in acting. Kevin Spacey and Oliver Platt are very good on their roles. Charles S. Dutton and Donald Sutherland have supporting but powerful roles. Very good roles. Kiefer Sutherland steals the show in some scenes because he truly demonstrates hate through his eyes and expressions. Patrick McGoohan also delivers a fine performance. Overall an excellent cast. This is one of the best movies from the 90's and truly deserves more recognition. A great movie on all aspects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I so this movie I felt how it really should when a movie grabs you from start to finish without action but emotion. The storyline is based around a man Carl Lee Hailey( Samuel L Jackson) and his actions in which he takes after his daughter of 10 years old is raped and nearly killed by two red necks in the local town. When the two men are being brought to court they are shot a number of times and killed by the father who has been taken over with anger and revenge. This is when other characters are introduce into the movie like Matthew McConaughey who becomes Carl Lee lawyer, which I feel this was one of Matthew McConaughey best per formations and film's in which he has done.The movie itself comes with A-List actors/actresses like Kevin Spacey, Kiefer Sutherland Ashley Judd and Sandra Bullock. Also all great perforations, this movie couldn't have be done better it is prefect. America please don't make a remake.</fullReview>

I also love the part where Carl Lee is telling Jake that they are different. Jake doesn't mean to be different but that is the way he was brought up. He may see him as a black, African American, or a negro but he's different. I also like Kevin's Spacey's performance as the lawyer. I just love how he hates them.

		<shortDescription>A well-told story sticking to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me this movie rates as one of the best Grisham adaptations to the screen, along with The Rainmaker and The Firm. The story is told in a very matter-of-fact way and, even with the racial subject matter, doesn't overstate or sensationalize the message the movie sends. Also, and very important, it sticks faithfully to the storyline in Grisham's book.McConnaughey is simply great in the role he plays as defense lawyer; that alone is reason to watch the movie. Also, Samuel L. Jackson as the protagonist is his usual dynamite self. The movie didn't reach the box-office figures that the other above-mentioned films did, but to me it surely deserved to. The story needs to be told to give people a truly realistic picture of racial bigotry and its sometimes tragic results.The only reason I rate it 9 instead of 10 is that the ending, in my opinion, was a little flat and could have been fleshed out a bit more. However, that certainly doesn't spoil the movie by any means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragic film. (Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, although based on a fictional story, has its roots in reality. Throughout the world, there have been countless innocent women and girls subjected to the immoral brutality of sexual assault. For the past few centuries, many young African-American girls and women have been survivors of sexual assault. Like the character Tonya, who was only 10 when she was attacked so viciously by two drunken monsters, many of these criminals never were punished or even held accountable for their crimes. The scumbags who attacked Tonya would have gotten away with their crimes had it not been for her father, who took the law into his own hands when the justice system failed his little girl. I know this is just a move, but it is sad that such terrible events as sexual assault are being carried out to this very day, especially against the innocents such as children who cannot defend themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge? or Justice?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie, A Time To Kill, a young, black girl was raped. The two men who raped her, threw her down into the river. This movie is about revenge, prejudice, and justice. The little girl's father ended up killing the two men who had raped his daughter. A white lawyer is trying to defend the black father. He is also ttrying to find justice in the case.This movie shows how life used to be. It also shows us how life really is today. There are still people in this world who feel prejudice against other people. It is not only blacks and whites either. It can be anyone. Somebody might not like another person because of their hair color, the clothes they wear, or the car that they drive. Throughout the whole trial, the jury acted very prejudice too. Even at some parts of the movie, I thought that the judge was leaning more towards an unfair decision and that he was not even listening to the black father's story of the rape. In other parts of the movie, it shows how life was like down in the south. The Ku Klux Klan would burn crosses on the lawn of the white lawyer who was defending the black man who killed the two white men who raped his ten year old daughter. The father of the little girl wanted revenge for what happened to his daughter. He felt that the only way to take revenge on the two men was to murder them. He thought that they would never get what they really deserved. Carl Lee, the father, even asked his lawyer, Jake, what would happen to the men if they just went to jail. Carl Lee said,"You remember them four white boys raped that little black girl over in Delta last year?" Jake said,"Yeah." Carl Lee replied,"They got off, didn't they?" Jake just said,"Yeah" again. Carl Lee knew that the two men wouldn't get what was coming to them. You will have to watch the movie to find out what happens in the end. It was a really great movie and I give it 5 stars.</fullReview>

What I don't like is that it think's it's re-inventing the wheel ? revealing truths which have never been thought of before. There is a smugness to it. Which is a shame, because that acting is great, and the thing looks really good. But I think what's really missing, is some kind of emotional background for the characters - in 'A Few Good Men', everyone seems a hell of a lot more rounded somehow (even Demi Moore), but here, apart from Jackson's need for revenge, no one seems to have a big reason for doing anything.

		<shortDescription>Tries to do too much, follows the book much too closely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main flaw of the film adaption of 'A Time to Kill' is that it never strays from the book at all. Every scene is just the way they were in the book, but much shorter, resulting in 150 one-minute sequences. The dialog is often identical, the director/editor just couldn't cut nearly enough, resulting in too much handled and an extremely long running time (150 minutes). The book was one of Grisham's best, riveting with excellent characters, wonderful situations and a completely unexpected ending. The movie is identical, except everything that is excellent in the book is awful in the movie. Matthew McConaughey is well cast and is probably one of the brightest spots in a dim movie. Bullock is given one of the worst roles in a career of bad roles, and the rest of the excellent supporting cast, particularly Samuel L. Jackson and Kiefer Sutherland, is wasted. The actors could've given their characters life and injected a glimmer of hope into the movie, had they had the right script, but they don't, so they just sit there and watch the action take place around them. Neither Ashley Judd or Donald Sutherland are given enough screen time, so they look like characters who are meant to be the center of the story, but aren't. But the main fault lies in the script. As mentioned before it tries to do way too much and follow the book word by word, and the whole cast and director having to work with it. The locations are well photographed, and the first and last scenes actually manage to look good. If only the rest was like that... So, if you haven't seen the movie or read the book, choose one, but not both, I recommend the book, but if you are a fan of any of the stars, and you don't want them to look bad, see the movie.3/10</fullReview>

I do admit admiring the craft in this movie, its twists and shameless hammering of hoary court-room cliches notwithstanding.

		<fullReview>What ? Is this film based on a book from the 'great' author John Grisham ? I thought that he was supposed to be a lawyer writing legal books which are legally correct or at least convincing ? Well, he must have had a terrific head-ache because the story of this movie is rubbish ! The story about a (black) father whose 10 year old daughter has been brutally raped and almost killed and who revenges himself on the (white) trash is OK for me but the movie tries to make this legally acceptable ! Ridiculous. The father is OK by me and probably by most viewers but it still remains a vigilante type of action. The role of Sandra Bullock is strange, the legal whizkid which gives important advice to the lawyer on little scraps of paper is handy but she is annoying and one can constantly feel the threat of a forbidden love-affair. Please don't ! The movie is not a movie about Racism, not about the KKK. You can far better watch Mississipi Burning for that. The plea at the end of the movie is hard to stand. Very, very disappointing and I can still not believe anyone taking this movie serious.</fullReview>

I mean, her character was also in the book, but I found myself savoring the scenes that she was not in. Well, I have a positive note for this movie: it was interesting seeing through the eyes of the KKK, it lets you know why they believe what they believe.

		<fullReview>The black characters in this movie have very little screen time. The whole movie involves itself with the lives of the white characters. You have the lawyer, his prejudiced wife, his alcoholic mentor, his alcoholic colleague, his little rich-girl assistant, his secretary, and all the terrible people in the klan. Whatever happened to the black people? Isn't this story about them? This movie is about as immature as "Imitation of Life." In both films, the blacks are only there as token minorities. In the same way that Annie in IOL speaks the "truth" only when she's on her deathbed, Jackson's character speaks articulately from a jail cell. It's a convenient way of allowing the token black man a chance to say his peace and then move on with the film without him around.Sandra Bullock was a waste in this movie. The little rich girl from up North must be beautiful because she's in this movie ONLY to provide sexual tension. There was absolutely no need for her to be in the movie. This was supposed to be a morality play about racism. Why do we need sexual temptation? What does ANY of that have to do with the plight of the black characters????Mathew's speech at the end of the movie and the outcome of the court-room drama are not only unrealistic but insulting as well.I hate morality plays from Hollywood. They always try to impose a mainstream perspective on everything they do. There was no drama or conflict in this movieThis movie panders to every pretentious Hollywood cliche about racism. There are so many better movies about there about these same topics.

		<fullReview>First rate cast, a compelling and quite disturbing story and Kevin Spacey at his most cool. What a movie! Okay, the story is not a very cute one and the topic of racism vs liberalism isn't really that counterbalanced when you look at the number of white people who have huge roles vs the black people with mere walk-ons.Except for Charles S. Dutton and of course Samuel L. Jackson, the black people are essentially extras. But remember, this isn't a story about a black man who kills 2 people and is accused of murder. It's about the white lawyer who is warned that the black man is going to kill someone and then let him do it.And for that purpose the movie works. We see lots of beautiful white people: Ashley Judd, Sandra Bullock and Matthew McConaughey. We see lots and lots of ugly white people or rather somewhat attractive white actors disguised as ugly white people.It's like the line in the movie: "Imagine her as white", except imagine if Sandra Bullock and Ashley Judd were black? Quite a different movie and no matter how liberal Hollywood gets, we will still see a movie like The Color Purple and Harlem Nights as different because the actors were black. Take that! And still, I do recommend this film. The actors are awesome and no matter how cynical or jaded you are, you still can't help but feel something during that closing argument. Imagine Don Cheadle delivering it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Tonya Hailey, a young African-American girl, is raped by two white men, the town of Clanton Mississippi is changed forever. After hearing that there is a strong chance that the men who raped Tonya will get off because they are white, Tonya's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) decides to take the law into his own hands and kill the two men who raped his daughter. Killing them in the courthouse, Carl Lee does not try and hide his murder, and immediately goes to jail. Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) is set to defend Carl Lee, but with the return of the K.K.K. it will be a much harder, and more dangerous case then Jake had originally anticipated. Jake will have to risk everything he owns, including his family, to free Carl Lee, and beat the District Attorney (Kevin Spacey) in what will be the hardest case he has ever had.Along with The Rainmaker A Time To Kill is without a doubt my favorite film based off of a Grisham novel. The script was not just fantastic, but I really, really liked the story in this film, and I even thought some parts of it were quite touching. The courtroom action was very interesting, much better than most movies I have seen, and it really kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what was going to happen.The cast was fantastic, not all of the acting was perfect, but it certainly was good. Several of the actors in the film have been at least nominated for an Oscar. However, there some flaws in the performances, they definitely were not perfect. Matthew MaConaughey as the lead was much better then I had expected, it was not Oscar worthy or anything, but still good. I can easily tell you that He is much better playing a lawyer in a courtroom drama, then some loser in a terrible comedy. Now, Ashley Judd playing his wife was not very good. I am not really sure why, because in a lot of her movies she is a pretty good actress, but in this one she is not really at all. Sandra Bullock and Oliver Platt are good along side MaConaughey, but my favorite performance was by far Kevin Spacey. He was brilliant playing the District Attorney.Overall, A Time To Kill, is a flawed but very good film with great performances, and to some will be a touching, and maybe even at times moving story. Along with a lot of interesting court scenes, and a nice ending, it was a good film.</fullReview>

People who don't live here, and/or want to close their eyes to the prejudices here will say it is not true and stereotyping.... unfortunately though, i is not. I can see this happening in real life, and I can also see a totally different reaction happening from the white community had this been a white girl that was raped.... (and for the record, I do live in the rural south, Alabama to be exact.) Vigilante justice may be legally wrong, but so many people, especially parents could relate to this character. The feelings, the passions of the people in this movie were so real, so heartfelt that I could not help but be sucked into it. I think it was wonderfully written and directed and imho Samuel L Jackson and Matthew McConaughey gave the best performances of their careers thus far in this movie.

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Time To Kill is the best movie I have ever seen in my life. The cast, plot line, and events in the film make it my favorite.I would like to start with the cast. It is the one of the best casts to have been put together in movie history. Matthew McConaughey played the unseasoned lawyer of Carl Lee, Jake Brigance. My favorite actress, Sandra Bullock, played Ellen Roark, the sort of arrogant but extremely brilliant (and hot) assistant to Brigance in the case. Samuel L. Jackson played Carl Lee Hailey, who was on trial for shooting two rednecks named Billy Ray Cobb and James Louis Willard for brutally raping his 10-year-old daughter Tonya. Rounding out the top four characters is Kevin Spacey, who played D.A. Rufus Buckley, one of the toughest lawyers in Mississippi, who was actually running for governor. These four, plus other great actors and actresses like Kiefer and Donald Sutherland, Ashley Judd, Brenda Fricker, and Oliver Platt make A Time To Kill a great film.The plot line of A Time to Kill is a young lawyer, along with three solid assistants, defending a father that killed two men for raping his child. The plot line itself was really deep, but the way that the cast executed their roles makes this movie an uncanny piece of film.For the most part, I liked the events that took place in the movie. In fact, the only event I did not like was when Jake and Ellen were in Ellen's motel room. The two were sitting on the bed looking at each other, ready to start making out. But Jake backed down because he was married. That was disappointing because first off, his wife was out of town and she never would have found out and secondly, he wanted to do more than just make out with her. Heck, if that was me sitting with her, I would have made out with her whether my wife was gone or not. How could you resist kissing a sexy woman like Roark? I guess Jake was soft enough to resist.My favorite part was when Jake and Carl Lee were in Carl Lee's jail cell talking the night before the final hearing. I learned about how Carl Lee felt about Jake after this remark. "They see you, they see a yard-worker. They see me, they see an attorney." He said that Jake was one of the bad guys. I had mixed feelings about Carl Lee's remarks. Jake did see Carl Lee as different, but he wasn't one of the bad jury guys.In conclusion, I would like to say again that A Time to Kill was my favorite movie that I had ever seen. I could watch it over and over again. Thanks, Joel Schumacher, for directing such a well thought-out movie. This movie will be a classic to me for years to come, seeing as it is now a decade old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will there be comparisons with "To Kill a Mockingbird"? And why hasn't Joel Schumacher done anything good since?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Involving pretty much the same situation as "To Kill a Mockingbird", "A Time to Kill" portrays white lawyer Jake Tyler Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) defending black man Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), charged with murdering the racist thugs who raped his daughter, thereby incurring the Ku Klux Klan's wrath.I don't know whether this was the greatest adaptation of a John Grisham novel, but I would recommend it. Needless to say, there are some pretty ugly scenes. The fact that this movie is so well done brings to mind the question of why the quality of Joel Schumacher's movies deteriorated after this; "Batman and Robin" and "Flawless" are probably the two most infamous examples.Also starring Sandra Bullock, Kevin Spacey, Charles S. Dutton, Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland, Ashley Judd, Brenda Fricker, and Patrick McGoohan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has it all, in my opinion. John Grisham book means a great script. Incredible list of actors, including Matthew McConaughey who I think is terrific (see The Newton Boys, a lesser known gem of his). But it comes down to great chemistry -- Matthew with his wife Ashley Judd, with Sandra Bullock in one of her best roles, with Samuel L. -- the list goes on.

		<shortDescription>My number 20 movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A time to kill is my number 20 movie. It is a very good thriller. I usually do not like thrillers about court proceedings, but this is a GREAT one. The actors are all great, from Matthew McConaughey &amp; Sandra Bullock to Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin Spacey. The great part of A time to kill ( as of Dead Man Walking, too ), is that the film does not concentrate on the defendant or the prosecutor, but it concentrates on both. Maybe you hope that Samuel L. Jackson will be innocent, but you also know that this is not possible actually, since he has murdered two persons. My favorite part has to be the end summation of Matthew McConaughey. That is one of the greatest moment in film history I think. Good points : Story, ACTORS, CHARACTERS!!!, directing, ENDING, the summation, style, plotBad points : sometimes a bit too long, but just sometimesAll in all, I rate this movie 9.6/10 and recommend it to everyone. It is GREAT!CU; Rinho.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems like old times when accused rapists were lynched before being tried.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A completely immoral and ridiculous movie reminding us that at one time it was considered quite justifiable to lynch a man accused of rape in many areas of the U.S. before he was tried. And the deputy whose leg was shot off by the avenging father surely must be the most forgiving, magnanimous, altruistic victim in movie history when he agreed with the father's actions. The prosecutor's summation asking the jury to change the skin color o the victim and the accused is also idiotic. We have seen the outrage when whites have been allowed to take the law into their own hands and the later riots. It is indeed sad that movies such as this can still be made and few protest their message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to Waste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another adaptation of a John Grisham novel, this is one of those overheated Southern courtroom dramas that portray Dixie as so behind the times that they still haven't heard of air conditioning. Okay, so I don't recall whether or not any of the actors swap the sweat off their faces while a ceiling fan whirls futilely through the humidity, but all the cliches of Southern courtroom dramas like "To Kill a Mockingbird" and "Inherit the Wind" seep into the film despite the director's efforts to avoid them. It's the fault of Grisham's original novel that "A Time to Kill" fails to distinguish itself from dozens of TV movies. Add another 50 minutes to the running time, and you've got a standard sweeps month mini-series. Only the presence of Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey, and Donald Sutherland give it a big screen veneer. Still, I can't say I wasn't entertained by it, but it's still a movie to see only when you have, as the title says, time to kill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a well made movie, and the acting is generally O.K., but in the Law I know...Samuel Jacksons character..HAD TO BE..found guilty. The McConaughey speech at the end , was very week. By that time, the Director Joel Schmacher must have thought he had his audience in the palm of his hand, so not much thought was put into the most important part of the movie. It is a movie that sets out to say a lot, yet in the end ...we know things wont change in the U. S. of A. I felt i had watched this type of manipulative film many times (and i have)...we all have. The year it is portraying really does not matter. What matters is ...does anyone believe this ? And if you do, you must ask yourself.....WHY..??

		<shortDescription>A slick, cliché-filled, moving tribute to revenge killing, and a statement against racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Time to Kill (1996)What a powerful movie. Yes, it's built on movie-making clichés, it manipulates the viewer, and there are excesses and improbabilities. And yes, in fact, it is on some level kind of trashy. But it's extremely well made trash in the hands of director Joel Schumacher. And when you deal with contemporary race relations in Mississippi through a capital murder trial you end up at the extremes of society. All of what happens here makes sense and reveals some remaining strains of bigotry, violence, and personal blindness in society. I don't like the underlying moral logic much, but if you can appreciate American vigilante revenge (I can't, even though it happens in a lot of convincing movies), you'll click with the message here, too.It might slightly help to remember this made a little more sense in 1996. Or maybe 1986, which is when the book was being written. Oddly, and wonderfully, the movie feels like something that wouldn't happen in 2013, when I saw it. Maybe in some ways all of this could still take similar vague form, and I have not doubt about racism being alive in kicking in many places around the country, but what happens here is meant to be the vestiges from 20 years ago of what was once commonplace in the south. Hopefully last vestiges.A cinematic strength here beyond the story of a black man in an essentially white justice system is the rich cast. There are something like seven major stars in various roles, from Matthew McConaughey as the leading defense lawyer who does a good job to Ashley Judd as his wife who isn't given much to do or say and who is surprisingly canned. There is Donald Sutherland as the wise renegade (and disbarred) old lawyer who helps from the background (rather like Preminger's 1959 "Anatomy of Murder") and his son Kiefer as a crazed neo-KKK bigot with a quick tendency to cruelty. Somewhere between is the perp and eventual hero to some played with decent intensity by Samuel L. Jackson, and the bright smart-alecky law clerk in the form of Sandra Bullock. Throw in Kevin Spacey as the haughty D.A and Patrick McGoohan of all people (he's the lead in the great 1960s t.v. series, "The Prisoner") as the judge. Both are terrific.Expect lots of interwoven plots, lots of violence against lots of innocent people, and some speechmaking about how to achieve justice and find the best in people. The movie is designed to make you approve of the revenge killings near the start of the movie, revenge by a father after the brutal rape and torture of his 10 year old daughter. The key defense hinges on the idea that any father would have done the same. It's "justifiable homicide."But to appreciate this is to turn a blind eye to the fact that there might never be such a thing as justifiable homicide. I mean, that's what lynching is based on--and so what one person calls justified is what another calls senseless vendetta-based murderous sin. And the underlying message is that if someone commits a bad enough crime they deserve to die. Without a trial. This is what drives the movie and makes you take sides. It's almost impossible to side with the prosecutor, who makes the simple case that you don't kill people in cold blood in our society. But the common folk of the jury are all twelve swayed in the final four minutes by a heartwrenching and unlikely speech by our young lawyer hero. The KKK finds its comeuppance. The new South is apparently just starting to see the problem with its centuries of racism.The more I write the more I realize the movie is almost shameful. But a well-acted, well directed bit of movie-making shame. Yes it's worth seeing, no matter which side of the morality you are on. It is, to be sure, by the same director who gave us "Falling Down," if you remember that other justification of revenge violence. It is also, luckily, a condemnation of racism in many forms. See it, but give it some thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing second time around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a big let-down on my second viewing, 14 years after the first. I rarely view a movie more than once. There's a mere handful so good that I've seen them several times and continue to be moved by them. I enjoyed this one quite a lot when it was first released and eagerly agreed to a belated second viewing last night. Wow. I must have become very much more discerning. What a great courtroom drama mixed with wonderful character development it could have been; instead, it's a shallow rendition of what was actually good original material (the novel engrossed me), and full of cardboard cutout characters. And the sugary ending! I've become very tired of the good-triumphs-over-evil-and-everybody-lives-happily-ever-after theme which certain film-makers can't seem to resist, especially when the national flag features prominently near the end-- they remind me of some of the old WW II propaganda movies. I have a feeling that my dislike of this film also has more than a little to do with the fact that just lately I've been spoiled by some brilliant British made-for-TV courtroom dramas. Alongside them, it fails dismally.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let me tell you a story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Far fetched and convoluted story about rape revenge and murder in the deep south circa 1995 that seems to get itself lost in the both translation as well as the screenplay.There's no doubt to anyone in the film "A Time to Kill" that outraged father the hard working family man Carl Lee Hailey, Samuel L. Jackson, gunned down both Billy Ray Cobb and James Pete Willard, Nicky Katt &amp; Dough Hutchison, as well as crippling Deputy Sheriff Looney (Chris Cooper), who just happened to get in the way of Hailey's barrage, on the steps of the courthouse as they were to be indited in the brutal kidnap rape of his 10 year old daughter Tonya, Rea Van Larrymore Kelly. The fact that Tonya survived her being attacked by them had nothing to do with Cobb and Willard letting her go. They in fact tried to lynch little Tonya but the tree branch that they tried to hang her on broke. It was Hailey's trial in the murder of Cobb and Willard that made no sense at all if you followed the movies storyline. With up and coming hot shot town lawyer,looking for the big case, Jake Tyler Brigance, Matthew McCouaghey, taking on the case his only hope of getting his client Hailey off was an insanity defense. This was later forgotten about when it became obvious to anyone, in the movie and audience,that Hailey was in fact cold stone sane when he committed his crime. In fact Hailey himself told Brigance earlier in the movie when he was to defend both Cobb and Willard for the rape and kidnap of his daughter Tonya that he was tempted to get out his assault rifle and gun the two creeps down before they were to be put on trial. That even if convicted of all charges they would only end up getting ten years behind bars and be free before they turned 35 years old! Still being old,or young, enough to rape and possibly murder some other unfortunate child whom they took, while getting high of pot and drunk on beer, fancy to.***SPOILERS*** At the trial with all his expert witnesses unable to prove that Hailey was insane when he committed his murderous act Brigance then turns to the jury and audience's moral conscience in getting them to see his, as well as Hailey's, point of view in that this was an act of pure revenge in what the two, Cobb and Willard, did to Hailey's 10 year old daughter in the most graphic description possible to change their minds in convicting his client! That with the local prosecuting D.A Rufus Buckley, Kevin Spacey, who just about had the case won sitting there in the courtroom looking as if he were brain dead without raising even the slightest objection to Brigance's changing the entire reason that Hailey defense was hanging on! An insanity defense!There's also in the film the resurrection of the notorious Klu Klux Klan that's been dormant for years in order to put their two cents worth in the Hailey murder case. These pointy headed loonies were so revolting, to both blacks and whites, that for a moment I suspected that it was Brigance himself who put them up to it, coming out in the open, in order to help his and his client's the accused Carl Lee Hailey's case! Besides the town's hanging judge Omar Noose, Partick McGoohn, there's the usual bleeding heart liberal form way up north Ellen Roak, Sandra Bullock, who's extremely perky and breathtaking support bra made more of an impression on lawyer Brigance as well as those of us watching then her very impressive credentials in the field of Civil as well as US Constitutional law. We also get to see the take no BS tough talking black Sheriff Ozzie Walls, Charles S. Dutton, who seemed to have been elected by the mostly white and racist town of Campton Mississippi not because he's black or even competent in his job but because of his past career as a running back for the L.A Rams!And last but not least there's the Sutherlands father &amp; Son Donald &amp; Kifer who are on the opposite side of the fence in the movie. Donald plays the barley sober and disbarred lawyer Lucien Willbanks who's always giving his protégé Jake Tyler Brigance advice in how to handle the case that almost ends up having him lose it. And then there's son Kifer as the slain accused rapist Billy Ray Cobb's older brother Freddie Lee who screws everything up for the prosecution in getting Hailey's put in the Mississippi states gas chamber by committing, together with his Klu Klux Klan fellow travelers, far worse crimes, like murder arson and kidnapping, then even Hailey was charged with!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great and Well Casted Film Full of Statements About Society and the Justice System That are Still Applicable Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No film has ever quite left me conflicted as this film has, and that is meant in a good way. Very few big budget Hollywood films can say they leave a lot of room for discussion after the screen goes black and the credits begin to roll. This film brings to life John Grisham's novel of the same title: "A Time to Kill." The film is also well done as far as imagery and performances from actors. The dialog by the characters is so well done.My personal reactions to the film are split. On the one hand, I am very sympathetic toward Carl Lee and his family. I can't say I wouldn't do the same if I had a young daughter like his that was raped by two drunken lowlifes. In many ways, I cannot say that what Carl Lee did was wrong. Those two boys that hurt his daughter deserved what they got, and the justice system in place where they committed this crime would have greatly and unfairly favored their case.At the same time, from a legal standpoint, as well as from a moral standpoint, I cannot condone Carl Lee's actions. He should have been convicted, because letting a man be acquitted of murder, no matter what the circumstances are, is very devastating to precedents in the criminal justice system. It is true that nothing ever justifies one human being killing another. I am a believer that if the criminal justice system does not hold people accountable for their actions, that God always does. On a person's Judgement Day, the day he/she dies, he/she is finally brought to justice and finally held accountable for his/her failures as a human being?failures that he/she has not repented for and felt truly sorry for.But, I digress. This film is rich in statements about society today even, as well as the criminal justice system. Society is still divided racially, and in so many different ways, now. The criminal justice system is seemingly too subject to human emotion as opposed to reason, and it has been that way for so long. Why? It is subject to human eyes, and this film very emphatically states that fact that is also a truth. The success of this film can likely be attributed to its time of release as well. It was released pretty much on the heels of the fallacy that was the verdict O.J. Simpson received in his trial for murder. (Yes, I believe very strongly O.J. was guilty.)At the same time, this film is well casted. A lot of times, big Hollywood films with big all star casts seem to be very much for the purpose of getting people into theaters to watch a movie that is otherwise mediocre. This film is very much different in that it is well casted and well acted. Matthew McConaughey is very powerful as Jake Brigance, a young charismatic lawyer looking to make his big break. Samuel L. Jackson is stellar as Carl Lee Hailey, a blue collar working father and husband that works day by day to try and support his family. Sandra Bullock is exemplary as Ellen Roark, a young woman fresh out of law school wanting to have some impact and looking to get her foot in the door as well, and make a name for herself having been somewhat in the shadow of her father, a very wealthy aristocrat. She works to help Jake in his case, despite their differing views. Kevin Spacey is excellent as the District Attorney Rufus Buckley, an adamant political figure who is not above bending regulations to win a case. Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland, Brenda Fricker, Oliver Platt and Charles S. Dutton are just a few more names of an extremely strong supporting cast, and they all shine brightly in this film. In the very few films such as this, I always look for somewhat of a wild card performance from a supporting actor/actress that I know nothing about or have seen very little of. That wild card performance comes from Patrick McGoohan as the aptly-named Judge Omar Noose. Noose is very much on the side of the prosecution, and the way he is portrayed in the film is rather indiscreet: from his long curly gray hair, half moon spectacles, to his very strong bias against the defense and his plantation home where he has black servants. The imagery that stood out mostly to me was a subtle one. For much of the film, the lighting along with the constant sheen of sweat that everyone seems to have on their foreheads is something that suggests the racial tension really coming to a boil. Finally, on the last day of the case, the day of summation and the delivery of the verdict, that sheen that everyone has from the thick muggy air of the Deep South is gone: foreshadowing to anyone who hasn't read the book perhaps?It's an incredible film that I recommend to anyone who is looking for a good film that can both provide the drama that someone needs, or provide a point of discussion for an intellect. I give it 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe this movie isn't in IMDb's top 250...this is a really good movie. It's totally believable (exception noted below), and you can see both sides of Carl Lee's plight. You know what he did was wrong, but you can TOTALLY empathize with why he did it. If I was in his shoes, I would be sorely tempted to do the very same thing.The acting in this movie is wonderful. The movie is paced well, each character is necessary and well-accounted for (their relationships with others and the story's explanation of such is justified)...what I really love about this movie is the fact that (even though this is one of those Nice-Guys-Finish-First movies) you're never 100% certain of the outcome.The only real issue I would raise with this movie is the relationship between the judge and the prosecuting attorney. Such blatant elbow-rubbing in modern times would surely force the judge to recuse himself.This is the movie that made me decide to take a second look at the literary works of John Grisham. If this stuff tends to be a little dry for your taste, give this movie a try...I really think you'll be glad you did.I highly recommend this movie.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, talk about an all-star cast, there are a lot of big names here: Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Kevin Spacey, Donald and Keifer Sutherland. Jackson plays Carl-Lee Hailey a man who takes matters into his own hands when he kills 2 redneck caucasians when they rape his 10 yr. old daughter. McConaughey plays his lawyer, who hasn't had much experience, nevertheless he doesn't miss a step. Spacey is the prosecutor who wants Carl-Lee to fry, Sandra Bullock plays McConaughey's law-clerk. Donald plays a McConaughey's mentor and his son Keifer plays a bad guy. Ooh, sounds good? That's cause it is. I gave this movie 10 out of 10 because the cast is incredible, you couldn't have chosen a better cast than this one, the story memorable, the drama unforgettable. This movie is truly the best dramatic motion-picture I have ever seen in my entire life. I've always loved Sam Jackson, and I know lot's of people do, for his incredible acting ability, and he definitely shows he still has "IT". McConaughey, he's a younger actor, not as many movies as Jackson, but he definitely knows what he's doing. Sandra Bullock is one of the best actresses out there, I think, she's incredible, we've seen her comedic sides in movies, but this one has got to be her at her best. Also hats off to Kevin Spacey and Donald and Keifer Sutherland, they are definitely at there best in this movie. We know from the past that Donald has done some amazing work and he get's to show it off, and his son Keifer is excellent, he definitely takes after this Dad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is the law always justice?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just re-saw this movie after the first time years ago. Coming to IMDb I was surprised at the number of reviews that were negative. But like any controversial movie or topic, there are 2 polar extreme views from many different people.I will just briefly recap the story. A 10-year-old girl is on her way home from the grocery store. 2 young men brutally rape her, try to hang her (branch on the tree broke) then toss her 30 feet down to a river bottom &amp; leave her to die there. She miraculously survives. Her father, Carl Lee Haley (Samuel L. Jackson) then decides to take the law into his own hands, after hearing they could either get off completely, or perhaps just serve 10 years &amp; get out early on parole. After the shooting and killing, he seeks Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) to be his lawyer, since he previously helped his brother win a case.The movie makes many strong statements, perhaps some are overstated &amp; I would agree there are times that it is pushing our collective buttons. But even so that shouldn't diminish the message. The real message of this movie isn't, vigilante killing is okay when the people "deserve" it. The real message of this movie is how do we, black and white, come together for real? The scene in Carl's jail cell where he tells Jake he is the enemy is a tough one to watch. Hard for a couple of reasons, one being that this man has just sacrificed his friends, family &amp; home for this trial but his client is telling him HE's the enemy. And another because it's partly true. Being a person that believes we really &amp; truly are equal, I can see what he means about saying, "when you look at me you don't see a man, you see a BLACK man." He says that by virtue of how he was raised, he sees him as different. I would say this is true for both of them. Having been married to someone from Mexico for 10 years, I was frequently the only "white" person at many gatherings. I learned to speak Spanish because I wanted to understand him, his friends and the culture. Mark this: understanding is the enemy of ignorance &amp; racism. Only when we truly understand each other can we start to see without the eyes of prejudice. It is through empathy and compassion that understanding comes to us. And yes, it goes both ways. You can say to Carl Lee, "have you ever brought YOUR daughter to my house to play?" If there is to ever be a true unification, it must come from all sides equally. Blame is pointless- or as Dustin Hoffman said in the movie Papillon, "blame is for God &amp; small children." One reviewer said the last line of the summation, "now imagine she's white" was offensive. Why? After all, if one is to be judged by a jury of their peers, how can you possibly say an all white jury knows what racism a southern man and his family have lived in fear of? And don't think that just because the bad people in this story are drawn so extremely that they don't exist. They do. There are people even today that think we should all be segregated and that one race is superior to another. But when it becomes personal and internalized, we all feel differently. And if we're being honest, none of us knows what we would do until something like that happens. By telling an all white jury to picture her as white, he is in effect saying, imagine she was your daughter, just as he had already done himself. If she was your daughter, wouldn't you want to kill those "men"? The title of my review was one I also used for a movie called "Billy Budd" by Herman Melville. In that book/movie they ask the question, is the law always justice? That is also at the crux of this movie. Because how many of us have seen things in the news or papers about how someone does a horrible, heinous crime &amp; yet receives what seems to be a light or unfair sentence? I agree with the prosecution, 10 years DOESN'T seem like enough time for attempted murder &amp; rape. If the punishment really did fit the crime, would Carl Lee ever have felt he needed to take the law into his own hands? Probably not. And you can say, well, she's still alive so killing those men wasn't a just sentence. But what kind of scar have they left for that 10-year-old girl? Besides them making her infertile for life, the mental &amp; emotional scars are HER life sentence. Shouldn't they receive at least the same? Yet our justice system would say 10 years is enough. Not to me.The performances by everyone are very well done. A terrific cast- down to even the supporting roles like Charles S. Dutton &amp; Chris Cooper &amp; Brenda Fricker &amp; Donald (and Kiefer) Sutherland. I've even read here on IMDb that Matthew McConaughey's final summation was done in one take &amp; yes, those are real tears. This is a tragic story &amp; how someone can watch this &amp; not be moved is beyond me. Just to set the record straight, I don't condone vigilante law. I believe the law is there for all of us &amp; we must abide by it. But like any man-made institution, it is flawed and needs to be reformed. 10 years is a drop in the bucket compared to what they did.All around a good and thoughtful drama, I recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To kill a crow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never read this Grisham novel. Probably won't now. The movie is not bad, but I wonder if it couldn't have been so much more, and hopefully the book was. McConaughey's summation is somewhere between moving and maudlin. I know I'm being "played." Even then I found it somewhat moving. But the substance of it and the movie could have been more insightful.And then comes the basic question---does an injured member of a family have the right to execute people known to have done some injury to his family. Emotionally, you want to say yes. But if we are a nation of laws, and that has become more doubtful lately, then must we not abide by them in order to preserve our own rights? The insanity defense was actually ludicrous. He planned the murder. He even discussed it in advance.We are repulsed when an all white jury finds a white man innocent of killing a black man who did some egregious wrong to his family. But in this movie we are asked to think that it's acceptable to have a white jury find a black man innocent of killing two white men when his daughter is horribly raped. But the defense asks the jury to imagine what would be fair retribution if the little girl had been white. So is their finding of him innocent a result of sophistry or judicial progression?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much more than the 6.9 rating. This movie is full of powerful, moving scenes. As a male college student, I have seen so many movies and I am almost "immune" to emotional scenes. At the end of this movie I almost cried, not because it was sad, but because it was so powerful. Coming from the south (atlanta, GA) racial issues are, no matter what anyone tells you, still very much prevalent. In high school I would see this every day. This movie is not only a moving story about the awful reality of racism but a moving story about the strength and the importance of family. Sure, this movie is not "perfect" by cinematic standards, but everyone needs to see this, not to mention the fact that the action keeps you on the edge of your seat! 10 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Time to Kill" is far and away the best movie (so far) based on a John Grisham novel. This movie is one of the most powerful, gripping dramas that I've ever seen. It's amazing of how I was pulled into this film right from the start and it held my attention all the way to the end. I was never bored for one second. "A Time to Kill" is about rape, murder, and revenge in a small town in Mississippi. It all starts when a 10-year-old black girl is brutally raped and beaten by two white guys. They are immediately arrested for the crime. While on their way to the hearing, the girl's father takes his frustrations out on the two guys by shooting and killing them in cold blood. After being arrested himself, the father (Samuel L. Jackson) asks a young, inexperienced lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) to represent him, which he accepts. During the trial the lawyer, his co-workers, and his family receive serious threats from the Klu Klux Klan, who want to see the Jackson character found guilty (one of the members of the KKK is the brother of one of the two guys killed). For the lawyer and his defendent, trying to get off not guilty will be a tough challenge as the plaintiff is a tough-as-nails attorney (Kevin Spacey) who is smart and experienced. So the young lawyer gets some assistance from a Boston based law student (Sandra Bullock), who provides interesting information for him that proves to be helpful. "A Time to Kill" has solid directing by Joel Schumacher, and brilliant acting by an outstanding cast. McConaughey, Jackson, Bullock, and Spacey all give excellent performances, as do the other supporting players which include Brenda Fricker, Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Patrick McGoohan, Donald and Kiefer Sutherland, Ashley Judd, Chris Cooper, Joe Seneca, and (in an unbilled part) M. Emmet Walsh. "A Time to Kill" is a great movie. One of the best movies of 1996.**** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Not Kill But Let's Watch This Anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I reveal extremely important details of A Time to Kill in this review, so if that would ruin the movie for you, please don't read on.Samuel Jackson plays Carl Lee Hailey. Hailey kills 2 men who raped and almost killed his little girl, Tonya. It is up to Jake Brigance, played by Mathew McConaughey, to try to keep Carl Lee from either spending the rest of his life in prison or being put to death. McConaughey and Jackson give us great performances and so does most of the supporting cast. Kevin Spacey plays the prosecutor, who you might like and hate at the same time, with the brilliant flare I have grown accustomed to. Sandra Bullock is good enough, as the assistant to Brigance, and Kiefer Sutherland is excellent as the racist and revenge-oriented brother of one of the rapists. Other actors who give good or great performances include: Donald Sutherland, Oliver Platt, Ashley Judd, Patrick McGoohan, and Chris Cooper. I agree with and like the racial messages in this movie, and think that they were very well implemented. I don't think the average person realizes how much racism there really is. It's not just in the Ku Klux Klan, a bunch of skinheads or even the bigoted `Archie Bunker' living next door. It's in you and it's in me. Until most of us realize that, and make a concerted effort to do something about it, racism will continue to live strong in this world.I like A Time to Kill a whole lot; it's actually one of my 50 favorite films of all time, but I wouldn't feel like I was writing a complete review if I didn't share my disagreement with the main message this movie seems to convey. That message, the way I see it, is that it is ok to take the law into your own hands, to break the law in order to execute your own version of justice in the form of murder, before the system has even had a chance to succeed or fail. If this case happened in real life, I would be very disappointed in the jury for acquitting Carl Lee. I view a jury's duty to follow the law as being similar to a country's duty to follow the principle of freedom of speech. These two ideas are opposites in a way but the philosophies and significance to society are very much similar. We shouldn't censor a statement just because we disagree with it; in fact we should support the right to say it, or freedom of speech won't work. For very similar reasons, we should not condone someone breaking the law just because we empathize with that person. `I'd have done it too, if it was my daughter!' A big problem with this way of thinking is: who is to decide what laws should be broken, and for what reason? You? Me? How about a member of the Ku Klux Klan? No to all. We should tell all people to not break the law, and if they do, they should be held accountable by the law, except in rare circumstances. If Carl Lee was legally insane when he committed the murder, I would not be complaining; but he wasn't, and the Jury knew that.And what if the murdered suspects are innocent? You can't even partially undo that kind of injustice. In A Time to Kill, the viewer sees the crime that Carl Lee is responding to; in real life, however, it is usually not that clear cut. If you take the law into your own hands, killing the accused, you are not only breaking one of our most important laws, you might just be murdering an innocent person. A Time to Kill is an entertaining movie that makes people think long and hard about very important issues, which is great; I just hope it doesn't inspire too many people to take the law into their own hands by either committing a crime, or exonerating those who do.

		<shortDescription>Excellent story, legal aspect lacking however</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The background story in this movie is excellently told and superbly acted by a 5-star host of actors. I watched this movie feeling so many different emotions until the legal aspect of this became the focal point.While Spacey and McConaughey were very convincing as an assistant district attorney and criminal defense attorney, respectively, their actions inside the courtroom were laughable at best. Due to poor legal research, all the courtroom scenes were full of implausible scenarios including a judge who violated so many ethical rules, and McConaughey who was possibly the most under prepared attorney ever in a capital case - ostensibly so that Bullock could swoop in and save the day. This however, is highly unrealistic, and resulted in a very forced legal drama in nearly every courtroom scene.The last straw for me was a scene where McConaughey and Jackson discussed what questions to ask a witness DURING TRIAL. McConaughey was reluctant to Jackson's proposed question because he was afraid of the witness' possible answer, at this point, I had to turn the movie off. ANY attorney, pardon me - ANY PERSON, would have merely questioned the witness before trial to ascertain an answer so fundamental to a case, let alone a capital one.But, as I said previously, what the movie severely lacked in courtroom procedure, it made up for in the storyline. I never read the book, but if this is an accurate adaptation of one of Grisham's novels, I suggest that he do some intensive research on trial advocacy for his next.</fullReview>

Jackson is the "hero", who kills his daughters attackers, and we're suppossed to root for him against the death penalty. what about the two guys? the blacks are portrayed as useless incompetants who need hot shot white middle class types to fight their battles for them. the N.A.A.C.P are portrayed as a corruptive force on a par with the KKK! Am i making this up? shockingly, no. whats most shocking however is that there are people who will see this and think it's a liberal movie. it's no more liberal than alan parkers "mississippi burning", which confines the protests of the 60's to the work of two white lawyers. utter tat, completely irredeemable and bereft of any moral standing. complete bollocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains spoilers -- contains spoilers -- contains spoilers You know it doesn't happen very often, which is probably why the experience is so memorable. How often do you see a movie, and by the end you think that the "good guys" are just flat-out wrong? Matthew McConaughey's character is wrong, and Sam Jackson's character did not deserve to go free. What is wrong with this country that we think that this is an example of a court delivering justice? Kevin Spacey's DA character was exactly right when he addressed the jury about Carl Lee Haley, and said "He's taken justice out of your hands, and put it into his own.". You see, in the movie, we the audience are given the knowledge that those two racist, loser, rednecks actually did the crime. WE know that. So when we see Carl Lee Haley (Sam Jackson) conclude that they may go free and they have to die, and then storm into the courthouse and kill them, we're to feel that it is righteous and deserved. But in real life, you almost never get to know with such certainty who did and did not commit a crime. That's why the lady justice is wearing a blindfold. What if some other loser redneck who had a beef with these guys, did the crime and then tossed the evidence into their truck to frame them? What if some serial-rapist had set them up because he knew they, as drunken losers, were an easy mark? Do these scenarios sound so crazy? But this is what we are so often served up on TV and in movies these days. We the audience get to KNOW, not think or suspect, but KNOW that some suspect is in fact the killer. And then the writers make our blood boil as they get set free on a technicality or something. But again, that's not real life. Sometimes the person that everybody KNOWS is guilty, didn't actually do anything wrong. Of course we all hate racists and rapists, but this movie's message that some crimes are so heinous that vigilante justice is the right choice, is dangerous. I believe that there are bad guys out there who deserve to die, but since there is no way of undoing such an act, we need to be as sure as possible that we're punishing the right person. And that's why we have trials, judges, juries, Miranda rights, etc. When we start side-stepping all that from time to time, then there isn't anything separating us from the criminals. And John Grisham is a lawyer?!</fullReview>

The acting was passable, the production values fine, but the screenplay was moronic, the direction crude. Can Matthew McConaughey act, or only mug? Sandra Bullock tried, but what can you do with a part like that? The moodswings were enough to give you whiplash, but left credibility behind. Kevin Spacey was his usual fine job, even when playing a straw man.Any viewer of "Law &amp; Order" would see the holes in the judicial procedure. And geez, the prosecutor's mere statement that his questions "go to the heart of" a witness's credibility, doesn't make them relevant when they aren't! The film's treatment of ethical issues was confused and questionable, both aspects typified in the defense summation. Another dumb movie from another dumb novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A legal thriller the likes of which you rarely see anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sort of film that I am certain in 30 or 40 years will be considered a classic. Even if you ignore the fact that it is a terrific cast full of familiar faces and stars that went onto to be superstars, the story and the concept and the writing and the ethical and moral dilemma that comes out of this will be talked about for decades. Grisham created one of the best legal thrillers ever and who better because the man practically created the genre. Translating it to the big screen would be no small feat but I think they went a step beyond and captured the book and the characters very nearly flawlessly. The film runs a little long, I'm not sure given that it is technically a "thriller" moreso than a drama that it should feel like it drags just a little bit but I can't fault them for making sure the characters and idea is fully developed. The best thing to come out of A Time To Kill is the dialogue. The script for this film written by Akiva Goldsman is brilliant and masterful. He has done some great screenplays (we'll forgive him Batman and Robin and Lost In Space) but this is truly one of his best. Fortunately for him he also had some incredible actors delivering the lines.Matthew McConaughey is perfect as the struggling lawyer Jake Brigance. No one can play down to earth better than McConaughey and his charisma is brilliant on screen. He also plays a darn good lawyer. His closing speech is one of my favourite scenes in film. Samuel L Jackson perfectly plays the father who murders his daughter's rapists in cold blood. Jackson is emotional and moving in his role and the chemistry between he and McConaughey is very good. There are such incredible actors in this film and the one criticism I can give the film is that I feel like once you move away from the main cast, some of the supporting cast doesn't get the screen time they could have or deserve. Kevin Spacey is good but underused as the cocky DA Rufus Buckley and Sandra Bullock is feisty and fun and a very strong female lead but underused in her role. Oliver Platt who was always good for the sarcastic, fun but serious looking supporting character does exactly that in this film. Donald Sutherland is also terrific as Brigance's mentor but I wanted to see more of him. Kiefer Sutherland couldn't be better playing the smarmy and evil looking brother of one of the dead rapists. Ashley Judd is sort of flash in the pan as McConaughey's wife.This was Joel Schumacher at his best. He was a great director at one time but has slipped in recent years. This was a great example of the sort of vision he once had. He captures the racial tension of the deep south perfectly. You can just feel the air of tumultuous politics. Despite being a courtroom battle, the film is more about the racial battle happening outside the courtroom. The case and situations gives rise to a brand of the KKK and puts Brigance's life in danger and those in his life around him in danger as well. The opening scenes of the film are literally hard to watch, one of the most disturbing rape scenes in film and yet not because its graphically done or shown in poor taste but rather you feel and sense the danger and horrible act that is being done to a defenceless little girl. A Time To Kill is terrific. Its more art than entertainment because of the concepts behind it but if you love legal drama, thrillers, courtroom battles or just a very good film then this is one to see. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shows Us How Hate Is In All Of Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a lot of deeming factors that makes "A Time to Kill" one of the most important films to watch. It's not a film for entertaining purposes by any means of the imagination. This intriguing story stars Samuel L. Jackson playing the part of Carl Lee Hailey, a vengeful African-American man who killed two rednecks who raped and nearly killed his young daughter Tonya (Rae'Ven Larrymore Kelly). It all comes down to rookie hotshot lawyer Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) to prevent Mr. Hailey from either serving a long-term prison sentence or worst, be put to death. The acting in "A Time to Kill" well performed, by rather large ensemble of terrific thespians. The leading performances of McConaughey and Jackson were both very engaging and quite colorful and a bit disturbing at times. The supporting performers turn in some very compelling roles and movie the film along quite nicely. Kevin Spacey shines as the prosecutor who might be a likable or a hateful character at times. But his charisma as a performer is something everyone respects of him. Sandra Bullock was brilliant as Brigance's assistant and law student, Ellen Roark. Kiefer Sutherland was excellent as the unashamed bigoted, vengeful minded brother of one of the rapists who was killed by Hailey, Freddie Lee Cobb. To wrap up this all-star cast includes Charles S. Dutton, Donald Sutherland, Chris Cooper, Ashley Judd, Oliver Platt and Patrick McGoohan and a cameo from M. Emmet Walsh. I'm not a racist by any means, but the philosophy that the KKK stated is not all that ignorant or narrow-minded by any stretch of the imagination. In fact it is pretty well documented. As a member of the human race, hate is placed in each and every one of us. Racism is not just formed in the KKK or the Nazis, skinheads or the iconic bigot himself Archie Bunker. Bigotry is in all of us. If a person is dressed differently, we laugh at them. If a person does things in his-her ways, we ostracize them. If you have a birthmark in an obvious place on your body, we insult the person. Everyone is capable of delivering hatred, it is in all of us, no one is safe from the wrath and hatred we inflict on each other. There's a lot to like about "A Time To Kill", but the message delivered here does not do any justice at all. I strongly oppose taking the law in your hands or relying on underhanded tactics like murder just to get even with someone. If this was based on a true story, I think it would be unjustified if they ended up acquitting Carl Lee Hailey. I expect law and order to be handled in very unbiased perspective with no excuses. Hailey's tactics was cold-blooded and unnecessary. He should have sued these rapists in court before going out on a killing spree. I'm sorry for what happened to his daughter and he has every right to be angered by the whole situation, but he is not entirely innocent for what he did.Another wonderful adaptation of John Grisham's novel beautifully directed by Joel Schumacher. It's a fascinating courtroom drama with wonderful performances and film that will have you pondering for ours giving your thoughts and opinions of those around you. I just don't encourage people to get even with someone, by taking revenge in your own hands but doing something regretful or let alone exposing those who do.</fullReview>

Gypsies, Arabs, Jews, and so on .... "nigger" is still the same I think, but they have learned from the history of the past. At least I hope so! God bless the script writer! "A Time To Kill" as the story of racial injustice unfolds. Centered around the brutal rape and assault of a young black girl, Tanya Hailey, "A Time To Kill" immerses itself into the intense emotions that are involved in hatred. The rape, committed by two white men, epitomizes this blind hatred that stems from the racism of the South. Influenced by the pain of his loss, Tanya's father, Carl Lee Hailey, lashes out in a passionate state of retribution, slaying both assailants. Charged with two counts of murder in the first degree, Carl Lee is trapped in a judicial system that is greatly swayed by the racism of the world beyond.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Time to Kill (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Set in a racist South, a young lawyer (Matthew McConaughey) takes the case of a black man (Samuel L. Jackson) who murdered the two white men who raped his ten-year-old daughter. Soon the lawyer comes under attack from the KKK while at the same time he tries to find a way to get his client off. There are certainly flaws to be found in this film but for a mainstream courtroom drama I think it offers enough that makes it highly entertaining. We could debate the political issues in the story for years but I'll freely admit that I agree with what Jackson's character did. I think what makes this film so entertaining is that we're given some very memorable characters and the actors do a terrific job bringing them to life. McConaughey easily became a star thanks to this film and I think he showed a great talent as he really nailed this character and the various emotions that he goes through. Jackson is also very good in his part as the sympathetic father and Sandra Bullock is also terrific in her role as a woman trying to help the case. Donald Sutherland is also very memorable in his supporting role as is his son Kiefer who plays a racist. Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Charles S. Dutton, Brenda Flicker Chris Cooper and Ashley Judd are also very good in their roles. The story itself is one that could cause a heated debate but I thought for the most part it was professionally told by director Joel Schumacher. With that said, I think the director creates some rather not-so-good moments including a few silly close-ups and over-dramatic moments that happen with them. Take a look at the evil juror who wants to fry the Jackson character and during one scene he says something bad and we get a cheap thunder sound effect. Another thing that keeps the film from being perfect is how evil everyone is. I mean there's an evil cop, a cheating D.A., a crooked judge and just about everyone else is guilty of something. I think the story was strong enough without having everyone being dirty of something. At a minute short of 150-minutes, the film runs on a bit too long but thankfully the performances and story are strong enough to carry most of it. A TIME TO KILL is certainly far from perfect but it's certainly entertainment at its highest level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Yes They Deserved to Die And I Hope They Burn In Hell"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I stumbled across the Trailer for this movie on YouTube and was intrigued. I purchased the movie on iTunes a few days later and found myself unable to turn away from the screen, no matter how badly I wanted to. Some off the scenes are hard to bare, such as the rape and torture and attempted murder off little Tanya, a scene that was portrayed to show the true horror of the act and yet it was not filmed in an overly explicit or indecent manner. Many peoples problem with this film seems to be that Carl Lee acts as a vigilante, he takes the law into his own hands and serves out a punishment that while illegal the movie still portrays him as the good guy. But isn't he? Yes he shot those to men (I use this word lightly) and yes he feels no regret but would any one is his shoes? I understood his reasoning, those men raped, tortured and tried to kill his daughter twice, first by hanging then by throwing her from a bridge and while his daughter may have survived, she is undoubtedly damaged, not only mentally but also physically as she is not able to have children after the attack. Could any parent stand that happening to their baby and not be driven to actions that they would normally consider themselves incapable of, especially if there was a good chance that the people responsible would walk free, if not instantly in a few short years? The question is, when the law fails to uphold justice, whose responsibility is it to punish the guilty? Who has the right to be judge, jury and executioner? Can anyone really say his actions where unjustified, can any parent say that they would do otherwise in his situation, not only as revenge but to prevent it from happening again. I do not favor violence, I do not consider myself aggressive but I felt nothing but satisfaction watching those two men die and why? Because they deserved to be punished and there was to high a chance they wouldn't be with the judicial system.The acting in this movie is superb, the only characters I thought a little 2D where the KKK members, it was as though saying "These people are in the KKK, they are bad, they are bad because they are in the KKK" was enough, that, I found unsatisfying. Otherwise every character had depth, good qualities and flaws and they all went on their own journeys that all begin the day that little girl is subjected to the most unimaginable cruelty. She sparks change and struggle and the struggle of the other characters can be paralleled to the struggle she will face for the rest of her life. This film makes you think, it gives you time to question and it gives you time to come to your own conclusions. The pace is perfect, The score chilling. The morals admirable. The story heartbreaking. This film is about race, but it is about more than that. It's about family, love, hate, revenge and human nature. I loved almost everything about the film, having said that it was not perfect, claiming insanity was foolish as the act was clearly premeditated several hours before the fact thus he was of sane mind, the closing statement is unrealistic and it does not keep in ties with the Insanity plea, it is more an emotional appeal. The KKK as I said before are a bit 2D and some off the scenes are a little cliché but the overall movie is still brilliant. If there is one way to wrap this movie up, it is the scene between Kevin Spacey and Samuel Jackson, when Spacey's character (the Prosecutor) asks Jackson's character (the defendant) whether or not he believes in a sane state of mind, the two men he killed deserved to die, unwilling to answer at first as he is trying to act as though he killed them in an state of mind where he was unstable, Jackson does not answer at first however driven to anger by the prosecutions repeated questions he bellows in response, "Yes they deserved to die and I hope they burn in hell." and if you watch this movie, wait till that moment and see if you disagree with him.</fullReview>

The remainder of the film then focuses on the trial of Carl Lee Hailey for murder.It features an ensemble cast that includes Sandra Bullock, Samuel L. Jackson, Matthew McConaughey, Ashley Judd, Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Spacey and Patrick McGoohan.The screenplay was written by Akiva Goldsman, and directed by Joel Schumacher.Carl Lee Hailey takes the law into his own hands after the legal system fails to adequately punish the men who brutally raped and beat his daughter, leaving her for dead. Normally, a distraught father could count on some judicial sympathy in those circumstances. Unfortunately, Carl and his daughter are black, and the assailants are white, and all the events take place in the South. Indeed, so inflammatory is the situation, that the local KKK becomes popular again. When Hailey chooses novice lawyer Jake Brigance to handle his defense, it begins to look like a certainty that Carl will hang, and Jake's career and perhaps his life will come to a premature end. Despite the efforts of the NAACP and local black leaders to persuade Carl to choose some of their high- powered legal help, he remains loyal to Jake, who had helped his brother with a legal problem before the story begins. Jake eventually takes this case seriously enough to seek help from his old law-school professor. When death threats force his family to leave town, Jake even accepts the help of pushy young know-it-all lawyer Ellen Roark. This film adaptation of John Grisham's first novel was a highly charged from beginning to end.It allows the audience to make their opinion with regards to whether the father was right or wrong to put justice into his own hands after what happened to her daughter and how the culprits were set free after a trial.In other words,it puts him/her into their morality issues.This alone makes it worth watching.Aside from that,Matthew McConaughey's performance was brilliant as the laconic young lawyer together with other members of the cast.These reasons alone makes the film a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess if you/someone truly and honestly can close your eyes and visualize this story.... you can answer yourself whether the child- rapists deserved to die or not..... regardless of skin-color...... This is a story about a little girl walking home from the grocery store one sunny afternoon. I want you to picture this little girl......................... Now they climb on, first one then the other, raping her, shattering everything innocent and pure -- vicious thrusts -- in a fog of drunken breath and sweat. And when they're done, after they killed her tiny womb, murdered any chance for her to bear children, to have life beyond her own, they decide to use her for target practice. So they start throwing full beer cans at her............................................................... they pick her up, throw her in the back of the truck, and drive out to Foggy Creek Bridge and pitch her over the edge. And she drops some 30 feet down to the creek bottom below. Can you see her? Her raped, beaten, broken body, soaked in their urine, soaked in their semen, soaked in her blood -- left to die. Can you see her? I want you to picture that little girl. NOW IMAGINE SHE IS YOUR LITTLE DAUGHTER.......... (if someone is still confused about the baby girl's father's action or the child-rapists deservedness.....then i've nothing more to say to them....they'll find out eventually.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racially charged legal thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Grisham to most people is a love him or hate him type of author, where he has either has lovers or haters of his work. I personal don't mind him, I have read The Firm and thought it was pretty good. Grisham work has ended up being made into a number of films, such as The Firm, The Pelican Brief, Rainmaker and the Runaway Jury, all looking at the American Legal system. A Time to Kill is one of his favourite novels, and made had an active role in the adaptation's production.Set in rural Mississippi, a 10-year-old girl is brutally raped by two racists when she was walking home. It is a violence crime that unites the community and the two men are quickly arrested. The men confess to their crime, but the girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), fears that they would be acquitted. He takes the law in his own hand and kills the two men, and himself gets arrested. A local young lawyer Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) takes the cast despite having limited resources because he felt he would have done the same it had happened to his young daughter. There is public sympathy for the case, especially in the black community and Jake even gains the help of Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock), a intelligent law student. But Jake's life and his family is put in danger when the Ku Klux Khan role into town, led by the brother of one of the rapists (Kiefer Sutherland). They use threats and violence against Jake, his family and employees to stop him in the case. Jake also has to tackle the talented, but slimy DA Rufus Buckley (Kevin Spacey) who uses all his influence to get his way.This is clearly a bleak story, and has potential to look at a number of themes, from American law to the still embedded feelings of racism in the American Deep South. The film tries to show all this having a number of sub-plots and looks at a number of characters. They are ideas of racism in the jury, in the police, but also the police having sympathy for the father. I sure a lot of people would feel the same if it happened to a close friend or family member. They is good cast in the film. Samuel L. Jackson was going through his mini-phase of being a militant black man, and was in good form. Kevin Spacey was delightfully slimy, which he is good at, and underused. Kiefer Sutherland offered a similar performance to what he did in another legal thriller, A Few Good Men. Sandra Bullock was okay, but nothing special. Matthew McConaughey too was okay, but I doubt his abilities as a leading man. At times when he was on screen with Sandra Bullock it was a contest on who could offer the most wooden performance.This is also one of Joel Schumacher better films, and shows he can do dark, serious films, and not campy messes like he did with his Batman films. There is violence, some good set pieces and a good handle behind the camera: but he was a workman like director with this film. But he and the writer Akiva Goldsman made the film too long with a bit too much fat: they should have cut around 10 minutes to give the audience a more tort experience.Akiva Goldsman did offer some weak moments of dialogue, and a bit too much melodrama. He is in advantageous with this film, and sticks to the standard legal thriller formation, lawyer gets cast, lawyer has trouble with cast and thinks he is about to lost, lawyer is offered a small ray of hope. That's what happens in most American legal thrillers and the legal thriller is not a genre with has caught on in other nation's cinema.Despite they are claims of liberalism throughout the film, it also offers a very right-wing message, accepting vigilantism, that it is okay to take the law into your own hands.With a little editing, re-writes and a strong indie mentality this could have been an really brilliant, but ends up being standard Hollywood pulp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story ruined by the long running time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I liked was the courage of the lawyer and the story itself. It shows that there is still a limit between black and white people and there are not many to defend sometimes the truth. What I didn't like therefore was that the movie was told too detailed and sometimes it lost even the dynamic or the main point. I mean, the last part was played in the court and I thought that it never stops. They talk too much here, fight and suffers all and every time I had the sensation that all the film is blocked and not fluid. I think they had to cut at least one hour and to concentrate it; perhaps in a remake? Final verdict: 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to kill for Time to kill (Ha! Clever!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Time To Kill is a pretty by the numbers drama about tensions that arise when a vengeful father kills the Southern yokels that raped his young daughters and the brouhaha that ensue in the Southern town where the trial is held. OK, let's see, we have Samuel L. Jackson as the vengeful father, Matthew Mcconaughay as the lawyer who represents him, Sandra Bullock as his peppy law student assistant, Kevin Spacey as the D.A., Donald Sutherland as a retired Lawyer reluctantly helping Mcconaughey, and yes, even Kiefer Sutherland as a grizzled young troublemaker trying everything, including yes, bringing the KKK in! So as you can see here, we have an all-star stew here, and it's all somewhat fun, trying to figure out who comes out the winner in this acting derby (I think it's Kevin Spacey and definitely not Sandra Bullock) . This movie may run too long for it's own good, but holds itself together by its performances to make it enjoyable as.. yess.. A TIME TO KILL! Wow, clever.</fullReview>

The acting was fine, but the characters were so far from the same characters in the book that it can drive you crazy. As a movie - it's more than just OK, but as a movie based on a successful novel - it's a failure. I have no idea why the author of "A Time to Kill"agreed to such massive changes in his story :( I gave this movie a 6 because I was waiting for a great and witty movie, but all I got was a typical "Hollywood" picture - emotional but not satisfying. Anyway - the book's better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SLJ and the KKK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bit of a plodding, just on the right side of sanctimonious Grisham flick in which Samuel L. Jackson plays a poor black southern man who blows away the redneck pond scum that raped his ten year old causing sometime friend Matthew "I live on the hill" Macognahoghanogna to take his case against a backdrop of racial hatred, intimidation and family breakdown etc... There are no shocks in this one, you've seen it many a time but if you like 'em efficient, workmanlike and slick then there's no reason to think you won't lap up the intricately manufactured tension. Will MM lose his lovely blonde Ayran family? Will he sleep with the sarcastic Bullock? Can he possibly beat the bigots and convince a jury of southern white folks to acquit SLJ? Will Donald Sutherland be redeemed through his young protégé? Well what do you think? You can't fault the cast who all put at least 10p in the metre and deliver their contribution with just enough lift to make it all gel. An appreciative, if unenthusiastic nod must go to Kiefer Sutherland who makes a very good simpleton and an even better racist and the MM express is a likable enough lead. The big issues, namely colourblind justice and southern racism aren't explored so much as signposted but with Joel Schumacher at the helm this was never going to be Mississipi Burning, more Blackman and Robin. To be fair to him he does keep it reasonably tight and given its terrifyingly predictable trajectory there still is a hint of anticipation when MM gets to his feet for his make or break summation.In the end we discover that we're all the same really and that the South is full of backward racists. Not huge revelations you might think but we did get to see SB tied to a poll and someone take a shot at fair haired Matthew so it wasn't a waste of time after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time and 'Social Progress' Make this Film Maintain it Poignancy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Grisham's powerful novel about persistent racial conflict in the South was transformed ten years ago into a gripping film by Joel Schumacher with the screenplay adaptation by Akiva Goldsman. The reporting of an act of violence by an African American father whose daughter had been kidnapped, brutally beaten, raped, and further debased brings together a rookie lawyer whose involvement with the father during the prolonged trial results in a suggestion that there may be hope for harmony, even on a small scale, if the racial lines can be erased or even blurred a bit.Matthew McConaughey is the rookie white lawyer, Ashley Judd his wife, Samuel Jackson the father, Sandra Bullock the bright wannabe lawyer who assists McConaughey, Kevin Spacey the brilliant but slimy lawyer opposing McConaughey, Oliver Platt as McConaughey's sidekick, Donald Sutherland as the disbarred drunk of a lawyer who cleans up his act to help McConaughey find the truth justice knows, Patrick McGoohan as the implacable judge, and Kiefer Sutherland as the KKK redneck representing all the evil of the little southern town. It is a fine cast and Schumacher moves them naturally between their lives in the town and the interior of the courtroom with great facility.Perhaps this will never be considered as one of the 'Great Movies', but is certainly pleads the case for understanding and for putting an end to the evils of racial bias.

		<fullReview>This movie based on the book with the same title, is about a trial about a man who shot some people because his daughter was raped, and the KKK is coming in, as the trial goes on. This is a very powerful drama, and a decent cast as well, Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock, Donald Sutherland, Kevin Spacey, Kiefer Sutherland, Matthew McConaughey, and Ashley Judd. Very great and dramatic acting, directed by Joel Schumacher, the man who brought Falling Down,Batman &amp; Robin,Batman Forever,Phone Booth,The Lost Boys St. Elmo's Fire and many others. The scenes at trial were very realistic and convincing and the beginning of the film was perhaps the most disturbing in this movie, and the scene with the KKK coming in was also disturbing. A must see for those who have read the book, I believe they have captured the feel of it very accurately. Watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good movie, despite some clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Time to Kill is a very interesting movie, because it talks about a difficult subject: what would you do if someone raped and (almost) killed your child? I guess many of us would like to react the same way as Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) did. We would like to shoot the one who did it too, instead of waiting for justice to decide.A young white lawyer will defend the black man who is accused of murdering the two men who raped his 10-year-old daughter. This sparks the rebirth of the KKK and the interest of some black pressure groups, who all think the man shouldn't be defended by the young lawyer. The KKK accuses him of being a "nigger-lover" and threatens to kill him, his family and everybody that works for him. The pressure groups on the other hand want to get rid of him, because they want their own lawyers to defend Carl Lee, so they can use him as a status symbol for their own cause.The story is very good, but sometimes too many clichés are used. For instance, it's two boozing rednecks that raped and murdered the innocent black girl who lives with her parents and a lot of brothers and sisters, somewhere on the countryside, in an old house; Every white person in the South is against the black population;... But don't let these clichés turn you down. When you can see past them, you'll see it is a very good drama /court room thriller. I enjoyed watching it and I give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Morally complex legal drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good cast in a complicated story. The usual narrative trajectory here would take us into a small Southern town in which some African-American guy is railroaded into the slams for a crime he may or may not have committed, subject to a brutal trial by prejudiced rednecks, and saved by some whitebread lawyer who finds his humanitarianism in the course of the trial.Not here. The South has changed and the cinematic depictions of the South are changing with it. Samuel Jackson, as the shooter, really DID commit the crime -- and for reasons that are morally ambiguous. Two young drunken white guys kidnap his ten-year-old daughter and do unspeakable things to her, as a result of which Jackson guns them both down on the courtroom steps. The crime isn't a simple one. The two young punks are guilty of all kinds of things, but one is defiant and the other scared. They're not simply stereotypes, although they're decked out to look like it. They're human beings. And they have been caught and are about to be brought to trial, with the likelihood of conviction. (The chief of police is black and is a pretty rough guy.) Is it justifiable for the father, no matter how grievous his wounds, to take the law into his own hands and execute the rapists?I didn't at all agree with the answer the movie gives us, to the triumphant strains of a theme resembling The 1812 Overture. I don't blame Paul Newman for finding it distasteful. The town is divided into interest groups by the trial. The KKK get their invisible empire organized. The NAACP comes down with a smarmy white ACLU lawyer to promote ITS cause. Most of the people are caught in between. A policeman is shot. McConaughey, the white lawyer, is cut during a riot. Sandra Bullock is beaten up, stripped, and left to cook in the sun. (She's rescued by a sympathetic Klansman who comes back and quietly cuts her free and takes her to the hospital. I told you it was complex.) An innocent deputy sheriff, Chris Cooper, a childhood friend of Jackson's, has his leg shattered by Jackson's bullets so an amputation is necessary. He forgives Jackson in court and shouts that if he were in Jackson's place he too would have blown those two crumbs away.The writers don't make it easy for you to take sides. We even get to see the funeral of one of the murdered rapists, and his stricken and vengeful brothers and friends. But at times, the complexity is almost too much. Donald Southerland plays the part of Arthur O'Connell in "Anatomy of a Murder." Ashley Judd leaves McConaugbey and then comes back. All these narrative strings unravel. I also sometimes get the creeps when someone in a John Grisham story begins talking about the ideals of lawyers. They're there to see that justice is done, etc. It's a bit hard to believe that conversations of that sort take place after one leaves law school. I mean, doctors don't sit around at parties talking about the divine mission they've been given of saving human lives. (Or do they?) And my heart sinks a little -- or anyway, my stomach -- when I hear a summation that asks the jury to think with its "heart" or its "soul" rather than with logic. That's happened a little too often in the past to impress me as an idea I can feel comfortable with. But what a great cast. McConaughey has never impressed me that much, and the others don't have much of a chance to stretch their chops because their parts are rather limited. But we know they can do it, and they show some glimmer of their talent on screen here -- Kevin Spacey, Chris Cooper, Ashley Judd, Oliver Platt, and others have all done splendid work elsewhere.It's a movie well worth watching if only because it doesn't treat the audience like semi-moronic naturals. It leaves you to make up your own mind, kind of like a jury, but about a lot of issues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge Will Be Mine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Time to Kill" opens with Tonya Hailey (Rae'Ven Larrymore), a little ten-year-old black girl coming home from the local grocery store. She is walking alone on a dirt road in a small town in Mississippi, when Billy Ray Cobb (Nicky Katt) and James Louis Willard (Doug Hutchison, two drunken, racist men, come up behind her and hit her with a beer can. They severely beat, rape, and try to kill her. They leave her to die, but she lives. Carl-Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), the father of the little girl, finds out what happens and wants revenge. The two men are charged with attempted murder shortly after the incident. On the day of their trial, the father comes into the courthouse and kills the two men. After he is charged with murder, he seeks legal representation with a young and inexperienced lawyer, Jake Tyler Brigance (Mathew McConaughey). The trial for the murder of the two men brings not only injustice into the picture, but also racial issues as well."A Time to Kill" is a movie which exhibits injustice, revenge, and discrimination, all wrapped into one. The main idea of this film is to insist that justice is colorblind and should remain that way. Everybody should be able to receive a fair trial no matter what their color, race, or religion maybe. I also think that there is intent to question what is right or wrong in judicial law and what is morally right and wrong in every citizen's heart. This is what I believe to be the primary message in the film."A Time to Kill" shows that every character brings some type of tale into the main story itself. The lawyers in the southern state of Mississippi appear as dominant, upholding citizens. The black community is shown as middle to lower class people. The dialect between the white and black people is very different. The KKK association is brought into this picture with the symbol of racist hatred. These are just some of the techniques that are addressed in this movie.This movie teaches society a valuable lesson in racial discrimination and vengeance. They should be diminished. Justice should not be taken by the hands of a human being, but rather by the law. I found it very interesting to watch; it will not leave the viewers bored. This movie will keep them on the edge of their seat. Also, the actors were fantastically cast. I definitely rate "A Time to Kill" five stars.</fullReview>

In fact, this is perhaps one of the best movie recreations of a book I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a few. The movie sticks to the facts in the book (other than that part where Jake throws the bomb and it explodes, added for special effect). Aside from a few minor differences that do not affect the storyline, the movie is right on line with the author's intent.

		<shortDescription>Very Good Court Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Time To Kill is a very good court thriller and is the best John Grisholm adaption I've seen. Probably one of the best court films ever made, in the likes of A Few Good Men (1992), which is also a very good court thriller. Those 2 films also have 2 other things in common: they both have heaps of famous actors in it and both have Kiefer Sutherland in it. This is one of the 4 films Joel Schumaccher (director) and Kiefer have made together, including The Lost Boys (1987), Phone Booth (2003) and Flatliners (1990).The film is about 2 white racist thugs who rape a young black girl and they are killed by her father Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson). Then there's a major courtcase about it, about weather Carl should be given the death penalty. Jake Tyler Brigance (Matthew McConauggey) and Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock) are lawyers try to defend him, and Rufus Buckley(Kevin Spacey) is a lawyer who wants to put him on the death penalty for his own publicity. All the locals (mainly the black ones) want Carl to live, but Freddie Lee Cobb (Kiefer Sutherland), who was a friend of the 2 thugs, wants Carl dead, so he calls on nearby Ku Klux Klan members to kill Carl and his lawyers. Not only this, but Jake is worried about the safety of his family from the KKK and he starts getting attracted to Ellen.Thrillers are definately Joel Schumaccher's high point as a director, as he proved in 8MM (1999) and Phone Booth (2003). The all star cast make this a treat for the audience, as well as the darkness to the story. This film not only has a good story, but deals with issues like the death penalty, racism, adultery, trust and family. This is a very good film not to be missed.Rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Difference Between Black and White</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) is a dedicated, hard-working familyman. Two men change all of that. The two men who raped his daughter. The two men who attempted to murder his daughter. They shattered the life of his ten year old daughter Tonya. As they arrive at court for their hearing, Carl Lee shows up and shoots them to death. He wanted revenge on them for what they did to his daughter. He knew that even if they went to trial, they might not even be punished for their crimes. Now, the trial is no longer for the two men, but for Carl Lee himself. And, Carl Lee has chosen Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) a Mississippi lawyer, to defend him. `The Difference Between Black and White.' Jake Brigance is a white lawyer defending an obviously guilty black man. With an all white jury, the odds are stacked against Jake and Carl Lee. Jake must utilize everything in his power to prove Carl Lee's innocence. And the stakes are raised even higher as the KKK begins to retaliate against those involved. The KKK manages to kill one man, injure another, and burn Jake's house to the ground. The KKK and their white followers want to see Carl Lee fry. While the black community wants to see him set free, because what he did was clearly an act of revenge. It's an all out battle between black and white. It comes down to the very last minute. Will he be guilty or innocent? With Jake's last minute save that's exactly what he is: innocent. With an all star cast--Matthew McConaughey, Samuel L. Jackson, Sandra Bullock, Kevin Spacey, and Donald and Kiefer Sutherland--it is a must see movie. The movie is truly based on a story of revenge. A father's love and protection of his family is incomparable to that of his own life. He would sacrifice everything for his family, and in this case, especially his daughter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twists And Turns Aplenty!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off watching this film until just recently (2003). The reason is that a Grisham novel is difficult to make into a film. If you read "The Firm" and then saw the movie afterwards, you were probably as disappointed as I was.I am also not particularly fond of Sandra Bullock as an actress. Demi Moore would have made a better choice and kept her from making some other lousy movie in 1996. Bullock always seems to remind me that I'm watching a movie and I prefer to get engrossed in a film so I forget that.Other than that, there is a great cast here, most notably Matthew McConaughey who is excellent in this film. However, there are too many twists and turns to the story that make my eyes start rolling, if you know what I mean. It's just not believable.</fullReview>

Kevin Spacey was superb. Sandra Bullock was pretty good but I've seen her in better roles.I'd recommend this movie to my friends and co-workers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A TIME TO KILL (1996) *** Matthew McConaughey, Samuel L.Jackson, Sandra Bullock, Kevin Spacey, Brenda Fricker, Donald Sutherland, Oliver Platt, Ashley Judd, Charles S. Dutton, Kiefer Sutherland, Patrick McGoohan, Chris Cooper, John Diehl, M.Emmet Walsh, Joe Seneca, Kurtwood Smith. Evenhanded and at times predictable adaptation of John Grisham's first bestseller about two rednecks beating and raping a 10 year old black girl and the vengeance killings by her father (Jackson in a searing performance) who enlists green attorney McConaughey in a star making performance, who faces all sorts of ethical and racial consequences when he accepts the controversial case. Great ensemble of talent and better than expected screenplay by Akiva Goldsmith ("The Client").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There is a Time to Kill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a book by John Grisham which I read. It is a very good book and form what I remember the movie follows as closely as it can. The movie is fantastic. A little girl is walking home but doesn't make it quite there because two hicks hit her in the head with a beer can and then they have their way with her. They ruin any chance she could ever have with giving birth. Any. They don't have any remorse because they live in the south where they will surely get off because the jury will consist of whites. Which of course does not settle to well with the daddy, Car Lee Haily, he sneaks into the court house and kills them both. He is now the one that is going to trial and he is the one that has an all white jury. But what he has now is a lawyer who wants to win. Jake Brigance has not had a good case in quite a while until he stumbles across this one but decides that he should take a pay cut to defined Haily. A law student comes along, Ellen Roark, to help for free. The case gets more difficult because the NAACP wants another lawyer, the Klu Klux Klan rears their dirty pillow heads, and rage of the black community fire what is a big decision for 12 people to make, was what Haily did justified? This movie was good. I liked it a lot. The fact that Haily killed those boys for what they did to his daughter was not all to bright but it is what he did. And what he did was no worse then what they did to his daughter. They raped her and beat her. By raping her they ruined any chance that she could have with birth of a child of her own, which is in its own right murder. They ruined a father because they ruined a daughter. So what they did was, in all actuality, kill themselves. They could have saved everyone a whole bunch of trouble and just killed themselves, but they didn't. The cast in this movie is caliber. Kevin Spacey shows how evil he can be by playing the snide district attorney. Sandra Bullock gets a little serious with her Roark role. Matthew McConaughey shows his acting ability with Jake, especially during his closing statements. Samuel L. Jackson brings out the life in a father that lost the innocence of his daughter by to dirty men. The whole case turns into a race issue and has the Klu Klux Klan marching and the African Americans marching too just to match them. They fight in front of the court house. They want it to be a race thing. But it shouldn't be. It should be about a girl who lost what she had because two men thought they could get away with it just because of her color. But no matter the color she was still a little girl and no little girl disserves what she got. This movie is exciting and thrilling. It was a great book and a great movie. It captivates me every time I watch it. As the title shows there is a time to kill. A-.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best courtroom drama I have ever seen! Even though I did not see A TIME TO KILL theatrically, one night, it was October 30, 1999, it happened to be on ABC, so, I decided to watch it. After watching it then, I decided I liked it and wanted to own it. This smashing courtroom drama made me feel really good, and, the more I watch it, the more I like it. If you ask me, Carl Lee (Samuel L. Jackson) gave Billy Ray (Nicky Katt) and Pete (Doug Hutchison) what they deserved. In my opinion, Jake (Matthew McConaughey) was the perfect choice for Carl Lee's attorney. This was because he was a young and experienced attorney. I thought that Ellen (Sandra Bullock) looked very beautiful in the black dress coat and skirt, white blouse, and beige high heels. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "If you ask me, everyone involved in this film did a superb job, and, I have quite a bit of the dialogue memorized." Now, having said all that, I give A TIME TO KILL three out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What might have been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the John Grisham novel, A Time To Kill is the story of the legal battle a black man who kills two white men that brutally raped and attempted to murder his young daughter. It's a fascinating, if touchy, set-up, that could have led to a great story.Unfortunately, Director Joel Schumacher clearly does not have enough faith in the intelligence and thought capacity of the audience to figure out and interpret their own beliefs of this potentially complex film. Rather than walk the fine, narrowly defined line of right and wrong and black and white in this film, he decides to beat us over the head with who the good guys and bad buys are, turning what could have been a fascinating look at race relations and the justice system in America into a drama/action flick of good vs. evil, one that we ultimately know who will win. It's still a good movie. You grow to care for the characters, and it is an intense film, that is at times griping. I would, however, be interested to see what a different vision of this story could result in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Southern accents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from the film's other downpoints, it has the weakest Southern accents that I've heard. Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey, and Oliver Platt all grew up in Mid Atlantic states which usually have a flat East-coast dialect. Patrick McGoohan was born in the Northeast but has had an inherent Irish accent in all his films because he was raised in Ireland as a child. This accent, if not Donald and son Kiefer's, was the funniest. Only Matthew McConaughey and Ashley Judd succeeded (partially) in speaking the deep Mississippi/Alabama twang because one was born in Texas and the other lived in Kentucky. But I do think their language coaches could have done better. Having read Grisham's novel some time ago, I must note that Jackson's and McConaughey's characters were much more suspicious of eachother than how they appeared on film. And as others have said, McConaughey's character was much less the hero then how he is portrayed here. Providing you have no qualms on predictable endings (common in Grisham novels) this may work as a morality play, but it really depends on whether you prefer a film for its point over its plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay here's the good: 2 good performances by the main characters who you cared about, court drama which a lot of the time was effective, and other entertaining elements. Still the movie fails to quite deliver, and instead of be rightous it ends up just trying to excuse vengence. For every effective courtroom scene you see, there's another that makes you cringe. I liked most performances, but this is obviously one of the worst roles Sandra Bullock has ever taken. Outside the courtroom most was okay, although there were one to many scenes with the KKK without even a true reason for them to be involved (This isn't the first time a black man who was defended by a white man in Alabama had a chance for an aquital). This movie is also full of obvious stereotypes. When I see a courtroom drama I want a movie that makes me care for the character charged, which this movie succeeds in, but I also want to believe it's rightous, and no one can convince me that it is justifiable to kill someone who raped your daughter. Hayley doesn't deserve to die or even get life in prison, but I believe he should get some punishment for what he did. I wanted to like the movie for the basic reasons, good performances, good drama, intersting aspects. Still I can't get by the overall concept. I give this movie a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I live in the South, I guess I must be sweaty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to enjoy this film, and from a simplistic standpoint it was easy to watch because it didn't demand any real thinking on your part. But that's part of the problem. The movie never gave you any doubt as to who was 'right' and never made you question Samuel Jackson's character for his actions of revenge. Certainly I understand why his character did what he did (what father couldn't), but the story never even attempted to raise any doubts about his righteousness. It came at it from the angle of whether or not he'd be WRONGFULLY found guilty.And as somebody who was transplanted into the South from an early age, I was offended by yet another stereotypical Hollywood view of the South. If we're to go by the example set in the movie, nobody in the South appears to have air conditioning. Now I know in many parts of the country, air conditioning is still considered an option given the varying climates, but in the humid South it's practically mandatory. Even the vast majority of people in lower income areas have it. It's as essential as food and clothing here. Yet according to this movie it looks as though every single person and location either lacks the intelligence or resources to buy an air conditioner. Give me a break! And it goes without saying that all the other stereotypical Southern set pieces are out in full force. I don't mind some of these as they are still true in certain areas. But after awhile it wears on you as its obvious the South has now been permanently type cast into this light no matter what changes may come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, the very best of Grisham movies, is by far the best court-room thriller I have seen. Every sweaty, heavy moment of the story is expertly portrayed, it has a great cast and a gripping plot. But what really makes this film go over-the-top is Samuel L. Jackson - he steals the show, really, and this could be his finest performance, so far.Grisham has a very schematic writing: young, fresh lawyer or law student proves his mettle against some giant monster, corporate or other. Reading more than two or maybe three of his books is almost unnecessary, for once you know the basic plot of the others, you can work out pretty much how they work. The films are about the same - but "A Time to Kill" stands out a bit: it's fairly predictable, but it is so well made that it doesn't feel like a Grisham movie. That's only for the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this film was made in 1996, I personally have not seen anything better since. It touches on so many morals, so many that our nation as a whole has lost somewhere in the hustle, bustle of our busy, everchanging lives. Matt's character(Jake) likes the recognition he is getting by defending a black man in a white man's world. But at the same time, he wants to risk everything because he believes Samuel's character(Carl) was justified in what he did. Jake has a good, strong, marriage and a little girl the same age as Carl's. Jake works so hard to try and defend Carl that he loses sight of the hurt he is putting his loved ones through. His marriage is tested by a woman he finds attractive (Sandra Bullock) and the passion they share in the laws and in freeing Carl from First Degree Murder. But yet, when Jake is at his lowest, he does not give into temptation. Even with Carl behind bars, he teaches Jake what it truly means to make a good team....black and white, they stand tall together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polarising...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The lasting appeal of this adapted screenplay of the John Grisham novel is that it's a great debate starter. Everyone seems to have very energised view on the subject of corporal punishment but this delves into even murkier territory, as it asks whether a father has the right to murder his 10-year-old daughters rapists.The film also takes a position on it which turns it into more of a propaganda piece but still, a very effective and somewhat even handed one. Samual L. Jackson is the father, whilst potentially career best turns form Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock steal the show. Oh and Kevin Spacey turns up but there's little point even mentioning his performance as he makes it all look so easy.The film follows the events of the rape, the rapist's murder and the trial which ensues. The K.K.K. takes sides, the N.C.A.A.P. wade in and death threats and bombs are flying through the swamps of the deep south. This is a very good thriller and one of the best Grisham adapts to date, but it's the question that drives it throughout; the question of is there ever a time to kill which keeps this 149 minute thriller burning, even when the plot falls foul of the clichés.Worth a watch every time and will certainly polarise options.</fullReview>

Sheesh I have lived in a southern, coastal town and I can tell you, unless you are super poor or have an old house that can't be changed/updated due to being on the Historical register, we have AIR CONDITIONING in the homes, court houses and more. And, if it isn't central air, we have WINDOW UNITS a humming all summer long. Nothing is more calming than the sound of a window unit. I don't care how used to the humidity and heat you are, walking around dripping sweat and looking good at the same time is just not a common activity. So, TURN ON THE A.C. writers of southern stories, unless it is a historical/period piece. Heck, and cool off. Makes me sweat just watching this movie. ; )Great movie though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apart from what he did to the Batman film series of the 90's... and I suppose one should eventually forgive that, since Nolan's doing rather a great job with the franchise, so what Joel did was mainly give a new generation a version of the character that resembles the campy 60's show... I suppose Schumacher really hasn't done anything that can be held against him. As far as directors go, there are countless ones out there who are considerably worse; in fact, he's quite dependable, and as long as the source material wasn't a comic book, his movies are seldom downright poor. And it is nice to see him tackle something as interesting and provocative as this. I haven't read the novel, nor any other by Grisham(save for Skipping Christmas... I know, talk about the exception to his body of work), so I can't comment on how close this sticks to it. With a script written by Akiva "Hit and Miss" Goldsman, I suppose there's a reasonable chance that it got the core right. The plot is compelling, and the pacing is so good that the two and a half hours pass a lot faster than one might think. Acting is about what one would expect, and while McConaughey isn't half bad in this, he's still out-shined by the masters of the craft(and Bullock, too) in the cast. Jackson does well without being given much to do. This is dramatic, exciting, engaging and, when it means to be, intense. Past the controversial message that some argue that this promotes, is one so banal and predictable that it ought to no longer need be campaigned for. The editing and cinematography are relatively standard. There is violence and disturbing content in this, and the latter is verbally described in detail. I recommend this to any and all fans of those who made it and/or of thrillers. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-made, thought-provoking thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never read a single one of John Grisham's novels; he is one of those authors whose works I know solely from film adaptations, of which there have been several. "A Time to Kill" forms part of the cinematic tradition which uses the conventions of the courtroom thriller to examine the problem of racism in American society. This tradition dates back at least as far as "Intruder in the Dust" from 1949, and perhaps the best-known example is "To Kill a Mockingbird". Modern examples include "Ghosts of Mississippi" (also from 1996) and "Snow Falling on Cedars", although that was set in the Pacific North-West rather than the Deep South and the defendant was of Japanese rather than African-American descent. "Just Cause" starts out like a film of this type but is then spoilt by a plot twist which negates its anti-racist credentials.The film is set in Clanton, Mississippi. A 10-year-old black girl named Tonya Hailey is raped, violently beaten and dumped in a river by two white racists. Tonya survives her ordeal and the men are arrested. Her father Carl Lee fears that, due to ingrained racism in the area, they may be acquitted by a white jury, and goes to the county courthouse where he shoots them dead with a rifle. The policeman escorting them is injured in the shooting. Carl Lee is arrested and charged with murder.The rest of the film revolves around Carl Lee's subsequent trial. A common feature of this type of film is the fearless white lawyer who stands up for justice. (It is curious how this convention has survived for so long. Might it not be more original to have a fearless black lawyer?) This film features two such characters, Carl Lee's attorney, Jake Brigance, and Ellen Roark, a liberal law student from Massachusetts and ACLU member who volunteers to assist Jake with the defence, which revolves around a plea of not guilty by reason of temporary insanity. Although he opposes racism, Jake himself is not particularly liberal; he is, unlike Ellen, a supporter of the death penalty. Indeed, there is a suggestion that he is so keen take on the defence because he approves of the sort of vigilante justice which Carl Lee handed out to the two rapists.Defending a black man accused of murdering two whites does not make Jake and Ellen popular with many in the white community, and tensions begin to rise, especially when the Ku Klux Klan begins to organise in the area. Jake is forced to send his wife and young daughter away for their own safety- a wise decision as his house is later targeted by arsonists. Ellen is kidnapped by Klansmen, but later rescued.I felt that Matthew McConaughey, only in his mid-twenties at the time, perhaps came across as too young and inexperienced for a lawyer charged with so major a case. (He was later, in "Amistad", to play another lawyer acting for black defendants charged with murder, although that was a historical film set in the days of slavery). Several other actors such as Kevin Costner, most of them rather older than McConaughey, were considered for the role. I felt that much of the sub-plot involving Ellen, who comes close to having an affair with Jake before he develops a conscience at the last minute, was rather unnecessary, and probably included because the film-makers needed a role for a major female star. (Jake's wife Carla does not really count as such because she is absent from the action for much of the time).There were, however, some good acting performances. I liked Samuel L. Jackson as Carl Lee, a decent family man driven beyond endurance by the attack on his daughter and, more generally, by the racist attitudes of the white community. I also liked Donald Sutherland in a cameo role as Lucien Wilbanks, a veteran liberal lawyer who has been disbarred for violence on a picket line activist but who still manages to provide Jake with advice. Perhaps the best performance comes from Kevin Spacey as the ruthless district attorney Rufus Buckley, the sort of prosecutor who is less interested in justice than in furthering his own political career. (The American system of directly elected prosecutors- anathema to anyone involved in the British legal system- seems to be taking some flak from Hollywood; F. Murray Abraham played a similar character in "the Bonfire of the Vanities").I have not liked all the Grisham-based films I have seen, but "A Time to Kill" is one of the better ones; I preferred it, for instance, to "The Client", which was also directed by Joel Schumacher. The interest of the film lies not only in the courtroom duels between the opposing lawyers but also in the issues it raises about race and about justice. The film suggests that there may exist in America more insidious forms of racism than the brutal hatred which inspires the Klan and the rapists. Carl Lee points out that white people, however well intentioned, see him as a black man rather than simply as a man, and that even the most liberal whites rarely socialise with blacks. The film also explores the question of vigilantism and when revenge might be justified; if people are not to "take the law into their own hands", the authorities need to maintain a firm grip on it themselves and to be sure that it does not slip from their hands though either weakness or prejudice. A well-made, thought-provoking thriller. 7/10</fullReview>

The movie also suffered from his heavy handed approach. Schumacher also wrecked the film by trying to make a chick movie. He put in dialogue and scenes that aren't in the book. And he also lost the temperament of both blacks and whites by being too PC with the dialogue. Too simplistic. All whites are bad, all blacks are good. Grisham has the good and bad of both sides clearly on display in the book. This movie was bullshit. Don L., Redford, MI</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best courtroom drama I have ever seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best courtroom drama I have ever seen! Even though I did not see A TIME TO KILL theatrically, one night, it was October 30, 1999, it happened to be on ABC, so I decided to watch it. After watching it then, I decided I liked it and wanted to own it. This smashing courtroom drama made me feel really good, and the more I watch it, the more I like it. If you ask me, Carl Lee (Samuel L. Jackson) gave Billy Ray (Nicky Katt) and Pete (Doug Hutchison) what they deserved. In my opinion, Jake (Matthew McConaughey) was the perfect choice for Carl Lee's attorney. This was because he was a young and experienced attorney. I thought that Ellen (Sandra Bullock) looked very beautiful in the black dress coat and skirt, white blouse, and black high heels. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, "If you ask me, everyone involved in this film did a superb job, and I have quite a bit of the dialogue memorized." Now, having said all that, I give A TIME TO KILL three out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This "movie" if it can be called that, is an absolute disgrace to the South, Old and New What is it about the South that causes Hollywood to often portray Southerners, ALL southerners , Black and WHite and Sociopathic Murderous neo sodomites? Is it the fact that the KKK was founded in Atlanta Georgia? Perhaps it was. But Guess what? The KKK Is more prominent outside the South than IN the South, for there are more Non Southerners than Southerners. I personally and philosophically have no feelings whatsoever but pure pity for ANYBODY REMOTELY sympathetic to this vile worthless piece of trash.BTW One of my favorite Actors, no, MY FAVORITE Actor was from Chicago.

		<shortDescription>Gritty version of John Grisham's best-seller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'A Time to Kill' starts off with the brutal rape and murder of a young black girl by two white men and then proceeds to tell the tale of how racial tensions in a small Southern town are brought to a boiling point. Before the trial of the accused, the men are shot on the courtroom steps by the girl's father--setting in motion the plot that brings attorney Matthew McConaughey to the fore as the young attorney defending the enraged black father. Against a background of Klan terror and media clamor for justice, he is helped by Sandra Bullock to get his legal research for the trial.While maintaining its suspense throughout an overlong running time of 2 1/2 hours, it is sometimes hard to take the harsh realism and the hate-filled speeches that consumes many of the principal players. The performances are all strong--with Kevin Spacey as a ferocious prosecutor and Samuel L. Jackson doing the most impressive work. Sandra's role is rather peripheral to the main action but she is more than competent--and the film proved to be a star-making role for Matthew McConaughey, fighting biogtry as he tries to defend a black man. Absorbing, hard-hitting melodrama of the deep South, not for the squeamish.</fullReview>

I don't know if any other movie has had an effect on me like this one. Usually I watch movies and they have no effect on me, their sole purpose is entertainment. Not one has ever made me cry. This movie didn't make me cry (if you know of any that might email me) but it did surprise me. The speech at the end... have you ever listened to it with your eyes closed like he says to? Picturing it in your head? It might almost feel real, make you hate those men that did that to her. I don't really understand Sandra Bullocks part in the movie except to create even more conflict, which there is already plenty of. The beginning was made well. You understood what was happening but they didn't over do it. I would rate this very high. You must see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoyed films like Mississippi Burning or In the Heat of the Night, which dealt superbly with the subject of black racial discrimination, then at first glance, you could be excused for thinking that A Time to Kill might be just the movie for you. Unfortunately, you may end up being severely disappointed.The film is one of the worst of its type, because of the awful direction. I haven't read the book, so I could not judge how true the screenplay and action relate to Grisham's story. But disregarding the book, the main problem with the film is its utter drabness. The characters seem cardboard cut-out stereotypes. Matthew McConaughey is the struggling, caring white lawyer with a beautiful, blonde blue-eyed wife and daughter, defending angry, black Carl Lee Hailey, whose young daughter has just been raped by 2 rednecks. Hailey walks into McConaughey's office and tells him that he intends to get revenge on the 2 rednecks despite their impending trial, and he succeeds in killing them on the day of their hearing. Like the courthouse wouldn't be properly guarded. And yes, McConaughey decides to defend him after this incident because he is a 'man with a conscience'. Then the brother of one of the murdered rednecks decides to involve the Klu Klux Klan, and so we have threats made to McConaughey and his legal team, and race riots in the town where this all takes place. And in the end Hailey is acquitted of murder, everyone smiles and is tearful, McConaughey is a hero, and they all live happily ever after.Well that's the nuts and bolts of this very predictable and unoriginal plot. To make matters worse, the actors at times appear to be going through the motions. Donald Sutherland is brought in as a seriously drunken lawyer to help McConaughey; that idea stolen from a much earlier legal drama, The Verdict', which was vastly superior to this dross. Hailey, played by Samuel Jackson, seems relatively unperturbed by what he has done, and the fate that might await him. Kevin Spacey as the DA, plays the stereotype who tries to make out McConaughey is too inadequate and green a lawyer to take on the case. How many times have we seen that sort of scenario in legal dramas? Patrick McGoohan plays the crusty old judge presiding over the court, who is over zealous and stubborn much of the time. Sandra Bullock plays an eager-beaver law student who arrives out of nowhere and insists on helping out McConaughey over the case, because she has a heart, and wants to learn...and so it goes on. And that's the problem. An impressive sounding cast, but none of the actors convince or can lend any real credibility to their characters. They are just too wooden and stereotyped. I read that the Mississippi state accents were poorly done by most of the cast, but I am no judge of that. Nevertheless if I didn't know any better, I could be fooled into thinking I was watching a legal drama spoof. So best give this one a wide berth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful tale of Morality and Racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a white male from the UK, it is difficult for me to relate to Racism in the Deep South, or even the KKK, other than i know of them. But racism is sadly something i do see in different forms regularly, and on this note i felt the powerful morality of the story.Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) murders two men after they rape his 10 year old little girl and leave her for dead. After he chooses a young white lawyer, Jake Tyler Brigance (Matthew McCaughey) the relatives of the Murdered rapists join the KKK and begin their pathetic reign of cowardess and torture against Brigances family and his law practice. I have to say, i simply loved it when Stump Sisson (Kurtwood Smith) the leader of the KKK, was burned to death during a riot. The hatred i felt for him, the rest of the KKK and the spokesman for the Jury, surprised me, but that's the power of this movie.Unrelented, Brigance with the help of Ellen (Sandra Bullock), Harry (Oliver Platt) and his teacher Lucien (Donald Sutherland) continue the fight for Carl's release, and the story grows more dramatic with every scene, with no scene more powerful than the closing address in the courtroom from Brigance, simply brilliant.With fine performances from all of the cast, the credit must go to Matthew McConaughey, for his finest performance ever.This movie is one of the most powerful that i've seen, forget any weakness of story or plot holes this may have, it's morale values are very real, and we could all learn from them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the greatest movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not about the actual judicial system and getting around it, although that may be an intricate part. i know all us movie lovers like to sit and analyze movies and the possible hidden meanings behind them, but not everything is a read-between the lines kind of thing. the movie is about family and love and justice and the racial issues that still exist in this country. you could say some of the characters were stereotypical, but that is a heinous assumption. the characters all serve their purpose. each one of them is dealing with real life issues and the pressures of the world around them. we are all stereotypical in that sense. would you feel sorry for some rich man, black or white, who had everything in life and a life that was smooth sailing when his daughter was raped? no... it's more emotionally appealing if the father is a poor, hardworking man who saw the reality of our court system and new that in the south at the time his daughter's rapists would walk free like nothing ever happened. not that killing them was right, but that something had to be done when our law systems might do nothing. the movie isn't about some political standpoint. it's taking the realities of our world and showing the truth of how horrible racism is. why do people have to look at it from 500 different angles and break it apart. a black man's daughter is raped, he kills the white rapists and is put on trial. his white lawyer appeals to the court and viewing audience with one of the best scenes i've ever witnessed in a movie, the closing argument. the man is exonerated. the acting alone is reason enough for anyone to view it. with an extremely talented cast of samuel l. jackson, matthew mcconaughey, sandra bullock, keifer sutherland, donald sutherland, and kevin spacey.. you can't go wrong. this is a definite must see. in reality, you shouldn't take anyone else's opinions to heart. we all see things differently. just watch the movie. whether you thing it was excellent or just OK, you get something out of it.</fullReview>

Added to which, the character played by Sandra Bullock must be one of the flimsiest ever to insult a big money blockbuster.Not a night to propose marriage, after all.We watched Casablanca on video a few nights later, thankfully, and we've been happily married ever since.If you want a truly brilliant legal/racial drama, then get out the classic from which all the best scenes are shamelessly stolen, To Kill a Mockingbird.

		<shortDescription>Ham-handed, simplistic, but not completely worthless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read Grisham's novel before I saw the movie. Both novel and movie are severely flawed; what is interesting is how *differently* they are flawed.The plot of A TIME TO KILL is simple. Two vile white thugs brutally rape and try to murder a little black girl near a small Mississippi town. They are caught, but before they can be tried, the girl's father, Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson) guns them down on the courthouse steps, accidentally wounding a white deputy in the process. Hailey hires attorney Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey) to defend him; Brigance is put through the standard wringer of difficult relations with his client, threats against his family and home, and a judicial deck that is stacked against him.The chief flaw of Grisham's original novel is that it has no sympathetic characters; even Hailey ends up looking cowardly and dishonest. The chief flaw of the movie is that the heroes are too perfect. Even Oliver Platt's character never does anything really despicable. Grisham's original novel realistically portrays lawyering as a profession that crushes idealism mercilessly, but the movie shows Brigance as a starry-eyed sentimentalist out to "save the world one case at a time."The best part of Schumacher's A TIME TO KILL is Samuel L. Jackson's performance. While Grisham's Hailey seems to kill the rapists just because he thinks he can get away with it, Jackson makes it clear that he wants these two men dead even if it means he will be convicted or even executed for it. Nothing less will satisfy him, his pain and rage are so great. He is also pleasingly intelligent, another trait lacking in Grisham's Hailey, as is shown when he out-manipulates some NAACP characters who are trying to manipulate him. I shared, and I think most viewers could share, Jackson's rage in the line, "Yes, they deserved to die, and I hope they burn in Hell!"There is no question that, according to clearly defined legal standards, Hailey is guilty of murder. Brigance's insanity defense is designed to give the jury a legal excuse to acquit; neither Brigance nor anybody else believes that Hailey is or was actually nuts. This is in no way unrealistic; juries can and do ignore the law and facts to suit their own feelings, as can be seen from the O.J. Simpson case, the Scottsboro case, and numerous cases of "Texas self-defense" (the popular term for the tendency of Texan juries to acquit men who murder their wives for infidelity). I can honestly say that if I were on Hailey's jury, I would never have voted to convict him, regardless of whether the law required me to do so. I could not live with Hailey's blood on my hands.But A TIME TO KILL steadily degenerates into a series of rah-rah crowd-pleasing scenes and go-get-'em speeches delivered by McConaughey and Donald Sutherland (Brigance's disbarred mentor). A scene involving a dog dredges up bad memories from INDEPENDENCE DAY, and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman's efforts to set up the triumph-against-the-odds scenario are so blatantly transparent that the movie ends up being laughable by the end. Sandra Bullock's character is even more uselessly tacked-on than Demi Moore's in A FEW GOOD MEN.The climax is one absurdity after another. A criminal is suddenly caught despite the total absence of any evidence leading to him; Brigance's wife returns to him for no reason that didn't already apply. Brigance gives a closing statement, in which he asks the jury to imagine that the victim of the rape was white. What is the point of this argument? To any decent person, raping a black girl is just as bad as raping a white one. If the jury somehow felt that this monstrous crime was justifiable because the victim was black, how would that despicable attitude be changed by Brigance exhorting them to imagine that she were white?Jackson has a speech at the end which essentially boils down to accusing Brigance of being a racist, because he doesn't come over to Hailey's neighborhood and visit. I have a serious problem with this line of thinking; for people to visit each other's neighborhoods because of their race rather than because of their individual qualities would take the country no closer to Martin Luther King's dream of judging people by their character rather than their skin color. But supposing Hailey has a valid point, the movie's answer to it, where Brigance's family does come over to visit Hailey's amid much pompous drum-beating, smacks of pure condescension rather than genuine neighborliness.The lawyerly realism of Grisham's novel is not completely lost; the emphasis on jury-selection tactics mostly survives into the movie. There is a good scene where one of the State's star witnesses turns out not to be as helpful as the prosecutor had hoped.The acting is good. Jackson, as described above, is mesmerizing. Matthew McConaughey is not dazzling, but is sincere. Kevin Spacey does a superb job as the bloodthirsty prosecutor. Patrick McGoohan's voice cannot be plausibly disguised as Southern, and he appears to phone in his performance. Kiefer Sutherland delivers his patented psycho performance, which he does about as well as usual. Racism is an ugly thing with ugly consequences; it is ill treated by Goldsman's treacle. Say what you will about MISSISSIPPI BURNING, but there was nothing sugar-coated about Parker's movie. And of course A TIME TO KILL doesn't even approach TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. The most interesting parallel to Schumacher's work is the TV movie OUTRAGE!, whose theme was identical except that the rapist was black and the outraged father white, and that the father killed the rapist only after he had been set free. The conclusions reached were otherwise exactly the same as in A TIME TO KILL.Rating: ** out of ****.</fullReview>

You cannot enjoy the movie without noticing his irritating dialog delivery and worst acting. He just spoils the entire movie watching experience. Who the hell does even think of casting him in their movies. Even the girl who played the character of the rape victim acted very well compared to him. His acting is disgusting. Which spoils the thrill. You can enjoy the movie if you can ignore his awful acting, but the problem is, you won't be able to, since he plays the lead role.

		<shortDescription>Cliche's and cardboard characters "kill" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure John Grisham is a fine writer and I do think Joel Schumacher is a pretty good director but this script and direction just goes way over the top! Two rednecks (Who else?) rape and beat a ten year old girl and are arrested. As they head to the courtroom the next day the father of the girl shoots and kills both of them and accidently wounds a deputy in the process. The Klu Klux Klan get involved to make sure the black defendant is found guilty. Matthew McConaughey got his first big role in this film and he's actually pretty darn good but the film has so many familiar courtroom drama staples that its awash in cliche's. First, since its in the south it has to be boiling hot 24 hours a day. All the actors are drenched in sweat for the entire film. Even in the courtroom! I'm pretty sure in this day and age a courtroom in the south has air conditioning. In another point of the film Ashley Judd who is McConaughey's wife is sent away when the Klan starts making dangerous threats. This is obviously a ploy to get Judd out of the way so McConaughey and Sandra Bullock can have more screen time together and make eyes at one another. This film has just about everything thrown into the mix. A state DA who wants to make governor (Of course), the KKK threatening everyone, Local preachers who are trying to use the case to make money, Jurors who use the "N" word, and then they bring in the national guard when riots break out! While watching this film I asked myself if I could believe any of it. The answer is no. I did like a few things about the film. I like the fact that Bullock had a rather small supporting role. I think this is something she should think about doing more of. Take whatever role interests you no matter what the size. Samuel L. Jackson has a good scene with McConaughey in his cell when he tells him that he's different. Its probably the most thought provoking moment in the film. And McConaughey has two good scenes that help keep the film from being laughable. The first is with Bullock in a restaurant and Bullock tells him her aspirations of abolishing the death penalty nationally and she assumes he would agree. Well he doesn't. In fact he tells her the main problem with it is that it doesn't get used enough! The scene rings true and its almost a slap in the face for some viewers. The other scene is of course McConaughey giving his summation to the jury. Its a very strong scene and a well written one at that. Its not easy for a young actor like McConaughey to tackle something like it, but he's got some back-up from the writing. McConaughey shows his chops and proved to everyone that the risk in casting him was the right one. Aside from these moments, the rest of the film is just to over the top to be taken seriously.</fullReview>

Tempers flare, the KKK is reborn and people start getting hurt and dying. Expert witnesses turn out not to be so expert and the young lawyer's house is burned to the ground. The suspense is in high gear throughout, and the script is powerfully written. Matthew M., Sam Jackson, Keifer and Donald Sutherland and Sandra Bullock pull out all the stops.

		<shortDescription>Gripping and uncomfortable - thanks to Sutherland jnr</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another day, another John Grisham adaptation, this time with quite the illustrious ensemble cast ? Sandra Bullock, Samuel L Jackson, Kevin Spacey and Matthew McConaughey ably supported by Brenda Fricker, Charles S Dutton, Oliver Platt, Ashley Judd, Patrick McGoohan and Chris Cooper, as well as both Donald and Kiefer Sutherland. With Joel Schumacher sitting in the director's chair, a tale of racial tension in the deep south of the United States could prove more brash and inflammatory than anything which John Grisham might have intended. But Schumacher proves surprisingly adept at handling some sensitive material, producing a gripping and harrowing tale of racial hatred and injustice.Samuel L Jackson plays avenging father Carl Lee Hailey, who shoots dead two white men who raped his ten-year-old daughter on the way to their trial, fearing that justice will only be done if he takes it into his own hands. Now McConaughey's Jake Brigance (Hailey's attorney) must find a way to defend him against ruthless prosecutor Rufus Buckley (Kevin Spacey ? again excellent as an attorney after a superb performance as Clarence Darrow, but this time as a by any means necessary prosecutor rather than white knight defender). Meanwhile racial hatred is stirred up by the re-emergence of the Ku Klux Klan, led by Kiefer Sutherland's vicious portrayal of one of the murdered's brother. . As tension rises, viewing becomes more and more discomforting as some unfortunate truths are shown of everyday life in the deep south of the USA. What makes for an even more interesting story is the fact that there is some corruption and racial hatred on both sides of the colour divide. Faint shades of To Kill a Mockingbird are apparent from the outset, with many of the town expressing their opinion, and prejudices running riot, as well as the building up to the trial all the while the defending attorney being pressured and intimidated to withdraw ? only with a lot more hostility and violence, on both sides. The guilt of the defendant becomes somewhat irrelevant as the violence increases.However, Jake Brigance is no Atticus Finch, and Matthew McConaughey is certainly no Gregory Peck. He is rather dislikeable as the crusading lawyer trying to defend Jackson's avenging father. Jackson himself meanwhile gives an atypically very understated performance, eliciting neither too much sympathy or hatred ? he is just an ordinary man who did what he did for his daughter. Spacey is as usual excellent, but the film is stolen by Kiefer Sutherland's tremendously sinister performance as the bigoted, grief-stricken, borderline-psychotic redneck who revives the Ku Klux Klan in the area in response to his brother's killing. He is a truly hateable avenger and in this film he truly steps out of his illustrious father's shadow.As the action continually shifts from the courtroom to the town and backwater houses, the tension continues to build. Carl Lee Hailey did kill the two men who raped and tried to murder his daughter, of that there is no question. What the story asks is not what constitutes justifiable killing, but what could drive a man to such an action? Similar to films such as Mississippi's Burning and To Kill a Mockingbird, A Time To Kill's theme of racial tension and hatred proves that man has a long way to go before he is truly enlightened, but that while there are men who are willing to disregard and even fight against injustice, there is still reason for optimism and hope.While the film does become quite harrowing and even uncomfortable to view in places, it is still a tale you cannot take your eyes off, and Joel Schumacher has done well to not go over-the-top as he is prone to do in many of his films, but rather lets the subject matter tell its own story. While not all the performances may be Oscar-worthy, the story more than makes up for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great and powerful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never have been a too big fan of movies based on John Grisham novels, since they are quite boring within its genre but I've always liked this movie, though in all honesty the movie really starts loosing some of its power on repeated viewing.The movie has a real inspiring and powerful story. focusing on moral dilemmas, racial issues and the legal system, when a black man shoots and kills two racist white men who had just raped and attempted to kills his 10-year old daughter. It makes this also a real original movie to watch within its genre; the courtroom-drama. The movie mixes its 3 main themes; racial issues, moral dilemmas and the legal system, really well and effectively. It might sound like a messy movie and as a movie that is trying to preach but it in fact is a really well constructed and balanced movie, that is skillfully being directed by Joel Schumacher, as weird as that might sound, considering that he mostly makes some really below par movies. Even his best movies are mostly lacking in more than one way. This movie can perhaps be regarded as his least lacking and simply best movie. Fair is fair, he simply did a good job with this movie.When I first saw this movie it made quite an impression on me, due to its great story about justice. The movie angered me, the movie moved me and it simply grabbed me all throughout. The movie makes its point and is showing the less pretty side of the legal system and the treatment of Afro-American people within it and the treatment of those people in the south of America in general.Samuel L. Jackon has picked several roles like this throughout his career; a black man against society and the system. He seems like a person to me who is always making a big point out of racial issues and the treatment and acceptance of Afro-Americans in America in particular. In all honesty, it often more annoys me than that I find it something admirable and it just doesn't always work out that well and effectively within a movie. This particular movie forms an exception to this though and like I said before it's a movie that makes its point well, by often exaggerating and generalizing things of course but it nevertheless comes across well and powerful.Yes, some things come across as being quite over-the-top and not exactly as anything too believable and I do feel that the movie is overdoing it a bit at times but the movie is just never going too far with it and it knows to maintain a good balance between the strong realistic aspects and the more 'Hollywood' like aspects and themes of the movie.You also really have to give movie credit for its cast. You have to remember that this movie got made back in 1996, when very few people had an idea who actors such as Matthew McConaughey, Kevin Spacey, Chris Cooper and Kiefer Sutherland all were. Besides that, the movie also features some already well established names such as Samuel L. Jackson, Oliver Platt, Donald Sutherland and Patrick McGoohan in one of his last big movie roles. I say last, not because he's death, he's very much alive still but he rarely stars in any movies, pretty much like he has done throughout his entire career. Seems like he is just more an actor who enjoys working on the stage.Simply a great and effective movie within its genre, although it's already starting to loose some of its power, 12 years later. So it will most likely not become a classic in 30 years from now.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The racial tension in a small country town is ignited when Carl Lee Hailey (Samuel L. Jackson), a black man, shoots two white men dead as a retaliation to prejudice inflicted on his daughter. The perspective on right and wrong is a main theme throughout the film and questions every character's outlooks and morals, even among the "good guys". Or more to the point, whether there is, or is not, in fact, a time to kill.Not only does it ask this to the characters in the film, but it asks it to you, the viewer. It makes you ask yourself where you stand. The film raises many important issues in society, and not just among racism, but justice for that matter, and what is right and wrong, both morally and ethically. Of course though, even with all this said, the film is not unbiased. Working off the basis of most movies, there is a definitive "good" and "bad" and you know who you're cheering on and who you're not, or at least, who the writer's are and are not. Sometimes this can come across as a little simple-minded, maybe even arrogant, but the film tries its hardest to bring a point from every side. Opinions still rage among characters who are meant to be working with each other, showing the different thought process of individuals.Many see this film as heavily biased, but I can guarantee there are many respectable points brought forward by all the characters, even the "bad guys", that will challenge everyone. The white aren't all just black hating hicks and the black aren't all just innocent victims of racism who never inflict any themselves.Moving away from the social aspect of this film, A Time to Kill offers much in the way of acting and writing. Although I usually find Matthew McConaughey uninspiring, his performance as Jake is the best I've ever seen him hold. Jackson is superb and refreshing in a much different role than that of what he seems to be playing recently. Alongside these great performances is Sandra Bullock as aspiring lawyer, Ellen Roark, and Kevin Spacey as "big bad wolf" District Attorney Rufus Buckley. A Time to Kill is a work that evidences the best all these actors have to offer, or at least, did have to offer once upon a time. It shows of a better time before such actors fell into forgettable flicks such as "Fool's Gold" and "21".At the end of it all, A Time to Kill is going to conflict with many viewer's personal opinions. Not everyone is going to agree with it's outtake on what is good and bad. But you can at least give it credit for daring to raise the question and making you decide where you stand. This coupled with top-notch acting makes A Time to Kill well worth the watch.Hamish Kearvell A.K.A Screaming Japan Productions - www.myspace.com/screamignjapanproductions</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie would have you believe Mississippi is still a place where the Klan riots, knifes, and snipers people in broad daylight without charges being brought against them. Idealistic, liberal students from the North volunteer their efforts while the National Guard moves in to restore order. The result is anachronistic at best while attempting to achieve high drama.Having lived many years in New Orleans, I have enjoyed most of John Grisham's movies (e.g. Runaway Jury, Pelican Brief) this one seemed however to fall short in an unexpected way.In the end, the movie is as guilty of exploitation of the oppressed (in the name of drama and profits) as those it seeks to condemn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the acting was superb, and the filming was beautiful, I don't understand why this was about a black man unable to get a fair trial in Mississippi in the 90s - I mean, the guy did it! An 'unfair trial' is one where the innocent are condemned or the guilty go free - the defendant was a vigilante, for crying out loud. A better case could be made if the 2 rapists were on trial - *then* that is about race, justice and the South. But this? I just don't get it, and having viewed it during George W. Bush's tenure - where we have a president who is a 'decider' instead of a 'decision-maker', and where we are seemingly supposed to follow our hearts/basest instincts, 'bring it on', for example, rather than use our brains to think - I was appalled by the summation where the jurors were requested to decide based on emotion rather than rule of law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great flick even with some of the stereotypes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie the other day because I just saw "Sahara" and was reminded of how good M.McC. was in "A Time to Kill." He really is great in this movie. My husband has this theory that most actors and actresses are really just playing themselves in most films, that no matter how well they play themselves, it's really not much of a stretch. But if the stuff we read and see of McC. in real life is at all accurate then pretty as he is, he really is a great actor.I'd also forgotten what a great cast this was: Keifer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland, Charles Dutton, Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Cooper, Oliver Platt. I don't give Sandra Bullock very high marks for this one though. I mean I like her, but I think she falls under the rubric of my husband's theory and sometimes that works for me and sometimes that doesn't. Part of the reason I didn't like her character was the holier than thou way she preached to Jake about the death penalty and his southern sensibilities - I mean how do you get up on a soap box about watching murderers die for their crimes (apparently her character had witnessed two executions) when you know that at the heart of the issue in this movie is a 10 year old little girl who was viciously raped and would have been successfully hung if her attackers had not been drunk. Bullock's speech seems further out of place when you consider that she's against the executions while arguing for the acquittal of a man who, well, um, EXECUTED two men.Okay - so I didn't like that scene. Scenes I did like and highly recommend you look out for are the court room scene when Kevin Spacey puts Chris Cooper's character on the stand. I won't spoil anything for you, but I will say I wasn't sure whether CC was a good guy or bad guy in this movie (he plays both so well) until this scene.Of course Jake's closing statements in the trial are amazing. Truly gut wrenching and provocative. And it doesn't hurt that the courtroom scene here evokes "To Kill a Mockingbird" with it's hardwood floors, wooden benches, and packed seats and balcony.I also really like the light hearted moment with Oliver Platt and Matthew McC. teasing McC. secretary about whether she had an affair with McC.'s former boss, Lucien Wilkes.Can't say I like Ashley Judd much here - though again, I usually do like her (she's very good in Simon Birch). She's not as pretty as a blonde and she just wasn't very believable. Also, while I love the whole idea of the steamy south, some of the scenes with Judd and McC. and their humidity clad bare skin were a bit much. The film takes place in 1996 - they have a/c down south, ya'll.Overall, despite stereotypes, the movie is very good and very worth renting and watching a couple times for the great acting and the atmosphere if you have a thing for the south like I do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Love this movie! Explores the theme of prejudice really well. It is a really fast-paced thriller. Most movies on prejudice are rather boring and dreary, but not this one! It is really interesting. It shows whites lending a hand to the blacks and also stepping in their shoes (as shown in the summation)and to see many people being moved by the summation speech. It is also rather moving to see how Jake sacrifices many things in his life to help fight the case for Carl Lee. This movie also teaches us things like putting ourselves in others' shoes and to not divide and stereotype people based on colour. I think that this show is really worth watching as it teaches us an important theme - of prejudice and it is rather interesting as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hamfisted and disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somehow I missed this movie when it was released, and I rented it recently from an online DVD store without knowing how old it was. I quickly surmised that it was mid 90's, but what I was startled at right from the outset was how incredibly DATED it seemed: the attitudes portrayed, the liberal guilt, and its attempted resolution through the courtroom heroics of the protagonist. This might have been a groundbreaking film a couple of decades earlier, but I guess the producers didn't notice we already have 'To Kill a Mockingbird', 'Twelve Angry Men' and umpteen other such things. Then it hit me, why all this incredibly old-fashioned moralising... but I'll get to that in a minute.This alone may not have sunk the film, but lo, the movie suffers from the attack of every screen writing cliché in Hollywood. I mean, it's so predictable that I was actually able to hold my left hand in the air and let it fall at the exact moment that Matthew McConaughey's supposedly dead dog runs out of the bushes. Add to that the utter over-the-topness of it. We've got the Klux Klux Klan marching down the road outside the court in broad daylight for Heaven's sake, and the National Guard running about going 'Hut! Hut! Hut!', and armoured vehicles - in one scene the army has machine guns trained on the (completely inert) crowd outside the court. Heaven forbid they should just cordon off the area if they were expecting trouble. I'm sorry, but I actually laughed at a couple of these moments.We've got a bunch of fine actors, almost none of whom are given anything to act with. Good evidence of this is that Kiefer Sutherland was in a movie with both his father and Kevin Spacey, and managed not to look conspicuously inferior. I don't think this was due to any great effort on KS's part. More that his character was about as one-dimensional as theirs.I could have fun just listing the absurdities in this movie. Oh, and the plot-holes. Part of the reason we're supposed to accept that the revenge killing was justifiable in this case, is that one of the perps had signed a confession. If this was so, why was everybody expecting him to walk free the day he went into court? And did Morgan Freeman's character _know_ about this confession (this is the defense of the revenge killing; that the killer absolutely _knows_ the accused to be guilty.) And oh, yes, it just slipped the defense team's attention that their star psychiatrist was a convicted statutory rapist? Good God.Now, if all of that isn't bad enough, we have the fact that the film is actually pretty offensive. We're supposed to come away from this feeling that this vigilante revenge killing was justified; either that or presumably get in our pickup with the Union flag on it and drive off swigging a bottle of Jack Daniels. Well, pardon me: I'm opposed to the death penalty, AND I would probably have done the same thing Freeman's characer did, like most guys would in that situation when they're half out of their minds, but this film did not convince me that I would have been right in so doing, and I don't like having my intelligence insulted by the supposition that I can't work it out for myself.McConaughey tells the jury to imagine that the rape victim was white. The prosecuting attorney might have been given the opportunity to ask them to imagine if the two men Freeman shot had turned out to be innocent. Because ultimately that's what's on trial here: not this specific case, but the whole notion of the death penalty, whether dispensed by the courts or by a vigilante.Oh yeah. The Magistrate is Judge Noose. That has to be either one of the worst attempts at humour in history, or the worst attempt at symbolism in history. I forgot about that.Anyway, earlier I said I was baffled by why the film seemed so dated, so concerned with the race issue. Why Freeman's character could say something as dumb to his lawyer on the last day of the trial as "America is a war. You're on the other side." Then I remembered, this was only a few years after the Rodney King bashing and the LA riots. A film very much of its time, but that doesn't excuse how terribly ham-fisted and clichéd it is.I'm giving it 5 simply because the production values were decent, the actors did what they could with a bad script, and there were actually two or three decent scenes (Bullock and McConaughey in the café arguing over the death penalty was one of the film's few good moments). But 5 is my bare minimum for a big budget modern movie simply going through the motions. This has nothing to lift it any higher, and I'm probably being a bit kind to it.I suppose I should add that I live on an island halfway to Antarctica, so don't really have any overwhelming racial or political investment in the subject matter. It was just a stupid film. It would have been stupid if it had presented the opposite point of view as ineptly.I find this movie guilty of being ridiculous, obnoxious, predictable, and occasionally funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a rent, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. And in some ways, I did. The steamy atmosphere of the cloistering town is set well. While not an amazing cast ensemble by any means, it still is quite good. There is a lot of acting talent in this film. Matthew McConaughey's end speech was by far his best moment ever on screen and definitely a standout performance in a larger context. He does that rare thing that the great actors must be able to do - as his character had to do to convince the jury to acquit Carl - he made the audience fully believe in his performance and the reality of the story that he had to tell.In some ways this movie is on par with, say, Mississippi Burning (one of the greatest civil rights movies to come to the big screen) as far as great dialogue goes.That being said, the reason why this movie is not at the level of (for example) Mississippi Burning is that it is almost completely fictional. The reason that civil rights movies are important in and of themselves is that they tell a real story - they give us a piece of our national history that actually happened. They are both a picture and a painting. Reality, incredulity, knowledge, empathy, sorrow, acceptance, and learning are the reasons why the Civil Rights movement interests people and why we watch movies about it. This movie was complete fiction. Without the base in reality, it loses its credibility as a civil rights movie and does not inspire a great deal of passion.As a legal thriller, it is somewhat cliche (lawyers power-swinging like baseball players at witnesses, opening statements, summations, and discovery) but the performances turned in by Kevin Spacey and Samuel L Jackson in the courthouse are stirring and firey in parts.After everything is said and done, I probably won't be buying it for my own DVD collection, but if you're thinking about renting it or can watch it for free, go for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Time To Kill" was a beautiful movie about the love a father has for his only daughter. Samuel L. Jackson, always an incomparable actor, plays Carl Lee Hailey with the passion that he puts into every role. As a father himself with a daughter, I think that Sam Jackson plays his role as Carl Lee so fervently because he's acting out on what he would do if something ever happened to his little girl. The performances are outstanding - Sandra Bullock, Ashley Judd and Matthew McConaughey are wonderful as always. This was the first R-rated movie I ever saw, and my father went with me. I don't think we could have picked a better show to have gone to see. Do yourself a favor and watch "A Time To Kill." Tell them that I sent you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best lawyer films ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Time To Kill seemed to me like a movie that would bore me out of my mind and it would probably get a five or lower star from me. Happily, the movie turned out to be a powerful, top-notch, entertaining, and truthful thriller. You can hardly expect that from Hollywood films nowadays and that is a shame because they don't make classics any more, The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption, and I am sure that everyone would disagree with me when I say that Avatar is nothing compared to the 1900s films. A film with such a boring story turned out to be a film that would be remembered forever and that is all thanks to Joel Schumacher and his crew. Joel Schumacher has directed entertaining films such as The Lost Boys, Flatliners, The Client, The Number 23, and Phone Booth and A Time To Kill ascended up my ladder faster than a cheetah could kill a cockroach. What a great director! Matthew McConaughey (Jake Brigance), the lawyer in this film who defends a black man, has given everyone his best performance to audiences everywhere and he truly looked like he had gotten into his part. Sandra Bullock plays the witty and sExy gal named Ellen Roark (Ro-Ark) who thinks that the death penalty should be used also offers help to defend the black man. Kevin Spacey looked good on screen and his villain-kind-of-role made me hate him. The real star of the show was Samuel L. Jackson! He portrayed a man whose daughter had been raped by two men and out of anger, he kills them, only to land in a battle between right and wrong. Samuel L. Jackson really looked like he was settled into his role and he, by far, gave the best performance in the film. The film is emotional at times but the end was more emotional than ever because it had tears in my eyes.(May contain some spoilers!!!!) In Canton, Mississippi, 10-year-old Tonya Hailey is viciously brutalized by two white racist rednecks -- James Louis "Pete" Willard and Billy Ray Cobb. Almost immediately after Tonya is found and rushed to a hospital, Pete and Billy Ray are found at a roadside bar, where they had been bragging about what they did to Tonya. Tonya's understandably distraught and enraged father, Carl Lee Hailey, remembers a case from a year ago, when four white men raped an African-American girl in a nearby town, and got acquitted. Carl is determined to not let that happen in this case. While deputy Dwayne Powell Looney is escorting Pete and Billy Ray up a flight of stairs to a court room, Carl emerges from the building's basement with an assault rifle, and he kills Pete and Billy Ray for what they did to Tonya. Carl is later arrested at his house by African-American sheriff Ozzie Walls, and Carl is scheduled to be placed on trial. Despite the efforts of the NAACP and local African-American leaders to persuade Carl to choose some of their high-powered attorneys, Carl wants to be represented by his friend Jake Tyler Brigance, who has a wife named Carla and a daughter named Hannah. Presiding over the trial is white judge Omar Noose, and the prosecution attorney is Rufus Buckley, who would like nothing more than to win the case and swim in the publicity that a win would generate, because Rufus realizes that a murder conviction could help him gain higher office. Helping Jake on the case are his former law professor Lucien Wilbanks, fellow attorney Harry Rex Vonner, and law student Ellen Roark. Ellen has had experience with death penalty cases, and that's exactly what Rufus may be seeking. To start things off, Noose denies bail and denies Jake's petition for a change of venue. Carl has also been fired from his job. Billy Ray Cobb's brother Freddie Lee Cobb wants revenge on Carl, so Freddy gets the help of the Mississippi branch of the KKK, led by Mississippi grand dragon Stump Sisson. Carl's wife Gwen tells Carl that a doctor has said that because of Pete and Billy Ray, Tonya's reproductive organs are damaged enough to where she won't be able to have kids when she grows up. That night, a KKK member is found trying to plant a bomb under Jake's porch. Jake's secretary Ethel Twitty and her husband Bud are also attacked by the KKK. Still, Jake, Harry, Lucien, and Ellen continue to help Carl. On the day the trial begins, there is a riot outside the court building between the KKK and the area's African-American residents, and Stump Sisson is killed by a molotov cocktail that was dropped from a roof by one of Carl's sons, who was not seen dropping it. Freddy and the KKK start burning crosses throughout Canton, and one of the crosses burns Jake's house down while Jake and his family are not home. As a result, the National Guard is called to Canton to keep the peace during the trial. But Freddy is not about to let that stop him. While Freddy continues his efforts to get revenge on Carl for Billy Ray's death, Carl's attorneys put everything they've got into Carl's defense. (End of Spoilers!!!!)The great thing about this film is that it doesn't hide the coarse language, not at all. Throughout the whole film you will hear the word f*ck, semen, raped, and a lot other more but these words are the most vile. The setting was great as well for a film like this since racism was still at large and it made the film look good. The Ku Klux Klan were a bunch of weirdos that wore masks and hated black people. They were unnecessary in my eyes. Donald And Kiefer Sutherland, father and son in real life, were similar and acted similar and even looked similar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resolves effectively to the degree that Hollywood crowd-pleasers do. Though there are many touches that shade the film with definition, such as our smidgen of sympathy for the mother of the two racist hillbilly rapists, who we despise to no end; the passionate political disagreements between McConaughey's character and Bullock's character and our equal investment in them despite which one we personally agree with; the turning point of the story, Jackson's character acquiring an M-16 rifle and going to the county courthouse and opening fire on both of his daughter's rapists and unintentionally injuring the Sheriff's Deputy with a ricochet, creating a thinner line between right and wrong for the audience to weigh. What's wiser is how Jackson, who gives the best performance of the entire cast, does not resist when he is subsequently arrested; the jury secretly discussing Jackson's case, and his fate looks sealed.Sometimes, message movies are a little overbearing not because I "don't want to pay money to have a message shoved down my throat" but because often message movies are constructed for the cause of a message that is already heeded by the masses. A Time To Kill, for example, is a movie about the justification in Jackson's murder of his daughter's rapists and the right elements to integrating white and black people into a peaceful environment to share. These are things most people already understand. However, A Time to Kill is not necessarily preaching to the converted. It's more of a story that fills the audience with passionate feelings ignited when characters do the right thing and the wrong thing, both of which Grisham and Schumacher already aware of how the audience will react. That's why one leaves this film feeling good.There is however a bit of body fat to the film: McConaughey's attraction to Bullock grows, and nearly begins an affair before he gains his wits and goes home. Though I will admit Bullock is exceptionally sexy in this film, can American movies ever let a male and female just be friends and colleagues? It does happen, you know. But, this is tolerable when Kevin Spacey is vastly entertaining, basically playing himself as the swaggeringly theatrical prosecutor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie because of Kevin Spacey and Donald Sutherland and in the end got disappointed. The two actors are of course great, but Sandra Bullock hops too often through the picture, being dressed temptingly, being smart and being everything else she needs to pretend to be. I don't talk about Matthew McConaughey, he is as slimy as always and they unfortunately gave him the main role in this movie. OK, I could not avoid talking about him.It is OK to construct a tight story, but Grisham goes to far here. He needs to transport just another moral lecture and spoils it all. So there is this black guy who murdered the rapers of his daughter and he finally gets free because everybody feels pity for him and (that's Grishams stupid trick) the only other alternative would be the death penalty.So we should let all murders of criminals roam free? What signal is that? At what point can somebody left free, which deed is cruel enough to justify a private murder? Ah, nonsense. And then Matthew in the end in front of the jury, all in tears about the story he thought up last night. Spacey is the only one who makes an impression on this movie - so please watch American Beauty or The Usual Suspects again and see him in a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor adaptation of a great novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read John Grisham's novel "A Time To Kill and having thoroughly enjoyed it, I was enthusiastically looking forward to viewing the movie adaptation of this movie. Perhaps I shouldn't have had high expectations because not only does it lack the depth and quality of the novel -which is perhaps understandable-but the choice of casting leads a lot to be wanted.To give credit where its due, Matthew McConaughey is great as Jake Brigance (even though the character in the novel is much more jaded and multi-dimensional than the movie version). And Samuel L Jackson does a great job as Carl Lee Hailey. And Brenda Fricker and Kevin Spacey are both goodBut somehow Ashley Judd, great actress though she is, is miscast for the role of Carla Brigance. Perhaps this is not entirely her fault because the character of Carla Brigance is not treated well in this movie and lacks the character development or the liveliness that characterizes her in the novel. And Sandra Bullock as Ellen Roark -what were they thinking? Bullock ultimately succeeds in transforming a very intelligent, genial and pleasant character into an obnoxious, shallow and vacuous character who left me cold and unsympathetic toward her -even during the climax of her character's role. Gone is a lot of the witty dialogue and humorous banter that characterized the Grisham novel. Lucien's character, although good, doesn't have much of the appeal that is such a strength in the book and the same goes for Harry Rex Vonner. And the issues and perspectives are not really examined in the depth that they should be in the movie -even given that a movie adaptation of a book can't go into the same depth, this one is sadly lacking.All in all I would advise people to read the novel and give the movie a miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film came out with a fair amount of publicity - Joel Schumacher at the helm, John Grisham's novel the source material. Matthew MacConaughey was touted as the new Marlon Brando / Paul Newman (depending on your point of view) but he didn't have the presence or talent of either of those old pros.The story is one of racial hatred set in Mississippi, where the Ku Klux Klan still rage war on the black population, and where Samuel L Jackson's little daughter is raped and killed, causing his to shoot the accused white trash at the start of the film. The remainder of the film is pretty much taken up with his trial for murder and the issues around it.Given that this empty film is implying that it is OK to take matters into your own hands (oh, and that all white men of a certain type and class are yobs, rednecks, and not fit to live), it doesn't have much more of a plot. Sandra Bullock is in there somewhere, mainly draping herself all over MacConaughey as the fans whirr in the hot afternoons. Kiefer Sutherland plays a nutty Klan member (a couple more roles like this would make his star wane considerably in movies thereafter), and his dad Donald makes an appearance as well.'A Time to Kill' is half-baked, unpalatable and not particularly good. The 'twist' at the end is manipulative and unconvincing, and the film really feels like a long-drawn out missed opportunity. There's an interesting idea out there about vengeance, family destruction, and prejudice - but this movie isn't it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An almost perfect movie with a bit fairy tale ending (the only thing on the down side...)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked it and I liked it very much.I feel that this movie has been greatly underrated at IMDb which may be partly attributed to its a bit fairy tale ending. But otherwise the movie is simply awesome. Fabulous performances by some well known names but at a time when they were still fresh on the circuit.The performances by Sandra Bullock, Matthew McConaughey and Samuel L.Jackson has been absolutely amazing.Not to forget the performance of Kevin Spacey, who is brilliant like always. The methodology adopted by Matthew (at the end) seemed (to me) to be the only one that could help his cause but yeh, I do feel the outcome was a bit unrealistic to some extent but that's not for us to debate.It's a movie after all.The spirit in which the movie has been made, the way it deals with issue that it deals with, is what I liked immensely. There certainly gotta be no place for discrimination between two humans. Must watch if you enjoy watching something matter.Looking forward to reading the novel though..!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the best book I have ever read was John Grisham's first (and absolute best) novel, A Time to Kill. This is not to say, it went soaring downhill after his debut book, but eventually I had to stop reading after probably a dozen or so.Despite this was his first effort, it was the fourth movie to hit the theaters. I'm sorry it took so long, because of all of Grisham's movie adaptations, this was by far the best.It doesn't hurt at all, it's contains an incredible cast, including two of my favorite actors of all time: Kevin Spacey and Samuel L. Jackson. Also, I love both Donald &amp; Kiefer Sutherland, Sandra Bullock, Charles S. Dutton?I could just reprint the entire cast. Much like A Few Good Men, one of my all time favorite movies and courtroom dramas, both contain a stellar list of credits.Also, it contains great drama, suspense, dialogue, humor and is a major tear-jerker. If you don't get choked up (or filled with anger) with what happened that little girl (see below) then I can't imagine what would stir emotions within you.Little (and normally I wouldn't point out her race out if not so relevant here) black Tanya (Kelly) is walking home to her family while her father, Carl Lee (Jackson) is hard at work, supporting his family. She's picked up (kidnapped) by the main definition of racist rednecks and raped, beaten, urinated on, tossed, hung and damaged beyond repair.Due to other cases that allowed these kinds of evils to either have reduced sentences or actually freed, Carl Lee takes it into his own hands to slaughter the two bad men in front of pretty much the whole town while they are about to enter their trial. Of course, now Carl Lee's imprisoned and it's up to Jake (McConaughey) to take the case of a lifetime for a mere $900.Add in the KKK causing havoc to those on Carl Lee's side and Jake's failing business, Jake has a lot going on. People get shot, terrorized and a lot of fires set. Jake also has to prove he was legally insane when everyone knows he wasn't and Carl Lee is happy to say otherwise, publicly. This would be the ideal case for Governor-to-be D.A. Rufus (Spacey) if not for the emotional side of the case, or?"What would you do if this happened to your daughter?" This leads to my favorite quote of the movie: "If you win this case, justice will prevail, and if you lose, justice will also prevail." I love courtroom movies and books, and the ones I like best are fictional stories involving decisions just like this one. And this one dives you so deep into the Southern town they live in, and in the jury's mind, it's practically impossible for you not to put yourself in the jury's shoes.I have left out a lot of what happens during the movie, as there are a lot of interesting and suspenseful, not to mention comical scenes, but this is a MUST SEE. I have read the book twice (I'm a slow reader and it is quite large ? or small print, many pages, so it's not likely, I'll read it again soon) and even though some things were changed, they pretty much nailed the book down. This has to rank as #2 best courtroom movie I've seen (behind A Few Good Men). Also, read the book for more extreme depth into the fantastic character of Jake Brigance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A Time to Kill" is really about...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Time to Kill" was not about the trial of a man who committed a murder, but was an exploration into the blinkered society we may live in. Of course the African American Carl Lee (Samuel L Jackson) killed the two rapists of his ten year old daughter, and naturally he was guilty of that, and you would think that as we are watching a courtroom film about whether he was guilty or not, that he would have no chance of being acquitted?but that's just it, it's not a film about whether he is guilty, and so people should stop judging it on basis that it ignores the facts. The best way to make a courtroom drama dramatic is to heap as much evidence up against the defendant that the viewer is rooting for, and that's all they done here (to the maximum).The vigilante murder by the grieving father was just a catalyst and the courtroom was just the setting. They were just tools used to drive the message of the film, which is pretty much summed up in lawyer Jake Brigance's (Matthew McConaughey) final speech when he says, "now imagine the girl is white". The film, like some reviewers seem to be saying, is not implying that the white jury are inherently racist against black people and that they'd be more horrified by a white girl being raped than a black girl. What it's saying is that the jury would maybe sympathise or relate (and I use these terms loosely) to it happening to a white girl as they would be able to picture it more as if it were their own daughter who had been violated, rather than a poor black girl of a crazy (enter racial slur here___).To support this, Carl's little pre-judgement day talk to Brigance lies at the heart of this final speech when Carl tells Brigance in his prison cell that through no fault of anybodies, they have been divided as white and black, that they are from different neighbourhoods and that their kids won't ever play together. In a sense this would have been true, especially if you take into account the time the film was supposed to be it set. The whole point was explicitly verbalised to the viewer when Carl asks Brigance to make the jury see through his eyes, or in a more literal sense befitting the film, through his heart and that's what he did. Don't rip this film apart for being illogical to facts or irresponsible, because it is obviously not claiming to be. Having said that, we shouldn't forget that in his final speech, Brigance did tell the jury that the psych doctor (who gave evidence in support of Carl) who was charged with statutory rape in his past, had actually been innocent as the girl was 17, on top of which he married her and had kids with her. This would make him not a felon and his statement that Carl was insane at the time he committed the murder entirely credible. So who knows, maybe the jury agreed Carl was insane and acquitted him based on that alone. In any case, it is made clear that this is an emotional drama that seeks a truth that sometimes real logical justice does not provide. It deals with heavy subject matter such as racism because racism hurts people emotionally and so is a perfect way or pulling the audience in, and if it's done its job then you should have shed a few tears (or more) at the conclusion of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I guess some people think that the movie condones murder, and it a way I guess it does...but it is still one of the best movies Matthew McConaughey has ever done. I was reading some of the trivia for the movie. I don't think I could see him playing the role Keifer Sutherland played. I guess Matthew McConaughey has played too many good roles to play a bad guy now. I guess if you take into account the star studded cast, there really isn't any way this movie could be bad. Sandra Bullock, Matthew McConaughey, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Spacey, Donald Sutherland, and Samuel L. Jackson...all you have to do is look at the cast list and know that it is a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Stunning Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the good fortune to see A Time to Kill in the theater when it came out in 1996. Like many other women who saw the film, I instantly fell deeply in love with Matthew McConaughy. His performance is so heartfelt and breathtaking, he should have gotten an Oscar nod. He did get noticed, though. People had a cover saying, "Where did this guy come from?" Equally high=caliber is Samuel L. Jackson's performance as a father whose little girl has been brutally raped by two rednecks. The rest of the cast is very good. Sandra Bullock is, as always, a breath of fresh air. She and McConaughy have a lot of chemistry on screen. Ashley Judd is good as McConaughy's spoiled, sorority queen wife. The story is not for the fainthearted. A Time to Kill is not a light-hearted movie. It is serious, rich, and deeply moving. I challenge you not to cry. Race relations and personal convictions are put to the test when Jackson murders his daughter's accused attackers before they even go to trial. A scene where the Ku Klux Klan clash with black residents immobilized me with it's intensity. One of the best movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don;t miss the point of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly excellent film that tells a difficult story. Samuel L Jackson, Sandra Bullock and Matthew McConaughey and in fact everyone in this film does an excellent and very believable job. However I think many miss the main point of this film, although it deals with sickening acts motivated by racism and the subsequent actions of those in authority who seem to believe that blacks should not be treated as well as whites, the main point that comes through in the end is that it really shouldn't matter what colour you are. We are all just people and the little girl was a little girl regardless of colour. It shows how ingrained racism can be and it it a sober thought that despite America electing it's first black president the people who have these feelings won't go away over night. There are few films that can get to me and this one certainly did. I have watched it many times and each time it gets to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great and troubling movie that I have certain issues with...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A TIME TO KILL is no doubt a very entertaining movie, with a first-rate A list cast, great characters, and of course, hot topics for debate.The issues I have with it are issues I've always had with it, even when I was younger and really into these A-LIST kind of movies.My biggest issue: Carl Lee Hailey. Samuel L. Jackson did a supreme performance and he is one of the greatest actors ever...ever. But I have problems with his character. Believe me, I hate rapists. I hate white supremacist rednecks too. I hate crimes against children and women. Indeed, those 2 pieces of filth might just have gotten off with a slap on the wrist for their deplorable crime. They should have been called murderers anyway, because they not only tried to kill Tanya, they killed her unborn children, or what would have been. To call them animals would insult animals. They were just plain pieces of filth.The reason I have a problem with Carl Lee is that the killings of those pieces of filth were all about him, not his daughter. He should have stopped to think: My daughter has been raped, and she's going to need me at HOME not sitting in some jail with the chance of death row. I know I'm going to get flack for this, but Carl Lee didn't consider his daughter before himself. He just acted on his rage. Sure those pieces of filth deserved to die, and to burn in hell, but Carl Lee was thinking more of himself than his child. That's just the way I feel about it. Instead of seeing Tanya as in individual who needed his love and support while she recovered from horrible physical and psychological injuries, Carl Lee did what I believe a lot of people do, he saw her as something of HIS. HIS daughter. "You raped MY baby!" I'm not questioning that Carl Lee loves his child, but does he see her as a person, or just an extention of HIM? Did killing those 2 redneck rapists reverse the damage done to Tanya? No, they only caused more pain."Say that when you lose a child of your own!" you say, but see? There you go. A child of my OWN. Not an individual, but something of MINE. If I take the time to think about what is really going to be best for the child, I won't be killing 2 rednecks who aren't worth the heartache that will follow. Those 2 monsters weren't worth Tanya nearly losing her father to the gas chamber, nor the death of Bud, nor Jake's house being burnt down and his family terrorized, nor Ro-Ark nearly being murdered.At times, I want to believe this film has a lot of one dimensional characters, such as the ones played by Keifer Sutherland and Nicky Katt. Are there really such repugnant people in this world? Are people so hateful of blacks that they are like these 2? Unfortunately, though much progress has been made since the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement, many white people in the American South still believe in segregation, supremacy, and probably slavery if they could bring it back. They believe blacks are inferior and just "don't count". Some of the rednecks in the courtroom have looks on their faces like, "So what if she was raped. She was black!" And yet they want blood because 2 of their good ol' white boys were shot. It's absolutely astounding.The entire cast is terrific from Donald Sutherland as an old lush who used to be an excellent lawyer, to Charles Dutton as the town sheriff, to newcomer (then anyway) Matthew McConnaughey (sp?) as Jake Brigance, a young, inexperienced lawyer who takes on the impossible task of defending Carl Lee, but whose reasonings I have a problem with just like I have with Carl Lee's. McConnaughey's performance always has me in tears by the end of the movie.Carl Lee Hailey? Not a murderer. A hero? Perhaps, though I believe Tanya is the bigger hero in this film, the one to look to for real inspiration.Am I glad Carl Lee shot those 2 pieces of filth? I'd be lying if I said no, or that I wasn't glad to see them get sprayed with bullets.Was it the best thing to do? Another thing to ponder altogther That might be what makes it such a good movie to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Time to Kill!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Time to Kill is a great movie with one of the biggest castings ever in My opinion and it includes Matthew McConaughey, Sandra Bullock, Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey, Oliver Platt, Charles Dutton, Brenda Fricker, Donald Sutherland, Kiefer Sutherland, Patrick McGoohan, Ashley Judd, John Diehl, Chris Cooper, Kurtwood Smith, and M. Emmet Walsh! The acting by all of these actors are very good. There are many great scenes in the film and all of the scenes are filmed really well! Some of the scenes I like are when the KKK make their appearances and those are really excellent scenes! When the KKK are marching in the street and battling is something else and it was filmed remarkably well! The music by Elliot Goldenthal is good. Really this is a fantastic film and in My opinion the actors and actresses have some of their greatest performances in this film! If you like any of the actors and actresses I mentioned above and if you like the movie To Kill a Mockingbird (that stars Gregory Peck) then I strongly recommend A Time to Kill!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting can't save ugly film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of you may remember how John Grisham lent support to the people suing NATURAL BORN KILLERS, calling it accountable for violence. I happen to hate that movie and like Grisham, but after seeing A TIME TO KILL, this is definitely a case of the pot calling the kettle black. Before I get to why, I should remember those who manage to stand out in this mess; Sandra Bullock(as the law student), Samuel L. Jackson(as the defendant), Kevin Spacey(as the prosecutor), and Donald Sutherland(as the former lawyer) are all terrific, giving this movie a gravity it doesn't deserve. The scene between Jackson and Spacey is the one time the film truly comes alive. And while McConaughey is ultimately defeated by the plot, he does prove he's for real.Okay, now to cases. THE CLIENT, which was Schumacher's previous adaptation of a Grisham novel, was probably the best Grisham film of all(though THE FIRM is quite good in its own way), and yet everything he did right there, he does wrong here. This proposes to tackle tougher questions(racism, whether vigilante justice is ever justifiable), but Schumacher and writer Akiva Goldsman(with this and writing or co-writing SILENT FALL, BATMAN FOREVER, BATMAN AND ROBIN, LOST IN SPACE, and PRACTICAL MAGIC, Goldsman is a leading candidate for worst screenwriter of the decade) aren't interested in answering them. Instead, they caricature everybody, on both sides, they trade sadism in for thrills(especially with what happens to Bullock's character), and instead of having a debate on vigilante justice(like they do in SLEEPERS, a far superior film on the same question), they manipulate us into only seeing it one way, especially in the speech McConaughey gives at the end. And it suffers what has been called Southern disease; the disease that makes otherwise rational directors think all of the South is out of a badly written, overheated, melodramatic Tennessee Williams play. The actors who don't play along(like Kiefer Sutherland as a KKK man) are wasted, like Ashley Judd as McConaughey's wife and Brenda Fricker as his secretary. In the end, you're left neither entertained nor enlightened, just ticked that you wasted good money on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>s This surely ranks in the Top Ten of all time left wing-biased films ever put on screen. Why do I say that? Check the movie out and you'll see:The "good" people in this movie are young, beautiful, educated, hip and suave - everything Liberals picture themselves. The bad people are white trash Southern racists. The bad guys also are "God-fearing" people and that is repeated over and over and over so you get the analogy that scummy, uneducated people are the ones who talk about God. The sweet-talking "hip" girl, played by Sandra Bullock, is going to help the handsome young liberal lawyer (Matthew McConnaughey) and among her "credentials" are successful briefs for the ACLU. That is supposed to impress us movie viewers.That's hardly the end of it....it gets worse, playing race cards to a ridiculous degree. For instance, in the movie, a black guy who guns down two white people in cold blood and it is deemed "okay." I'm not making this up - it's in the film! Try to picture the opposite, because you would never see that on screen, and justifiably so.All of this, by the way, was just in the first 45 minutes!. This is another manipulative movie that sucks people in on emotions to agree with the writer's bias. This isn't a crime movie; it's another cultural agenda piece, plain and simple. What a shame. I just wanted to a watch a crime story, that had a good cast and an interesting story....period but, judging from the material in here, that is not the idea of this movie.There are just too many clichés and stereotypes in here to make this rise about the normal crud Hollywood puts out, no matter what side of the fence you sit. Talk about manipulative! The fact is: it's a bad movie.</fullReview>
