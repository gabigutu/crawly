		<shortDescription>Zeppo's best Marx Brother Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zeppo Marx is frequently considered with a trace of a sneer: the fourth brother who was not worthy of membership in one of filmdom's two best comedy teams. He was the fourth brother of Groucho, Chico, &amp; Harpo Marx (and is only slightly better remembered than fifth brother Gummo, who never appeared in any of their films). He looked the best of the brothers (he was the youngest) so he could play the romantic lead if nobody else had the role (like Oscar Shaw did in COCONUTS). However although his appearance was better than the other three brothers, he was not a really handsome man like Robert Taylor or Tyrone Power. Also he had a serious problem with his sense of humor - he had one but it was remarkably similar to Groucho's. In fact, during the Broadway run of COCONUTS, Groucho was ordered by a doctor to take a long, overdue rest. He took off for two weeks, and was replaced by understudy Zeppo. At the end of two weeks he talked to the producers, and they willingly allowed him to take an additional week off. In fact, when that was finished they said he could take more time off if needed. They were not in a rush to get him back. Suspicious, Groucho went unannounced to the theater one night, and watched Zeppo being so good the audience was laughing hysterically at his delivery and acting. In a single day Groucho returned to the show. Groucho never made that mistake again.It would have been impossible for Zeppo to have played a smaller version of Groucho on screen. There would have been an imbalance with two Grouchos in the films. So Zeppo was usually put into the films as Groucho's assistant, or secretary, or even his son (in HORSE FEATHERS). His part in COCONUTS, as the film exists today, is not very impressive (there is one scene where he and Groucho try to greet Chico and Harpo as new customers at the hotel, and keep missing their hands). In ANIMAL CRACKERS he is Jamison, the secretary to "Captain Spaulding", and has an amusing sequence regarding the immortal firm of "Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger, &amp; McCormick". In HORSE FEATHERS he did take part in the mad football game at the end of the film. In DUCK SOUP, as assistant to Rufus T. Firefly, he had more sequences that were funny, such as when he gets slapped for telling a story to Groucho that Groucho had previously told to him. He also takes part in the "Fredonia's Going to War" number, and in the battle section at the end. But only the Hungerdunger scene in ANIMAL CRACKERS (shared by Groucho), and this film, MONKEY BUSINESS, gives one an idea of Zeppo as an effective comic.Here, unlike the other four appearances, he is not connected in the past with Groucho. He is paired with him, when he and Groucho are hired by Alky Briggs to be his torpedoes. However, he is frequently chased on the boat, and finds time to romance the film's heroine, in one particularly good moment telling her of his eternal devotion to her just before fleeing from her side to avoid being captured by members of the ship's crew. He also is able to romance her at her coming out society party, and rescues her from Briggs' gang. Here he finally does something normal to assist the film. He is a passably pleasant leading man, but nothing spectacular. MONKEY BUSINESS was also surreal in it's humor, best in the puppet show sequence and also the attempt of the four brothers to get off the boat pretending to be Chevalier. It is a very funny movie - maybe not the best of all their films (DUCK SOUP or A NIGHT AT THE OPERA are that), but close to the best. As for Zeppo, he remained part of the act and the films for two more years, and then quit both to become a successful film agent. He would always be in Groucho's shadow as a comic, and even in death (soon after Groucho's death in 1977) passed on with hardly any impact on the public. Had he branched out on his own (if anyone had shown interest in such a move) he might have had a chance to show his talents, but it is problematical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ship of Fools</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MONKEY BUSINESS (Paramount, 1931), directed by Norman McLeod, and written by S.J. Perelman, presents those four zany Marx Brothers in their third feature comedy. Following their previous efforts in THE COCOANUTS (1929) and ANIMAL CRACKERS (1930), each based on their 1920s stage works filmed at Paramount's Astoria studios in Long Island, NY, MONKEY BUSINESS, produced in Hollywood, was the team's first original comedy and one of their most funnier outings. While no relation to the 20th Century- Fox 1952 comedy starring Cary Grant and Ginger Rogers, except in title only, and having nothing to do with monkeys, this presentation does get right down to business when comedy is concerned.Here Groucho, Harpo, Chico and Zeppo play four stowaways aboard ship bound for the states who, after being discovered hiding in barrels singing "Sweet Adeline," they are pursued by First Officer Gibson (Tom Kennedy) and his crew, which has the foursome running all over the ship, eluding authorities and driving practically everybody out of their minds. Eventually the four stowaways separate, with Chico and Harpo posing as barbers; Groucho acting as the captain, invading the sanctity of the captain's quarters where he and Chico makes themselves at home by eating his meals; Harpo later chasing the young ladies as well as entertaining little children at a puppet show while at the same time making a fool out of Gibson. Harpo even finds time making friends with a frog, but keeps it under his hat. As for Zeppo, in between chases, he finds time escorting a young lady named Mary (Ruth Hall) around the deck. Afterwards, they all encounter rival gangsters, Groucho encounters Alkie Briggs (Harry Woods), after being found with his wife, Lucille (Thelma Todd) in her state room. Briggs, however, takes a liking to Groucho and offers him a job, along with Zeppo, as his personal bodyguards. Chico and Harpo encounter Briggs' rival, Joe Helton (Rockcliffe Fellows), Mary's father and Zeppo's love interest, each becoming Helton's bodyguards as well. After docking in New York, the Marx Brothers find they must get past custom officials to get off. After obtaining the passport belonging to the popular French entertainer, Maurice Chevalier (who does not appear), they pass themselves off as Chevalier, singing one of his current hit songs, "You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me," but to no avail. How the silent Harpo gets by with this must be seen to be believed. While the final 25 minutes shifts over to a swank party given by Kelton to introduce his daughter, Mary, to high society, the Marxes join in the function with dysfunctional tendencies as Groucho insults the guests, Chico and Harpo entertain with their traditional piano and harp interludes, while Briggs and his gang sneak in, posing as musicians, to carry out their plot of kidnapping Kelton's daughter, Mary, by holding her hostage inside a barn.Virtually plot less in a sense, MONKEY BUSINESSS plays like an extended comedy short that would have worked equally well had it starred the Three Stooges. MONKEY BUSINESS is pure Marx Brothers nonsense that appears to be every bit as funny today as it possibly was way back in 1931. Anything goes with this film, including many memorable shipboard moments including Groucho's comedic dance with Thelma Todd; Groucho doing his bit by posing as a reporter interviewing and insulting the cultured Madame Pucchi (Cecil Cunningham, in a manner somewhat similar to Margaret Dumont, Groucho's frequent foil and straight-woman). GROUCHO: "Is it true you're getting a divorce as soon as your husband recovers his eyesight? Is it true you wash your hair in clam broth? Is is true you used to dance in a flea circus?" MADAME PUCCHI: "This is outrageous! I don't like this innuendo." GROUCHO: "That's what I always say. Love flies out the door when money comes innuendo."; the Chico and Groucho exchange regarding Christopher Columbus: GROUCHO: "Columbus sailed from Spain to India looking for a short cut," CHICO: "Oh, you mean a strawberry short cut?;" Harpo coming out from a barrel of hay in the barn and seen kissing a calf, and much more.As with most of the Marx Brothers films produced by Paramount, MONKEY BUSINESS is pure comedy at best. Had this been done over at MGM, where the Marx Brothers would be employed (1935 to 1941), MONKEY BUSINESS most definitely be toned down some in comedy antics with extended romantic subplots and straight-forward and lengthy musical numbers. MONKEY BUSINESS has none of that. Unlike most Marx Brothers comedies, their characters in MONKEY BUSINESS have no background, no professions and no spoken character names (the closing cast credits them with their first names only). They are just unusual stowaways trying to keep themselves from being caught and taken to the brig. However, in this case, MONKEY BUSINESS has its full quota of belly-laughs. Nothing really drags and nothing provided is unnecessary. And whatever scenes may not be of importance or interest to the viewers, it passes by very quickly. MONKEY BUSINESS, hailed as one of the top 100 comedies by the American Film Institute, has become a perennial favorite to many Marx Brothers enthusiasts. After many years being presented on commercial television on the afternoon or evening to after midnight hours, it became available on video cassette through MCA Home Video in the 1980s, and to cable television on several channels, from the Comedy Channel shortly prior to 1990, then to American Movie Classics (1991-1992), and, a decade later, on Turner Classic Movies (TCM premiere: December 17, 2001). Regardless of its age, MONKEY BUSINESS, for all its silliness, continues to bring laughter to a new generation of movie lovers whenever shown, thanks to those funny men billed as The Marx Brothers. Because of them, no ocean voyage would ever be the same again, which is why no self respecting ship should ever set sail without them either. Bon Voyage. (***)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How does one review a plotless movie? In "Monkey Business," the Marx Brothers spend the first hour running around on a ship, then they crash a fancy party, then they fist-fight gangsters in a barn. Is there connecting material? Well, yeah - of the thinnest sort imaginable. Does the lack of a coherent plot hurt the film? Not really. Bottom line: it's hilarious. Groucho in particular steals the show with his weird combination flirting/insulting routines.It's worth noting that, while I laughed a lot at "A Night at the Opera," I laughed even more at this movie. In fact, I was in exquisite pain by the end. Of course, "Opera" actually makes some sense, so it might still be the better movie.Definitely the best Marx Brothers film that doesn't feature Margaret Dumont, and the strongest showcase for the brothers' talents as physical comedians.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Duck Soup was their greatest critically, this one is my personal favorite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all my years of criticing films, I have never found a team of comedians more funny, more satirical, or more flexible as the four original Marx Brothers. Their comedy and their formula works in ways that no other comedy team has ever worked, and results like this, their third and, IMHO, funniest film, prove what film historians already know: Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo are some of the most influential Hollywood legends to ever live!"Monkey Business" works because all of the brothers are given the same amount of screentime, and each of their characters were very important to the plot. In movies before and after this picture, more emphasis would be spent on different brothers in each film (i.e. Groucho in "Animal Crackers," Harpo in "Love Happy"), and the other bros would have little to do but stand their with their mouths open. Not so in this. They are all main characters here, and each of them are allowed to stick to their own unique formulas that they are best at: Groucho with his wisecracks, Chico with his conning, Harpo with his silent antics, and Zeppo the straight man with his women-swooning.As far as plotline goes, the four brothers play themselves, stowing away on an ocean-liner and constantly avoiding the captain and his crew by any means neseccary (and I do mean by any means!). The story itself is a very serious one, and it could have passed for a pretty good, if by-the-numbers gangster movie: There are two dueling mob bosses on this boat, one of which is trying to come clean after making his fortune. He has a beautiful young college daughter, and he is trying to get his life straightened out. The other mob boss has a failing marriage with a beautiful young wife (Thelma Todd), and he by no means is trying to reform. He wants his part of the other boss's money, or else he plans on kidnapping the daughter and holding her for ransom.So what we have here is a pretty standard, serious plotline....The writers were very smart in choosing to make it one, so that it would eventually become all-the-more funny. Suddenly, into this serious movie, the Marx Brothers are dumped into the scene, and everything becomes chaotic. Groucho falls for the bad guy's wife. Zeppo falls for the good guy's daughter. Harpo falls for any girl in a dress. Chico falls for a cow. Chico and Harpo are hired to protect the goodguy. Groucho and Zeppo are hired to kill him. In the meantime, they are still on the run and are constantly trying to foil the plans of the Captain, who wants to put them in irons. The results of their slapstick are all the better now, because they are surrounded by a bunch of straight men who are acting in a very serious film...and it is their job to make it funny.There is no greater film that better demonstrates just how genius the Marx Brothers' brand of comedy truely is. Groucho's constant insults and depression puns, Harpo's....whatever you call what Harpo does.... Chico's conning and comebacks, and Zeppo's romantic Renniasance man ("Mary, I'll never leave you," he promises his love before deserting her as he runs away in terror at the sight of the approaching the Captain) all make this the greatest of comedies. It also features probably their greatest screen moment: All four must do a Chevalier impression to get off the boat, and the results are....well....interesting.Don't miss this movie if you want your sides to split in half!"Would you mind getting off that flypaper and giving the flies a chance?"**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Marx Brothers films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It starts off fantastically, with the four brothers playing stowaways on a ship who are hiding in barrels and singing "Sweet Adeleide". Harpo is fantastic as he goofs in his own unique silent way, and there is a hilarious scene involving him and a Punch And Judy show. Chico is as usual on top form as the Italian who has sent for his grandfather's beard by "hair mail". And Groucho gives his classic wisecracks. Zeppo has more to do in this film than he did in other films and he isn't too bad considering that he didn't want to be in the films but had to due to his contract. Two historically funny Marx Brothers scenes in this film are one where they each in turn pretend to be Maurice Chevalier, and one where Chico and Harpo are cutting a man's mustache ("That sides-a-too short"). You must see this film; it's the Marx Brothers at their best. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Monkey Business contains three or four of the Marx Brothers' best sketches. Possibly the funniest Marx Brothers scene, too, where all four of the brothers take turns impersonating Maurice Chevalier, whose passport they've stolen. If you're a Zeppo fan - and, hey, who isn't - this is his biggest part (although I haven't seen Horse Feathers yet). He ends up being the leading man, if you can believe that! Well, he's still not very funny, even if he did elicit two laughs from me. That's two more than he'd ever gotten before! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is where the Marx Brothers hit their stride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much better than the first two Marx Brothers efforts. This is the first Marx Bros. movie written directly for the screen rather than adapted from one of their Vaudeville shows. The result is a faster pace, a bigger production and a wider variety of scenes. This was exactly what the brothers needed to become more effective on screen. The supporting cast is trimmed down, with Zeppo filling the romantic lead, thus combining two non-funny characters into one. This gives more screen time to Groucho, Harpo and Chico, who are on top of their game here. The comic bits don't drag on too long, and the musical numbers don't kill the momentum; both improvements from their earlier films. The storyline and the rest of the cast are just as bad as always, but what do you expect? The point is that the movie is hilarious and entertaining from beginning to end. Monkey Business is where the Marx Brothers really began to hit their stride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing fancy, but plenty of anarchic fun, "Monkey Business" won't disappoint anyone who likes the Marx Brothers. While a little less riotous than their very best movies, it features a couple of extremely funny sequences, with the favorite probably being the 'Maurice Chevalier' scene. (As you watch that scene unfold, you start wondering how Harpo is going to play it, and it's quite clever when you find out.) Harpo has another fine scene when he gets tangled up in a puppet show. Zeppo gets a little more action than usual, and the others have some great moments, too. This one certainly should not be missed by any fan of Groucho and company.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Entertaining MB Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's more typical Marx Brothes zaniness....and plenty of it, with a few instrumentals thrown in (Chico on piano nd Harpo on harp) near the end.Most of this "story" is just madcap chases with the four boys (yes, Zeppo is in here, too) being stowaways aboard a ship. The last part of the film shows a swanky party where Zeppo's girlfriend is kidnapped and the bothers go to rescue at an abandoned barn. That's a very funny scene and better than the boat segment, although a bit short. I'd like to have seen more of that latter scene.However, those earlier boat scenes are good, too, with a lot of clever puns which I thoroughly enjoyed. It was still a lot of solid entertainment in the Marx Brothers tradition. To my surprise, I found myself missing Margaret Dumont as Groucho's main foil. Thelma Todd takes over that part here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just as zany as monkeys going over Niagra Falls in a barrel, this concoction of fast-moving sketches moves so fast, you'll think you're heading over the falls, too. The four brothers are stowaways on a luxury cruise ship heading to New York and for a good 3/4 of this movie, they are doing their best to avoid being caught, even though a good deal of that time is conversing in marvelous double-talk with the ship's crew after them. They infiltrate the captain's quarters, Groucho insults a wealthy socialite (an unbilled Cecil Cunningham) and infiltrates the captain's quarters, and Harpo searches for his missing frog then attacks a passenger in the doctor's office who claims to have a frog in his throat. A magnificent puppet show has Harpo standing in for one of the puppets as crew members stand right near the puppeteer's box, then he makes a hysterical escape much to the viewing kiddie's delight. Like the later "Hellzapoppin'" and the Zucker Brothers movies of the 1980's, this requires repeat viewings to capture all of the gags or remind you of them, because they follow each other so fast, you will be dizzy trying to take it all in. There's the shell of a plot involving the kidnapping of a mobster's daughter once the ship docks in New York, and of course this leads to more zaniness with the presence of the brothers. There's a classy parody of the Maurice Chevalier craze with all four brothers (including the mute Harpo) trying to get off the ship while pretending to be Chevalier singing "A New Kind of Love". Sexy Thelma Todd, the almost forgotten comical star of a series of Hal Roach shorts, provides some "hot cha cha" as one of the ship's passengers who hides Groucho amongst her wardrobe which leads to some amusing dialog about Groucho being in the closet. This is one of those comedies you might consider buying (available with all of the brothers' Paramount films) because you might find yourself pulling it out on a regular basis.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Marx Brothers run amuck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know there's some controversy among Marx Brothers aficionados about which Marx Brothers films are better, the ones at Paramount or the ones at MGM. Thalberg at MGM demanded more of a structure. The Paramount films were largely based on plays performed by the Marx Brothers. Often it looks like someone turned on the camera and left."Monkey Business," which includes Zeppo, is completely chaotic and hilarious. The brothers are stowaways on an ocean liner, hiding in pickle barrels. Most of the action is centered around the ship commander and staff attempting to catch them. Beautiful Thelma Todd appears as a mobster's wife who is unhappily married and wants to ha-cha-cha.There are many priceless moments, but when they all try to disembark by each stating that he's Maurice Chevalier and then breaking into song has to be the best. Harpo, of course, does all of this with a hidden recording that slows down as he's lip-synching.For Marx Brothers fans, and any one else who needs a laugh. And who doesn't these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps their most anarchic film. Not their best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Marx Brothers fans agree that their first five films, made for Paramount, were generally better than their remaining eight. Among their early films, however, "Monkey Business" is probably the one that is most rarely mentioned (OK, maybe it is mentioned more often than "The Cocoanuts"). There is a reason for that: although this may be the single most anarchic Marx outing, it is not one of their best. Anarchic also means disorganized, and this has its good and its bad points: there is almost no plot to get in the way of the comedy (good), but there is also a missed opportunity to go further with the idea of the Groucho-Zeppo and Harpo-Chico teams working for rival gangsters (bad). There are no musical numbers involving secondary characters (good), but there is a piano solo and a harp solo back-to-back in the last 15 minutes (bad structure). Seeing this film today, it is Harpo's physical comedy that seems the most timeless in my opinion. Sure, Groucho could deliver his lines incredibly fast and some of those lines were decades ahead of their time, but Harpo is the life of the film's most memorable bits, like the puppet show or his impersonation of Maurice Chevalier. He is like a visitor from another planet, where people are allowed to do all the things we want to do but can't. He's extraordinary. (**1/2)</fullReview>

Chico has Another Great Piano Parody and Harpo Gets to Strum the Harp Beautifully.The One Liners, Puns, and Gags are Virtually Non-Stop and the Brothers are as Energetic as Ever. It Is One of Their Snappiest Films and is Ranked High in the Marx Canon. While Lacking the Sophistication and Polish, a Trait the Marx Brothers Really Didn't Need, of Other Titles that Some Consider Their Absolute Best, This One Still Remains One of Their Most Raucous.The Finale in the Barn Fizzles Somewhat and Goes On Too Long.

		<fullReview>This was the third Marx Brothers film but it was the first one written directly for the big screen and also the first one shot in Hollywood. It was actually banned in some countries because it was thought to encourage anarchy! Can you imagine - the Marx Brothers encouraging anarchy? If you follow the picture from start to finish there's not much of a plot or story here, but you do get a look at some of the amazing talent each of the Marx Brothers brought to the table. Groucho in particular is a whirling dervish of rapid fire banter that's always a pace or two ahead of the viewer, and I had to do a rewind when he offered that rather risqué line to a newspaper photographer - "Pictures? Here's a little sex stuff for your front page." Who would have imagined that for 1931? Chico managed to impress with his piano playing and Harpo somehow got a frog to jump into his hat not once but twice during the story, and it made me stop and wonder how many takes that might have taken. If there's any hint of normalcy to be derived from this band of brothers, I guess it would have to be Zeppo who despite the odd name, appeared to be of normal character and temperament. Put them all together though and you have some rather frenetic activity, what with rival gangsters stirring up trouble aboard ship and Harpo chasing after every gal who happens to come his way. The only thing missing as Groucho so astutely observed - "Where's all those farmer's daughters I've been hearing about for years?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anarchy On B Deck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Groucho, Chico, and Harpo land themselves in another fine mess, and it's up to that heroic, charismatic dynamo Zeppo to bail them out and save the day.Oh, well, I tried to validate my love for the under-appreciated Marx Brother. Yes, "Monkey Business" is the one where he clouts the bad guy and wins the girl, not to mention performs a mean Maurice Chevalier impression to help his brothers escape imprisonment. But he doesn't get much appreciation for his efforts. The fact the Marxes have little to do once they get off the boat is not my problem, unless I'm looking for a plot in this intentional shambles of a movie.Recognized as the first Marx Brothers comedy to be based not on a stage play but original material, supplied by S. J. Perelman, Will B. Johnstone, Arthur Sheekman, a couple of uncredited script doctors, and probably much ad-libbing, "Monkey Business" is the first comedy the boys shot in Hollywood, after replicating a pair of their stage shows on a set in Astoria, New York. We meet them as stowaways on an ocean liner, staying one step ahead of the ship's crew, with no money, no food, and a lot of complaints."I don't care for the way you're running this boat," Groucho tells the captain. "Why don't you get in the back seat for a while and let your wife drive?"When the first mate (Tom Kennedy) suspiciously asks Groucho if he knows about a stowaway going around with a mustache, Groucho is unperturbed: "Well, you couldn't expect a mustache to go around by itself.""Monkey Business" is shorter on plot than one has a right to expect, even from a Marx Brothers movie. It's 20 minutes before one even puts in an appearance, when we meet gangster Alky Briggs (Harry Woods) and his restless wife Lucille (Thelma Todd). How Briggs gets the idea that Groucho and Zeppo would make ideal hit men is something that never makes sense. Nor is it supposed to. The plot is just something to keep us occupied in-between comic bits and odd musical interludes involving various Marxes.The film at times seems to make fun of this very fact. Groucho can't even bother to help out when his brother Zeppo is getting roughed up in a climactic battle, instead providing boxing commentary as he watches overhead. Chico seems to sleepwalk through this film until he spots a piano to play, while Harpo has his most famous moment taking over a puppet show.The jokes aren't all winners, but it's hard to complain when Groucho delivers them rapid-fire: "With a little study, you'll go a long way, and I'd wish you'd start now."About the only person other than the Marxes to make an impression is Todd, with whom Groucho has a couple of amusing scenes. She'd be back for the next film, "Horse Feathers," playing up her sexy flapper persona to even bigger effect.There are several odd cuts, and the pacing really drags in the last half hour, but give director Norman Z. McLeod points for giving the Marx Brothers a platform to play off of. "Monkey Business" is not a great film, but it's a fine comic vehicle that holds up well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Marx Brothers were such a talented bunch that you come up with any story idea and they can carry it the rest of the way.they were so great and one liners and ad libs that one can't help but wonder just how often the script was stuck to.Thw whole idea of these guys being stowaways on a boat,if you go in already familiar with their work,is hysterical just on paper,and the boys deliver well in the final product as always.The only possible exception is Zeppo,who was intended,I suppose,to be the straight man of the bunch,but this never quite worked and is most likely the reason he didn't last with the group professionally.Look for a tragic irony when Groucho says to Thelma Todd,"...you will have to stay in the garage all night..".Years later,Thelma Todd was found dead in a garage under mysterious circumstances.That aside,if you are looking for classic style humor,you will find it here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Marxist Stowaways</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Monkey Business is a film that gets right down to business, the laugh business that is. No buildup of any kind, it starts off with the Marx four stowing away on a transatlantic ocean liner and merrily eluding captain and crew.You can't go into any kind of plot, there really isn't one. As it happens there are two rival gangsters on board the ship, Rockliffe Fellowes traveling with daughter Ruth Hall and Harry Woods, normally a western heavy traveling with his wife/moll Thelma Todd.Groucho and Zeppo get hired by Woods and Harpo and Chico get hired by by Fellowes. Zeppo has some misplaced loyalty though, he falls for Ruth Hall. But Groucho sticks loyally by Thelma Todd, too loyally in the mind of Woods.The action moves from the ocean liner to a society party, similar to the one Mrs. Rittenhouse was throwing for Captain Spaulding in their last picture Animal Crackers. Hall is captured and it's up to the Marx to rescue the fair maiden. After all for the one and only time in their film careers, she was the sweetheart of one of their own.Monkey Business is famous for the Marx Brothers affectionate salute to Paramount's biggest star at the time, Maurice Chevalier. They all get a crack at imitating Chevalier singing a few bars of You Brought A New Kind Of Love To Me from The Big Pond. All of them mind you, even Harpo.Monkey Business was also the first film the Marx Brothers did in Hollywood, their first two, The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers were done at Paramount's Astoria Studio in New York. It was also the first film written directly for them for the screen. It's a comedy classic, enjoyed by Marxists of all kinds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without question, "Monkey Business" is one of my favorite Marx Brothers comedies. It is full of fast-paced action and clever wit from start to finish, and it never appears to drag, unlike the previous two Marx Bros. films ("The Cocoanuts" [1929] and "Animal Crackers" [1930]).Here are my favorite highlights from "Monkey Business" (if you haven't seen it, don't read on). By far the best scenes in this picture are those on board the ship, as stowaways Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo (who are not given any character names) perform every kind of trickery they can think of to dodge the ship's commanding officers. After harmonizing "Sweet Adeline" while hiding inside kippered herring barrels, they rush over to an orchestra pit where Chico tinkers on the piano as the others pretend to be saxophonists. Harpo invades a Punch &amp; Judy puppet show and, with his famous Gookie face (which in real life he adopted from a humorless cigar maker), tricks First Officer Gibson (Tom Kennedy) into believing he's just another puppet. Groucho plays a few strange guitar interludes when the pretty Lucille Briggs (Thelma Todd) tells him of her desire for excitement and "hot-cha-cha-cha!" But perhaps the most celebrated scene on the ship is that of the foursome obtaining the passport of actor/singer Maurice Chevalier and trying to impersonate him singing "You Brought a New Kind of Love to Me" (for any of you musicians who are interested, Zeppo sings it in G, Chico in F, and Groucho in A-flat). At the party, Chico performs arguably his best and flashiest piano solo on film (I recently learned that the title of the last tune he plays is "When I Take My Sugar to Tea"). And at the barn during Zeppo's fight with racketeer Alky Briggs (Harry Woods), Groucho becomes an unofficial commentator and Chico creates a roulette game with Harpo."Monkey Business" is a terrific Marx Brothers film. The chaos and mirth are nonstop, resulting in an energetic movie that is quite a joy to watch from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Off to Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After filming their Broadway shows Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers in New York, the Marx Brothers headed to Hollywood to make Monkey Business. This was their first original screenplay, and it shows how difficult it was to write for the team. Starting with the premise that they are stowaways aboard a ship, much of the film consists of the ship's officers chasing them around the deck, which quickly becomes tiresome. Add to this mix a satire on popular gangster movies of the day (Little Ceasar and Public Enemy), and you have a funny, but rather confusing movie. Of course Groucho is going to pursue beautiful Thelma Todd (even the fact that she's a gangster's wife doesn't deter him), but it's more fun watching him make love to Margaret Dumont, since we know the only thing he could possibly be interested in is her money. My favorite scene in the movie is the one where Groucho wants to be a gangster's bodyguard. "Let's say there are two men trying to attack you and two men trying to defend you, why, that's 50% waste. Why can't you be attacked by your own bodyguard, your life'llbe saved, and that's 100% waste. You've still got me and I'll attack you for nothing. So it's settled, I'm to be your new bodyguard. In case I'm going to attack you, I'll have to be there to defend you too. Now let me know when you want to be attacked and I'll be there ten minutes later to defend you." Unfortunately, this brilliant comedy writing is diminished by jokes which seem to be left over from the Brothers' vaudeville act, circa 1917. At one point, Groucho tries to give Chico a history lesson by telling him the story of Columbus. Columbus sailed on a vessel, and of course you know what a vessel is. Chico: "Sure, I can vessel (whistles a tune). When he tells him Columbnus' men were going to mutiny at night, Chico replies: "Nah, no mutinies at night. Mutinies Wednesdays and Saturdays." Zeppo gives his usual wooden performance while romancing the daughter of Joe Helton. Groucho always felt that Zeppo never got an opportunity to show what he could do. "He had talent, but there were three brothers ahead of him." Yet his successors, the bland Alan Jones, the awful Kenny Baker, and the hideous Tony Martin, fared no better (if you can stand it, listen to Tony sing "The Tenement Symphony" in The Big Store; it's perhaps the worst piece of music ever written). In short, this is an enjoyable outing for Marx fans, not their best, but worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I happened to watch this immediately after the hysterical-yet-clunky Marx Brothers comedy Animal Crackers, and I have to say, there's a huge difference filmmaking-wise. Not bound by the limitations of early talkies, this movie has lots more complex slapstick such as chases and fights to keep the audience thoroughly entertained.Of the three Marx Brothers movies I've seen (other two being Animal Crackers and Night At The Opera), this had, in my opinion, Harpo's best visual humour. All his gags were very clever, and uses his talents as a comedian to his full potential. Groucho is his usual snarky self, including one memorable scene where he commentates a fight taking place at a barn. And of course their's Chico and Zeppo, who I never find too memorable.Bottom Line: There's tons of great slapstick and gags, definitely recommended for Marx Brothers fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delight all the way around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the one Marx film wherein all four Brothers are allowed to develop their screen identities and to push their comic styles to their limits. Naturally the two most memorable performances are by Harpo and Groucho, since they were quite aware of having created performance personae, whereas Zeppo never quite got the importance of that and Chico of course never cared. But Harpo is on fire in a couple of unforgettable scenes, such as the infamously surreal puppet sequence (there isn't any puppeteer in the booth!). And Groucho is at his most mature and most sophisticate - the scene where he first meets Thelma Todd is filled with obscure sexual innuendo ("we can clean and tighten your breaks but you'll have to stay in the garage all night") and wild riffing on romantic clichés, e.g. the sudden appearance of the guitar to accompany Todd's gyrating body language after she declares she wants a good time.Speaking of Thelma Todd, this comedienne, who ended her career all too young with an (apparent) suicide, was one of the finest - and most beautiful - of comic actresses to come out of Hollywood. Her performance here is pure gold - her timing is perfect, and her chemistry with Groucho adds real sizzle to their characters' abortive romance.Finally, a word on the preservation of this film: the production team making this film also worked on Horsefeathers. That film was not carefully preserved, and the existing prints have poor light values, scratches, all kinds of flaws.Monkey Business has been much more fortunate - the print now on DVD is almost mint condition - this is one of the few films of its era that we can see as if for the first time. And this allows the film to come across whole, without technical interference.A delight all the way around; perhaps not the first Marx Bros. film to see (since the film makers and the Bros clearly assume the audience is already in on the joke), but certainly among their finest efforts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four goofy lowlifes stowaway on an Atlantic cruise-ship and get mixed up with two rival gangsters on board. Once they dock in New York, one of the hoodlums holds a big social bash for his daughter, and more mayhem ensues.This is the third Marx Brothers movie, and whilst perhaps not quite as good as the preceding Animal Crackers, is still an all-out assault of inspired lunacy, hilariously deadpan breakneck dialogue, some of the best slapstick I've seen (Groucho and Todd's dancing is wonderful), musical madness and their uniquely cynical-yet-debonair happy- go-lucky sensibilities. In particular, Harpo is at his face-pulling, skirt-chasing, anarchic, violent best in this film - shaving moustaches, stealing chess-sets, beating up immigration clerks, attacking Chico, kissing cows, and of course playing the harp delightfully. There are so many nutty lines that unless you've had a complete sense of humour transplant, you'll be chuckling all the way through ("Tell me, has your grandfather's beard got any money ?" - "Money !? Why, it fell hair to a fortune !"). The only key ingredient missing is the inimitable Margaret Dumont, although the jaw-sockingly gorgeous and sharp-as-a-tack Todd (who was also in the subsequent Horse Feathers, and whose death, for those interested, is one of the great Hollywood mysteries of all time) is a fabulous sparring-partner for Groucho's lightning wit. A terrific comedy classic, brilliantly scripted by S.J. Perelman and Will B. Johnstone, and I bet Maurice Chevalier loved it !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The four Marx brothers play stowaways on a ocean liner headed for America who mingle with rival gangsters in their first comedy written directly for the screen. This film refreshing abandons the stodgy proscenium of their first two features which were based on their Broadway successes. The first two-thirds of the film are very funny as the brothers attempt to elude the ship's crew. Chico and Harpo have many inventive gags and routines, and Groucho wisecracks with abandon. And Zeppo... Well, does it really matter what Zeppo does? (I don't mean to disparage Zeppo. I wish he would have remained in the team. He could have certainly handled some of the "straight" business in the films better than some of the 2nd tier leading man wannabes that ended up in some of the films. Think Zeppo in place of Kenny Baker in "At The Circus." See what I mean?) The climax of the first part of the film, as the brothers try to sneak off the ship disguised as Maurice Chevalier, is a classic. Unfortunately, the land bound finale is rather weak as the inconsequential plot plays itself out. Still, the first part of the film is prime Marx Brothers at their best.</fullReview>

The script is great, with some deliciously acerbic one-liners from Groucho, and the story while perhaps straightforward is well structured with some very memorable sequences especially Groucho dancing with Thelma Todd and Zeppo getting tough with a gangster. Speaking of Zeppo, he is very underseen and underused in my view, and I just loved it that he had a chance to shine here and that he did. The film looks good as well, it goes at a snappy pace and the direction is spot on. And the acting with all four of the Marx brothers is most enjoyable. All in all, hugely enjoyable and for me one of the Marx brothers' best. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An apt title to an appropriately managed film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The two things one can expect from a Marx Brothers movie (at least those made by Paramount Pictures): a chockablock of puns and visual gags and anarchy as far as the eye can see. It's no surprise their early film, Monkey Business, is a collection of miscellaneous mix ups and quirky events all strung together by the vaguest resemblance of a plot. It's funny, intelligent, and some of the purest and richest satire conducted in such a loose form.The film involves the four brothers, Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and Zeppo, who are involuntarily placed on a ship as stowaways to North America. Along the way, they become mistaken for toughs, who work alongside gangsters, and eventually, become the alleged heroes when one of the gangster's daughters is kidnapped. About half the film takes place on the ship itself, before they reach land, and believe me, the laughs continue there as well.Let's be honest for a second and admit, with what has been released over the last seventy plus years into the mainstream and what new groups have formed, it's easy to dub the Marx Brothers films dated and unimportant, when they are the direct opposite. Dated, maybe, I don't think I can argue with that. The standard of humor has greatly changed, and it's beyond rare we get a slapstick comedy that brings to light humanity and wit. But unimportant is the polar opposite of the brothers themselves. It is because of the Marx Brothers, Abbott and Costello, and the Three Stooges that comedy evolved into what would eventually be a never-ending supply of audience enjoyment. They showed us, in the black and white days of cinema, what humor was. Simple and effective little events, strung together by the bare basics of a plot, littered with verbal puns and lunacy, with a little satire and commentary on the side, to create a feast of humor and intelligence. In the day and age of limitless raunchiness and where repetition among tiresome jokes has become normality, it is great to revisit a classic comedy like Monkey Business that relies on its own personal intelligence to carry a film. And at seventy-seven minutes, feels neither bloated or too quick and empty, although the end, like in many Marx Brothers films, is a blink and you miss it sort of setup.Notable scenes are scattered amongst the camaraderie and zaniness of it all. One of them, Chico does a beautiful piano solo, the infamous and interesting scene that involves a surreal puppet show with Harpo (who, again, gives us some of the most hilarious physical, expressionist comedy this side of film), and Zeppo, for once, seems moved to the foreground here, and is presented during the second and third act as Groucho's right-hand man. Zeppo has always been ostracized by Marx enthusiasts as the least funny brother and the one who was always given the role of the realist or the serious-man. Here, he shows us that giving him a role that occupies zany quirks and goofball antics is truly doable. Monkey Business is an anarchic piece of work, knows it, embraces it, and, most importantly, lives it.Starring: Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx, and Thelma Todd. Directed by: Norman Z. McLeod.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Their Best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it really necessary to spell out the plot of a Marx Brother's movie? They are stowaways on a ship and finally get ashore in New York where they are entangled with rival gangsters.This is among their two or three best for a couple of reasons. One is that the script is by S. J. Perelman, a writer who contributed some hilarious pieces to The New Yorker in the 30s and 40s. Perelman's sense of humor was akin to Woody Allen's and they both were born in Brooklyn and shared a contempt for Southern California and its values.Perelman adds -- I don't want to use the word "class". The Marx brothers always parodied conventions but Perelman lifted their send up to more literate heights. "Can't you hurry, dear? My regiment leaves at dawn." That bit of nonsense is the sort of send up that's more dignified than the earlier brothers'. "My regiment leaves at dawn" is aimed at an audience that finds movies about British colonial wars ridiculous; it's not aimed at a vaudeville audience. "Well, it's better to have lost and lost than never to have lost at all." That last mangled thought may not have been a popular catch phrase but it's also a parody of Tennyson.Other lines needed no help from Perelman. "Married for twelve years? You must have been married in rompers. Tell me, do you miss it? Do you ever plan to go back?" (The reference is probably to Yonkers, New York.) "Say, do you have a blond in that hay loft with you? No? Then you're a bigger fool than I thought." "Monkey Business" stands out too because it has a couple of scenes that are practically surreal in their humor. I'll mention two briefly. One is when the stowaways are being chased around in a circle that takes them through the ship's ballroom. In the middle of one circuit, they stop, grab instruments from the band, and play a cacophonous bar or two of up-tempo music. There's absolutely no reason for it. It brings the plot to a complete stop for five or six seconds.Another instance. During the pursuit Harpo takes refuge in the booth of a Punch and Judy show in front of an audience of wildly screaming children. I can't describe what happens. Harpo seems to be half human, half dummy -- and the kids shriek with delight -- before he exits on a tiny rolling child's wagon.The four Marx brothers are their usual greedy, libidinous selves. There is the usual musical interlude and the film is thick with laughs.</fullReview>

When one sees a Marx brothers movie, one remembers having seen a joke, or a gag somewhere else also. But then they all copied from the inimitable Groucho, Chico, Zeppo and Harpo.The movie contains the usual routine we are so accustomed to seeing in a Marx Brothers movie. But then they still make us laugh.However, my high point in the movie is Chico's Piano solo. The way his fingers move over the Piano is really amazing. And Harpo! The way he plays the Harp in this movie is unforgettable. We are used to seeing him pull odd objects out of his pockets or following 'dames' but seeing him on the Piano is something altogether different.A must see.</fullReview>

I especially liked the guitar routine Groucho used in his scene with Thelma Todd.One curious thing about this film, that I've never seen mentioned anywhere. Anyone else notice that Harpo clearly (thanks to the camerawork) appears to be the lead singer in the opening sequence, when the four of them are hidden in barrels? Even though you can't see his (or anyone's) mouth moving, it's apparent that he's the one doing the main vocalizing, probably as a wink-wink joke to the audience.

The brothers play stowaways on an ocean liner causing all kinds of chaos and getting mixed up with gangsters. There are many funny scenes, such as Chico and Harpo playing barber or the brothers impersonating Maurice Chevalier (yes, even Harpo). Sadly, there's no Margaret Dumont in this one. Instead we have comedienne Thelma Todd, who's best remembered today for her untimely death under suspicious circumstances. Todd's not bad but there's just something funnier about Groucho seducing (and insulting) Dumont over a pretty young blonde. We do get a taste of the type of routine Groucho had with Dumont when he accosts Cecil Cunningham. It's non-stop madcap slapstick for 79 minutes with only the slimmest of plots and no musical numbers besides the piano and harp stuff we expect from Chico and Harpo. I like my Marx Bros. as crazy as possible so I naturally prefer the early Paramount films to the later ones that had a more structured plot. This one doesn't have any of the brothers' most famous routines but it's a good one nonetheless.</fullReview>

It's also the first they filmed in Hollywood instead of New York, the first not adapted from one of their Broadway shows, and the first time Harpo accompanies someone that's singing (Maxine Castle) when playing his harp. And Zeppo has even more of a role here than in previous movies though it's essentially straight and has him play the romantic lead to one Ruth Hall. Of course, the lion's share of the earned laughs goes to not only Harpo-especially when he's part of a children's puppet show or has his frog with him-but also to Chico-with yet another hilarious confused wordplay-and especially Groucho, who instead of Margaret Dumont to insult has Thelma Todd to charm and dance with. Oh, and all four brothers share a routine here: they accidentally, or not, have Maurice Chevalier's passport that they all try to fool the passport man into thinking they are all him with Harpo doing so by-well, watch the movie. In summary, Monkey Business is another hilarious Marx Brothers film. P.S. I was very pleasantly surprised when Groucho asked someone on the ship if he knew how many Frenchmen can't be wrong since the last picture I watched was called 50 Million Frenchmen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Marx Brothers Take a Cruise to Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Four Marx Brothers (Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and Zeppo) stowaway on a luxury liner bound for New York, and get mixed up with rival gangs. Though they went east for the plot of "Monkey Business", the brothers went "Hollywood" to film their third feature, leaving the stage behind. The Perelman-Johnstone script is remarkably Marxist. You can see a few of the visual gags coming in this one - it isn't as uniquely insane as "Animal Crackers" (1930), but in the long run, the dip proved negligible. The Marx Brothers used the new medium perfectly in their next film.******** Monkey Business (9/19/31) Norman Z. McLeod ~ Groucho Marx, Harpo Marx, Chico Marx, Zeppo Marx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At Least Give Groucho A Chance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If zany 1930s comedies don't interest you, at least watch Groucho work his magic."Monkey Business" was okay. There's not much of a plot, just the Marx Bros. horsing around. (They start off as stowaways on a ship, then the focus turns to a rivalry between gangster-types.) In my opinion, Groucho is the best. His quick wit and one-liners are timeless. This film is pretty old, but Groucho remains funny.As the first Marx Bros. movie I've seen, this was a sort of introduction to the group for me. Chico uses an Italian accent and works in some puns. Harpo, dressed in the ratty clothes of a tramp, doesn't speak and constantly chases after women. He seems to be the most cartoony of the bunch, but I found his act kind of creepy. Groucho (the intellectual one) is a comic genius. Zeppo, the tallest, youngest, and handsomest Marx, seems to be a regular guy, randomly hanging out with the other three.The film is wall-to-wall with silly bits. (Whether or not they're "funny" depends on your humor.) All good clean fun. Nothing dirty, just a few innuendos. Groucho writes the book on one-liners and Chico and Harpo show off their musical talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lots of wacky fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very wacky film with lots of silliness (such as Harpo trying to pass himself off as Maurice Chavalier) but the film suffers, somewhat, from a feeling of claustrophobia as most of the action takes place on an ocean liner. In many ways, this makes the movie very reminiscent of their later film, ROOM SERVICE (1938). In both cases, the brothers were trying repeatedly throughout the film not to get caught (either for stowing away in this film or for not being able to pay their hotel bill in the other). Because of this, there is no way this could be considered their best film, but it is still very watchable and silly. Now, if you are NOT a fan of stupid and non-stop comedy, don't watch this film. But, if you are in an odd mood and want a cheap laugh, give it a try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gee, I Wish I Had Me a Horse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Duck Soup" is more satirical, "A Night At The Opera," contains several of the Marx Brothers' cleverest routines--especially the cabin room scene--but for downright fun, merriment, and belly laughs this is the best Marx Brothers comedy. Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and to a more limited extent even Zeppo have some of their best moments before the camera. IMDb has several of the funniest quotes from the movie to give you an idea of how the quips fly like a jet plane. One that I missed the first time around is uttered by Chico. Toward the end of the movie when the kidnapping takes place and everyone rushes out of the ballroom for the search, Groucho runs out behind some of the damsels, Harpo hops on the back of one of the lovelies and rides her out of the room. Suddenly Chico finds himself all alone. He pauses, looks at the camera, and laments, "Gee, I wish I had me a horse." The part of the movie aboard ship, which is in fact most of the film, is the best with all kinds of jokes bandied about with the emphasis on trying to apprehend the four stowaways. Following one of their most humorous movie routines parodying the pop idol of the day Maurice Chevalier, the movie begins to drag just a little but not enough to take away from the full effect of the show.The movie was produced at the height of the Great Depression. As the viewer might expect since nothing was sacred to the Marx Brothers, Groucho has a field day poking fun at the worsening conditions of the American economy. In one scene when Captain Corcoran (Ben Taggart) corners Graucho who claims to be a stockholder. The captain tells him that he looks more like a stowaway to him. Groucho retorts, "Well, don't forget, my fine fellow, that the stockholder of yesteryear is the stowaway of today."This Marx Brothers outing is not to be missed. The lines come so fast and furious that you may have to watch it several times to catch all the puns and gibes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually, Monkey Business contains three or four of the Marx Brothers' best sketches. Possibly the funniest Marx Brothers scene, too, where all four of the brothers take turns impersonating Maurice Chevalier, whose passport they've stolen. If you're a Zeppo fan - and, hey, who isn't - this is his biggest part (although I haven't seen Horse Feathers yet). He ends up being the leading man, if you can believe that! Well, he's still not very funny, even if he did elicit two laughs from me. That's two more than he'd ever gotten before! 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frenzied Collection of Jokes, Slapstick and Vaudeville Turns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If viewers approach MONKEY BUSINESS with expectations of a coherent plot, stable characterization and tight structure, they will be sadly disappointed.As with all of the early Marx Brothers films for Paramount, MONKEY BUSINESS is a rag-bag collection of jokes, slapstick and vaudeville turns. Director Norman Z. McLeod simply allows the four brothers to run riot on the screen, much as they did during their Broadway days.The plot - such as it it - involves a conflict between two mobsters (Rockcliffe Fellowes, Harry Woods), the kidnapping of a beautiful young girl (Ruth Hall), and the futile efforts of an entire ship's crew to capture four stowaways (the Marx Brothers). Within this shaky framework the Brothers have the chance to show off their various comic talents.One cannot but admire Groucho's joke-telling ability, allied to his lithe movements on the screen. The way he prowls across the frame, while extricating himself out of the most ticklish situations is a marvel to behold. Harpo was a master of nonverbal comedy: the scene where he become involved in a Punch and Judy show reminds us of just how childlike a person he was. He was also a brilliant harpist. Chico, with his cod Italian-American accent and down-to-earth manner, was also a brilliant pianist. Zeppo appears in this film, but doesn't have much to do except impersonate Maurice Chevalier (another artist contracted to Paramount Pictures at the time the film was released).To be honest, the film rather runs out of steam at the end, as no one (not least the director) seems sure how to end it. Nonetheless it provides a valuable record of the Marx Brothers at their performative peak.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From Stage to Screen... the Marx Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The four Marx brothers are stowaways on a ship, hiding themselves in barrels marked kippered herring. As they are known to do, they spend the bulk of the movie being chased around the ship by the captain, crew, and everyone else who they cause trouble for.The production looks largely like it was designed for the stage and not as much for the movies, but as the Marx Brothers rely so heavily on witty remarks (especially Groucho) the viewing format or scenery is really not important. The number of sets improves in the second half.I like how lightly this film approaches racketeering and wives leaving their husbands for other men. They freely admit there are ex-racketeers in the newspaper, and yet they seem to be very well-off, popular people. That strikes me as such an odd thing. Also, they are drinking during what I presume to be Prohibition.I don't think this film is as great as "Night at the Opera", and Groucho does not give as fine of a verbal performance as in "Duck Soup". I am not saying it is not a good film -- it is still funny -- but I would say it is not the best of the Marx brothers repertoire. Still worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter what those four crazy brothers did, it was always funny in some way or another. In all their movies, they were able to completely dominate the atmosphere they were in. You don't really care about the other actors or their situations. The Marx Brothers are the center of it all. In Monkey Business, the writing isn't as polished as Duck Soup or Night at the Opera and the movie seems to rely more on sight gags than on Groucho's signature one-liners. Still, it accounts for enough laughs to satisfy and make you realize that the Marx Brothers were indeed the greatest comics of their era and possibly of the twentieth century. If you like them, see this for sure. It's not the best, but it's the Marx Brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barrels of Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When dissecting the craft of the Marx Bothers critics and historians invariably select Duck Soup and Night at the Opera as their best work. Along with Dr. Strangelove, Duck Soup is probably the funniest anti-war film in history. Its absurd presentation mirrors perfectly the absurd actions and pronouncements of its antagonists. A Night at the Opera is another brilliant satire that skewers opera and high society. For just plain funny though, I have to admit a bias for the anachronistic Monkey Business.While it clearly lacks the production values and sounder direction (even the great Margaret Dumont is absent) of Soup and Opera, it nevertheless allows the brothers freer reign to rebel. It is probably Harpo's( my favorite Marx) best effort containing a brilliant puppet show scene with a flustered first mate and children who seem to be truly enjoying Harpo instead of acting. Another scene I consider one of the funniest moments in all of of sound era history is with Harpo posing as Maurice Chevalier in an attempt with the rest of his brothers to get off the ship. Groucho and Chico are also at the top of their game in Monkey Business and thankfully, Zeppo stays out the way more than Alan Jones in Opera. In addition Harry Woods and Thelma Todd as mobster and moll are able foils for the brothers. I'll concede that Soup and Opera are better overall productions and that today they hold up much better than the creaky prohibition era humor of Monkey Business, but in the final analysis it comes down to laughter when discussing the Marx Brothers and it doesn't matter if they have a front row opera seat or are living in a barrel. Monkey Business is my favorite Marx Brothers movie by a chuckle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #055: Monkey Business</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>055: Monkey Business (1931) - released 9/19/1931; viewed 5/17/06.Charlie Parker makes 100 wickets in England. The Huang He and Yangtze Rivers flood and inflict the highest casualties of any natural disaster in history. Wiley Post and Harold Gatty set off for the first single-engine plane trip around the world.BIRTHS: Robert Morse, Martin Landau, William Goldman, Regis Philbin, Anne Bancroft.KEVIN: Monkey Business is not a perfect Marx Brothers film, but it's the first one that had me laughing almost constantly. It's surprising that they were able to deliver laughs so efficiently with their first production written for the screen, without first honing the story on the stage. Here the story truly is the stage, and the narrative is driven solely by the antics of the brothers. The physical comedy in this film is grander and less stagy than their previous two films. Monkey Business contains many standards, the usual archetypes of the brothers and gags (including Chico's piano followed quickly by Harpo's zaniest harp number yet.) Even the supporting players are enjoyable, especially Thelma Todd as the mobster's lovesick wife ("I want life! I wanna ha-cha-cha!"). Besides the absence of Margaret Dumont, one very unusual thing about this film was that the four leads have no identities, not even assumed ones, as they do in their other films. They're just four mysterious nameless stowaways who run around the cruise ship causing mayhem all over. Are they brothers? Classmates? Why are they so tight-nit? I might have liked it more if they gave us just a slightly better idea of who these four guys really are. Otherwise, the brothers are definitely in top form for the first time.DOUG: We finish our triple-feature (the best day we've had of this odyssey yet), with the Marx Brothers' third film, and the first one written specifically for the screen, Monkey Business, where the brothers' antics are unleashed on a luxury cruise liner. It is at this point that the brothers hit their stride; the rapid-fire jokes are virtually airtight, the chemistry is as hilariously potent as it would ever be, and even the supporting players are top-notch. Once the four of them emerge from the barrels (was Harpo singing in there?), the laughs are underway and they don't let up; in between running from security, Groucho and Chico dine with the captain, Chico &amp; Harpo enjoy snipping a man's handlebar mustache, Zeppo does the usual straight-man flirting, and Harpo joins a puppet show while making friends with a frog in his hat. The subplot doesn't even begin until 20 minutes in, as Chico and Harpo are enlisted by one crime boss, while Groucho and Zeppo fall in with another (who seems to carry on awful lot of guns on his person, don't you think?) We get one of the great Harpo moments as he and Chico try to demonstrate how tough they are by having Harpo punch Chico in the face. Margaret Dumont is unfortunately absent from this outing; the brothers' foil for this trip is Thelma Todd, who does a nice job of stealing the show. This also seems to be Zeppo's finest hour (seriously, the movie is like an hour), as he has more to do here than ever. That sounds like his voice singing lead at the beginning, he starts up the famous scene where the guys try to get past security by imitating Chevalier, he gets a nice romantic subplot, and is at the center of the final showdown, where his brothers sit on the sidelines making jokes while he beats up the bad guy.Last film viewed: M (1931). Last film chronologically: The Smiling Lieutenant (1931). Next film: Platinum Blonde (1931).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick is essentially the boys runnning wild on an ocean liner. Monkey Business = Marx Brothers= wild and crazy. I just saw the film for the first time in 20 years or so and I laughed myself silly. I think this picture is mostly Groucho's because of his scenes with Thelma Todd. The secondary love story is minor here (Zeppo &amp; Mary?) and doesn't really get in the way of the film. The real legacy of the Marxes is that their films are hilarious and politically incorrect.They are foreigners onboard a snooty ocean liner that wouldn't have them on the boat let alone in America. The boys fit the stereotype of foreigners as lechers. Ethnics can be barbers, but even then- mind your mustache.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The early Marx Brothers films were vastly superior to some of the later efforts for MGM. One, films like The Coconuts(1929), Monkey Business(1931), and Duck Soup(1933) took satirical looks at human nature. Two, their work was more daring and less subdued. Three, the films after A Night At the Opera(1935) attempted to recapture the glory days without any punch. Four, The expression of the artist was destroyed when the Marx Brothers signed over with MGM.Monkey Business(1931) is the third best Marx Brothers film behind A Night At the Opera(1935) and Duck Soup(1933). They play stowaways who do hilarious things in order to avoid being caught by the captain and crew. Groucho does perfectly fine as the leader with his great lines. The other brothers add to the lunacy of the plot. The direction by Norman Z. McCleod is done excellently for this pic.One of the most memorable scenes of Monkey Business(1931) is when the four brothers do a Maurice Chevalier impersonation in the hope of getting off the boat. The written was co-written by later Howard Hawks writer, Ben Hecht. The father of the four named Frenchie has a cameo as one of the passengers. Thelma Todd is terrific as a mob doll and the interest of Groucho. There are many wonderful lines in the movie, but the best one is when Groucho says to someone "But look at me. I worked myself up from nothing to a state of extreme poverty".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Needs Real Monkeys When You've Got The Marx Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to comedy teams, some people insist that The Marx Brothers are the absolute greatest, while others seem to find them about as amusing as a sink full of dirty dishes.Myself, I'm sort of positioned in the very middle when it comes to being able to appreciate this particular, early-Hollywood foursome and their chaotic style of humor.For me, I find that The Marx Brothers' slapstick antics, their one-liners, their silly insults and innuendo only work to their advantage about half of the time. For the rest of the time The Marx Brothers' material is a real hit'n'miss thing where the situations often teeter pretty close to the point of falling flat on their face more often than one would expect.Personally, I don't believe that the scriptwriters fully understood how best to present The Marx Brothers in a favorable light to the movie-going public. And because of that they ended up with story-lines that, often enough, had a real lazy, off-kilter and slap-dash feel to them. (Well, at least that's the way The Marx Brothers' films appear to me) Perhaps if The Marx Brothers' films had been edited down from their usual 80-90 minute running times to, say, about 30 minutes of comedy-run-amok, then I think that they would have been a helluva lot more entertaining in the long run.Please, don't get me wrong. I'm not slamming The Marx Brothers. I can certainly appreciate what they had to offer, only, I think that it could've been done better in much-much smaller doses.I guess with The Marx Brothers being such a novelty (as they certainly were back in the 1930s), makes it quite understandable to me as to why they were so popular in their genre.Monkey Business' story concerns The Marx Brothers as stowaways on a luxury ocean-liner crossing the Atlantic from Europe to NYC.Once they are discovered by the ship's crew, the chase is on as the boys do whatever's necessary to avoid being caught, arrested, and, thus, thrown into the brig for the duration of the trip.As luck would have it, The Marx Brothers inadvertently get mixed up in a feud that's going on between two rival, big-shot gangsters who are also on board the same ship.Once stateside the daughter of gangster-Helton is kidnapped by the henchmen of gangster-Briggs. It is now up to The Marx Brothers to step into the middle of this (monkey) business and, hopefully, save the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I understand that "Duck soup" is usually considered the very best Marx brothers movie ever. It's an excellent film, no doubt about it. Still, if you appreciate a good, pure laugh, I'm pretty certain you'll share my opinion: "Monkey business" is by far the funniest and greatest masterpiece they created. It's packed with absurd, mindless comedy that is filled with hundred-percent anarchy.Legends like Laurel &amp; Hardy and Charles Chaplin did some pretty crazy stuff too but they (or no-one else, to be precise) never got even close to this kind of unbelievable and incomprehensible humor. Groucho keeps on shooting his verbal fireworks until audience is totally confused and mixed up. I also guarantee that it's simply impossible to keep a straight face with Harpo and his silly yet cruel pranks and hilariously childlike looks. Of course Chico is magnificent too and even Geppo gets some room, usually he stays more on the sidelines.Unfortunately some of the Marx brothers movies contains pointless musical numbers and irrelevant sideplots. "Monkey business" is free of those things, it's purely fun and amazingly stupid comedy - no more no less. That's why I love this film! Still, I have to warn you, if you possess a weak stomach, it's not safe to watch this movie. Of course some of the viewers just don't figure out what Marx humor is all about but I nearly died of laughter and survived to tell that "Monkey business" is definitely one of the funniest films of the whole movie history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marx Madness Supreme!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite Marx picture. For one thing, all four brothers are united at the start; for another, they all get a chance to shine. Groucho's wisecracks, Chico's puns, Harpo's wild antics (especially on line with his "passport"), and Zeppo's satirical wooing get high "Marx" for great comedy. Practically every film they did afterward - even the classic "Night at the Opera" - stole something from this picture. If you can, see it at a theater, and prepare to laugh like h***!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best I could sense of the plot of this film involves two gangsters, Briggs and Helton, who are rivals. Briggs kidnaps Helton's daughter towards the end of this film. That being said, this film is great. The Four Marx Bros. are stowaways on an ocean liner where they constantly wreak havoc with the other passengers and the ship's crew. Groucho is fast and furious, puns fly back and forth, and Harpo chases women. Zeppo doesn't really do too much in this film (he's barely in it), but this is well worth watching again and again. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... and sat up all night retelling the jokes to the friends who saw it with me. And they laughed again and I laughed again when they retold them to me. The ending is weak, as most Marx Brothers endings are, but the trip getting there will wear you out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine comedy despite the messy and unengaging narrative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The four Marx Brothers have stowed away onboard a transatlantic ship, hidden inside four kippered herring barrels. When they are discovered due to their harmonic singing of Sweet Adeline they flee the forward hold and hide among the passengers. Getting into minor confusions at first in their attempts to evade capture by the crew, the brothers find themselves drawn into the middle of a beef between two mobsters on board as the ship slowly makes its way to New York.The first of the Marx Brothers' films that was written specifically for the screen, Monkey Business is a fine example of all the Marx Brothers do well while also being an example of where they are usually weak. The strength is evident from the very start as madcap antics are mixed with cutting lines and amusing puns. On this level the film is fun and energetic from start to finish with one routine after another keeping things moving. The musical numbers are happily limited to the final 15 minutes as they just cause big delays in the films because they don't fit into the narrative (although here they are not as out-of-place as in other films). Not that the story is really much to go normally with such things. Here it is so-so, involving a mobster being on board the ship and the Brothers getting tied up between the two men. It provides an adequate frame for the comedy but nothing more than that.The cast are mostly strong. As usual Groucho naturally dominates, having all the best lines and having a wicked delivery. He works well with Chico, even though the latter is not as strong as the former. Harpo does the silent physical comedy pretty well although I personally have always found him limited in his range even if I still laugh at his antics. Zeppo is happily limited in his influence in the film and barely stuck in my mind for a second after leaving the screen. Fellowes and Woods are fairly stiff and don't bring much to the table, but Todd has chemistry with Groucho and the pair work well together.Not the best of the Marx Brothers' films but a fine comedy nonetheless. The script delivers loads of good lines and funny scenes which work to cover up the fact that the plot is pretty pointless and not really worth following. As usual Groucho is on great form and the laughs keep coming when he is on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's the new and most recent, 1931, manual for how to immigrate illegally into the US via New York, Ellis Island, and then how to succeed in the gangster dominated society of New York City. Of you are a stowaway, better be four because they will never be able to find you all and one will always be able to make them run in one direction while the three others are either eating, or resting, or playing, or flirting, or whatever. Then of course you have to rotate the one or the two who are running and chasing the officials on the ship. Funny business indeed, monkey business for sure, but who is the monkey, who are the apes? Then the best strategy is to select two competing gangsters, who are here only to enjoy gambling and drinking, on the ship and manage to become their bodyguards. Two for one and the other two for the other one. You add to that a slight love affair of one of the four with the daughter of one of the two gangsters and you have it. It will only take some hullabaloo with the customs officers and the police to go through in a lot of noise, antics and floating or flying papers and stamps. Then use the rivalry of the two gangsters to get the daughter of one kidnapped by the other, then retrieve her from detention and manage to capture the kidnapping one and deliver him to the other and you are the kings of the night, full of money, good food, good champagne, in one word good cheer. We cannot exactly say this is a super-duper plot that deserves a medal, an Oscar or even a paragraph in a cinema encyclopedia. But you have to take into account the rest, that is to say the performance and antics of those four clowning siblings. They will manage to play some piano, some harp and also to play Punch and Judy with the captain and his acolytes. It is nothing but apish foolish clownish play but it is funny in the extreme rhythm and supreme variety hence absolute amazement it breeds, raises and inflates in your brains, plural absolutely needed because after a while you do not know any more on what brain of yours it is playing, left, right, middle, under, top, upper, heart-core or whatever. You are losing your ground and you start diving or sinking in their broth. And your sanity is getting loose. I hope you will not meet Chico or Harpo in a dark street tonight because you may feel a sudden need to run away. They are not really dangerous, they are just frighteningly de-structuring. And don't try to understand their language. From pun to pun, from innuendo to fuzzy innuendo, from play on words to more play on more words, you will be completely corrugated within fifteen minutes by their witty gibberish. Even if this film is definitely not politically correct, it sure is not in anyway hitting under the normal belt of morality. Yet it is a defense and illustration of illegal immigration from Europe, if possible rather what could we call it? Jewish, ethnic, Yiddish, who knows, but white nevertheless. In 1931, in the trough of the depression, still a couple of years before the New Deal, with no alcohol, except of course on transatlantic ships, and in the private celebrations of gangsters, life could only be funny if some apish monkeys cultivated some funny disturbance in the midst of the social capitalistic and teetotallistic mist, if not fog, if not plain good old London pea soup smog, of America.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne &amp; University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll laugh till it hurts!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost IMPOSSIBLE to comment on the best Marx Brothers films because nothing matters except The Marx Brothers. They are The Beatles of comedy; or are The Beatles the Marx Brother of MUSIC? The Marx Brothers INGENIOUSLY twist any phrase or object into HILARITY.One warning: When watching a Marx Brothers film with a plot (you know, other characters that you can COMPLETLEY ignore), do yourself a favor and fast-forward past what should have been left on the cutting room floor.NOTE: If you have a heart-beat and love to laugh yourself silly, you MUST see Horse Feathers, Duck Soup, The Coconuts and Monkey Business.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not One of Their Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this a day after watching Animal Crackers and was surprised at how much the quality of the material varied. Where Animal Crackers was bursting with funny gags ? both verbal and visual ? Monkey Business seems to limp along, managing an occasional smile but little more.The boys are stowaways on a grand ocean liner, each of them having their own kippered herring barrel. When their hideaway is discovered, they're forced to play a game of cat and mouse with the ship's crew, and end up in the middle of a tame gang war between a couple of big shots on board.The film's got more of a plot than Animal Crackers, but the Marx Brothers films weren't about plot, they were about the anarchic wit and furious pace. Groucho and Chico struggle with most of the material they're given, and while Harpo still manages to raise a laugh or two with his outrageous physical pranks ? and energetic pursuit of any pretty girl who happens to cross his path ? overall, the film feels like it was made in a hurry to cash in on previous successes. At least the musical interludes are kept to a minimum in this one.Talking of Harpo, does anyone else find his screen character a little scary? I'm sure that if I watched this film as a six or seven year old I would have been terrified by him in the same way that some kids are scared of clowns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My oh my, are these guys unfunny or what.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Until now I've never been able to force myself to watch a Marx Bros flick. I didn't know why, but without even having seen a single shot of them I've always been convinced they would bore me to death. Why I was so sure about it, I don't know; maybe I'd have to find the reason in the realm of the unexplained; in some 6th sense or in that I had already seen their flicks in a former life and they bored me stiff then. But I was finally able to gather the strength to do it, and what do you know.My, are these guys boring and lame. Even Monty Python looks like a barrel of laughs in comparison. Even Jim Carrey. And to think that so many know--it--alls pretend they represent a classier, deeper humor than that of the Stooges...pull-heeze! Comparing them to the three--or rather four--giants of XX Century comedy is like comparing sucking wet dirty socks to drinking champagne in a crystal cups. I guess it all has to do with some cultural thing?Anglosaxon, European, whatever?that pretend that a guy is a complete riot is he clowns around; if he is screaming to us in his actions, mannerisms?Hey, watch me! See how funny I am! That's the kind of humor these guys perform and which many others later imitated--Robin Williams being the worst offender of all. I'm not big fan of Chaplin or of Jerry Lewis, especially because too frequently they tend to become too serious or schmaltzy, but something I admire in them is that they never clown around, trying to impress me with their antics, their wits or their fast talk. Everything flows from them naturally, as an integral part of the action, the plot even when doing the wackiest things. Watching the MB instead is like witnessing a live--and not so funny--show on a stage. I could even imagine the four waiting for my applause every time they did one of their antics. Truth is, I don't find this utterly self-conscious kind of humor the least funny; just lame and, even worse, narcissistic.What's laughable, though, is the idea of rating talents by the mileage of film shot. The said "experts" argue that the Stooges were mostly incapable of filling beyond 2 reels, meaning they were unable to develop a more complex plot, so they had to stick to simple, superficial, things. Come on, and how complex could be a plot of 4 stowaways trying not to get caught in a boat? Yep, that's deep, sophisticated.This dog, about which rave many people supposedly intelligent, is about the bros. trying to escape the law aboard a cruiser; yet what makes for most of the action is them engaging all kinds of people in aimless, meandering, verbal exchanges; fast talking people, confusing them, making them act like morons. Not one single of those sketches was the least funny. What about that puppet show, was it that funny? Even the Romans in Life of Brian were hysterical compared to that. And what about Firpo, Harpo, fooling around with a frog in his hat and chasing every woman on board? Was that 1st class comedy? In fact the best part of the flick concerned the secondary characters: the two mobsters, the heiress, the moll. If the movie had focused on them as protagonists, this could have been a far better, more serious, comedy or film noir.Let me put it this way: after 17 min. of a Stooges flick like, say, Punch Drunk or Grips, Grunts and Groans, the word End on screen finds me aching from guffaws. Instead, while watching this one after 40 min. I felt like under torture, kind of: "Stop it, stop it! I'll reveal Govt. secrets, I'll betray my country, but make it stop!!" I just couldn't finish the viewing; I unplugged the thing before the hour.In all, a complete dog. If you want to see a funny Groucho, just get those things with nose and mustaches, put them on and look yourself in a mirror. That will be A LOT funnier than watching this one. 2/10, mostly for the mob and molls subplots.</fullReview>
