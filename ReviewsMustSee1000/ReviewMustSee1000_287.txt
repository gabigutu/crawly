		<shortDescription>Under-rated epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"1900" follows the lives of two friends (although sometimes they seem more like enemies!) born on the same day in a beautiful part of Italy. Olmo is born a bastard to peasant farmers and Alfredo is the son of a wealthy businessman. We watch their lives unfold with vivid cinematography and lush visuals of the exceptionally beautiful countryside. The movie jumps forward, to the end of World War 1, and Olmo returns home after fighting. And essentially the film follows the exploits of the two protagonists as they deal with love, friendship, money, death and the evils of war.The film unfolds like a finely crafted book, taking its time to tell its story.Unfortunately, the version that I watched was horrendously dubbed. It was so bad my brother couldn't continue watching. I tried to look past this major fault, as I started to love the film's story and visuals, and it does get better, but I'd be extremely disappointed to find out a subtitled version doesn't exist. And to make matters worse, it was also a Pan &amp; Scan version. This doesn't bother me too much if I'm watching, say 'Mrs. Doubtfire', but "1900" is definitely a wide-screen movie. Some scenes were practically ruined as characters are framed to the extreme right or left. For example, at the beginning where Olmo lays on the train line, I couldn't see him in the wide shot! I couldn't see what was going on. Terrible! And the version I watched came in at about 4 hours and 35 minutes. So it was a cut version, and this is blindingly obvious. The cuts are dreadful. This has to be some of the worst editing I have ever seen in my whole movie viewing life.But for all these problems (easily solvable problems that have nothing to do with the movie itself (unless the dub is the original)) I fell in love with this movie. I didn't really notice the hours passing by; the story and the characters suck you into their world, and don't let go until the final credits roll. And even then they are stuck in your head, along with the more memorable scenes. I couldn't help but be reminded of my own childhood, even when the scenes had no context to my memories. For instance, the simple setting of workers ploughing a field bought back memories of playing in a big dirt mound in our backyard as a child, or beautifully lit scenes at sunset; I could almost feel the warmth. These memories made me feel really good, and whether it was intended or not to remind the audience of their childhoods, the film certainly had this wondrous effect on me.I was quite shocked with some of the scenes in this film, especially the rape scene. While there is no sex shown at all (at least in this version), the crying eyes say more than any words or images could. You should be warned this film has some pretty graphic violence and contains a few explicit sex scenes. But the sex scenes are refreshingly realistic, as opposed to Hollywood's fraudulent version of sex.The acting is, for the most part, admirably handled. Robert De Niro is convincing as the rich son with a poor peasant as his best friend. This role could have descended into cliché, but De Niro steers it clear of any such event. Towards the end of the film De Niro's performance is terrific. It's remarkable that in the same year that this was made, De Niro played a certain Travis Bickle in the seminal 'Taxi Driver.' 1976 was certainly De Niro's year! Gerard Depardieu is wonderful as Olmo. I have never seen a movie of Depardieu's where he was young, and I must say he was very handsome in his day! His performance elicits emotion without settling for sentimentality. The supporting cast do a good job. Burt Lancaster is both charming and divine, yet in one scene I was quite uncomfortable as to where it was going to lead. But he portrays this without the cliché of a `dirty-old-man' but rather a lonely man who may not remember where the line of decency may now lie. Donald Sutherland is disgusting beyond description. No, not his acting, but the character he plays. I haven't seen too many of Sutherland's films (unfortunately, off the top of my head I can only recall 'Fallen') but I'm keen to see more of his work, as his acting here is top notch. And the hunchback (sorry, can't remember his name) is delightfully endearing. Only some small characters have questionable acting talents, but in a film with so many bit parts this may well be expected.The word 'epic' seems to imply greatly to this film. While the scope and size of the film is epic, the film relies heavily on the lives of the main protagonists. In a way this is an intimate epic, if such a thing could exist.This is an excellent film that is highly recommended for people interested in Italian history, the landscape of Italy and beautifully crafted films. This particular version is recommended to people interested in gaining evidence that Pan &amp; Scan is the work of Satan and that dubbing should be a sin.If you enjoyed the films `Schindler's List' and `La Vita é Bella', then I'm sure you'll get something out of this film.You shouldn't be turned off by the long running time of this film, you get so engrossed with the story the time just flies by. This is certainly an under-rated classic, treated poorly by some versions.10/10 If in wide-screen, un-cut and subtitled. 9/10 If Pan &amp; Scan, cut and dubbed.But as I have to give one overall score, I'd have to say 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As satisfying as the best classic novels; shame about that touch of political revisionism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All in all, I loved Bertolucci's 1900. By the end of it (I watched the uncut, 318 minute version and it was an effortless, engrossing, never over-long experience), I found myself feeling as satisfied as someone who's just finished reading one of those wonderful, very long classic novels. There are, however, some major flaws, not just in narrative structure but also in content, and this is why I've given it "just" a 9/10. It's rather disjointed and all over the place, like a huge, gangly foal rather than a harmoniously-formed horse. However, I don't agree with one accusation I heard that was leveled at it, regarding its change of tone. In my view it was unavoidable and appropriate when dealing with a historic period going from the beginning of the 20th century to the rise to power of Mussolini (1922), and finally to the culmination of full-blown Fascist oppression. The "change of tone" in the film perfectly captured the profound and shocking changes that swept over Italy, as if bitten by something that had made it go mad. My main problem with the film, however, was of content rather than structure: the over-simplification of its politics, not to mention the inaccuracy in the way it portrays the reasons for the rise of Fascism. These smack of just a little too much historical revisionism even for a tendentially left-wing person like me. But then, 1900 was made in the 70s, smack bang in the middle of a decade in which the Italian left wing had a strong hold on the country's artistic and cultural institutions. After decades of poverty, ignorance and forced silence, these institutions voiced their views with a more earnest tone than they would have had if they'd never been repressed. Pasolini, Bertolucci, Moravia and several others producing art during the 50s-70s in Italy are a prime example of this kind of voice. Inevitably, it was tinged with a political agenda ? it couldn't have been otherwise, as political freedom was a new toy and everyone was so keen to play with it. Bertolucci's film would have us believe that the rich landowners (represented here by the Berlinghieri ? Robert De Niro's character's family) were responsible alone for sponsoring the Fascists. Keen to maintain the country in an archaic state of feudalism with the poor, ignorant multitudes working their estates as semi-slaves, they encouraged or turned a blind eye to the violent cruelty of the blackshirts. They employed them as "guard dogs" (as De Niro's character Alfredo refers to Attila, Donald Sutherland's Fascist bully character at one point), giving them official charges as managers of their estates and oppressors of any sign of rebellion, etc. Though this has effectively happened, a more objective historic version will take into account that for Fascism to spread so rapidly and so well, it must have had some hold on the "common people", too. Just consider that the rich landowners were a tiny, tiny minority of the population and not all were sympathetic to Mussolini ? originally a Socialist himself. The rich often supported the monarchy and/or church instead (and Mussolini aspired to a lay state, not a religious one). It was indeed so many of the common men and women of Italy who responded well to the young Mussolini, who was neither particularly cultured nor a member of the elite, yet was a charismatic go-getter who could speak to the crowds in a way that made sense to them for the first time ever. The landowners and aristocrats, decadent and totally out of touch from reality (as Bertolucci's film shows so well), had no idea how to relate to the masses. In contrast, Mussolini wanted to harness the energy of the multitudes, giving them a sense of worth for the first time ever. What a cruel irony this turned out to be for all those people! What Bertolucci's film is successful at putting across is the fact that neutrality, turning a blind eye to and staying passive to Fascism was in itself responsible for allowing it to thrive. ****SPOILERS****: Alfredo does nothing to stop Attila and his stooges beat Olmo, G?rard Depardieu's character, to a bloody mess, despite the fact he knew that Olmo was innocent of having killed the child at the wedding party. This scene is so effective in creating a sense of frustration in the viewer. Watching that scene, it comes naturally to ask oneself: "Why didn't anyone do anything to stop it?" EXACTLY! ****END OF SPOILERS.**** Regarding the accusation leveled at the uncut version of the film containing pornographic sequences: I thought pornography's sole purpose was to titillate and arouse. Do any scenes in this movie try to achieve this? Most certainly not! Naked human bodies can be representative of so much more than just sex. They are not just about the degree of their ability to arouse or otherwise, but also about a whole other spectrum of human states and feelings. Strength, vulnerability, tenderness, compassion, closeness, distance, receptiveness and whatever else is sometimes just not possible to express in so many lines of dialogue. Why shouldn't a sexual encounter ? even one featuring genitals in view ? speak volumes about so many other aspects of men and women's humanity? I could write so much more about this movie! Though not as mesmerisingly beautiful to look at as Bertolucci's 1970 film Il Conformista, it is none the less a testament to Vittorio Storaro's genius photography once again. I will probably be watching this movie many more times and discovering more layers, more beauty and even more imperfections? which is all worthwhile when confronted with such amazing material. Whoever's been comparing 1900's portrayal of Fascism with the way it was dealt with in Il Conformista isn't being entirely fair: the latter takes a far more intellectual approach (after all, Fascism was a multi-faceted phenomenon) and is a less ambitious film anyway, therefore less likely to fail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A long and good picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most perfect historic contemporary pictures ever made. Wonderful performances of the actors Robert de Niro, Gerard Depardieu, Burt Lancaster and Donald Sutherland. This film tells us a story of two mans (Alfredo and Olmo) born in the same day back in the beginning of the twentieth century - Alfredo is a landowner, Olmo is a peasant- and their relation with friendship, love, politics. ( I think this is a film about how friendship can be true in a cruel half century that was the fist half os the "novecento").There is a Marxist view about life and about cinema itself in this Bertolucci film: the two main characters, Alfredo and Olmo, symbolize the strike between the two classes of the capitalism - the high bourgeosie that owns the land where live the proletarian. The picture tries to prove that their lives are different in the way that their different social condition can interfere. In the beginning Alfredo and Olmo are very close, because they are only child. Alfredo tries to be like Olmo. He sees in his friend the freedoom that he hasn't. He wants to be a socialist.I recommend this picture to all who like good cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful European achievement with Hollywood stars.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast list alone is fabulous:Burt Lancaster, Sterling Hayden, Robert De Niro, Donald Sutherland, Gerard Depardieu, the best of Italian artists, the incandescent Dominque Sanda, at her prime. The production team: Bertolucci as director, the DOP is Storaro, the music by Ennio Morricone. How much would such a production cost today? $100 million? $200 million? How could you fail with such a line up? Well the film was long, and there were several versions around. It played at art houses in two parts. It was a co-production, (always an ominous sign) still there isn't a DVD available. (Although I saw a laser disc version in Jakarta some 7 years ago which I taped). Is the film beautiful? Yes. Does it sound wonderful? Yes. Does it deal with large important themes across generations? Yes. So how come it doesn't knock everybody's socks off? It should, that much I believe. Its themes of socialism/communism versus fascism across 50 years or so of Italian history don't sit well with American audiences. The two political systems are personified by two sons of the estate, one rich, one poor.Such a subtle (Or not if you are from North Zanesville)device is difficult to reconcile if you are used to a hamburger menu. Many audiences want a such a simple menu- a guy falls in love, gets married, the mob kill her, he takes revenge and kills the mob. Life is a hamburger. But we in Europe know that Life is not like that, it comes with grey areas, imperfections, flaws,nuances.So the first disagreement is about politics. The second is the length of the movie; what actually are you watching, and where can you get the real longest possible version? That again nobody seems to know. The third is the lack of a DVD. That would make money and re-establish the film as a classic among the video stores to all the believers and make a new audience fall in love with this flawed masterpiece. Flawed, but still a masterpiece. So many people have not heard about it, so they don't know any better. There are some staggeringly beautiful shots that have lingered in my mind for 28 years- pure Storaro, many shot in golden hour- the boy with frogs in his hat, the countryside estate,the hunchback jester moaning about the death of Verdi,all accompanied by a typical Morricone oboe-driven melody with great intelligence and pride. Bravissimo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1900(1976) begins with the defeat of the fascist regime in Italy by the allies. The film then flashes back to 1900 with the birth of Alfredo and Olmo who belong to different social classes. It follows the lives of the grandfathers as well as the growth of their two grandchildren. Alfredo and Olmo becomes friends as young boys.Alfredo is someone who prefers to hang out with Olmo's social class then his own. Alfredo's grandfather kills himself and Olmo's grandfather dies of old age. Olmo joins the military and returns at the end of World War 1. A new helping hand is hired by Alfredo's father named Attila who later becomes a member of the Fascist party.Alfredo goes off adventures with his new wife Ada and the Fascist regime's battles with the Socialist becomes worse. Alfredo and Olmo develops a love/hate relationship and Olmo exiles from his home town to avoid being caught by the blackcoats. The film then returns to the year of 1945. 1900(1976) finishes in 1976 with Alfredo and Olmo as grandfather figures.1900(1976) does a good job in taking a narrative look at the first fifty years of the 20th Century. The film begins during the period of a new age. The film follows the early rise of the Socialist Party in Northern Italy. It describes the struggle between landowners and socialist supporters.This movie also is good at showing the rise and fall of the landowning class. 1900(1976) contains a scene which describes how the Fascist Party came into being in Italy. The landowners are the ones who planted the seeds of fascism and helped it grow to almost all powerful proportions. The film begins with birth, progresses through life, and ends in death.1900 is controvsial in its full uncut frame of 312minutes. There were many scenes deemed to be offensive that were cut from the motion picture. One such scene is the menage a trois with Alfredo, Neve(Stevania Casini), and Olmo. Another controvsial sequence is the rape and graphic murder/torture of a young boy at the hands of the fascist Attila.The art direction is beautifully filmed with a historic touch of Northern Italy. The filmmakers presents Italy during the early to mid 20th Century as a country whose identity is always changing. The motion picture gives the viewer an idea of what it might have been like in Italy during the first half of the last Century. The actors give a realistic performance and behave like the people of that era.1900(1976) is comparable to Bertolucci's award winning movie, The Last Emperor(1987). Both take a look at middle aged men and flashback to their childhood days. Both Alfredo and Pu Yi are Puppets of the system as they have no real authority to behold and are just figure heads. Finally, Alfredo and Pu Yi are part of a power structure that falls apart before they are able to establish themselves as strong and powerful leaders.Bernardo Bertolucci gives another excellent directorial performance. Vittorio Storaro does a brilliant job as the director of photography. Gerald Depardieu gives one of his top performances as Olmo(this is when he was slender and before he became known for his olfish looks). Robert De Niro's performance as Alfredo is widely overlooked by his chilling portrayal of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver(1976).Bertolucci did back to back films with two of the greatest actors in film history(Marlon Brando{Last Tango in Paris}) and (Robert De Niro{1900}). Donald Sutherland is purely evil as the hatable Attila. The make up effects were done by the man who did the effects for Let Sleeping Corpse Lie(1974), and would later provide some of the most gory effects for most of Lucio Fulci's films during the late 1970's/early 1980's(Giannetto De Rossi). 1900(1976) is a perfect movie to view together with The Last Emperor(1987).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A too much long but beautiful movie, showing the political changes in Italy in the Twentieth Century. These changes are presented and reflected through the friendship of Alfredo (Robert De Niro) and Olmo (Gerard Depardieau), from the end of World War I to the end of World War II, from the ascent of the Fascism to its decline and the ascent of the Socialism. Alfred and Olmo were born in the same day and in the same place, landowner and peasant respectively. As far as they grow up, Bertolucci presents the changes in the political scenario in Italy, affecting the relationship between these two friends. The film is a little exhaustive, but it deserves to be watched more than one time. Recommended to viewers who like European movies and particularly Italian history and Bertolucci. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "1900"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching 1900 is like walking through Italy, even more so because of the movie's length. However, this is one beautiful film with wonderful performances and great cinematography. The story is both complex and rich with detail and the characters are superbly drawn. 1900 is one of the director's finest works, more symphonic in nature than most films, and deserves a wider audience.

		<shortDescription>Flawed, yet great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An epic about Italian political history of the first half of the 20th Century, detailing the lives of two men born on the same day. Olmo (played by Gerard Depardieu as an adult) is the bastard child of peasants and is raised to be a socialist. Alfredo (Robert De Niro) is the son of a wealthy family and will someday become lord and master of all the peasants on his land. He's a pleasant man, not cruel like his father, but he won't go out of his way to help those below him in status (including Olmo, who is his closest friend and companion). It's a huge film, and very sloppy. I would guess it would be very sloppy even in its original version (the English language version is an hour shorter at least). My biggest problem with the film is the character of Olmo. As a child (played by Roberto Maccanti), he exhibits daring and independence. As an adult, he seems like a sponge and he kind of drops out of the last third of the picture, it seemed to me. My interest dropped in the character because, first, the character does not seem to follow from childhood to adulthood, and, second, Depardieu gives a dull performance. He's handsome, but in the kind of way that makes you forget that he even exists. Maccanti, as young Olmo, leaves a much bigger impression. My second biggest problem with the film is the treatment of politics. It's no secret where Bertolucci's sympathy lies, with the communists. That's fine by me, and it's good that he has Alfredo not as the villain but as a man who turns his back and continues to live his life as a wealthy man. But there are Fascists in the film, and they are lead by Donald Sutherland. Sutherland is so evil in this film it becomes amusing. He'll do anything to get what he wants, including killing old women, children, and he even headbutts a cat! I have no real problem with showing the Italian Fascists as evil, but this is cartoonishly evil. Sutherland's character's name: Attila. No sh*t! On the other hand, I cannot help but admit that Donald Sutherland has all the most memorable scenes in the film. He may be more or less one dimensional, but I'll never forget his wicked grin, and I'll never forget the splattered blood on his forehead from that cat! Robert De Niro does a lot with his role, which is the most complex in the film, probably. His performance here matches his best work. Alfredo's wife is played by Dominique Sanda. She also gives an exceptional performance, although her character could have been (and might have been, in the full version) better developed. While I have some major problems with the overall substance of the film, there's no doubt there's a genius at work here. Several, actually. Bertolucci's direction is as good as it ever was, and his ambition seems, at least for a while, peerless. He may have had several better films, but this is as much a peak in his direction as Last Tango in Paris or The Conformist. Helping him achieve greatness far beyond what should have resulted are Vittorio Storaro, providing gorgeous, sweeping photography, and Ennio Moricone, ever the trooper with another exceptional musical score. 1900, despite heavy flaws, is indeed a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Novecento is the Gone With The Wind of Italian cinema with enough American stars and one French one to make sure of its international market. It has the epic feel of Gone With The Wind, you can also compare it to any number of films based on Edna Ferber novels. It begins at the beginning of the 20th century in Northern Italy with the birth of two boys on the same day. One is the grandson of the local Padrone, Burt Lancaster who grows up to be Robert DeNiro. The second is the illegitimate grandson of the head man among the workers on Lancaster's estate, Sterling Hayden and the boy grows up to be Gerard Depardieu. This had to be Northern Italy or no one would have believed Gerard's baby blues in Sicily or Calabria.Despite the difference in class which Americans have trouble comprehending, but as Marlon Brando said in The Young Lions mean a great deal in Europe, the boys grow up to be friends. But it's not only politics that pushes them apart, it's the love of Dominique Sanda. She marries DeNiro, but he can't believe she's not get a yen for Depardieu.Like Gone With The Wind with the Civil War and Reconstruction, Novecento is set in the period from 1900 to 1945 which were tumultuous years for Italy. Until 1870 Italy was a geographical expression not a country, until the Pope surrendered sovereignty of the Papal States. Like Germany which also united at the same time it now wanted to be recognized as a leading power, Italy even got into the colonial game in Africa. Unlike every other European power it met defeat at Adowa when trying to takeover Ethiopia. That too had a major impact on the Italian psyche, something Bernard Bertolucci curiously enough did not mention.He concentrated on the age old grievances of peasants against the landlords and the internal problems it was bringing Italy. Abusive landlords and the peasants they controlled, a feudal system that was badly out of date in the industrial age which came to Italy, a bit late, but there in time to throw a lot of peasants off the land and make socialists and communists of them. The gentry, the growing middle class, the church responded in kind with its own counterrevolution, Fascism. In fact the film's villain is Donald Sutherland as a Fascist overseer that DeNiro hires and who basically takes over running the estate and politics of the locality. This is one of Sutherland's best screen performances, he will chill you to the bone with his cruelty and arrogance. He's essentially a thug who's been given political power.Running a close second is Laura Betti as DeNiro's sister who marries Sutherland and becomes a true believer in the Fascist cause. At least she sees the peasant discontent and believes Fascism will protect her privileged position. The original running time of this epic is over five hours and really should have been a mini-series. Maybe in that format we'll see the director's cut some day. It's still a powerful piece of film telling the epic story of a country for almost half a century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-reaching epic with memorable vignettes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gifted filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci, along with his collaborators, probably bit off more than they could chew with this massive epic of politics, revolution, love and war, but it's nevertheless a fascinating entertainment for those with the constitution to sit through at least 4 hours (the original long version is 5 hours +!) of imperfect dubbing.Robert DeNiro and Gerard Depardieu play, respectively, a rich landowner and a peasant, born on the same day of the new century. The story of their friendship takes them from bucolic idyll to the rise of Fascism, bloody war and its aftermath, and back again. Veterans Burt Lancaster and Sterling Hayden play their grandfathers, Dominique Sanda is the woman they both love, and Donald Sutherland inhabits the cartoonish character of Attila, their Fascist nemesis, with trademark fish-eyed malice and depravity. Gorgeous cinematography by Vittorio Storaro and a gentle, evocative score by Ennio Morricone lend this disjointed story more appeal and dramatic clarity than it might otherwise merit. If the simplistic politics at the end leaves you cold, there will have hopefully been enough vivid and touching scenes along the way to make it worthwhile.</fullReview>

NOVECENTO!I have quitted watching few films in my life, and this one would have very much deserved it, especially considering its painful length!, but I stood till the end, regretfully!. Probably I have seen no film in my life where stereotypes and identification of good and evil with particular ideologies/social classes were so clumsily and naively shown, a tale for 6 years old children contains more character introspection and development than this film.I don't want to enter historical flaws (and actually blatant manipulation of history), other commentators have put it clearly and possess more background than me on the topic. Cinematographycally the film is a succession of mostly senseless scenes, added in no logical order, which leads nowhere, and fail completely to construct anything remotely similar to what we can call a "story". The final scene of the judgment of De Niro's personage, Alfredo, is one of the worst pieces of? "whatever" I've have ever watched on screen be it cinema or TV.Interested in Bertolucci? try The Last Emperor, it seems he can do a better work when telling stories from far away his own country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To call it merely monumental would be an understatement. Bernardo Bertolucci's massive film is a masterpiece of movie-making. Richer even than his previous politically charged THE CONFORMIST. 1900 centers on the parallel lives of the wealthy bourgeois Alfredo (Robert DeNiro) and the peasant Olmo (Gerard Depardieu). They're the best of enemies growing up during the early part of the twentieth century. They share their dreams, their fears and even their women. Alfredo grows into his lifestyle quite nicely while Olmo becomes a revolutionary fighting the Fascists (embodied by cruel farm foreman Donald Sutherland as the aptly named Attila). It's brutal, horrifying, tragic and extremely well made with breathtaking cinematography by Vittorio Storaro and a jarring, sometimes perverse score by Ennio Morricone. There are scenes in this film that are very unsettling. DeNiro is excellent, capturing the passive, disengaged wealthy class that allowed Mussolini and his blackshirts to run amok. Better still is Depardieu, offering up the most passionate rebel on screen since Spartacus!The large supporting cast include Dominque Sanda, Stefania Casini, Alida Valli and, as Olmo's fire breathing grandfather, Sterling Hayden. Burt Lancaster plays the tragic (very tragic) patriarch of Alfredo's wealthy family. His cameo is truly memorable. Be wary of cut versions of the film...there are many out there. The 315 minute version is surely one of the best films to ever come out of Italy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Kids Are Born, Sutherland's a Freak, Woman Pretends To Be Blind, Kid Gets Molested, Horse Manure Is Thrown, Two Old Men Fight In the Road, The End.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have no problem with lengthy movies, and many of my favorites are over three hours. However, the longer a movie is, the more it risks losing its focus, and that's the problem with 1900. It is not boring, but it goes and on, jumping between characters, ideas, etc, and about halfway through you realize: "This narrative isn't really going anywhere. It's just unfolding in random directions." Yes, I know that the "point" of the story is to show the rise of Fascism and Socialism in Italy, and I've heard people say that you appreciate the movie more if you are Italian. I'm not, though I do love history, and politically am a Socialist, so I should sympathize with this movie, though it provides no real history lesson other than "The only reason for the rise of Fascism was Donald Sutherland's sadism and the only reason for rise of Socialism was that landowners were very mean." Furthermore, the movie is shot in the "spaghetti western" style: an Italian production with English speaking lead roles. This means that most of the supporting characters are dubbed into English, but MAN, is it some blatant dubbing that has a jarring effect! Thanks to DVDs, I can switch over to the Italian audio track, but then I'll have to put up with DeNiro and Lancaster being dubbed. Ugh! I don't get why this style of film-making became popular, because you have to put up with awful dubbing either way.The movie begins with a lengthy childhood sequence that could have been reduced to 15 minutes without hurting the story much. Bertolucci is interested in establishing settings and characterizations, but doesn't know what to do after creating them. We see a worker protest by cutting off his ear. It's a visually arresting scene, but it goes nowhere. It was nice to see character actor Sterling Hayden play a memorable role, but it's a superfluous character, who does nothing except exist as an obvious parallel to Burt Lancaster's character. Now you might say: "Oh, you're nitpicking. Every movie to some extent has superfluous characters." Yes, but the longer the movie is, the more obvious it becomes that they are superfluous. But my biggest gripe with the childhood sequence is that it focuses on two kids with dubbed voices that are OBVIOUSLY not their own, and that speak out of sync with their mouth movements.The rest of the first half of the film continues with various sequences and/or character vignettes that are often visually striking or get attention, but are not really cohesive. We get a scene with an epileptic prostitute, and a woman pretending to be blind. There's no real reason for either except that they are eccentric sequences. What exactly is wrong with Ada and why does she engage in what is borderline psychotic behavior when we first meet her? No reason is given.The second half, however, becomes dominated by the two villains, and they are two of the HAMMIEST villains I've ever seen in a movie. It isn't enough that Sutherland's character is a Fascist; he must also be a sadistic, demented, constantly sneering pedophile who is so obviously mentally unbalanced that he would never get a job in real life. His lover (though these characters are portrayed so cartoon-ishly evil that it's tough to imagine them being capable of love) is Regina, who constantly cackles like a witch. And in case it's still not clear that she's evil, she is sexually deviant as well, and harbors feelings for her cousin, who in one scene appears to be pleasuring her in the woods (why he is participating in this scene is not really explored). These two characters go from scene to scene, killing a kid here, killing an old lady there, no real point, just to show that Fascism is bad. There is a fun scene where Attila is pelted with manure, though it goes on too long (and thank you, Bertolucci, for that random closeup of a horse's rectum! I sure needed to see that). At the movie's climax, these two are chased in a witch hunt. Bertolucci goes out of his way to humiliate and degrade his villains as much as he can, literally dragging them through the mud, and while this scene is somewhat satisfying, its impact is diminished by how long it goes on, just like countless previous scenes in 1900.Well, this review is getting long (but what can you expect from a movie that tries to cover too much?) so I will sum it up: it would be a much better movie if it focused more on DeNiro and Depardieu's characters and their friendship, and lost a lot of the excess baggage. Sometimes you'll get obvious plot devices (a drifter randomly showing up to confess to a crime he didn't do, just so that Depardieu can get off the hook), at times there is no plot, and most of the time you'll find yourself thinking: "This scene would be so much more effective if it wasn't bogged down by so much excess."Here is a YouTube video I made making fun of the movie: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I4BxQ5ydMM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>huge disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Q: What happens when five true geniuses - a director, a composer and three actors - get together to make a movie that would really change the world? A: A disaster.Bertolucci was never able to write good dialogs, or to tell a coherent story, or to create deep convincing characters. He always tried to palliate that with a rather pathetic mix of realistic sex and unrealistic politics. He never had any sense of rhythm, but we always forgave him that because his lengthy shots are so beautiful, and his casting so impressive. But in this film, the usual flaws are exacerbated to such an extent that it is practically unwatchable.The story that lasts for those five bloody hours is really very simple. It's about a Good Commie Guy (Depardieu), a Bad Fasist Guy (Sutherland) and a Weak Rich Guy (de Niro). By the way, de Niro's character is in every detail a clone of the Last Emperor from another Bertolucci film: same spoiled childhood, same loneliness, same conformism, same bohemian farniente, same relationship with wife, same end as a prisoner of the people. I can think of only one other film in which so much efforts of such great actors were wasted in such a useless way, and that is "The Thin Red Line".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is gratifying to see that this film is finally receiving the recognition it deserves. The United States market never understood this film. First put off on the length distributors cut and slashed the film to a length they thought movie-goers would tolerate and produced an inferior product that made no sense. The movie-goers themselves were not of a mind-set to appreciate the themes and content of the film. It was released during the height of the disco period when the movie-going public wanted to see Saturday Night Fever and not a politically charged film. There would have been a different result if the film had been released ten years earlier, but even that possibility is doubtful. The film is unabashedly leftist and proudly exposes the virtues of Marxism, so much so it has been called the Marxist Gone With the Wind. Finally, the historical issues portrayed in the film, while familiar to European watchers, are totally unknown to American movie-goers, who never had much interest in history anyway. Still, with all of these drawbacks, its was on its release and remains widely popular in just about every other country in the world and a film of incredible beauty. I watched the 2-DVD release years after first viewing this movie in Europe when it was first released. Little did I know I was watching the European uncut, five hour plus, version, which was not available in the United States. The 2-dvd version loses little of the effect and Bertolucci does not hide his political sympathies. Some may believe that the political message detracts from the film. Far from it. Its message is more relevant today than when it was first released. Burt Lancaster and Robert de Niro took reduced fees for acting in the movie, they believed in the vision so much. De Niro made this movie immediately following Godfather II and could have demanded a higher fee, but didn't.Other reviews have taken exception to the candid depictions to the coming of age scenes, and the scenes depicting the killing of animals. While this may offend PETA sensibilities, and as difficult it is to see the slaughtering of the pig --- or any animal --- there was a point to this part of the movie. One of the purposes of this movie, Bertolucci says in the bonus features, is to remind modern day Italians where they came from. He states that the Italian viewer watching this film in the 70's was only one or two generations away from the lifestyle reflected in the movie. It is faithfully recording everyday life of Italian peasantry, a practice which lives on today in villages in Southern Europe. Nothing was wasted because they could not afford to waste anything.Folks, this is not post-modern urban life in America. American viewers in the early stages of the 21st Century may be farther removed from the practice of slaughtering livestock and scrounging for a meager existence, but as the day laborers in 1990 lived, but I can assure you that there was a day when that was precisely how Americans lived. It is how people lived their lives, until very recently, for hundreds and hundreds of years.American viewers should be more disturbed on seeing how fascism took hold in pre-WWII Italy. It is a reminder how it can happen, here or anywhere, but, ... "It Can't Happen Here" ....As difficult as these scenes are to watch, Bertolucci's 1900 is actually a rather accurate reflection of political trends in Southern Europe in general, and Pre- and Mid-WWII Italy and Greece in particular, and an accurate depiction of post WWI Italy.A particularly accurate account is the scene late in the movie, when, after the war and after the trial of Berlingheri, partisans come moving in, notifying the mob that a new government was installed, and requested everyone turn in their firearms, which they did. Roughly the same post-WWII events occurred in Greece.Whatever one may be the political predispositions of anyone viewing 1900, Bertolucci has created a film of great and exquisite beauty, with a powerful message as relevant today as when it was released. Every frame is suitable for framing, and matches the magnificent the oil painting which opens the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deeply flawed, but also quite amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So flawed that I almost feel weird giving it this high a rating. But two viewings of this somewhat bloated 5 hour plus film left me feeling the same way; The film is over-simplistic in its characters and politics, badly dubbed (with actors from all over speaking their own language, so whatever soundtrack you pick there are important characters who sound like something out of 'What's Up Tiger Lily'), and even the English spoken by DeNiro seems post- recorded, making for an oddly stiff sounding performance. Yet for all these complaints it is somehow a near-great film. There are so many moments; images, incidents that are indelible, and in the end there's such a real emotional punch to this overview of the history of Italy from 1900 to 1945 as seem through the lives of a few people in a small town that it overcomes many of the flaws. I couldn't defend the film from anyone who wanted to tear it down ? e.g. the simple-minded jingoistic endless competition between fascism and communism as if those were the only two options in the world, with both sides reduced to cartoon like figures of evil and good.But it's strengths are strong enough that I'd urge people to judge for themselves. You may find, like me, that all the flaws don't matter to you when a film has so many unforgettable moments. (although I suspect some may want to hunt down and kill me for the recommendation).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This masterpiece of cinematic brilliance is the reason films get made. Don't let the fact that it is 5 hours long daunt you - you won't feel the time. You will instead be completely absorbed in an epic story that, despite its rather simple premise of following the lives of two men, is really like watching a novel. I can't really describe the film any other way than that - it is a novel.There are some scenes that are hard to watch, especially in this day and age of political correctness and "you can't do that on television" attitude, but set your 21st century mind aside. This film shows life in its rawest form. Brutal at times, hilarious at others, but altogether real.This film defines the talents of so many household names. It has become like an old friend - like that book you read every year or two. By the end, you will find yourself utterly spent and it will stay with you forever.Novecento is one of those films you absolutely, positively must see before you die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 20th Century in Five Hours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bernardo Bertolucci's Novecento has five hours and fifteen minutes and before we know it this historical epic ends and we're left craving for more. That's the ultimate grace of Bertolucci's masterpiece: one never feels the movie's length; it flows and involves us so hypnotically in its story that we lose sense of time. The story is so finely constructed, the actors so good, the cinematography so breath-taking, the music so exciting, that one curses the unavoidable moment when the credits roll down the screen.Released in 1976, Novecento is, as the title says it, a story of Italy in the 20th century, from its beginning to the year of its release. Known in the USA as 1900, I chose the Italian title because this one misleading. The action starts the year Italian composer Verdi dies, so it's actually 1901 (Bertolucci knows the Gregorian calendar unlike the majority who believe in pop culture). Two children are born, Alfredo and Olmo, the first the heir of the Berlinghieri estate and fortune, the second the bastard offspring of Alfredo's father and a peasant woman from the Dalco clan. They grow together and their lives, although going in different ways many times, continue to intertwine throughout the decades, from the aftermath of WWI to the rise of Fascism in Italy, to the liberation of Italy in 1945; they're always together until their old age.Novecento is effectively about the organisation of the labour rights movement in Italy and its clashes with Fascism. Olmo (Gérard Depardieu), returned from the WWI, sees communism as a way of uniting the peasants in the struggle for better wages and more rights and end the hunger and humiliations perpetuated by the padrones, the bosses.Parallel to the labour rights movement's organisation is the rise of fascism, embodied by Attila Mellanchini (Donald Sutherland), the Berlinghieri forearm who organizes the local Black Shirts. In the middle of this struggle is Alfredo (Robert DeNiro), a bon vivant who only seeks pleasure and finds love in Ada (Dominique Sanda), an avant-garde woman who fascinates him with her sense of modernity. Unwilling kept away from the war thanks to his father's money, Alfredo sees Olmo's return as good news until politics and his inevitable fate of becoming the new padrone get in the way, not to mention his inability to stand up to Attila.The film is shot in four sections, each one employing a different color palette, to represent each station of the year. So the first part, Olmo and Alfredo's birth and childhood, is bathed in bright summer colors; the WWI's aftermath is filmed with autumnal browns. The Fascist reign is grey and drenched in winter rains, and only Italy's liberation gives the movie its bright early colors with the coming of springtime. This is one of the greatest achievements of Vittorio Storaro, a director of cinematography who never ceases to amaze me. He's lent his talent to many good movies over his legendary career (Apocalypse Now, The Conformist, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Reds), but I've never loved the look of one of his movies so much except perhaps in an earlier, much neglected Bertolucci movie called The Spider's Stratagem. Each shot could be a painting.The actors are also excellent here, especially the veterans Burt Lancaster (who plays Alfredo's grandfather, also named Alfredo) and Sterling Hayden, who plays Leo, the patriarch of the Dalco family. They're in the movie for about an hour, but their performances are amazing enough to leave an impression, especially Hayden's.As much as this movie is about fascism and communism, it's also about class differences and class clashes, and this is shown in the three Berlinghieri generations. Grandfather Alfredo and Leo have a relationship based on respect and co-dependence. His son Giovanni brings technology and consequently unemployment to his lands as well as the violent Attila to keep the workers in order, and also ends many of the ancestral rights the workers had. His despotic rule marks the beginning of the peasants' consciousness that change is necessary. Giovanni's brother, Ottavio, is his opposite, preferring to travel and enjoy life, much like his nephew. Finally Alfredo simply doesn't care, pursuing self-gratification and allowing Attila to gain power and impose a reign of terror in his lands, with the help of Alfredo's cousin, Regina (Laura Betti).Donald Sutherland has always had a gift for playing villains but he set a bar too high even for himself to surpass when he played Attila, the sadistic Black Shirt who crushes kittens to make philosophical points about communism, molests children and kills helpless old people. Fans of Sutherland who wish to see him at his darkest and most intimidating mustn't miss this film.DeNiro, Sanda, Betti and Depardieu are also very good, with Depardieu outshining DeNiro only because he has a more demanding and visible role. Sanda is also good, even if her role is to be basically annoying most of the time. Betti makes a great demonic pair with Sutherland. DeNiro, today the most famous of the actors who worked in this film, delivers one of his typically good performances, but he doesn't reinvent himself like in Taxi Driver or Raging Bull. This is Depardieu's film.Also worthy of note is Ennio Morricone's score, containing many of his most uplifting compositions. Bertolucci made this film to inflame hearts and rouse consciousnesses, to make viewers leave the cinemas anxious to change society and make the world a better, fairer place, so Morricone's music works perfectly with the images. And even if Bertolucci's goal ultimately failed, the movie is so well crafted its grandiose finale should leave viewers pretty upbeat and hopeful.No review of Novecento can do the movie justice. It's a work of art, it must be watched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been about 35 years since I first saw this movie. I thought it was a masterpiece then and watching it again, my opinion is the same. It is "Citizen Kane," "The Godfather,""Last Tango in Paris," Jules and Jim" and "La Dulce Vita" all rolled into one movie.After a short prologue, the movie begins with the announcement that Giuseppe Verdi is dead. Verdi was the greatest opera composer of the 19th century. It is an important clue to the movie. The movie is really a non-singing opera about the first half of the 20th century.All elements, writing, acting, cinematography, and music are superb. Its amazing seeing how young and beautiful Deniro, Depardieu and Dominique Sandra were back then. It is wonderful seeing Bert Lancaster and Sterling Haydon in one of their last works. Donald Sutherland is intense and terrifying.Nobody can be considered a completely educated humanist or an artist without seeing this movie. It is far more than a movie, it is a poem and one of the greatest works of art in cinematic history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A four-season saga of impotent gentry, lusty communists, perverse fascists, and dead animals, at 315 minutes NOVECENTO is not exactly bloated, but not quite interesting enough to justify its immense running time. There is simply not enough event to fill five hours. It's Bertolucci's HEAVEN'S GATE: the self-indulgent monster a director gets away with once in his career, just after a stunning success like Cimino's DEER HUNTER, or in this case LAST TANGO. But every third scene is just beautiful - intensely acted, lusciously filmed, passionately directed.What's interesting is that this simplified vision of Italian history, as portrayed in 50 years of exploitation, dissipation and failed revolution on a country estate, doesn't look or feel particularly Italian. This isn't because it's populated by French and American leads - Sterling Hayden, for instance, is utterly convincing as a Bolognese peasant. And it's not the direction per se, as there are flashes of neorealism and occasional moments of genuine Roman hysteria here, including most of the last hour. But its universal themes, methodical pace and visual style make this movie less an Italian drama than a generically European soap opera. As paean to the land it is Dutch, lit like a Vermeer and composed like a Rembrandt; as political polemic it's Russian, with Gerard Depardieu declaiming Marxism into the camera as if he's standing in front of the Winter Palace; as romance it's French, if anything, though Flaubert's disillusioned housewives were never this bland.There are many singularities about NOVECENTO. It's certainly the only picture to feature the penises of not merely Depardieu and Robert De Niro but Sterling Hayden; it's probably the last movie to represent cocaine as a harmless diversion; I hope it's the sole film to feature a horse anus massaged until it deposits a load into someone's hands. Most impressively, to my knowledge it's the single movie to capture the whole breadth of Donald Sutherland's talent. He is charming, funny, drunken, sadistic, swaggering, boorish, pathetic, scary, and obsequious. It is a rare film role, and an even rarer supporting turn, that allows an actor so much room; it is an uncommon actor indeed who can fill it.The same cannot be said of Depardieu's character, who unfortunately has only one face to make in the whole thing, nor De Niro's work, which is as unconvincing here as he was electrifying the same year in TAXI DRIVER. This performance ranks with his most uninspired late 90s shtick. Dominique Sanda, Laura Betti and Alida Valli are outrageously good in their limited roles, as are Hayden, Lancaster and a variety of Italian nationals. But the script wholly degenerates as the film wears on, taking an unhappy turn from pastoral eloquence to symbolist rhetoric. By the end nobody's got anything worth doing except Sutherland, and then he's dead and we've got twenty more minutes of tired verite speechifying. But it looks absolutely great all the way through. Though his obvious influences are so various and often so pretty, Vittorio Storaro's most striking images here are of things dead and dying: a hat crowned with gigged, squirming frogs; shot ducks twisting and drowning in a canal; a fleeing fascist impaled by farm implements. Not to mention the butchered hogs and raped women and children.</fullReview>

Its a typical story, one rich, one poor, with a large portion of the film taking place in Italy under Il Duce, but the handling of the film turns it into something more.The release version of this film is four hours long (and a directors cut is even longer), but don't let that stop you.

I'm going to be honest and tell you outright that you probably won't be glued to your seat the whole time, its rare that any film of any length can hold you that tightly for its full running time, however you will want to stay with and and watch to the end even if you run off to the bathroom.

		<fullReview>To explain what I think of a 6 hour movie by Bernardo Bertolucci in a review would be impossible. Suffice to say, Novecento is an epic film that succeeds more often than it fails. The failings, as I perceive them, include Novecento's tendency to drag on for more than six hours so that scenes are included that are simply unnecessary (like the strangely comic scene at the end where the Olmo (Gerard Depardieu) and Alfredo (Robert De Niro) are trying to beat each other to death) and the other problem is the blatant dubbing. But this film has some of the best cinematography ever. Bertolucci approaches his work with the soul of an artist and you can see that in the way he preparing shots and skillfully combines music with images. Most film directors would have shown far less dedication in planning how scenes are filmed, but Bertolucci's intense focus never wavers. Bertolucci also makes a very intelligent use of metaphor, such as the murder of the boy who brings the black gloves to the Fascist Attila. The boy is a metaphor for the youths who are seduced by Italian Fascism and then sent off to die in Mussolini's wars. Finally Bertolucci's Novecento is a movie that makes you think about you see. This is not mindless entertainment. The viewers are expected to study carefully how this film unfolds and more than one viewing is probably necessary to understand and truly appreciate this film. I mean this as a compliment. It is a sign of a great film when the audience is made to think carefully about what they see.ButI left out one thing: the plot. I think that Novecento is the kind of film that just has to be viewed from beginning to end to be understood. This movie does not belong to any genre and any plot summary by me will amount to a gross understatement. So don't ask me what it is about. Just watch it for yourself and arrive at your own conclusions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The (Rough Draft) of One of the Greatest Films of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My title sums it up really well, modesty be damned. I would give this film an award for having the best potential. What could be better than a film written and directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, scored by Ennio Morricone, photographed by Vittorio Storaro; using the acting talents of Robert DeNiro, Gerard Depardieu, Dominique Sanda, Burt Lancaster, and Donald Sutherland, for a whole 315 minutes? Apparently, a lot. Novecento (which I refuse to call 1900 because none of it actually takes place during that actual year) usually has the same critique: moments of true brilliance, with other stuff thrown in. My favorite review used the metaphor of a delicious pasta salad, with chunks of Velveeta thrown in.Truly, this films really does look delicious at first. My mouth was watering, at least. This is the stuff dreams are made of, or so I hoped. For starters, it was directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, who is one of my favorite directors, and maybe even my favorite. He had come from making two masterpieces: The Conformist and Last Tango in Paris. Ennio Morricone, well, need I say more? The same goes for Vittorio Storaro, whom I consider to be the greatest color cinematographer. The cast is made up of international greats. Did I mention it was a whole 315 minutes?During the first four hours of so, this movie was really something special. Yeah, there were a few of those "chunks of Velveeta" thrown in, but they were heavily outweighed. I'm glad to say that the pacing was excellent. Then the ending came around, and I had to ask my self, "What went wrong?"Let me start by stating what did not go wrong. The score, for one, did not go wrong. The cinematography was great as always. Some of the main performances, such as those by Burt Lancaster and Gerard Depardieu, were really good. I hate to admit it, but I really blame Bernardo Bertolucci. Don't get me wrong, this man is a genius. I'm just sad that he had to mess up his first epic. While Bertolucci's masterful touch is felt throughout most of the film, he just got carried away. This film is drunk in politics. His masterpiece, The Conformist, is very balanced in its politics (both consist mainly of anti-fascism, and maybe a little pro-communism). Most of the chunks of Velveeta are the bits of politics thrown haphazardly into the film.There are also some of the characters: the villains are so hammy (and fascist), Robert DeNiro puts on a frankly bad performance, and the peasants seem kind of cheesy at times (although they're perfectly fine throughout most of the movie).In the end, I would still give this a positive rating. If some of the political junk wasn't thrown in, we could have ourselves a masterpiece. Unfortunately, movies cost too much to have final drafts, so we have to live with what it is. Personally, I am perfectly fine with that, but it makes me sad to think of what could have been. Oh, Bertolucci, if you hadn't made such good films before, I don't know how I could forgive you....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bertolucci's most ambitious production, if not perfect then with the aspirations of great art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here it is, finally after over thirty years of wait, 1900 (Novecento) is out on DVD for those who never got to see the full uncut version (which were most Americans, particularly those who didn't see it on VHS years ago), and it's happy to report that the picture comes in a small variety of language/subtitle options. While one wouldn't want this to be simply a report on the condition of the DVD- albeit there's an interesting interview with Bernardo Bertolucci on the 2nd disc- it would be important to note how one might feel about switching back and forth and/or committing to watching the picture in a particular language. This isn't a Leone western, after all, where it's not too horrible to watch it in simple English all the way through for its crucial American stars. There's American actors, as well as a few others, who speak English, and then a host of hundreds of extras and supporting players speaking the native tongue. In short advice, stick mostly with English (it is people like De Niro, Sutherland, Depardieu and Lancaster here after all), but for those little moments like with the children in the first quarter, try some of the Italian portions for realism sake.Because this is, indeed, such an ambitious work, such a passion project, such a work by a director running strong off the steam of his previous successes (The Conformist, Last Tango in Paris), a work including people from all over Europe and the States, and according to the director with the original- and later admitted naive- intention of the picture being a "bridge" between the US and Russia, that it's easy to say it is a big waste. It is a huge film, covering a story that includes multiple human dimensions, character arcs, and a political canvas that is explicitly Marxist at the least in iconography if not in message. It got lauded in the US even at its *abbreviated* four hour running time, and has only recently been rediscovered. But then again it will either seem a success artistically or a mess, or maybe both depending on how much a viewer can take of Bertolucci's pirouetting camera movements and the occasional jarring scene transition.It covers, essentially, a tale of friendship, which to me is a strength in conventional wisdom: the two sides of the coin on a farm in the first half of the 20th century, as Alfredo (as an adult De Niro) and Olmo (as an adult Depardieu) become close friends after sharing the same birthday, but lead different paths as the former is the inheritor of the land turned quasi fascist and the latter is a worker-cum-socialist. Bertolucci enriches the saga with relationships with women, one severed with Olmo and the other a very jagged tale with Dominique Sanda as moody Ada, and with a vicious villain with the ultimate fascist Attilla (get it?) played by Sutherland. For all of the pieces of the story that bulk up the picture to its current length, for the most part all of the sections are important in building up who our two 'sides' are, and how certain personal events (i.e. Lancaster and Haydens' respective deaths, the theft of a gun, the pressures with violence and their unspoken destinies) shape them as much if not more than the state of politics.It's so rich and alive and engrossing a story, with moments that intrigue and question and actually shock (a certain scene with a cat and Sutherland had me cringe, and another with a boy had my mouth drop), that it's a shame to report it's not the pinnacle of Bertolucci's career. It is probably too long, by how much I can't definitively say; it isn't acted all around greatly (Sanda, for example, has no place being among the likes of De Niro and Sutherland and Depardieu who all deliver real top shelf work here, particularly De Niro as his mid-point between Corleone and Bickle); and as mentioned some scenes transition a little suddenly, like with a key turning point scene at a wedding that goes on to a pig killing some undetermined time later.And yet all of these flaws are somewhat minuscule in the grandiosity of the film as a whole. It's full of tremendous cinematography by given virtuoso Vittorio Storaro, it's got that classic score by Ennio Morricone that reminds us he didn't just score gun fights, and its so frank in how it expresses its mix of sex, violence and politics that it blends the line between melodrama and realism to an unbelievable T. There's even a kind of double (or even triple) climax that goes from invigorating to bittersweet and finally really, really strange. It's ultimately the work of a filmmaker who actually used momentary carte blanche to his advantage and carved out his own piece of history. Whether or not it connected with everyone is another matter. Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable - Despite Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1900 is not Bertolucci's best film. That honour would go to his one true masterpiece, "Il Conformista". It is, however, his last great film before a 1980s slide into movie mediocrity that only recently showed signs of coming to a halt with "The Dreamers". 1900 encapsulates all that was great about Bertolucci - confronting themes, stunning visuals, copious nudity and lashings of gratuitous violence. Unfortunately, 1900 also contains some of the rot that would later stain his output to an increasingly large extent.Despite the colossal five and a half hour running time, 1900 is, at heart, a rather simple tale of friendship between Alfredo, born into nobility, and Olmo, a peasant. This friendship is set against the political landscape of early 20th century Italy, with the rise and fall of fascism and the growing influence of socialism. 1900 succeeds brilliantly when examining the central relationship between Alfredo and Olmo, and their vastly different experiences with fascism. It is far less successful at conveying the context of events, wallowing happily in stereotypes and historical inaccuracies. Bertolucci has a message and he is intent on relentlessly beating the viewer over the head with it.The clumsy handling of historical events is not the only problem with 1900. Like many of his later films, Bertolucci strongly favours style over substance. Every effort has been made to turn the film into a visual feast, yet considerably less effort has gone into the film's plot, character development and dialogue. Characters haphazardly appear and disappear, there are various pointless subplots which detract from the film's momentum and the minor characters are such caricatures that 1900 sometimes feels more like an incredibly elaborate soap opera (with lots of animal violence and frontal nudity) than the masterpiece it is held out to be.Despite these many flaws, 1900 somehow manages to hold your attention over the most of the running time and offers some of the most arresting and unforgettable images captured on film. 1900 benefits immeasurably from Bertolucci's inspired direction, which is effortlessly beautiful and fluid. The performances are similarly magnificent. Gerard Depardieu is especially fine as Olmo. He is engaging and utterly convincing. Robert De Niro reminds you how good an actor he used to be in the role of Alfredo. While the beautiful Dominique Sanda almost steals the show as Ada, the only three dimensional female character in the film. I particularly love the scene where she pretends to be blind at a dance. Donald Sutherland, never the most subtle of actors, is so over the top as the evil Attila that it almost defies belief. This degree of overacting would shock Christopher Walken. Nevertheless, there is something mesmerising about his creepy performance and his character is responsible for some of the film's most shocking images.1900 is still a controversial film by today's standards. The penis fondling depicted in the infamous threesome scene may pale in comparison to the rampant sexual activity contained in films like "Nine Songs" and "Intimacy", but the shock value of the child murder and animal cruelty is undiminished. I really hope that was a "stunt kitten". I also can't say I've seen too many recent films which show an old man explicitly rubbing a horse's anus to stimulate defecation. Bertolucci's talent is such that these confronting images are captured with the same sense of poetry as those which are intrinsically beautiful.1900 is a film that demands your attention. It may not be able to keep it over the full five and a half hours, but it comes very close. Though occasionally frustrating and uneven, 1900 is a film that is hard to ignore and even harder to forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite many memorable scenes, overall far too long and unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard about this film as having a decent cast and its fairly good rating here on IMDb, I greatly anticipated seeing it despite its colossal running time. I am capable of sitting through long films and have done so with The Green Mile, Once Upon a Time in America, THe Godfather Trilogy and Titanic. However, 5 hours simply seemed too long. Having watched both Acts of the film (running about 2 1/2 hours each) separately to ensure I wouldn't get hasty, I still ended up being disappointed.I won't get into the plot too deeply purely because that is not what the films problem is. Simplified, it is about fascism and socialism. The biggest problem is the film runs far too long. As mentioned before, I am able to sit and watch a film if it holds my attention and constantly keeps me engaged as those mentioned films did brilliantly. This film doesn't and in my opinion runs at least 2 hours too long. The problem is there are so many pointless scenes and subplots that are often forgotten and add virtually nothing to the story that they really could and should have been cut out. In particular, I found the scenes of the leads at a younger age outstayed their welcome and should have been greatly shortened. Many others throughout follow a similar trend. Another reason the film should have been shortened is that it really is telling a simple story that doesn't require such a huge length of time to tell it. In the final hour I was getting incredibly agitated and felt the story was deliberately dragging on for the sake of it. When the credits finally rolled I felt cheated and very unsatisfied.Despite these heavy flaws, there are things that make the film slightly worth watching. First of all are the decent performances turned in by most of the cast. DeNiro, Deprardieu, Sutherland and most of the others are fine with Sutherland making his character an incredibly evil and unlikable person. DeNiro was the main actor who attracted me to this film and it seems to be a largely forgotten role of his. Although its not one of his best performances he really is brave and committed here as he features in two pornographic sequences that I can't imagine too many well-known actors are willing to engage in.The best aspect of the film is the Vittorio Stanto's wonderful Cinematography that makes the most of the Italian countryside and many other wonderful landscapes. Ennio Morricone's score is fairly good also.Several scenes work well, but unfortunately I was put off by the sheer amount of pointless ones that made the film as long as it was.I would recommend seeing this film only for the performances and cinematography. I would also recommend finding a much shorter cut because I believe it may be much better if it was between 2 and 3 hours or even less.Overall I give the film a generous 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to warn non-italians: do not take this movie too seriously.The cast is impressive and the theme is ambitious: however, the movie contains major historical imprecisions over the origins and rise of Fascism. The pre-fascist social struggle and the daily life and mentality of farmers are represented in a most unrealistic and historically imprecise way as well. The main interest of the director seem to be grandiosity and spectacularization, at the expenses of authenticity.In conclusion, in my opinion, 1900 isn't Italy - it is Hollywood! By 1976, a large part of Italian cinema had already lost its intellectual autonomy from Hollywood, autonomy that was instead still retained in the 60s - see the various masterpieces interpreted by Alberto Sordi, Sophia Loren, Marcello Mastroianni, Claudia Cardinale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Communism is a disease. It can destroy the world!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Powerful words for me to hear, having bought and watched this movie here in China...It is unusually interesting to read the reviews of professional film critics about Bernardo Bertolucci's wildly ambitious "1900," which in my opinion stumbles in no small part because it resembles too much some of Bertolucci's other films, notably of the bizarre European sex drama variety. I have a secret theory that any legitimate film that portrays graphic sexual acts has sort of a glass ceiling, a level of quality that it can't surpass, no matter how spectacular the rest of the film is. That, like the graphic pig-slaughtering scene, is simply bad taste. 1900 is no exception, and the saddest thing is that the rest of the film is not even very good, it's just really long. In fact, at just over five hours, it's one of the longest films I've ever seen, second only to Stephen King's 6-hour The Stand, which was made for TV anyway. In all of the professional reviews I've read, I've noticed some unusually interesting examinations of what went wrong with Bertolucci's much anticipated epic film, and yet not one of them seems to have the nerve to come out and say what is so obviously the problem. And unfortunately, the horrendously bad taste doesn't end at the literally pornographic nudity. I can't think of any legitimate reason why we should have to watch a pig being butchered and then sliced in half, or (and this one truly blew my mind) see a man massage a horse's anus with his bare hands and then gleefully catch the steaming excrement in his hands. And to make matters worse, Bertolucci, in one of the short documentaries on the DVD re-release of the film, made the shocking claim that "I thought it was very innocent at the time." It could very easily be said that he had no grip on reality when he made the film. Much of it is truly sickening.And the characterization is no different. Donald Sutherland is one of my favorite actors, and Bertolucci managed to coax a ridiculously cartoonish and offensive performance out of him. He is, of course, a Fascist blackshirt (a bad guy), and we are most certainly not allowed to forget that. He has frightening, devilishly toothy grin, a cold, killers stare, and he wears a skull and crossbones on his shirt. He also, by the way, wantonly kills kittens and children. I only wish I could say that I was just being dramatic when I say that...The film tells the story of an era, not of its main characters, but it tells that story through the lives of the characters. DeNiro plays Alfredo Berlighieri, the son of a wealthy landowner, and best friend of Olmo Dalco (Gerard Depardieu), a the son of a peasant who works for Alfredo's father. The scenes of their childhood are alternately fascinating and revolting, as we learn of their friendship despite their different backgrounds and yet are forced to sit through scenes of them as 12 or 13 year old boys examining and comparing their penises. There is no need for something like this in any film in any country at any time. Ever. From here on, respectable members of the audience may find it difficult to forgive this perverse nonsense and objectively enjoy the rest of the film. I also love the weakness of the characterization in the film. There is a scene early in the film where Olmo's father gives him a rousing speech about going off to join the military and maybe even learn to obey and take a wife but never forget that he comes from peasants, and just to make sure everyone in the audience has figured out that this is not a family of nobility, Olmo walks his dirty bare feet across a lengthy and crowded dinner table as his father gives him the speech. No one seems to mind.From a technical standpoint the film is a total, belligerent disaster. Everything is dubbed over, so no one's voice matches their facial movements, which are in turn exaggerated by the actors so they can try to more easily match up the dialogue later. It rarely ever works, and so their voices and the ambient sound is totally off from beginning to end. The photography, on the other hand, is brilliant, but as Ebert suggested, it comes across almost like an apology for the narrative mess of the rest of the film.Most interesting is that Bertolucci managed to make such an incompetent film with such stupendously talented actors as Gerard Depardieu, Robert DeNiro, and Donald Sutherland. Sutherland's character is so cartoonish that it's nearly impossible to take anything about his performance seriously, but DeNiro and Depardieu are both outstanding in their roles, which are mirror images of each other in more ways than one. Unfortunately, as becomes completely obvious in the film's closing scene, Bertolucci just had no idea what to do with them. 1900 is not a complete failure, but it is as close as I've ever seen a film this big come to being one. It is not a successful or even a respectable effort, but it is definitely an ARDUOUS effort, kind of like sitting through the whole movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An epic......disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's very difficult for me to understand the love for this film. It may, in fact, be one of the worst films I have ever seen. No character is really developed, despite the over 5 hour run time, and one of them, the Padrone DeNiro's wife, may be the single most annoying character ever set in a movie.Speaking of DeNiro, roughly 80% of his dialogue sounds like he doesn't really even care what he's saying. Poor Donald Sutherland was given the diabolical "Attila" role. It's pretty much a one note performance of evil and stupidity from beginning to end. Scenes are in the film which serve no purpose other than to bore the audience to tears, or in my case, make me cry from laughing. After a young boy is killed, the guests at a wedding run around in the scene immediately following as if they were in a Keystone cops movie. One of the lead characters is named Olmo, which was the basis for another film years later called St. Olmo's Fire. Oh wait, I meant he was the basis for a stupid Muppet on Sesame Street. There's a scene where a character gets his face stuffed with horse manure. That experience is very similar to watching this film. 1900 is simply another 1970's catastrophe along the lines of Heaven's Gate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bertolucci masterpiece. Possibly one of his best with one qualification</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the rather in-genuine acting of De Niro in this movie( also noted by others) this film stands out as a masterpiece of Italian cinema, rising above its own storyline to show the viewer something greater then the sum of its parts.Depardieu is fantastic as Olmo. Supporting cast also excellent. Having never been to Italy, one has the sense that Bertolucci has revealed the heart of the Italian people and their struggles against despotic leaders and fascist movements. The ultimate will of the people remains supreme.Cinematography is fantastic and details well observed. This story is much more then the rivalry between two friends. The story encompasses all the changes in Italy in the first 45 years after 1900.See it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bertolucci's flawed epic... certainly worth experiencing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1900 was director Bernardo Bertolucci follow up to the Italian masterpiece, The Conformist, and his legendary work, The Last Tango in Paris. Like Michael Cimmino's similarly flawed-epic, Heaven's Gate, it shows what happens when an acclaimed director gets control of the ultimate cast and an unlimited budget, and is allowed to go over-schedule on a sprawling personal project, without the interference of the studios. As a result of this, 1900 is a deeply flawed film, really falling apart somewhere towards the end and to some extent, slipping away from Bertolucci's grasp as a result of the sheer epic scale of the project. The story begins in the year 1901, on the day of Verdi's death. As the people mourn, the backdrop to the story finds two boys born on the same day - the first boy, Alfredo, is the son of a wealthy landowner... the second boy, Olmo, is the bastard son of a farm labourer - as the story progresses, the two boys become central to the ultimate story, developing a strong friendship that will play-out against a backdrop of war, socialism and the rise of the Fascist party in early twentieth-century Italy. Bertolucci confuses matters further by having the film begin during the 1945 Liberation Day; using this pivotal moment as a framing device to launch into his epic back-story, only to emerge at the end of the story some many years in the future.The story isn't quite as confusing as it sounds, with the director anchoring the story throughout to the characters of Olmo and Alfredo. In the early scenes, we see the two boys living an idyllic "Huckleberry Finn" style existence, catching frogs, play-fighting, testing each other's bravery with a series of dares whilst, all the while, succumbing to the lifestyle of their respective families. This will eventually, to some extent, tear the two friends apart, as the hard working Olmo sides with the communists whilst Alfredo, torn by loyalty and greed, allows the fascists to operate on his land. As you would expect from an epic, the film introduced lots of background characters, with the film taking in three generations of Italian history over the course of its vast, five-hour running time. Some of the history of the film is glossed over... with Bertolucci falling into an uneasy habit of switching between oblique, allegorical metaphors and almost bludgeoning political ideologies. Also, we're never really sure of whom we're supposed to be rooting for; clearly, Bertolucci wants us to side with the socialists, but they come across as spineless cowards who can only afflict revenge on the fascists and the landowners once they have been stripped of all their power. For the most part, the socialists wander around singing songs to each other, never once trying to convince us of their suffering, whilst Bertolucci seemingly thinks that if he makes them dirty enough, or ugly enough, we'll feel sympathy for them regardless. It doesn't quite work.However, despite these flaws, the film is still a monumental achievement. This is an epic in the classic sense, recalling films like The Godfather and Visconti's The Leopard (Burt Lancaster plays a role here that is very similar to the role of Don Fabrizio Salina, which he played in that particular film). It's also very similar to that other flawed Italian filmmaker's epic, Once Upon A Time in America, with both films employing the use of a flash-back/framing devise, as well as a thematic scope that covers a similar period in history (albeit, this is about Italy rather than America). Like Leone's film, 1900 is vast and sprawling, though anchored to two characters and their personal relationships. Like Once Upon A Time... 1900 is a very brutal and confrontational film, with many violent sequences and scenes of outrageous sexuality. The version that I have (the one shown on Film Four) is as close to uncut as can be shown in this county (only one shot, the one in which the young Alfredo plays with himself in order to achieve an erection, was digitally darkened around the genital areas so that nothing could be seen); with Bertolucci taking almost every scene and characterisation completely over the top. This method is most apparent with the character of Attila, the lead-fascist in the film, who, in one of his earliest appearances, ties a kitten to the wall and then head buts it. This prefigures a later scene, in which Bertolucci implies that Attila has raped a small boy, only for Attila to then pick the child up by the ankles and swing him around the room until his skull shatters against a post.Some of the performances in the film are very strong, particularly DeNiro as Alfredo, Gérard Depardieu as Olmo, Dominique Sanda as Ada, Sterling Hayden as Olmo's grandpa Leo, Burt Lancaster as the patriarch Berlinghieri and Donald Sutherland as the snarling "villain" Attila, whilst that gorgeous cinematography from Vittorio Storaro is just exquisite (the camera always moving, blocking, tracking, revealing, swooping around the characters with the most gorgeous colours imaginable). It's easily one of the most beautiful films ever made, adding to the epic nature of the story and the feelings evoked through Ennio Morricone's great score. 1900 might not be the greatest film ever made, but I feel that it is an important film, both in terms of style and ambition. It's a definite flawed masterpiece, with a great cast and a talented director at the height of their creative prowess. As both an outrageous, overblown melodrama and as a political allegory/treatise on loyalty and friendship, it's worth looking out for and is an interesting relic to one of the most-important eras of cinema history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A magnificent Marxist soap opera with moments of greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1900 is a mixture of the good, the bad and the ugly of Italian cinema. Bertolucci's defiantly left wing political epic at times plays like a Sidney Sheldon doorstop novel as written by a disciple of Karl Marx, has a laughable first hour and some performances that are so far over the top they've circumnavigate the globe and come back again. Yet it also has moments of genuine power, a sweeping ambition to it and is one of the most beautifully photographed films ever made due to Vittorio Storaro's wondrous combination of natural light, backlighting and the 'magic hour' as the situation demands. Ennio Morricone's score is consistently one of his best as well, ensuring that the film sounds as good as it looks.Chief debit is Burt Lancaster's senile padrone, hanging himself because he can't even get the erection he needs to rape the child of one of his employees: no gattapardo he. Donald Sutherland's socially mobile foreman-turned-fascist thug veers between plus and minus ? it's a broad performance, as you'd expect from a character whose idea of political debate is to head butt a kitten to death (it's an extremely tough film on animals: the kitten's death may be faked but none of the other animal killings are), although there are moments that ring true in the latter section.It was an interesting experiment to try to gauge the actors original intent by flitting between the various soundtracks on the European DVD ? the preferred English soundtrack gives you De Niro, Sutherland, Lancaster, Stirling Hayden and Dominique Sanda talking for themselves, the French offers Depardieu's voice while the Italian gives you more natural vocalisation for the majority of the smaller parts, as des the German.Ultimately it doesn't amount to much ? the basic thesis can be reduced to "Fascism, socialism ? huh. Both as bad as each other," with paradise postponed once again at the very moment of liberation and the status quo more or less restored for the rest of the century. But there's a side of me that can't help thinking that for the most part it's a movie about peasants' rights made by a group of people who are now multi-millionaires who'll make almost anything if you write them a big enough check?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"1900" is one of the best historic epic made by Bernardo Bertolucci. As you know, Bernardo Bertolucci is a great film master in Italy. He has made many excellent films such as 'Before the Revolution', 'The Spider's Stratagem', 'The Conformist', and 'Last Tango in Paris'.'1900' was made after 'Last Tango in Paris', and it has long running time more than 4 hours. (Original uncut version is 5 hours and half long). In spite of long running time, this film is not boring at all.This film shows political and social history in the early twenty century in Italy through two famous actors, Robert De Niro and Gerard Depardieu. Gerard Depardieu symbolizes a Maxist, and Robert De Niro shows at the end of the fascism as an irresolute fascist. However, this film still has a controversial point. That is about the end of the film. Many people assert the defeatism in Italy. I think that was just reality at that time. Because at that time, in Italy, the fascism and the Maxism were opposed by many people. Also, Bertolucci was a Maxist. Maybe, as I guess, Bertolucci made this film realistically about his feeling and thought. But, I am not sure because I am not a Italian.Anyway, this film is absolutely one of the best movies. This film has good directing, good photographing by Vittorio Storaro (a master of photography), and good casting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand film of a simple story, with complex characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel that Bertolucci shot this film with the intention of giving all characters an opportunity to develop and grow just as the films storyline grows. One could ask the question "why so much content without the main characters in scene?", and my answer would be; "would you remove pages from a hardcover book, just to make it fit your pocket?". This is masterful film making, wonderful cinematography, exceptional feel for the era and classic example of "full-circle" storytelling. The depiction of the strong rebellious son of a peasant farmer born at the turn of the 20th century, which coincides with the birth of a wealthy landowners son who is passive in nature but bred into a fascist society, become childhood friends but in adulthood, adversaries on principals and politics.Not one element in this film is shot as filler, each scene gives a different emotion and captures your attention on multiple levels. Do not expect to be held with suspense but rather let each moment be absorbed and the art of Bertolucci will be evident. Although this story takes place in Italy and gives some historical representation, it truly is a simple story that could be retold in almost any nation of any era, but with different circumstances. I recommend this film for any movie buff or true film lover, it is not a popcorn and cuddle up in the family-room type of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disastrous mishmash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a ham-handed propaganda film extolling the virtues of the agrarian peasant and excoriating the wicked landowners of Italy in the early 1900's. But even as political screed it doesn't work. Early in the movie a peasant boy who has hunted frogs and sold them for a coin is ordered by his father to turn over his coin, explaining that he should never forget what he has is there for the rest of the suffering peasants on the farm. Given that the boy has just been hijacked by his father, it makes one wonder why he would ever do anything enterprising again ... his father would just take it away, and justify it with a Communist cliché to boot. If the boy's future feelings about his father were true to his experience in the movie, he would of course hate his father. But this is not the case, and the character becomes a good little socialist. Motives of other characters are equally confusing. Why does anything happen in this film? It jumps from unrelated scene to unrelated scene, dramatic music alerting us that what is happening is very important. Characters engage in histrionic acting out (somebody cuts off his own ear to indicate strong feelings) for reasons never explained. Donald Sutherlund brutalizes and kills a cat to indicate some political point. Over the top Italian emoting is mixed with sloganeering -- "exploited workers of the world must unite against their oppressors," etc., etc.. Actors speak with Italian accents at times, but at other times the effort just seems too much, and the accent devolves to British or American. The early parts of the movie, which I focus on because I could not watch the whole thing, are filmed in lush gold and green colors. Peasants cut hay with their scythes in the fields, golden sunshine everywhere. It seems impossible to be miserable in such an environment... this is not the cold, bleak suffering of Russian peasants. Yet unhappy they are, presumably in some kind of comradely solidarity with their Soviet counterparts. Motives seem to be tied to identification with political cause, not individual experience. At other times people just act silly, dancing grotesquely or rolling around in homo-erotic horse play. Characters seem to take themselves very seriously; there is plenty of sobbing, plenty of bitter speeches. But I could not identify with any of it. The movie failed to engage me enough to care in any way about any character. Did the director somehow think that putting a bunch of characters with histrionic personality disorders together in a room would lead to profundity? It's ludicrous. Save yourself from five hours of wasted time. Don't see this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic historical movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Historical movies often tend to have little content besides the historical foundation they are built on. Yet this one here is different. On the background of the Italian political systems between 1900 and 1945 we both get a history lesson and see a great human story. The film has a very international cast, French, American, Italian etc. and its way of storytelling does also not follow the specific traditions of a certain national cinema. On the same day in 1900 two children are born on a strictly aristocratic farm in the Italian province of Emilia Romagna: One on the "slave's" side and one on the "master's" side. They grow up together, but in two totally different worlds. Yet somehow they become in a way friends. But the difference of their class origin can never be overcome. The final clash starts, when in 1945 after the Allied invasion Italy becomes democratic and the old system is abolished. If you get the chance to see it, go for it. It's over 4 hours long, but those four hours are a very rewarding experience. 9 of 10 points!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best films in the history of film making. You have wonderful actors, a history lesson and real peoples with dept. Everything you want if you are a film lover. If you don't like this film you are probably 14 years old and like the police academy no 48. The film tells the story of how people become either a upper class landowner or a slave. It is the background of conflicts all over the world. The film teach you also the dept of the different characters. All have some good and some bad inside. The only persons that are only bad are the fascist played by Donald Sutherland. One of his best acts ever. Burt Lancaster as the old father is also splendid. The only problem with this film is that its to short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a memorabilia of what leftist propaganda (wich I've got nothing against per se) was in the 1970s, "1900" is vaguely interesting. As a movie, it sucks big time. The issue is not that it's long -I love Visconti or Tarkowski- it's that it's long AND silly AND pretentious. And incidentally a huge waste of talents, given the stellar cast. My 2 main problems with 1900 were: 1) the story (or rather its political bias). During 5 hours you are presented to a piece of political "perspective" which would be more to the point in an old Walt Disney cartoon: Fascists are a minority of bad, ugly, pervert, and eyes-rolling murderers (how they came to power in Italy appears to be mystery, by the way). Landowners are (obviously) decadent, lazy, with a hint of sexual impotence. Communists are hard-working, beautiful, saint-like beings - their political aim appear to peacefully sing "the International" while toiling in the fields. Apparently, Mr Bertolucci learned his XXth Century history in "the Good, the Bad and the Ugly". 2) the soundtrack is awful. Apparently all actors are post-synced, so that de Niro's voice can be heard in the English version (but it doesn't look like he was actually saying his lines while the film was shot), Depardieu in the french version etc... Besides the music of Morricone -I'm sorry to have to disagree with some of my fellow IMDb reviewers- is quite bad.After a couple of hours (and despite the temptation to call it a day) I watched the rest of the movie hesitating between consternation and plain hilarity. In the end I just chose the latter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in Italy, the film follows the lives and interactions of two boys/men, one born of peasant stock (Depardieu), the other born to a land owner (deNiro). The drama spans from 1900 to about 1945, and focuses mainly on the rise of Fascism and the peasants' eventual reaction by supporting Communism, and how these events shape the destinies of the two main characters.This film excels as an epic, and must be commended for catching Robert DeNiro early enough in his career that he was able to sneak away for what could be called an art film, and then have nobody in America even notice that he did it.But also, that wonk scene... DeNiro and Depardieu? Forty years later, how do you live that down? They have both become huge stars, and Stefania Cassini has her own following, thanks in part to her role in "Suspiria".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Long Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1900 or Novecento is an Italian epic film by Bernardo Bertolucci that tells the story of two men during the political turmoils that have taken place in Italy during the first half of the 20th century.It features Robert De Niro and Gérard Depardieu together with Dominique Sanda, Donald Sutherland, Alida Valli, and Burt Lancaster. This is a 255-minute film that is sometimes shown into two parts due to its enormous length.Set in the Italian town of Parma, the film's continuity backtracks from Liberation Day in 1945 to the occasion of composer/patriot Giuseppe Verdi's death in 1901. The two men involved in the story are Alfredo Berlinghieti and Olmo Dalco. Wealthy Alfredo sinks into dissipation, while poverty-stricken Olmo becomes a firebrand labor leader and communist. The two meet each other when Alfredo goes back to Parma to handle Olmo's trial.The movie has a classic feel due to the lavish cinematography by Vittorio Storaro and the magnificent score by Ennio Morricone.The performance was also great especially by De Niro and Gérard Depardieu.Also,Bertolucci provides a great socio-political commentary and makes the viewer feel the richness of the Italian landscape.It was just unfortunate that it fell short of being a classic due to its cumbersome length and probably its being too ambitious in setting up so many goals for the films that not all of them are realized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Occasionally enchanting, unremittingly ambitious, frequently perplexing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two friends ? Alfredo Berlinghieri (Robert De Niro) and Olmo Dalc? (Gérard Depardieu) ? come from two different social classes. The former is an aristocrat who is relatively good to his subordinates, while the latter is a bastard peasant's son believing in communism. Their social stances entail clashes between them in the first half of the 20th century during which numerous disturbances occur? This glossy, contentious epic directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and stunningly shot by the great Vittorio Storaro is occasionally enchanting, unremittingly ambitious, frequently perplexing as well as overflowed with concepts and self-indulgent monologues. Viewing this imposing film is like peering at a dilapidated ancient temple ? the further a visitor steps in, the more constructional damages he beholds. As usual in case of Bertolucci's efforts, the ensemble is displayed in a non-linear manner, beginning on the day of the liberation of Italy in 1945 and successively recurring to the moment of two protagonists' birth ? they are born on the same day. This time the composition is not to blame forasmuch the entire action unfolds in a relatively straight-forward way, evading any unnecessary intervals and being one huge flashback itself. Upon being regaled with an enviable artistic freedom, Mr Bertolucci executes his tale about political maelstrom in fascist Italy with indubitable meticulousness and surgical precision. The first act is particularly ravishing and owing to the length of the movie, Bertolucci is able to render characters sufficiently profound and their intentions and needs plausible. There is a fine role of Alfredo Berlinghieri the Elder (an uncle of the protagonist played by De Niro) acted by Burt Lancaster which conveys psychological depth to the motion picture and resembles Prince Don Fabrizio Salina from Il Gattopardo (1963) by Luchino Visconti, likewise performed by Lancaster. Alfredo Berlinghieri The Elder cannot disclose any consolation in his old age and feels desolated by his family which is generally preoccupied with their inheritance. But for this poignant character, it would have appeared a mere communist propaganda. In the second half, the realistic tone is upended by a virtually caricatural couple of fascists played by Donald Sutherland and Laura Betti. Their relationship which is prefaced by an excessively pompous monologue proclaimed by Sutherland seems unrealistic and the nature of their first sexual experience involves a young boy who supposedly is raped by them (nothing is exposed explicitly). The entire sequence transpires in one of the rooms of the Berlinghieri's mansion as though it was a perfect place to perform forbidden acts such as paedophilia. It's likewise far-fetched that the publicly-recognised fascist dares to debauch a small boy as if he wasn't apprehensive of possible consequences. The entire event which is supposed to be disturbing is very contrived, forced and improbable ? the entire situation's purpose is concealed by a backdrop of incomprehensibility. Possibly it is intended to be a reference to Sal? (1975) by Bertolucci's mentor ? Pier Paolo Pasolini. If it is so then this is an extremely awkward connection.Still, insipid instants are few and far between, despite being rather leisurely paced. Mise en sc?ne is quite strong, despite some foibles regarding flick's climax. The auxiliary cinematography by Vittorio Storaro is delightfully flamboyant as well as one of the biggest advantages of Novecento, even though it is not one of Storaro's finest efforts. Storaro succeeds in dousing every scene in an adequate portion and colour of the lighting, imbuing the celluloid with disparate hues, ranging from cold (grey and blue) to warm ones (yellow and red) to the extension that at one point, flowing water in a river reminiscent of orange juice. The cast is simply remarkable and Mr Bertolucci must have been ecstatic about possessing such actors as Burt Lancaster, Robert De Niro, Gérard Depardieu, Dominique Sanda, Romolo Valli, Donald Sutherland, Stefania Sandrelli and Laura Betti at his disposal.Novecento undoubtedly implicates a marvellous appearance and impressive décor, nevertheless in the middle, it embarks on being at a loss for a specific direction and Mr Bertolucci ultimately steers the material onto cinematic shallows. The main topic of mutual relationship between Alfredo and Olmo nearly becomes a background to the events occurring on the screen and after some time, one is likely to forget what it was all about. Mr Bertolucci unabashedly relishes with film's grandiloquence and themes, not making allowances for the possibility that it is all too greasy and there is too much of this opulence and monumentality. Personally, I think it was occasionally engaging, even delightful, but towards the denouement it gets too pulpy, too obviously communistic as well as virtually devoid of main heroes. It almost feels as if one was teleported to a gathering of left-wing revolutionaries wielding Kalashnikovs and willing to assassinate you in any minute inasmuch you are not holding a red flag, not to mention the confounded resolution which leaves its viewer confused.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1900 (Novecento)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew that this was listed in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I didn't realise however it was going to be so long, so I watched it as soon as I could so not to risk dozing off, from director Bernardo Bertolucci (Little Buddha, Stealing Beauty). Basically this film follows the life of two men born in the same year, 1900, the beginning of the 20th Century, in Italy, and sees their life going through the years up to 1945. Olmo Dalc? (Gérard Depardieu) was born a bastard of peasant stock with his grandfather Leo (The Asphalt Jungle's Sterling Hayden), Alfredo Berlinghieri (Robert De Niro) was born in a family of landowners with abusive but populist grandfather, also named Alfredo (Burt Lancaster). Despite the social differences, Olmo and Alfredo become childhood friends, Olmo growing to enlist for the army in World War I, Alfredo learning about the landowning business, and their friendship continues when brought together again. Fascism is becoming rife in many people, including sadistic hired foreman Attila Mellanchini (Donald Sutherland), who tortures and kills animals and people, but don't worry, he gets what he deserves eventually. The 1920's begin, and both the men get married, Alfredo to gorgeous Ada Fiastri Paulhan (Dominique Sanda) who develops alcoholism, and Olmo to Anita (Anna Henkel) who dies during childbirth. Of course World War II begins as the 1940's come along, and the two friends in the older age seem to have parted their ways, and brought back together they do not see eye to eye, and in the end Olmo witnesses Alfredo killing himself. Also starring Stefania Sandrelli as Anita Foschi, Alida Valli as Signora Pioppi and Laura Betti as Regina. Both De Niro and Depardieu give credible leading performances, Sutherland is extraordinary as the evil character, and Lancaster gets his time too, there are certainly some eye catching moments and memorable scenes, despite it being five hours and seventeen minutes long, it is I suppose worth it, a most watchable epic period drama. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretentious masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretentious but majestic, this film is a masterpiece of some aspects and an almost complete flop of others. For instance, the cinematography and the art direction are what are truly amazing and make the film stand out among others. However, its coldness and distance don't make this a touching story, the theme of friendship is lost because no true signs of that friendship are ever established, and Bertolucci himself seems to be giving a lot more attention to the technical aspects rather than actor's performances. In this way, most of the actors, strangely cast, even seem out of place, especially Robert DeNiro, whose best performances are the ones where he can express himself wholly even through some share of improv. There is one performance that is better than the rest, and that is the one of Donald Sutherland, as the Fascist whose evil is deeply rooted in ignorance.At around five hours, this film can seem a bit tedious. The film never offers a character that we can truly admire, both the lead characters of Gerard Depardieu and Robert DeNiro have flaws. The dramatic impact of some scenes is sometimes much too heavily reliant on the wonderful score by Ennio Morricone, and the Communist messages are much too strong especially in the end, where the film seems to shift from being the normally time lined realistic film to being a half-experimental one. This is not an easy film to watch, it is a treat for the eyes, but it's quite demanding, crude and perhaps realistic, but not very appealing on a storyline point of view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bertolucci's masterful epic restored....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, in fact, Bertolucci's original cut of 315 (!) minutes. Having seen both the 255 minute version and the director's cut, one may actually say what kind of difference can there possibly be between these 2 versions? One is 4 1/4 hours, the other is 5 1/4 hours. They are both incredibly long versions, so what's the point? The point is that there is a huge difference. As incredible as it may sound, the shorter version seems longer, as it doesn't have the same narrative flow as the longer version does. There are subtle differences between the versions that make certain scenes different. For example, there is a scene where the leaders of the town go duck hunting (warning! Bertolucci shows the actual killing of ducks here, along with animals being slaughtered for food). They then go into a church to discuss bringing a new fascist order to the town. In the short version, the church scene only consists of the men talking. In the longer version, Bertolucci intercuts the dead ducks with the men talking, giving the scene a graver effect. The sex scenes are longer and more explicit in the longer version as well. I saw this long version at a Bertolucci retrospective, and there were college kids in the audience who were laughing at the sex scenes! The sex scenes, like in all of Bertolucci's work, are meant to be serious and natural, which they are. I suppose the young people of America have a difficult time taking sex seriously after a decade or so of lowbrow, childish, teenage "comedies". Some of the magnificent camera work got lost in the shorter version, because Bertolucci cut some of the beginnings and ends of scenes, where they would be a wonderful camera move opening or closing the scene. As for the film itself, it is incredibly ambitious and amazing to behold. Bertolucci just came off the amazingly successful Last Tango in Paris, and did something grandly ambitious. He should be commended for that. Many current day filmmakers would probably do a sequel to their already successful film to fill their pockets, and not give a hoot about anything else. Bertolucci originally wanted to release it in 2 parts, but the producer Alberto Grimaldi, who was reeling from the financial failure of Fellini's Cassanova (a film he produced), wanted no part of a 2 part film. So Bertolucci compromised. He only cut one entire scene. He made cuts within scenes (a technique that Terry Gilliam used on his film Brazil, when he had to trim his film from 142 minutes to 131). While this film is magnificent, it took a ton out of Bertolucci. He never worked with Grimaldi again (Grimaldi had produced Last Tango in addition to this film), and he didn't really recover his reputation as a great filmmaker until 10 years later with another epic, The Last Emperor. Since then, he's been erratic, but he can still make great cinema (watch The Dreamers, one of Bertolucci's best films). Since this is in fact the director's cut, by all means see it, rent it, buy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it's a masterful allegory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes 1900 so powerful is that it's so finely crafted as an allegory of Italian history. Bertolucci's characters are involved in a human drama but they are also players in a history, and as such they have dual roles: as real people and as representations of larger themes.This is established from the beginning, as the history (la storia) opens with the birth of Alfredo the aristocrat and Olmo the peasant -- on the same day and in the same house and on the eve of the 20th century. As the story continues, their separate lives are connected, unfolding in parallel right up until the end, when Olmo and Alfredo as two old men grapple on the train tracks, endlessly in conflict, inextricably connected, as are the social and economic poles of 20th century Italian history.Along the way in this story, we encounter the beautiful and untouchable Ada. She is Art, the embodiment of beauty, an impartial abstraction who remains aloof from the degradation around her. She marries Alfredo but gives her wedding crown to Regina. She declares, "I am blind! I cannot see!" We also encounter the evil Attila and Regina. They are Politics, the embodiment of fascist craving for power. They are parasitic, ruthless, unaesthetic, sprung from the worst needs of the common people. In the end they lose control over these very same people, who butcher them with their pitchforks. These quick sketches show how Bertolucci can use his characters as something larger than their human dimension, and allow human drama to take on the proportions of historical events. Thus, Alfredo's grandfather is more than just a man in his dotage when he talks to the young girl in the barn; he's the Old Order passing away.Seen as an allegory, Bertolucci's work has a lot more depth and continuity than might first appear to many viewers, and this makes the work not only worth viewing again and again, but ensures that it will stand the test of time.</fullReview>

The choice of actors in this movie is best i've ever seen. Great performances by Donald Sutherland, Gerard Depardieu and Robert De Niro. Ennio Morricone showed in this film that he is truly the best composer of our time. Although this film shows the brutal events of the 20th Century it's still a beautiful movie with great pictures and sights of Italy's villages and natures. This is the story about friendship between two boys/men. Despite they are from different worlds their friendship and love to each other will endure through some greatest disasters of Fascism and the 20th Century. This the best directorial performance by Bernardo Bertolucci and it's really shame that this film hasn't got many awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand folly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to see "1900", an Italian historical epic directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, after reading Pauline Kael's review of the movie. Though I don't think I would agree with everything she wrote about it, I think she was right on the mark when she began by talking about it as a "grand folly," one of those movies in which the director aims to transcend movies with a world-changing epic. They rarely succeed, but even just their ambition to make a masterpiece can make the movie worth seeing. There were plenty of sequences in 1900 that felt like they were in a great movie, and throughout almost the entire film I could feel just how high Bertolucci's ambitions were, which made it all the more disappointing when the film, over the course of its more-than-four-hour running time, failed to deliver on all it had promised. The story revolves two men who were both born on the same day in 1900 on the same rural Italian estate. One is the grandson of the estate's owner, the other of the patriarch of the peasant clan that lives and works on the estate. The movie proceeds to show their ambivalent friendship over the years against the backdrop of the rise of fascism and socialism. The aristocrat is played by Robert De Niro; the peasant is played by the French star Gerard Depardieu. The landowning grandfather is played by Burt Lancaster, the peasant grandfather by Sterling Hayden. The early scenes showing the main characters' childhoods are the best in the movie. They have a bucolic, lyrical quality, and the beautiful cinematography drenches the screen in golden light. Ennio Morricone's score complements the images beautifully. Maybe the peasants are supposed to be oppressed, but the whole section is filled with nostalgia. Though his accent is jarringly American, Burt Lancaster seemed at home here- maybe because he played an Italian aristocrat in an earlier period epic, The Leopard. However, the depiction of the two boys promises more than the movie is able to fulfill. In the later adult sections, the De Niro and the Depardieu characters never really seem to take center stage as the childhood scenes seem to promise they will. The movie is somewhat similar to Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America. The difference is that in Leone's film showing the protagonists adult rise in the mob fulfilled the promise of the childhood sequences. Kael suggests- and this seems pretty likely to me- that Bertolucci deliberately goes against the viewer's expectations by deemphasizing the role of the two main characters in order to show that it is "the people" who are the heroes of history. Cute, but if you make a movie that's over four hours long- and in the original version it's closer to six-, the main characters should be as compelling as possible. De Niro is shown throughout as being passive and weak, I guess to show the greater "vitality" of peasants, but Depardieu doesn't seem to do a whole lot either. The supposed friendship between them is never especially convincing, probably because Bertolucci has them representing so much that they never really come alive as characters. The movie's historical and political content is pretty simplistic. In Bertolucci's defense, he seems to have intended this to a certain degree, as a way of creating a truly "popular" epic in the mold of Gone With the Wind. This can be seen particularly in the depiction of the film's villain, Attila, the estate's sadistic foreman, who is used to represent fascism. As played by Donald Sutherland, Attila is a cartoon-like villain, who, at various points, demonstrates how to deal with Communists by smashing a kitten with his head, murders a little boy, and impales an old lady on spikes. Though this character is one of the movie's most criticized aspect, I don't think the character himself is the problem- Attila certainly makes a memorable villain- so much as the fact that there's simply not much conflict between Sutherland and the two main characters. Of course, it's the movie's point that De Niro, and by extension all "bourgeois", is too weak to act against the vicious Fascists, but Depardieu as the supposedly more robust working class-socialist never does much against Attila either.Therefore, 1900 doesn't fully succeed as a popular historical epic or as an analysis of Italian history. Where Bertolucci went wrong was probably where directors trying to make masterpieces often go wrong- trying to do too many things at once. For one thing, the socialist message that Bertolucci obviously intended this film to convey seemed strangely half-hearted; he seems more genuinely interested in showing aristocratic decadence. And by the end of the movie, the story had pretty much lost all of its momentum. The scene of the partisans overcoming the Fascists was rushed through, without Depardieu without even being present. And the ending is extremely disappointing; after De Niro's show trial has been put to an end by government troops, he and Depardieu start fighting with each other, and then the movie jumps forward in time to show them as old men, still fighting with each other. Yes, I know it's supposed to be symbolic and all, but it just doesn't work. When a movie's over four hours long, it's more than a little disappointing when it turns into the longest Grumpy Old Men film in history. The dubbing is another major problem. The cast is very international, and the voices coming out of the actors never quite seem to match. This is especially a problem with De Niro; his performance may have originally been quite good, but his dubbed voice sounds hollow and out of place.</fullReview>

I really didn't felt the passing of 5 hours in front of the screen, because this wonderful movie just kept me glued to that. There's not one exceeding photogram in this, and many sequences are cinema-anthology worth. This film features an incredible cast as well, with stunning acting performances by Gerard Depardieu, Donald Sutherland (great and disquieting), Sterling Hayden and the superb Burt Lancaster. Only Robert De Niro is not shining here, maybe because he was not very suitable for his part. Vittorio Storaro's cinematography is amazing as always, and that makes me consider him the best photography director in movies history (just see Apocalypse Now). The locations are, as always in Bertolucci, simply astonishing, and the vision of the wide farmers' yard just moved me. If you're searching for an accurate historical reproduction, don't watch it. Bertolucci just talks about a time he didn't know, according to what he heard from other people's relations, and adding a little fantastic representation, which is the peculiarity of all of his works, that moves the watchers and makes them dream.</fullReview>

There have been films that I didn't want to end The Godfather, The Deer Hunter, Band of Brothers. This became a bloated rambling mess that I struggled to finish.

		<shortDescription>Epic Masterpiece by Bertolucci Far Better than most reviews state</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1900 (Novecento) 1977 NR 315 minutes. Since I am bored with most USA English movies lately I have been catching up on some of the movies by the "great directors" which I missed in the movie theater. 1977 I was not watching many movies (University) I watched recently (not reviewed) The Conformist. I have yet to see Last Tango. (I own a VHS copy) I loved the Last Emperor. It was a Multi Award Winner (now in new release 219 min version-not available on net/ flix) I did not particularly care for the Dreamers ?the political plot did not interest me-the sex and nudity was HOT. When I saw Emperor on the Big screen I thought it one of the greatest epics I had ever seen (besides Lawrence of Arabia). So now I decided to view his epic (much disliked) masterpiece 1900. Novecento. I was reading about the shortened release versions which got bad reviews. Even Ebert really hated the long version 2 stars on its release at Cannes. This is one movie where I greatly disagree with his review. I challenge Ebert to run the full length film at his Theater, view it there and not call it an epic masterpiece. Bernardo Bertolucci's massive epic, a history of Italy from 1900 to 1945 as reflected through the friendship of two men across class lines, is one of the most fascinating, if little seen, of his films. After beginning with Robert DeNiro as wealthy landowner Alfredo, and Gerard Depardieu as labor leader Olmo, the film returns to 1900 with the death of composer Giuseppi Verdi and the birth of the two friends. The opposing class interests of their grandfathers, padrone Burt Lancaster, and laborer Sterling Hayden, is quickly established in the enmity between the characters. As they grow, the boys become friends, mystified by the tensions that separate their families. But as time passes and Alfredo assumes the role of padrone, while Olmo works the land, their relationship becomes strained. With the rise of fascism, the director spells out its complicity with business interests, as the diffident Alfredo falls under the spell of a vicious and degraded fascist farm manager played by Donald Sutherland. Most will not like or understand this view of political Italy pre WW1 through Fascism &amp; Nazi. It somewhat rewrites history. Fascinating 5 star epic movie. The last neo-realist epic ever filmed. It contains some of the most stunning cinematography I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Returning to 1900</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though this epic drama by Bernardo Bertolucci was originally released thirty years ago, revisiting the film, now available in its entirety of 315 minutes, is like reading a favorite old classical history novel. Bertolucci obviously loved this story of two disparate boys, one from wealth and privilege and the other from peasant worker status, born on the same day in 1900 who proceed through the year 1945, bonded by country, intertwined by a developing friendship, and separating on political views. It is a film that examines capitalism versus socialism, Communism versus Fascism, two World Wars, and the effects that the changing political milieu of Italy had on the lives and loves of two men and their respective families.Of course this summation is far too brief for a film of over five hours in length, but the beauty of the film is the slow manner in which this set of ideas unfolds. The actors include not only such durable stars as Robert De Niro, Gérard Depardieu, Dominique Sanda, Burt Lancaster, Donald Sutherland, and Sterling Hayden, but also some of Italy's finest actors and an entire town of 'naturals', adding a sense of verismo to the film. The cinematography Vittorio Storaro is simply breathtaking and the musical score is by the inimitable Ennio Morricone. A mega-budget epic, the money seems well spent in retrospect. This is Bertolucci as an artist, a craftsman, an intellectual, and a committed politician. The DVD is somewhat hampered by the fact that the film was filmed in both English and Italian with two sets of dubbing choices and if the viewer has a problem with dubbing, then it is inescapable here. Despite this rather minor flaw, 1900 remains a film unlike any other in giving us a flavor of a country torn by the realities that the world faced in the first half of the 20th century. It is a long song, but well worth the time invested to absorb it all. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Books teach us knowledge; films give us senses. As for this aspect, this film filled with realities and sensations is as much inspiring as any everlasting masterpieces.If it's rare, it's expected to last. Focusing on the one-of-a-kind friendship between two boys of surprisingly different classes, the film really got me sitting up and constantly wondering which turn their emotional collapse would take among many possible ones.Fortunately, Bertolucci carried out an artful development of the plot and suggested various possible layers of both tragic and comedy, thus lifted the film to a higher state. Laughing, crying, hating and smiling, I experienced almost every sense to a great extent for watching it.The optimism consisting of happiness, humor, simplicity, hope and courage is, much more than the opposite of darkness and cruelties, the heart of the film. It provides us with a panorama of individual life under great pressures and shows us where the power lies for freedom and justice.Also it's ideally aesthetic and heartbreakingly rewarding, which makes this long epic stand out.Many inspiring details and elaborate expressions in this work are far beyond first watching and "spoiling", so I ensure this film is worthy of repetitively scrutinous watchings.Another uniqueness of this film is that, compared with other "so-called" historical epics, in the end it not only goes back to the start but also goes right back to the hearts of the individuals. Suffering so many realistic cruelties in the film, finally my nerves got compensated by the very reverberant time-vertical montage in the closing scene which is completely unprecedented in my cinematic experiences.At that moment, I was overwhelmed by the humanity Bertolucci filled in this film and eager to share this feeling with everyone. But I'm not supposed to spoil, so you have to experience it first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Best Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie the first time in the 5 1/2 hours version at Cinema Le Parisien during the Montreal International Film Festival in 1977. Didn't know much of Bertolucci at the time. I'm now a big fan of his body of work. How can you not appreciate Brando in the Last Tango or Trintignant in Le Conformiste. Luna and The Last Emperor are also masterpiece from this great filmmaker. These film will never get old and will always stay a beautiful look at a slice of history.Obviously from the very polarize appreciation for this film, this is not a film for everybody. First thing to understand is that there are movie and there are cinema. This film is cinema. If you like fast-action Hollywood style of movie, you won't like this film. If you like film like Barry Lyndon from Kubrick or Tess from Polanski, you will really enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though this movie may be really long and sometimes really dramatic and heavy, it's a perfect painting of a world now forgotten. I've seen in another comment that if you're non Italian you can't understand it perfectly. Well, I've been Italian for 35 years now, but I've grown up with other interests than politics . I've never gave a .... for the parties and all that political stuff, but Novecento made me think . Not only its photography is wonderful, but the story is simple and direct and reflects perfectly the war of the classes, the everlasting battle between rich and poor and other things maybe banal but functioning in this movie. De Niro, Depardieu and the other main actors are great. You can't watch it and turn your back about the fascist problem. About the problems of the working class, these are things that, looked in a modern perspective, aren't the same, times are changed and we Italians have to face other social problems... I understand , anyway, the people who didn't like it, maybe they should stick to "Meet the Fockers" or similar stuff, more at their intellectual level.by</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed 1900 is still an interesting journey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the criticism that's been thrown at this film I'm proud to say that this is still worthy of everyone's time and you have to credit this remarkable director for being bold enough to take on something this immense in scale. Anything this size and length will undoubtedly have areas in the story that just won't work for some (Lord knows I found a few) but to say that this film is a failure just doesn't sit well with me because I think all that is right with this seemingly gets forgotten. Story takes place in Italy with the death of Verdi in 1900 and ends with the death of Mussolini in 1945 and shows during the course of those years the rise and fall of fascism. Two boys are born on the same day with one being the grandson of a wealthy land owner (Burt Lancaster) and the other a bastard child of a peasant (Sterling Hayden) who works on the estate as a foreman.*****SPOILER ALERT***** The story follows these two as Alfredo Berlinghieri (Robert DeNiro) inherits his fathers land after his death while Olmo Dalco (Gerard Depardieu) continues to live among the peasants and while they try and remain friends it becomes difficult with the separation between landowners and workers. Fascism is on the rise and Alfredo's foreman Attila (Donald Sutherland) becomes a blackshirt and he and his cohorts start to threaten the rest of the residents in the area. Over the years Alfredo marries Ada Fiastri Paulhan (Dominique Sanda) but she becomes disillusioned with her husbands cowardice and apathetic attitude to the point where she not only sympathizes with the workers but she becomes an alcoholic and leaves Alfredo. With the end of WWII and Mussolini the peasants kill Attila and decide to hold a mock trial for Alfredo in which they will decide his fate but it's Olmo who convinces everyone that what he symbolizes is already dead.Director Bernardo Bertolucci has always been one of my favorite filmmakers and God knows I would never miss one of his films but I'm the first to admit that viewing 1900 is indeed a chore. The film's style can definitely be compared to the great Sergio Leone (in length as well) but Bertolucci's personal stamp is readily evident in several scenes such as the graphic nudity and the beautiful Italian countryside. Many viewers and critics have pointed out several of the (so-called) flaws in the story such as the portrayal of the peasants who come across as unsympathetic and I'm in agreement with this because the scene in which a worker cuts his own ear off serves no purpose at all and what exactly did Alfredo do that was so horrible that the people put him on trial? Being born into wealth? Apathy? These are not crimes! For me, one scene stands out that seems to belong in another film and it's where Alfredo and Ada snort some cocaine which makes one wonder how prevalent that drug was in the early parts of the 20th century. There are some glaring events in this attempted epic that might have viewers scratching their heads but for me this ambitious film represents the type of project that other directors should want to tackle (at least once) in their careers. Okay, the script goes all over the place but not once can I say I was bored watching this (I've seen it twice so far) and that's a tribute to Bertolucci who has consistently given audiences films to be talked about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful images-terrible script**One Spoiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of two friends: Alfredo, son of a rich land owner and Olmo the son of a worker in Alfredo's father's lands followed through two world wars in Italy. With them we see the clash of the aristocrats and the peasants. The weakest point of the movie is the script. The characters of the land owners and the peasants are one-dimensional. The land owners are purely shallow, weak, decayed, demoralized in contrast with the peasants who are consistently healthy, wholesome, united. The characters become simplistic, monotonous and the plot becomes generally predictable. Certain attributes are not even expressed, they are betrayed as when the wife of Alfredo goes to Olmo's house and exclaims that peasants seem so united. At times the movie goes out of its way to pass its message, which made me less willing to listen to that message. Relentless unrealistic bashing has this effect even if one agrees with it. ** SPOILERS BEGIN ** The end when the two friends humorously keep on fighting for the rest of their lives about whether the padrone is dead, left me puzzled. Is it trying to say that the struggle of the peasants and the landowners is a petty issue because of each side's immaturity and childishness? I don't see how it fit with the epic tone of the rest of the movie. ** SPOILERS END **As a result of the simplistic message and script it feels like most of the scenes can be taken out with no noticeable overall effect on the movie (I watched the director's cut). The story seems static, how things are rather than how they change. The movie is dreamlike only by virtue of the oversimplified therefore unrealistic script and its magnificent photography. If that is why Bertolucci simplified the plot and the characters he should have added something else that is interesting, that makes the fairy tale worth telling, some twist or perversion to the characters as Moravia's script successfully did for him in "il Conformista". Of course a lot of unconventional sex for the time of the movie does not fulfill that purpose. Perhaps, as it happened to other great leftist artists in the sixties and seventies, Bertolucci gets so involved in his message and carried away with it that he places it over art and film-making. My opinion is that just telling something that is right does not immediately make it great art. Such movies become quickly outdated and forgotten.Storraro's photography is once again profound. It actually saves the 5 hour empty script and makes the movie a pleasure to watch. The cast is great, I liked Donald Sutherland because his acting doeshave a sick twist that fits his role well.The fact that the movie is horribly dubbed adds to the woes of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a real masterpiece of the seventh art.I remember that I was very little when I first saw this movie. It must be good when it makes a 7-year-old boy to sit still and quiet for about 5 hours. When I saw it again 4-5 years ago I wanted to see it again and again and again...There are so many scenes that stay in your head forever. The dark ones are more impressive then the brighter ones: slaughtering of the pig, raping of the child, bumping his head against the wall, epilepsy attack... That's done in such way that... I don't know, leaves you "textless".There's no need to mention the acting. Just look at the cast... I was especially overjoyed with Donald Sutherland in his role of Attila and with the actress, which played his wife (I don't know her name but she reminds me on former USA secretary M. Albright - I hope the spelling is good).This is one of the best movies of XX century and I'm surprised that it is not in top 250. Maybe that's because it's Italian, not American.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film if you have four hours of your life to kill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film on the Bank Holiday , remembering I'd seen it before , but wanted a refresher. Anyway the film was set in Italy at the turn of the 20th century. Italy was still by far and away an agricultural country. Held by tradition and class. Burt Lancaster was great as the grandfather , who although was the owner or boss. He seemed to have a very philosophical and benign view of the world. One great scene was when one of the labourers daughter joins him in the milking hut , and tells her that a mans idea of disaster is not the loss of a limb or the death of someone close, but when a man is struck down by impotency. Shame viagra wasn't available. The story briskly moves on to the rise of fascism and how the bosses who met in the Church conspired to destroy the growing force of socialism and communism. What follows is disturbing to see. How the true and real nature of fascism is shown , with scenes of murder , decadence and unashamed greed. Resistance is broken among the peasents and friendships are strained as the chaos and surrealism begins to take control of the principle characters. The idealism and humanity that was displayed in childhood are somehow eradicated as the inevitable class conflict overwhelms a community that in all ends and purposes have suffered much under the murderous and villany of Attillo ( played by Donald Sutherland).Anyway if you have four hours of your life to kill , 1900 is well worth a view , but dont expect the Mrs or girlfriend to sit through it with you , only unless she is well into war , politics and serious drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bernardo Bertolucci's attempt at making a historical film fails in so many different ways it seems deliberate. The movie contains a war sequence which could have occurred whenever and wherever. This lack of clarity goes on throughout the film---worse yet, the film is somewhere around five hours long! Renting it, I couldn't finish either tape. Bernardo Bertolucci could have turned this into an actual non-fictional work, even with fictional characters, to describe whatever he's trying to say, but no.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>epic, metaphoric, eclectic: politically charged drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bertolucci did it again. Less 'red' than Reds (Beatty, 1981), unfortunately Novecento becomes very 'red' and sentimental in the last hour, but I guess that's to emphasize the emotional response to the ending of a war. The simplistic and propagandistic characterization of fascists in general (Donald Sutherland plays the caricaturally satanic embodiment of fascism and opportunism) didn't do justice to the subtlety of the rest of the story, but after all the story revolves around the friendship between aristocrat Alfredo and farmer Olmo. If you look beyond the few flaws, '1900' makes you wonder why only five Bertolucci films have hit the DVD plastic yet. Possibly that's because of the political engagement these tend to propagate in many (subtle) ways. One of the most obvious ways in '1900' is the quite in-your-face waving of the red flags near the end.Vittorio Storaro (Apocalypse Now, il Conformista, Reds) did it again. Very subtle compositions versus shocking graphic violence and intimacy from time to time: in general it's more coherent and explicit than 'il Conformista'. Although 1900 is less poetic poetic than 'il Conformista', the great cinematographer found many instances to display his cinematic brilliance in the most appropriate way and let the eclectic cast come to justice. To name a few: Robert DeNiro (Taxi Driver '76!, the Godfather 2, Brazil, Raging Bull), Sterling Hayden (the Godfather 1, Dr. Strangelove, Asphalt Jungle, the Killing), Dominique Sanda (il Conformista), Stefania Sandrelli (il Conformista), Alida Valli (the Third Man, the Spider's Stratagem) and the young soldier Teodoro (Allen Midgette) in Bertolucci's first feature 'la Commare Secca' has a short but good appearance in Novecento for some reason. And last but not least Burt Lancaster (il Gattopardo, the Killers, Criss Cross) who continues his part from 'il Gattopardo' in a way.Ennio Morricone (Days of heaven, Once upon a time in America) did it again. This time not yet as sentimental as Once upon a time in America: his subtle score carries some of the scenes and completes the film in an appropriate way, where the other film turns out to be overdone. Maybe he was glad to work with Leone again. Or something. Anyway, Morricone sure helps making the 5h10 movie watchable consecutively and in one sigh.The epic story about lower and upper classes and the (metaphoric) fascination with animals was presumably an inspiration for 'Days of heaven' (Malick, 1978). FYI IMO 'epic' does not necessarily mean that it's a good film, but in this case it's a crucial aspect of the story. If Bertolucci had watched the Godfather (1972) and especially Godfather Part 2 (1974) a little closer, then he could have gotten the flaws out if this film (refers to the 310 min version). Sergio 'dollar trilogy' Leone did that better in 'Once upon a time in America' (again unfortunately also infinitely more sentimental). Concluding: il conformista meets the godfather? Not really, but still 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie if you love Italian history."Novecento" tells the history of Italy from 1900-1945 through the two characters played by Gerard Depardieu and Robert DeNiro - one an upper-class landlord, the other a peasant.The characters interact over the course of Italy's turbulent first 50 years of the 20th century.DeNiro's character represents upper-class Italy's acceptance, if not approval, of fascism's beating-down of socialism. Donald Sutherland's character Attila (OK, the name's a little obvious) is a sadistic thug who hates the working class from which he came. He gains power, uncontrolled power, by turning on his own in order to please his wealthy masters.If you have the time, combine a few hours of "Novecento" with "The Best of Youth" and you'll have pretty much all of Italian history of the last century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe Bertolucci's finest hour - if one can take deeply theatrical and grotesquely vivid stuff. But how annoying is that dubbing?!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie that, I dare say, never could've been made in Hollywood - although financed by, as it is! I caught the long version, in two parts, of this epic of the changes of the Italian society, seen through the eyes of two friends from disparate families over the decades between 1900-1945. Be prepared for a deeply theatrical (yes, absurd scenes, caricature characters and gestures abound) and grotesquely vivid tale, that dares to be grit-dirty, fascinatingly vulgar, and very intimate with its not easily likeably developed characters. Sound like Fellini-territory? It's honestly not far from it! But the details of the rise of fascism is equally captivating and frightening - so next to "The last emperor", this is my choice as Bertolucci's finest hour. And try for goodness sake to see it in a theater, as the sceneries are overwhelmingly filmed, and to hold your attention alert during its mammoth length.But frankly - and this is a major complaint - isn't that (pretty poor, too) dubbing extremely annoying? Quite an unfair task to judge and rate performances, if they're constantly dubbed... I watch De Niro, Sutherland and Depardieu, but I don't hear them! Who the hell can judge them fairly without their real voices?! How does the Italian audience receive foreign actors awkwardly dubbed into their screen compatriots?

Great direction, great photography and great music, here Bertolucci, Storaro and Morricone are really doing their job. The plot: to me, excellent. Many flashbacks, intricate for some extent, but never boring. And yes, Attila is sometimes simply too much evil for us now, but please remember what Nazis and fascists did in Italy... for example, Nazis in a small Italian village (Marzabotto)actually threw newborns in the air like they were clay pigeons and shoot at them, only for sport... and Attila is exaggerated? Photography is something you just have to see; some mass scenes, as the funerals of the old communists or the embrace between the Partisans and the peasants make you feel as you were there. Music: Morricone (and Verdi!). And that's all. He never goes wrong. Finally, a note. The poor acting of most of the peasants is because they actually WERE peasants of the Po Valley. Like Pasolini, here Bertolucci just uses real people to represent themselves 50 years before: look those beautiful lined faces, you'll never find actors like them...</fullReview>

The version I viewed ran approximately 5 and a half hours and I would like to say if it were edited down to 3 hours it would be a much more watchable film, however I am not sure that would make it particularly informing or entertaining. The glacial pace makes one almost forget about character development or motivation. Bertolucci extends each scene about 3 times longer than is necessary and after a couple of hours of this I found myself wishing he would hurry up and advance the story. Even though it is beautifully shot after a while it becomes agony because of the plodding pace. I got the feeling I was viewing an acute case of a director's overindulgence.

		<fullReview>I believe that it is incredibly difficult to make an epic of such proportion and keep it perfect, compelling, and interesting for all 5+ hours of its duration. For me, "1900" somewhere in the middle began to feel like a runaway train that just did not know where it was heading and how to stop. Even the wonderful and beloved actors were unconvincing. With that said, I love and admire Burt Lancaster's and Sterling Hayden's performances as two patriarchs - with them gone, the film just lost its momentum for me. De Niro and Depardieu will be remembered for the threesome scene only; neither was compelling in their roles. Two beautiful and talented actresses, Dominique Sanda and Stefania Sandrelli were wasted and lost in this total wreck of the movie. Donald Sutherland as Attila is magnificent - he is not just evil, he is beyond any imagination but Regina (Laura Betti) was simply grotesque. I did not like cinematography very much; neither the score by Ennio Morricone was impressive enough. Bertolucci's own earlier "Il Conformista" (1970) - short, perfect, refined film was able to portray the corrupting deadly power of Fascism much better than "1900" and it does not even have a character like Attila. "Attilas" of the world are obvious (it does not mean that they are less dangerous) but Marcello Clericis are not - all they want to do - to fit, to be accepted and there is no limits to how far they'd go. "Il Conformista" has one of the most beautiful and sexiest scenes ever filmed - Stefania and Dominique dancing tango. I was hoping for them to dance in "1900" - never happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1900....hours long?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's not denying that Bernardo Bertulucci is a talented filmmaker. There's proof of that with 'The Last Tango in Paris' and 'The Conformist'. There's no denying that Robert DeNiro is a terrific actor. There's proof of that with 'Taxi Driver' and 'Mean Streets'. There's no denying that a film with a running time of nearly 4 hours can be astounding. There's proof of that with 'Lawrence of Arabia' and 'Gone With the Wind.' So why is it that '1900' manages to make one doubt each of those points? How is it that a film of such oppressive length can have so little to say? How can a fine, Oscar-winning actor like DeNiro totally botch up a performance of this caliber? To know the answer you'll have to park yourself in front of a TV for a good portion of the day and watch a big mess of a movie.There are many memorable moments in '1900' but not enough to sustain a 4 hour plus movie. I think Bertolucci knows this because he decides to put in a few shocking scenes just to spark our interest once in a while. There's a scene where two young boys examine each others genitals. There's a scene where a prostitute masturbates both DeNiro and Depardieu. There's a scene of a pig graphically being ripped apart. Why? Because the story is so thin and the points so familiar that this is the only way we'll endure this long, tiresome film.This is however a beautifully photographed movie, and the performances of both Depardieu and Sutherland are very watchable (Sutherland does go a bit overboard at times but he is still a commanding actor). But most of the good is in the first hour and a half of the movie. After that all the characters turn into statements and nothing is quite as compelling as the when the film opens.**1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lavish and interesting but poorly made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good film in that the plot unfolds nicely, the camera-work and the acting generally work well. However, its flaws left me feeling hugely dissatisfied, manipulated and treated a bit like an idiot by Bertolucci - he lays it on too thick. The use of music is ridiculously melodramatic and gratuitous, as is much else in the film. Unfortunately, the film neglects to develop the main characters, and offers us no insights into how they arrived at the personal predicaments they end up facing. Having said that, this film did hold my attention throughout, as despite there being much that is undeveloped, it does present a rich and varied tapestry of a period of time in which social developments are strongly representative of much that is both noble and ignoble in the human spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more disastrous movies I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now first off, I would like to say that I saw the 250 minute version of this movie, so I am willing to accept that I might have missed some great moments in the movie that were taken out. However, I think I saw what was truly essential to understanding the movie. This was, without a doubt, one of the major catastrophes of modern cinema, a film which had so much promise, but ended up ridiculous.One of the main problems, noticeable in the version I saw was the dubbing. Now I realize that this was not necessarily Bertolucci's fault, but what was his fault was having an international cast to begin with. It would make for awkward moments and never really let all the actors in their own voices shine. Whether mostly dubbed or mostly subtitled, some actors performances would be hurt.Saying that, the acting in the movie ranged from mostly mediocre to truly bizarre. Out of the main actors, the only two people who don't embarrass themselves too much are Burt Lancaster and Sterling Hayden. Not that the actors are the huge problem. What is mostly the curse is the horrible, horrible characterizations due to the horrendous script. The first half of the movie is merely very flawed in this manner, but the second half really just shows how badly the movie falls apart in this area. I was laughing out loud hysterically at the dialogue and actions of the characters that were part of the performances. I mean, were any of these people in the movie at all likeable? Were Attila (Sutherland's character) and Regina even human beings?Still, the main blame goes with Bertolucci himself. He did an adequate job directing, but the political argument he tried to make was weak to begin with, and lost amid the fact that the movie couldn't be taken seriously (something that extends even to the final scenes). He also made the story too broad. It seems to want to focus on the relationship between Alfredo (DeNiro) and Ulmo (Depardieu) but we never really get a sense of their relationship. Bertolucci just says they are friends so we have to accept that its the case, but I don't based on the evidence of the movie. Again, this may have to do with the cut version, but I am still skeptical that this is is the case. I also never felt compassion for any of the peasants, and making the fascists and wealthy into evil incarnate or dumb baffoons ruined by money and power was very convenient for Bertolucci. He desperately didn't want the audience to have any compassion for them, a truly dishonest way to proceed.I hope that this summary helps. I realize I am in the minority here, but I refuse to call this a good film. It is watchable and moves well, but not for the reasons that Bertolucci intended. If he wanted an over-the-top drama/horror/comedy (as Russ Meyer did with "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls") I would give the movie some props. But as it seems a serious attempt to garner support for the left, I can't think highly of it. "1900" simply is just one of the great disasters of film history, on par with "Caligula," "Dune," and "Ishtar."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste 320 min. of your life. See the theatrical version, if you can get it somewhere.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a fine mess this movie is. I'm referring of course to the DVD version, the director's cut, which last about 320 min. I remember this one as being a far better movie when I saw it in its short version, in a theatre, in a length about half that. What is with directors, who feel compelled to release the uncut versions of their flicks, even when it has been proved that at such lengths they are real dogs, even more when they were released in that format and they bombed, as the case is with 1900? At least Coppola got the excuse that the public had never seen his uncut AN. One thing that's probably hard to understand, unless you have seen it yourself, is that a 160 min. long 1900 is a completely different film from a 1900 twice that length. There are truly two different movies there. Think of those MAD fold-ups, I think, which show a given picture when the page is spread and then a different one when it's folded up. Viewer's sensibilities are affected in a very different way in both cases. There's immediacy to short movies that's completely lost in long ones. For ex. one critic makes the good point of the ending being goofed, with two old coots making fools of themselves. That's right, but when I saw it in its theatrical version it didn't seem that way, it was instead a very touching ending, because after only 2 hr. of viewing I still had lingering in my mind the beginning, with the rough but deep brotherhood love developed between the two men, I hadn't still forgotten the two kids playing in the field, screwing the Earth; friendship which constitutes the basis on which the whole movie is structured. For that reason also, Alfredo's trial had a greater emotional impact. In the short version, which is far more compact, well rounded, focused, what keeps the movie going for 2, 3 hours is their undying relationship through hell and high water, through too many vicissitudes; their parallel lives is the master column on which the whole plot is weaved. That's completely lost in the DVD version. There, after 320 min. of film Alfredo and Olmo are strangers, their brotherly relationship having been practically forgotten, diluted, overwhelmed by a multitude of different events. That's why there are two different movies here and the one I saw in a movie house was the best one by far.There are scenes that seem to last forever, long after the point has been made. The trial of Alfredo for ex., where we have to digest songs, hymns, political speeches and hear poor peasants venting their spleens. Or when Attila is attacked with dung cakes, did they need 10 min. of movie time for that single scene? Some others are just superfluous, like the one of Olmo killing the pig and then the guy who took the rap for the murder of the Pioppi kid coming back to tell him he knew who was the murderer. What was the purpose that? The same with the scene in the tavern where Ana &amp; Alfredo meet the epileptic prostitute. They reconcile there but did they need the whole scene for that? And I don't even remember the sequence with Attila &amp; Regina being held in the stable and the cemetery, which are both useless anyway. I just remember seeing both hunted down in the fields and then taken down with picks and that was good enough for me.There's also criticism about the lack of character development and that's right, but only if referring to the 320 min. version. The time a director has available for his flick is rather short?usually no more than 90 to 150 min. average?which means choices got to be made, the usual one between plot and characters. That's why some action packed flicks like Guns Of Navarone or Capricorn One contain no character development at all. In such event--charged movie like 1900 even 160 min, are barely enough to contain all the action, which spans times of social upheaval and war, so we can forgive it for its lack of character development. But that's unforgivable for a 320 min. movie, there's no such excuse there. The same for the terrible editing: after an excruciatingly long scene, which is prolonged two o three times what should have been its normal length, a jump cut suddenly brings us one decade ahead. In the short version you don't even notice how bad the editing is, as you are being overwhelmed by a frantic, eventful, plot development.This is obviously a movie that should have lasted no more than 150 to 180 min. and which was stretched to almost three times that length by a director who thought he could do no wrong and that anything he included in his flick had to be masterful. But there's something ever worse, as I remember. The first 90 min, are the same in both versions--i.e. until Olmo comes back from the war?which is no surprising, considering that that's the best part of the movie mainly because it contains the scenes of such greats as Lancaster and Hayden. That means that the remaining 60 to 90 min, of the second part has been stretched to a humongous four hours! No wonder I couldn't recognize here the same film I saw decades ago, after those initial 90 min.I won't rate this movie because, if I did I couldn't give more than 3 or 4/10, and that would be unfair as there's a far better movie in there. Al I can recommend is, look for the short version and judge it by yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The magic of acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The magic of acting is, I would say, to make the viewer forget that he is a thinking being and swallow the crap. And if that is the magic of acting, this one is the Dumbledore of film history. The actors, the scenes, just everything is so brilliant that you need quite a time to realise that a political message is hammered into your head. This movie is about a society, in which the master's power is a total on to use his "slaves"- and to abuse them (Lancaster in the stable). When the "slaves" discover socialism, the masters invent fascism as antidote and hire the worst of society to bring the "slaves" back in line. (This is Donald Sutherland's part, and probably his greatest performance- he is the only fascist in town, and at the same time a child violator and murderer.) This movie is a marxist propaganda film (on one occasion Depardieu speeks directly into a camera and accuses the masters pretty much of what I wrote earlier), which, of course, doesn't make it a bad movie, as long as you are alert. (Or as long as you are a marxist yourself.) But give it a try anyway, Sutherland's big bad wolf is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best epics I've ever seen. Like all of the great epics, it takes its time to fully show the developments of the characters more than in other films. The ones I love are Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather Part II, Il Gattopardo, and others. I do not understand the fuss Americans make about it being a propaganda film. Of course, it is definitively one-sided but then if Novecento is propaganda, so are Indochine, The Patriot, The Deer Hunter, Doctor Zhivago. The direction is unbelievable. This is probably my favorite Bertolucci after The Last Emperor. Not a second of this five hour film seems to be wasted. It is perfectly filmed and not boring at all. The photography is perfect: There seems to be absolutely no limit to the scope of the film. It is almost as if Bertolucci had traveled in time to find the locations (Althoug it takes place in the 10s, the twenties, the thirties, the forties, and the fifties, everything looks like it was shot at the same time). Robert De Niro gives, as usual, an extremely subtle performance. He takes full advantage of the fact that we see practically all of his life in the film. He has perfectly crafted his character. Alfredo develops exactly like anyone you would ever meet. Gerard Depardieu is also very good, but his character seems to be hollow. He never changes. He is quite simply the perfect man. Donald Sutherman gives a surprisingly subtle performance. He is a complete villain, in the tradition of Tavernier, yet Sutherland manages to give his one-sided character (quite simply the Devil!) a kind of change through the years, like De Niro. Dominique Sandra is impossibly sexy in this film. Her character is very complex.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of historic proportions made into a valued work of art by superb cinematography, an enchanting musical score and acting skill.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and written by he and his brother Giuseppe Bertolucci, 1900 is a film of historic proportions. Though rather simplistic assessment of both fascism and communism in early 20th century Italy, the film does capture the emotions and sentiments of many contemporaries who lived through this difficult period in Italian and European history.The efforts on the youthful Sutherland, De Niro, and Depardieu, along with the beautiful Dominique Sanda, are met by the mature acting of Alida Valli, Sterling Hayden, and Burt Lancaster. Complementing Verdi's Il Trovatore and Rigoletto, Ennio Morricone's musical score colors the fullness of human emotions which merge in the personal connections which unite the lords (Lancaster's patrician landlord) and peasants (Hayden's patriarch of the farming "braccianti") with their progeny (as the adult De Nero inherits land, status and power his one time childhood friend and now adult, Depardieu, inherits poverty, rebellion and honor).Of particular interest is the scene where a now aged landlord (Lancaster) seeks to rekindle his sexual desire with a youthful peasant girl he happens upon in one of his estate's barns. While milking the cows, the peasant girl is made a rather earthy proposition by the landlord who suggests that the milking should not stop with the cows. Being in the vicinity of the youthful peasant girl and the beasts of his farm, the landlord comes to realize that the bountiful fruits of the earth are given life through the heat of sexual desire and through the fertilizing warmth of nature's cow manure. Left unsatisfied by life's lost passions, the landlord takes his own life, only to be found and scornfully criticized by the peasant patriarch (Hayden) who sees the suicide as another example of the sad corruption of a society and people de-humanized by capitalism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think about my favorite movies, 1900 always planes towards the top of the list. No doubt the Bertolucci is among the best of his generation's directors. The multinational cast he built for this epic is remarkable. The story has a taste of Lawrence Durrell. But the cinematography is so textured and revealing and satisfying that I felt compelled to just watch and let it carry me off. The greens are so verdant, the blacks and golds and grays and the reds...well you get the idea. It is sublime cinema portraiture. Maybe one who is disinterested in how the history of the peasantry of Italy as feudalism morphed into fascism might find the subject matter too pedantic. But for those who find that the past is the explicator of our current world, 1900 takes the 45 years from the turn of the last century to the end of WWII and forces us to see our grandparents and their children as willing agents of the present. Get a good bottle of Barolo, a little rustic bread and cheese and settle in for a memorable time with good and evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too ideologically biased</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bertolucci is for sure a talented director. but as for many artists who are great with images, lacks of original content.this movie is depicting fascists as sexual perverts and maniac killers. and the model that should substitute them is the communist one. where the communists are full of good feelings, perfect ideals and capable to create a perfect society. that is not what happened in the real communist countries, where a form of even worse fascism took form. this movie will even justify the killings of many white partisans by the hands of the red ones, as in the end make the viewer see the new government as another way of fascism and landlord society to take power. people who never studied the Italian history will not understand what really the fascism has been for Italy. many crimes were committed by some fascists, but not fewer than thos committed by the Italian communists that were concerting to take power with the help of Moscow.to come back to the movie, well, great actors, especially the ingenuous Depardieu, who was giving himself in those years to all of the movies that were lacking of ideological originality, as some ferreri's movie (ciao maschio, l'ultima donna), but that still has a great physique and that is perfect to incarnate the sane and robust farmer to counter with a De Niro who is representing a society who is weak and decaying.some bucolic set and frames are beautiful as painted pictures.This movie has anyway to be seen, if not for its political accuracy, for what can offer: a surface analysis of a country that is undergoing great changes after which, as always, somebody will win and somebody will lose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still furious over the fact that i wasted exactly 255 minutes of my life watching this movie. I can understand this can be shocking considering the cast and the crew involved in the picture. I try to break down the elements that i think has led to the downfalls of this movie:Direction: From what I have seen from the master filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci I can say considering his other works, this movie can only be the result of a one-take-per-scene scheme, and seems like director Bertolucci just wanted to get it over with. Not wasting anytime, bad scene? tough? lets go to the next scene, we still got 200 more minutes to shoot!Story: The story is a major snooze fast; it is impersonal, at times unnecessarily appalling (major rated R for material for no reason) There is no way the viewer can identify with the characters, they have been given little to no depth, we don't really know anything about many of the characters, and why they do certain things, and there are no explanations given for what they do. It is assumed that we are already familiar with the concepts of Padrone, Communism in Italy, and the lives of Peasants and their relationship with the Padrone. So many missing blocks here...!Acting: I can only say that this movie features one of the best casts in the history of cinema, including greats such as Robert De Niro, Gerard Depardieu, Burt Lancaster, and Donald Sutherland. While the performances are given by such amazing actors, the characters receive little help from direction, montage, and the script!Music: I consider myself an enormous Ennio Morricone fan; and indeed his music in this movie is quite beautiful as in his other films, however, except in some minor scenes--mostly in the scenes where there's nothing going on--the music is irrelevant to what we see on the scree, mainly because of the soft music (very similar to the Legend of Greensleeves music) we are already falling asleep, even at the peak of the climax scenes and where enormous elements of suspense or shock are present.Cinematography/Montage/Mese En Scene/Light: To sum up the collective faults of the above elements give the viewer a pure indifference, that is quite inevitable; half way through the movie, (i.e after 2 hours) most viewers merely leave, and the rest furiously continue watching it, just so they never ever have to do it again! Extreme artificial light and contrast is used, to convey allegorical meanings, consistent with Bertolucci's expressionist style. Montage is done by Acralli--a close friend of Bertolucci--it almost contains all the shot footage with nothing to throw out, which makes the movie incredibly long and tedious. As I mentioned before the choice of Mese En Scene is quite inappropriate: e.g. irrelevant music, inappropriate images, unnecessary nudity (including 2-3 scenes of CHILD nudity!) which finally brings us to the last element, cinematography: it is done in the worst possible way, very similar to 'Once Upon A Time In America' use of dead colours, in a blurry, rigid, shaky format!In the end, I'd like to point out that many scenes and elements of film-making in the movie is set so they convey allegorical meanings and symbolism, which makes the movie incredibly rich, but meanwhile confusing and ambiguous. So if you're a die hard Bertolucci fan give the movie a shot by all means, but make sure you also give a look to Italian History following World War I and the lives of people in the southern Italy. I hope this review help you appreciate the movie better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directors tend to shoot a lot of footage. Much of it ends up on the cutting room floor. It is likely that Bertolucci's cutting room floor was clean after he wrapped up this film. Originally released at 4 hours, Bertolucci added 75 minutes for the uncut version. If he had instead cut 75 minutes, it may have been a worthy film because it has going for it excellent cinematography, a good score from Morricone, and an impressive all-star cast. However, the director's self-indulgence undermines everything. It is an ordeal to sit through a 5.25-hour movie, particularly when the plot isn't interesting enough to grab the viewer's attention.

		<shortDescription>A Story as a Catastrophe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bernardo Bertolucci is for me quite a mystery. The first film I saw of him was the wonderful and magical The Sheltering Sky. After that film I have eagerly waited to get hold of other films by him, only to have been disappointed twice (The Last Emperor, La Luna). Now I am unsure if I have misunderstood his genius after having seen his biggest disappointment yet: 1900? First of all I believe Novecento, alias 1900, is an overlong and pretentious film with a sloppily written, dry story. Some reviewers call this film "realistic", and I give them that regarding the explicit sex-scenes and animal-torture. But the character interaction, their behaviour, dialogue lines - they are everything but realistic. As a story Novecento seems to be merely a hasty sketch, an unfinished draft that miraculously made it to the screen. It marvels me that this film has such a high rating (7.7) on IMDb, but I guess it's due to all the American voters who think they've seen some extraordinary European masterpiece ? their only motivation being the "realistic" absurdity. Well I myself have nothing against such films, but what I expect at the least is a well-written story. This Novecento fails in delivering cardinally, and being a 5-hour film there really should be no excuses. Another striking failure is the acting. The lines are terrible so I get that living yourself into the roles as an actor must have taken quite a deal of trouble, but as de Niro shows it could be done. With de Niro, the only vaguely convincing performances are really the ones of Depardieu and Sanda. It says in the trivia that Donald Sutherland was so upset with his performance as Attila that he couldn't watch the movie for several years, and one can only feel sorry for him because that role was truly just about the worst in my viewing history. Another aspect that really kills the rest of all the credibility there is left is the inferior dubbing. When a film is good you can deal with such flaws, but when a film is bad, it's like cheap dubbing only crowns it all. Luckily, Bertolucci hasn't done everything sloppily, and the scenery and camera-work is indeed pleasing for the eye. There are also rare, poetic scenes in the film that manage to tickle a spark of interest in me and that make me endure the whole five exhausting hours of the film. These are scenes like when de Niro and Sanda are falling in love and when the cast shuts up for the camera to do the entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too complex and not for everyone. Unfortunately important meanings in this film will go right over your head. There's no Disney polish. Some things push the edge and it is unconventional in many ways for the 1975 timeframe. Students of film should see it and for anyone wanting "the fine art" aspect in cinema. Has everything in it, right down to a somewhat happy ending, but it doesn't satisfy you like a good meal. I had to rewind sections and watch it over and over again to catch things and decipher it all. Viewer gets too much and will probably miss some of the deeper messages here. This takes awhile to understand. Finely crafted depiction of people and their politics at all social levels as pathetic - shows communism as perhaps a small bit less absurd. Fascism depicted as just plain brutal aggression. Good portrayal of the "compagna" and the feeling of solidity and timelessness, right down to "Olmo" which means an elm tree. Great camera work. Masterfully depicts the accepted social structure of the time and the sad "slave" community of generations, right down to the polenta, the Italian meal of the poor. But workers don't find a resolution in their politics in this movie. Scenes are posed likes political posters, there is empty senseless communist chanting, parades, confusion, ridiculous. Feels like the artist is portraying these politics as just a turbulence that flowed over both it's victims and supporters, a pageantry of propaganda rhetoric and dogma, and largely about choosing sides of course; but it's certainly not about anything truthful intellectual or idealistic. Well crafted. Maybe he says this again in The Last Emperor ("Join the communist party or F! off"). In the end, there's still rich and poor and nothing has changed significantly; poor communist kicking the padrone in the ass is just a tolerable annoyance.Of course, most people don't care and they don't go to movies for this cerebral stuff. It may be great artwork perhaps like a Cezanne. Sadly therefore it would only appeal at a 10 level to a few people.</fullReview>

The forces of communism and Fascism arrived in Italy with a vengeance that we overlook today. Humour abounds however there are some spine-chilling moments that are plain nasty and cruel. The haunting music and the countryside of Italy are an amazing backdrop to this piece of history. The extras are all local farming people which adds an element of reality and humanity. Once again a European director with American actors has produced a giant of a movie: Just like "Once upon a time in the West". Hollywood never needed to go beyond mass appeal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In praise of the best movie ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first viewing of this movie was several years ago(5 hours of it) Since then I have watched it more than five times. To me, as a reasonably educated movie buff, this was the best ever. I have read all the learned comments (from wanabee film critics?)No political analysis from me. The acting,direction,cinematography and locations just blew my mind. My favourite movie followed by 'Once upon a time in America' then Maria's Lovers' and 'Paris Texas' close behind. I know what I like and sod all the intellectual claptrap!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie stunk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, this movie was horrible. I was so excited to see Robert De Niro and Gerard Depardieu in a movie together. I consider both of them 1st class actors. I also love anything historic, but especially turn of the century. I also love foreign films and even films that are a bit quirky. But this film is like the ugliest modern art piece imaginable. The scenes seemed so harsh and ugly, angry, evil. It was so offensive, so distasteful. Altho' sometimes the actual scenery could be lovely, or the costumes, but it only took a minute for the movie to turn very black, morbid, cruel and ugly. It was one of the most disturbing movie I have ever seen. I only wished I had known, it was as it was, I would have not wasted my precious time watching it. It had everything from cruelly killing animals, to child molestation and violent murder. Group sex and violence that was most grotesque. It was all done fairly graphically too. I love art movies, but this was like taking a bad copy of Renior and pouring animal blood all over it, that is after you have slashed it many times with a knife.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Backfiring propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is far more effective as fascist propaganda than Loni Riefenstahl could ever hope to be. It works this way: you see Attila (the main fascist character) behave as a psychopathic monster without any redeeming features; you remember that the Italian fascists murdered only about one dissident per year (and no Jews) while Mussolini was in power, which adds up to about the same number of people that Attila alone murders in the movie; and you decide that the Italian fascists were not as bad as they are portrayed. It is only a short step to concluding that the fascists were not as bad as they might have been, which is to say they were not so bad after all. The fact is that the great crimes of the Italian fascists, mostly committed abroad, are completely ignored in this movie. Instead, Attila kills Italians. Perhaps Bertolucci is ignorant of the fact that fascists are nationalists?Since Attila and his lover exist for propaganda purposes, it goes without saying that they come out of central casting. In fact, they make Red Sonja look like it was scripted by Jane Austen. The other characters are developed a bit better, say about as well as in Red Sonja. Another appropriate comparison is to Tim Burton's Batman (and Batman Returns): in 1900, as in Batman, the crowds accept uncritically whatever the "bad guys" want them to believe - with the exception of the working classes, of course, which are unfailingly portrayed in a positive light.If it were possible, I would give this movie a negative rating, meaning that it is so pointless, and unpleasant to watch, that to see it again I would need to be paid over and above the price of my time. I am glad that I did not get a chance to see this movie before The Last Emperor: if I did, Bertolucci would be on my blacklist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frightening look at Europe!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat through the whole 5 and a half Un-cut Version, this masterpiece was Disturbing in more ways then one. Trust me I don't usually find movies disturbing but this one was hard to watch, it might be because of the fact that it really reminded me of Europe when I used to live there, the sights, the people and the culture.Now that I got that out of the way. This movie is about 2 men living in the early 1900's. The movie follows them from child hood to old age. Along the way meeting some interesting people and getting them salves into trouble. When watching the movie you might notice the beautiful landscapes, set designs and the frighteningly realistic acting. The movie can get boring at times and the story gets complicated as the movie goes on and on. But it's worth taking a look at if you like disturbing European movies, or if you just want to see a movie not corrupted by the so called Hollywood standards of film making!RATING 4 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst big film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My God, what's wrong with you people? I couldn't believe the large number of high ratings for this pathetic boondoggle! You Italian moviegoers ought to be ashamed of yourselves! This is abolutely the worst movie ever made by a filmmaker of Bertolucci's stature. This film makes HEAVEN'S GATE look like THE DEER HUNTER. At least HEAVEN'S GATE tried to tell a story! At no time during this film do we know who all the characters are or what they are trying to accomplish. All we get is one pointless scene after another. It's easy to see why Robert De Niro never talks about this film. Since the actors come from several different countries, the film is horrendously dubbed. Even De Niro's dialogue never quite fits his lip movements. In a typical scene in this movie, the characters yell or talk about...who knows? Politics? War? Sex? I couldn't figure it out. This charade goes on for more than 4 hours. If you can sit through the whole thing, you deserve a purple heart. The cinematography is ugly, the music is terrible, and the editing is nonexistent. A complete waste of money and talent. At least Bertolucci came to his senses for his next film, LUNA.</fullReview>
