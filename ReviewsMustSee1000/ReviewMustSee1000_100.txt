		<fullReview>I just returned from seeing a special preview of "The Help," which is due out in theaters this summer. Okay, so here's the truth: I'm a middle-aged, white male... I didn't read the book and I assumed, based on the fact that this is a virtually an all-female cast, that this was some sort of chick flick. Boy, was I wrong! This is an incredible film that not only pays justice to the bestseller on which it's based (according to those who have read the book AND seen the film), but is phenomenally cast, with exceptional performances by Viola Davis, Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard and Allison Janney. Veteran actresses Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson also deliver incredible performances. While Tyson's character is central to the storyline, her role comprises what seems to be a few, precious minutes of the 2:20 running time, she delivers, in my opinion, one of the most powerful and moving moments in the film...one in which she doesn't even utter a line (trust me, you'll know when you see it.)The Help also delivers some very funny moments and will make you laugh. I'll go so far as to say that this film and a few of its cast members will draw some Oscar nominations. I certainly think this takes Stone into a whole new level.The racial imbalances of 1963 are well illustrated in "The Help," and will, no doubt, underscore how far America has come, as well as how little progress we've made in the last 50 years. Either way, this is a powerful movie that needs to be seen on the big screen as soon as you can get a ticket.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film--and realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this film were total fiction bearing no relation to reality, it would still be worth seeing for the fine acting and production values--even if some of the young white women approached "Southern Gothic." But it wasn't fiction--at least, the depiction of Southern society wasn't. As I watched I kept drifting back to small-town South Carolina in the 1950s, where I grew up. It was moving and disturbing to be reminded how black people were treated then--loved and yet "kept down in their place." Our neighborhood was all middle-class and every family had a maid. There were plenty of boys my age, we visited in each other's homes, and called every maid by her first name. One even started a baseball team for the little white boys, for which her reward was a visit by the Klan.Our maid helped my mother cook and clean. One of my parents picked her up and took her home every day--and she rode in the back seat. She ate her lunch in our kitchen--without being allowed to use our utensils. I remember her eating with her fingers. I do not remember ever seeing her use our bathrooms. I thought about that during the movie and truly cannot recall what she did, an embarrassing gap in memory.I do remember when my father was out of work and our maid had to be cut back to three days a week. I actually cried; she was a member of our family. When talk about civil rights began in the late 1950s, my mother became annoyed at our maid for getting "uppity." And so it went. We moved to central Florida in 1961, where there were no maids.Travel back in time with this film. It's quite real, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from a special-screening of "The Help" at my local movie theatre, so I thought that I might as well do a review for all of you who are wanting to see this movie when it comes out.Now, first off, I must admit that I have only read a portion of the book, but I definitely do know a lot about it. After watching the trailer, I was intrigued, so of course, I visited the IMDb boards to learn more about it. At first glance, the casting caught my attention big-time. Emma Stone as 'Skeeter'? I bet most people were as shocked as I was to find out that she was cast as the main character -- but let me tell you what: the casting was superb! I could not have chosen a better cast than what was already chosen. There was amazing chemistry between both the antagonists and protagonists. I won't go into too much depth about the characters, but for me, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Sissy Spacek, and Octavia Spencer were the shining stars of the movie.Casting: 9.5/10 I know that there has been an on-going issue about this movie from a lot of people claiming that "the blacks had to be 'saved' by the whites" (pardon the language), or something along those lines. I have to agree that the trailer does give off that type of vibe -- Skeeter saving the colored-folks -- however, the movie tells and depicts otherwise - the colored-folks actually saved themselves. Minny and Aibileen, as well as the other colored-folks in the community, were the real "heroes" of the movie; they just needed someone to push them to their potential (Skeeter).I can not remember the last time I saw a movie that inspired me, made me cry, made me laugh, and made me sad, angry, and hopeful, all at the same time -- this is what "The Help" strides and aims for, without making it "cheesy". Without a doubt in my mind, there are definitely Oscar-worthy performances in this movie. Not only does this movie depict just the colored-folks' side of the story, but it also equally shows the feelings of the white-folks, as well. So, you definitely get both sides of the story without it being more or less "mean" or "degrading" to any sides.There are definitely a few awkward moments in the movie, but what movie doesn't have them? This movie started around 7:10 and ended around 9:20 -- about 2 hours and 10 minutes, give or take, if my calculations are correct. However, this movie only felt like it was an hour-long. It was so good that I didn't even know the two hours passed by until the theatre lights lid and the rolling credits began.All in all, this is a DEFINITELY-MUST-SEE movie. I personally believe that it is one of the best movies of 2011. Go see it -- you will not regret it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.Movie rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minny Don't Burn Chicken</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The film is based on the controversial best selling novel by Kathryn Stockett. It was controversial because it is the story of Jim Crow-era maids written by a white woman. Yes, the book is actually the fictionalized story of a white woman getting black maids to discuss their lives as maids for white folks. Rather than get into some politically correct dissertation on the book, movie or story, I will only comment on the film itself ... this very entertaining movie that also manages to deliver a timeless message.Let me first start by saying that this movie is incredibly well acted. It is quite rare to have so many developed characters in one movie. There are some characters we immediately connect with, while others draw our ire each time their face appears. The script and these fine actresses utilize humor to point out the shameful behavior of those who saw themselves as superior. The humor doesn't soften the ignorance or abuse, but it does make the film infinitely more watchable and entertaining. Please know this is not a documentary.Ms. Stockett's novel has a very loyal following in addition to the naysayers. A two hour film must, of course, take short cuts and trim story lines. Still the key elements are present. Based in Jackson, Mississippi during Governor Ross Barnett's term we see the social shark, Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), in her full glory of ignorance, entitlement and superiority. We see her minions and followers emulating her moves while trying to gain her approval.The story takes off when Skeeter (Emma Stone) graduates from Ole Miss and returns home and takes a job at the local newspaper. Possessing observation skills and humanity that her lifelong friends can't comprehend, Skeeter desperately wants to tell a story from the perspective of the maids. As expected, the maids are hesitant, but Aibileen (Viola Davis) does relent. The stories begin to flow and soon the robust Minny (Octavia Spencer) joins in. Others soon follow their lead and Skeeter's education goes to an entirely new level.That's really all of the story I care to discuss. The brilliance of this one is actually in the details ... individual scenes and moments of acting genius by most of the cast. In addition to those mentioned above, Jessica Chastain plays Celia, the "white trash" outcast who so desperately wants to be allowed back into the girls' club. Ms. Chastain was seen a few weeks ago in the fabulous "Tree of Life" in quite a different role ... I would venture to say no actress will have two roles of such variance this year. Also, Allison Janney plays Skeeter's cancer-stricken mother, and Sissy Spacek is Hilly's mother who gets tossed aside before she is ready to go! The great Cicely Tyson makes a brief appearance as Constantine, Skeeter's childhood maid who was done so wrong after 29 years of service. Mary Steenburgen has a couple of scenes as a big NYC book publisher.As a said, this is pure acting heaven, but I must single out Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Viola is so powerful at the beginning and end of the film, and Ms. Spencer is a force of nature during the middle. This movie is really their story and these two ladies make it fascinating, painful and a joy to behold. They both deserve recognition at Oscar time.There are so many fantastic details to the film. At times, it is like watching a classic car show ... the late 50's and early 60's models are works of art. The wardrobe, hair and make-up are perfect in setting up the class differentials. The TV and radio segments provide context and timing with the deaths of Medger Evers and JFK. Even the books on Skeeter's shelf make a statement: To Kill a Mockingbird, Huck Finn, Native Son, and Gone With the Wind.This story takes place 50 years ago and director Tate Taylor does an admirable job of bringing Stockett's novel to the big screen. Mr. Taylor is a longtime friend of Ms. Stockett's and was quite fortunate to get the directing rights. He doesn't disappoint. Sure the story is a bit glossy at times ... it is geared towards the masses. If you are looking for more depth, there are numerous documentaries available on the Civil Rights movement. If you are seeking a very entertaining movie that uses humor to tell a story and send a message, then this one's for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film to Remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took our 12 year old daughter to see this movie and we both loved it. She was not thrilled when I told her we were going to see a film that told a story from the civil rights era but when we left she said she loved it because of the women's courage, their humor and the power of their friendships. We had never seen most of the actors which was refreshing and the acting by the entire cast made it easy to get totally involved. I laughed out loud and shed quite a few tears in The Help, and will remember it and recommend it to my friends. It was wonderful to see so many scenes in which the actors related to each other so perfectly. Even the vilest characters showed moments of conflict within themselves as they played out poor behavior that had long been inbred in them. I am especially grateful to the team who provided a film that told an engaging story about human relationships with important lessons for my daughter. That is a rare occurrence in today's movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must See, Oscar Worthy film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently the other Dude and I were discussing that not many award worthy movies come out during the summer; then I see The Help. To say it is not a story that I am normally interested in would be an understatement. I wasn't around during the time of segregation to fully appreciate the depth of this story. Additionally, if there was ever a movie that screamed "chick flick" it would be this one. In spite of that, I've heard wonderful things about the book and decided to view the movie. I'm happy to say that I'm glad that I did. Virtually unknown director Tate Taylor put together a cast of relatively unknown actors and actresses that truly made the story go. Taylor, whose last movie was the little seen Pretty Ugly People, grabbed a familiar actress to join him in making The Help, Allison Janney. Other than Janney the only other familiar actresses in the movie are Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spacek. The rather unknown cast has a fresh feeling on the story and there are no preconceived notions based on a past actor or actresses work. That being said Emma Stone (Easy A), and Viola Davis had a true coming out party in The Help. Both women played fantastic parts, which really made the cast mesh nicely together. Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain were all spectacular in supporting roles alongside Stone and Davis.When a movie doesn't have the explosions, crazy action or crude humor that we've become accustomed to seeing in newer movies there has got to be a great story attached in order to maintain your interest; The Help had that great story. There aren't many movies that have you laughing, crying, or getting angry and end up still being fantastic and that is where this one had me. With my common rule of no movie should be over 2 hours unless it is special; this one is very special. I would be surprised if there aren't a number of nominations coming.Children: If they can handle a lot of dialog it is age appropriate for 10+ Award Worthy: YES!

		<shortDescription>Mesmerizing - Pure Oscar Material!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar Oscar Oscar ? Kathryn Stockett's beautiful book is Oscar worthy in this film -- for editing, screenplay, supporting actress (several deserving) ? Emma Stone just shines ? at just 22 years old, this film proves she is a force to be reckoned with in Hollywood. There are so few roles written for black women and I was thrilled to see such great roles filled by Viola Davis (Abigail) and Octavia Spencer (Minnie) - both should be nominated for supporting roles although in my opinion, along with Emma Stone, all three share top billing.The character development in this movie is really outstanding ? I hate movies with flat single dimension characters and these from the lowest to those with the most screen time are just remarkably developed ? even the newspaper editor, the lines they chose for him to keep gave you enough information that even he is a memorable character with only three scenes, maybe 4 in the entire movie. Same for Stuart, Skeeter's love interest ? you actually like him then hate him and he only has maybe 3 minutes of air time. Great great job. Sissy Spacek with so few speaking moments is great as is Cicely Tyson who speaks volumes even in scenes with no words. Admittedly, being based on an amazing book the background story was already set out and tracks the book closely without some of the details but they have done a great job of putting it to film ? This movie sets out beautifully a terrible time in our history that unfortunately is not over ? it is better, but not over by a long shot. Being a child of the south and coming up during that time, being raised by such bigoted grandparents and parents, it leaves me pause to wonder how I avoided this rabid virus of hate and takes me back to long hot lazy days in the deep south before every building was air conditioned ? such attention detail right down to the Jesus fans they waved in church ? awesome flick. You FEEL the heat, the tension, the pain, the injustice of the time but still you laugh with them even as you cry for them - both races - ignorance is to be wept over.However, I think this movie does more, goes further in its exploration of the behavior of the privileged during that time. They were rabid toward blacks but were not that much better toward anyone who did not share their socio-economic status (the way the "Junior League" treated Celia) and the enormous peer pressure they put on one another (the club encouraging Skeeter's mother to make a poor decision). It visits the sins of the parents passed on to their children ? the bigotry and injustice that is learned at the knee of our elders. OMG it is just an awesome, poignant, moving, NOT TO BE MISSED film.Mesmerizing from start to finish ? never once drags ? just an easy easy easy 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ready to burst . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up in the 60's, the setting for The Help, a story of Southern prejudice and cruelty toward African Americans, who were chattel of the Southern rich treating their servants as expendable and marginal. I can say that as a Northerner with a black maid for our household, there was love but always a barrier, a carryover from the strict separation still prevailing after reconstruction.Director Tate Taylor keeps the race relations taut but not strident, as if we were living through the emerging civil rights movement slowly but inevitably aimed at equality, not "separate but equal." Skeeter (Emma Stone) graduates, returns to Jackson, Miss., and decides to write about the black help, whose "perspective' needs to be told. As more maids join in the writing of the manuscript, the more possible it is to counter the assassination of Medgar Evers and eventually that of Martin Luther King.While we have grown used to the base scatological humor of the Hangovers, Change-UP, and other rom-coms, the fundament motif in The Help is as low-key as will ever be depicted in film. Not only is the idea of the bad guys "eating s?t" effective, it is funny and poignant.A note about the performances?Bryce Dallas Howard as the conservative, prejudiced Hilly, is remarkably successful, making her a full-fledged actress and not just a famous director's daughter. Jessica Chastain as the ditzy but big-hearted Celia Foote cements her place as a great modern actress following her memorable role as the compliant wife in Tree of Life. Emma Stone no longer need rely on rom-coms, for she stars in The Help with a performance nuanced and underplayed, just the way I like it, albeit a bit too hip for the times.Although the film tends toward the simplistic, e.g., there are no bad blacks and most whites are obtuse, Viola Davis as maid Aibileen Clark successfully carries the film displaying the ambivalent nature of slavery ready to burst out of its chains.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lovely performances makes this far too clean and neat story, not merely palatable but enjoyable. We know by now that the plight of the "colored" in the South wasn't that clean cut or gentle in any way or shape. Here we can sit and watch discovering the depth of he ordeal in the wonderful face of Viola Davis. But, it all remains in the mild margins of the real story. Entertaining yes but I couldn't forget documentaries of the period or "The Long Walk Home" with Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek. Sissy Spacek is in "The Help" too and she's very funny. It also shows Bryce Dallas Howard under a new light. The bitchy, almost evil light. She's better here than she's ever been. Emma Stone is lovely and the wonderful Allison Janney in a disturbingly recognizable character raises the film to unexpected levels. I felt the film was too long and too careful not to offend anybody and that's were its weaknesses lay. But, I do recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Safe Fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So....I went and saw The Help last night.I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't as offensive as "The Blind Side" (ala the big overgrown, illiterate, strong as an ox, loyal, gullible, clown saved by a white Christian savior caricature) but the overall story was pretty watered down. The acting is solid, but I was torn about this movie. It does elicit the "Great White Hope" character, in that the maids only come together through the unlikely liberalism and goodness of a young white character. Its message for the future is also disturbing. For example, toward the end, one maid is offered salvation by a white couple who offers her the security of being their maid for the REST OF HER LIFE...a deal that makes her eyes grow wide with happiness. Meanwhile, the main white character goes off to greener pastures outside the limitations of her town.There are also some unsettling caricatures...like a "Mammy" figure who gets misty eyed when she talks about how frying chicken makes her feel good inside.I think they were pretty spot on in the portrayal of the white "southern belles (given that I'm from Jackson myself)." They were mostly ridiculous, petty and cold...which, to my understanding, is how they really were. It makes for some good comedic moments.This is a "safe" film...there's no violence, and the threat of violence doesn't feel very immediate or nearby. The racism of the day feels like an omniscient boogey-man...and the white men in the film are all portrayed in an indifferent "they could care less" light...which seems VERY unbelievable. And the Black men were either abusive, docile or messengers...I mean, not a single, strong Black man?The real sad thing about this film is what it says about Black progress in Hollywood. I haven't seen "real" roles for black women this year...and it's telling that the project that employs the most black women at once is one where they all have to play maids. Even in a trailer shown before this film for "Tower Heist," Gabourey Sidibe (from "Precious") is playing a maid...complemented by Eddie Murphy playing a convict with expert knowledge on robberies. So, blacks are either subservient, criminals, comedic clowns...or the ever present "token black friend." The exception to this rule are the few Blacks that are seen as being "negro-lite"...e.g. Will Smith, Halle Berry and Beyonce. Many whites don't understand why Blacks are sensitive to their portrayals on film...but whites have to realize...you have an abundance of images to choose from. However, we have very few. Imagine taking your children to the movies...and the people that look like them, on screen, are usually stupefied, marginalized, subservient or comedic to the point of buffoorney. That's not the reality whites EVER have to accept, adapt to or address. This is not playing the race card...as there is no card to play when this is your life.My grandmother was a maid, like these women in the film. She went to work every day for the local car dealer's family...doing housework, cooking their meals and taking care of their kids for $5/day. She supplemented her income ironing white people's clothes from town. She raised 10 kids and helped with the war effort at home. While a film like "The Help" gives her a voice, it also robs her of hope that things will get better. After all, one maid quits her job even though her options are extremely limited and she has jeopardized her own safety by helping Skeeter...the other maid accepts a position to be the lifetime maid of another couple and then leaves her abusive husband...and the third maid that we come to know is rotting in jail. The only people who make out with better futures are the white characters....Skeeter is off to New York. Celia learns how to cook and, through the "wisdom" of her maid, learns how to communicate with her husband and develops self worth. The young white child Viola was raising may get a "fighting chance" because Viola tells her mother to give her one. And Hilly may actually become a better person who's finally learned the error of her ways.Finally, there is one part that really summarized this whole film to me. At one point, Skeeter is sitting at Viola Davis's table. She asks her if she ever wanted to do anything else rather than be a maid. Viola Davis nods...and Skeeter never follows up with her to ask her what she wanted to do. My feeling was she didn't ask because it was irrelevant...irrelevant to the story and to the reality of the time. Black women didn't have choices, so there was no reason to speak of dreams that they both knew were empty.All in all, I think this film is a nice effort for what it was, and fluff for what it was not.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anachronistic, melodramatic take on discrimination against civil rights era domestic workers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Help' is a well-meaning attempt to educate the film going public about the civil rights era in the deep South through the perspective of the relationship between black maids and their white female employers.&nbsp; Author Kathryn Stockett, who wrote the book on which the film is based, does well in reminding us that the black 'help' not only had to endure the threat of violence as a result of the encroaching backlash from white racists upset over a new black militancy in southern communities, but also had to deal with a multiplicity of indignities on the drab domestic front, including being forced to use separate bathrooms in the homes of their white female employers.&nbsp; Not only does Hilly Holbrook (the film's principal 'villain') enforce this rule in her own home and influences her immediate neighbors to follow suit, but lobbies local politicians in order to have her racist initiative be codified into law.While Hilly may be a tad bit melodramatic as Stockett's 'Cruella de Vil', she is undoubtedly the most compelling character in the entire film. Stockett also does well with Elizabeth Leefolt, Aibileen's racist employer, who is perhaps more repulsive than Hilly, in that she does not have the self-awareness to realize that she is an incompetent mother. Occasionally, Stockett even suggests that some of oppressed maids may not have all their moral compasses in order. In perhaps one of the most interesting scenes in the film (due to the ambiguity), one of the maids is roughly pulled off a bus and arrested by seemingly racist, redneck policeman. I could hear the indignant sounds of the audience suddenly go quiet, when it's revealed that the maid arrested was the one who pilfered a diamond ring that had fallen behind a cabinet in the home of one of the white employers.Despite Stockett's noble attempt to relate the atmosphere of institutional racism so prevalent in the south during early 1960s, her main character, Skeeter, feels wholly anachronistic. It's as if Stockett projected her own modern day sensibility on to Skeeter and asks us to believe that such a character would have existed at that time. If there were progressive minded white liberals participating in the civil rights movement in the early 60s, usually they came from the north and were often met with outright violence. To have such a progressive minded white female from the south take up the cause of the oppressed black 'help', let alone create a book based on interviews with such women, is simply wish fulfillment on the part of the author. Stockett is obviously trying to mitigate some of her own guilt by creating the illusory, "feel-good" character of Skeeter. No book like "The Help" ever appeared in the early 60s and it would have never been published at that time.There's another reason why 'The Help' makes little sense. Why would "The Help" ever agree to Skeeter's plan? They certainly receive little financial compensation for their efforts and in the end, they're only setting themselves up for retaliation. A character in a book might take some satisfaction in mouthing off against an employer who subjects them to racist humiliation, but in the real world (and especially in the 60s deep South), one doesn't 'talk back', unless one wants to lose their sole source of support. Of course there were individual black women who worked as maids who could have 'talked back' and lost their jobs, but to suggest such a large group of women agreed to interviews en masse, is another one of Stockett's 'feel-good' conceits! While all those juicy interviews Stockett collected from the 'Help' may have worked in the book, the stories come off as dry recitations in the film. We don't actually experience the maids' stories visually?they are merely communicated to Skeeter during the interviews. Obviously, flashbacks wouldn't have worked during the interview scenes since there were too many of them. Stockett's other big problem with the 'Help' is that she's forced to place her main 'Help' characters on a pedestal. Yes Aibileen and Minny ARE victims but can they do no wrong? It may have been a more interesting story if "The Help" were REALLY told from their perspective. Stockett unfortunately is unable to make the Help's world come alive?do they actually have a back story? (the best we get is an allusion to Minny's "abusive" husband who never appears on screen). Or is everything defined by their relationship to the white world?Stockett resorts to melodramatic form, by offering up storytelling akin to a decidedly unsubtle 'quid pro quo.' You have your evil Hilly and then you need to counter it with the ditsy but kind Cecelia Foote, another unbelievable character designed to prove that whites weren't all that bad during the era. Even Charlotte, Skeeter's mother, must be subject to Stockett's quid pro quo treatment (Charlotte channels Hilly when she banishes beloved family maid Constantin in order to appease her racist club members but then sticks up for Skeeter when Hilly tries to blackmail her daughter).Worst of all are Stockett's male characters who are practically non-existent in the film. I didn't buy for one second that Skeeter would have actually been attracted to the boyfriend and gone out with him for a time. Wouldn't she have clarified from the beginning that he was a racist and had nothing to do with him? For those who are interested in getting a better picture of black life during the civil rights era, can I recommend the classic 1964 picture, 'Nothing But a Man'? 'The Help' only seems to suggest that white people deserve more credit than they really should receive for aiding black people in their quest for social equality and justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disservice to Important History</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film uses every cliché in the book starting with the liberal minded white person who is the voice of conscience and the long suffering good hearted but somewhat simplistic black people.This film is emotionally manipulative and panders to a sentimental reduction of complex history. Its moves were predictable and uses every trick in the book, even the scene in the church is cliché. Both the white and the black characters are mostly reductive caricatures out of some story book world which doesn't do justice to the historical complexity of such situations. Why would you want to make a saccharine comic book out of profound historical situations-- other than to pander to audiences longing for a feel good experience for the sake of box office. I actually don't mean to disrespect to people who like it, and I don't want to attack the actors. They didn't write the film, but at the same time, I can't believe that so many people fell for this bag of tricks. Still, a bigger problem and disservice a movie like this does to our culture is that such bad history and simplistic human portrayals turns race dynamics into good guy bad guy stories which we can watch with a complacent feeling of how much better we are than those bad old days. Such complacency leads to a historical ignorance that retards honest critique and real progress. This movie would be better if it just didn't pretend to be about something. Let it be some sappy comic book. That wouldn't be the worse thing in the world. At least it would be more honest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cartoon caricatures trivialize in black and white,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie wasn't badly made, it's just bad that it was made. In it every character is a cliché cartoon in support of a fictional rose coloured glasses version of 60's America, where almost every white person is a villain and every black person loves fried chicken. If this is how America learns its history (and judging by the reviews where many have viewed this film as having a positive and accurate message of hope and struggle????), then no wonder the western world is in trouble. Is it worse that a story about the struggle of black people to overcome oppression in racist 60s America is centered on a privileged white woman on the road to New York success? Marginalized yet again it seems. This movie started out as passable entertainment but by the time it crossed the finished line it had stepped full force into misguided and offensive. And shockingly many people seem to not know the difference.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hold on just a minute - cartoon city</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I grew up during this period in the south and we always had a black maid. We loved our black maid Veronica (first black person I'd ever seen and I thought she was made of my favorite stuff -- chocolate), and our family corresponded with her (and sent her money) for years after we moved. Other families had black maids and no one ever, ever, ever, ever, ever talked about them or treated them the way they are in this film (haven't read the book) but instead with value and respect, though within the confines of the segregationist times. That whole bathroom issue --silly, never happened that I witnessed or heard of.Don't get me wrong: It was certainly a period and relationship worth examination from our more modern era. I can recall at one point going out to visit our maid who was sick. She lived on a piece of farmland -- had all these children, our counterpart, and we played together while parents visited, though I was aware that it was like looking in a mirror, dark on other side. And one can bemoan the disparity of the period (but we still have it though) and still-rampart racism back then that was just taken for granted by everyone. But, no, ma'am, nothing about this movie rang true beyond the fact that the maids were always black, generally poorer, and, yes, helped raise white babies (sang to them, fed them, fussed at them, did their -- my -- hair). Maybe there was just some peculiar cesspool in Jackson, but if anyone had acted like the villain did where we lived, she'd probably be sent for mental treatment (actually not, but everyone would know she was insane).And by the way, no one back then said "Damn" in front of a woman (opening scene), "Jesus" as a cuss-word (opening scene), and heaven forbid "Sh-t" (many times) which I never once heard in my life until college. In summary, this movie struck me as a bit of a cartoon. Plunked down in a real period lifestyle are cartoonish villains as well as cartoonish heroines. Guess you needed to put in such stuff for Hollywood. Or maybe the writer added it to finally get sold. Too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For people who've never seen a movie depicting the civil rights movement, this would not be a good place to start. If you watched it and found it 'entertaining', then shame on you. Making up a story about this time to entertain and manipulate for profit is pretty despicable in my view, and I'm afraid I'm incredibly disappointed that this film seems to be getting positive reviews on here.If you lack education and a general sense of right and wrong - this is the film for you. There are so many important great works in film and in literature on the era and topic. How did this get made? It's also racist in and of itself in its depiction of black people and the white people are so disgusting and caricatures of evil. It's entertaining only if you are almost completely ignorant of that period of time - for the rest of us it's just offensive. It's also got that well worn trope of the black women helping a white woman to succeed / act as an apologist for (here's the spoiler) her taking off to NY in her big successful career while one happily continues to be beaten by her husband and the other loses her job.100 thumbs down.P.S. I'm not alone: "The Association of Black Women Historians finds it unacceptable for either this book or this film to strip black women's lives of historical accuracy for the sake of entertainment." Yes!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is like one of those afternoon made for TV "life affirming" dramas. Full of sugar, whimsy and wholesomeness but totally lacking in truth and bite. Ugh! The performances are almost uniformly two dimensional - even Allison Janney opted for cartoon like characterisation. The period detail is sometimes accurate but occasionally glaringly inaccurate. For example no girl in the early 60s would have worn her hair in Emma Stone's hopelessly anachronistic style. I blame Tate Taylor who was credited with the screenplay and direction. Apparently Taylor was born in Jackson and is a close friend of Kathryn Stockett. Can this really be how Ms Stockett wished her novel to be brought to the screen? But there again I haven't read the novel. Could it be full of the same yukky apple pie philosophy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The question that kept irking at me while watching this in the year 2011? This reminds me of one of those old blaxploitation films gone "chick" flick, or maybe a second rate version of "Steel Magnolias" with a Jim Crow law plot thrown in. The main problem I have with "The Help" is that it lacks the courage it needs to tackle these race relation issues.The movie actually starts off well and sets to be a tragic telling with some historical value. However in trying to appeal to everyone it randomly ends up just falling into 30 minutes of comedic jesting out of nowhere and then manipulative "tear-jerking" scenes just for the sake of them. In all this desperation to try to appeal to anyone the story ends up being useless drivel and all the characters fall into stereotypical categories. The movie's one saving grace is that each of the actors in this show exemplary ability. Too bad it was all just to turn into Hollywood nonsense."The Help" is based off a book, which was written by a White lady, through the point-of-view of a Black maid. Ignore all of the novel writer Kathryn Stockett's, high school creative classroom flaws, just admire the nostalgia of the days of the segregated South. If the writing didn't have you rolling your eyes from all of these ridiculously naive concepts and glibness, just know that racial problems can always be solved with fried chicken? "The Help" may actually seem decent to some of the popcorn flick goers who are easily manipulated. Don't be fooled, by the making light of a serious historical dilemma and trying to instead romanticize the time. Don't accept the malarkey marketing trying to pass this off as uplifting. What we need is a real movie thought over and that offers women empowerment, all this movie is sadly, is a crock. 3/10</fullReview>

They made the movie realistic and followed the characters from the book exactly. I don't think many actresses could have pulled it off. Also, it was a relief to see that Hilly was a lot less intimidating in the movie than in the book. What I like most about The Help is that it wouldn't be a huge deal to not have read the book; the movie would suffice (creating the same emotions in both film and book). Two side notes: (1) even after seeing the movie, read the end of the book regarding the author. (2) Emma is awesome--would love to work with her!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Help</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is one of the many films that's set in the 60s that deals with themes like prejudice and racism involving segregation amongst the Whites and the African Americans in Jackson, Mississippi, but having the very same themes also being relevant in society today even here in Singapore especially, with recent talk and focus on the issue of domestic help and our attitudes toward household maids that many employ for various reasons, who assist in looking after the children and the elderly, as well as to keep home while the rest of the adults are neck deep in economic pursuits. While racism is generally kept under control here, there are niggling incidents that pop up every now and then, so clearly we're not off the hook and there will always be individuals who choose intolerance.Granted that racism back then was more pronounced especially during that era put on film, the story's based on an international bestseller written by Kathryn Stockett, and over here we're bound to identify with the issues highlighted especially in the horror stories you'd hear with regards to the treatment of domestic help, with abuse cases that make you sit up and wonder why we are capable of such inhumane acts. And the worst of all involves being hypocritical, putting on a false front for society, while clearly behaving like the devil when behind closed doors. The bottom line is, we're all humans and we share similar hopes and dreams whatever our skin colour, language and where we're from, in desiring a comfortable life filled with love, with a roof over our heads, food and community, friends and family we can turn to in times of need. Which is why this film has themes and a poignant, thought provoking narrative that screams relevance, especially for those closeted intolerant few who must watch this, and reflect. Emma Stone stars as Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, an aspiring journalist who has returned home only to find out that the group of peers she had grown up with, are leading a lifestyle of superficial leisure, saying a lot of things, but meaning nothing. And for all their cliquish behaviour in cruelly treating one of their own as a social outcast (Jessica Chastain from The Tree of Life), for an ulterior reason only Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) knows, what more their household maids who have to slog with the chores, be that surrogate mother to their kids, be at their beck and call, and being given attitude, stick, and threats of the sack?Given the tension all round during the time, it's no wonder that Skeeter's plans to want to highlight The Help's predicament and provide them with a voice, no doubt also serving as a ticket for her journalistic ambitions to embark on a career in New York, all met with stone walled silence, until Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) decided that enough is enough, and begin opening up to Skeeter as research material, becoming her insights and perspective on how the African American help get treated in White households. And besides Aibileen's point of view, her friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) also chipped in, and both represent the broad spectrum of heartfelt accounts both good and bad, though largely negative, with the tacit understanding with Skeeter that they are not to be referred to directly.It's one of those powerful films that takes the ugly side of humanity and presents it to us face on, to confront how cruel some of us can be, and what the strong amongst us must do to act and help those who are weak or bullied. Director Tate Taylor, who also wrote the screenplay, focuses on the tales crafted around the households both Aibileen and Minny serve, from being treated like dirt to forming firm friendships with some of the people they know and serve, such as Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain), as a reminder on how we should never judge a book by its cover, being obviously relevant when one gets handed one's fate for being of a certain skin colour. You may think that this may be a heavy film with all its seriousness, but trust me there is enough light hearted, even heart warming moments scattered throughout, though counter-balanced with moments of fear that will make you worry for the characters since mob mentality can lead to anything.Emma Stone normally plays kooky characters of late, so this was perfect opportunity for her to shine in more serious drama which she does adequately. But she got upstaged by both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, the former who brought a certain quiet dignity to her role which just calls for respect, and the latter being the comic relief as a really straight-talker, and whose story was probably the most touching in the film, with one of the funniest, running gag in the later half. Bryce Dallas Howard also owned her role as the antagonist Hilly in the film, and if you'd think she's only capable of goody two shoes roles, think again as she can convincingly play back-stabbers, with Sissy Spacek in a supporting role as Hilly's mom.The Help reminds us of how one has to have Fear and Courage to addresses changes in community or the larger society we serve in, without which we would all be poorer for it. It may be almost 2 1/2 hours long, but it's every minute worth it just watching how an uphill battle was fought, and baby steps being taken each time to overcome obstacles placed in the characters' way. It's guaranteed that you'll laugh and you'll cry in the film thanks to its material, and it's firmly one of the contenders to be amongst my favourite films of this year. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unforgettable Movie about a Forgettable Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Jackson, Mississippi, in the 60's, the aspirant writer Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) has just graduated and returns home after finding a job writing in a futile newspaper column in the local newspaper. When she arrives home, she finds that her nanny and family's maid Constantine Jefferson (Cicely Tyson) is gone. Skeeter sees the chance of writing a book about the relationship of the black maids with the Southern society for an editor from New York. First she convinces Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) to open her heart to her; then Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) is unfairly fired by the arrogant Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who is a leader in the racist high society, and Minny decides to tell her stories after finding a job with the outcast Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain). Soon eleven other maids accept to be interviewed by Skeeter that also tells the truth about Constantine. When the book "The Help" is released, Jackson's high society will never be the same."The Help" is an unforgettable movie about a forgettable time in the history of the United States of America. The engaging story is supported by magnificent performances and the viewer does not feel the 146 minutes running time. The performances of Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain are top-notch and all of them deserved at least nomination to the Oscar and major film festivals. The direction is tight and art direction is very realistic. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Histórias Cruzadas" ("Entwined Stories")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slave Tired Of These Images</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate this movie. I hate everything about it. As a college educated, married, faithful Black Man in America I am here to say I'm slave tired of these "step n' fetch it" roles. These are the kind of depictions that Hollywood and white America seems to LOVE to see my sons and daughters emulate. But a film like The Great Debaters gets virtually ignored. Oh I get it... I'm just tired of it.The FACT that Black people are - mired in the abyss - of abject poverty, disproportionate incarceration and homicide rates, drug addiction, lack of education and inadequate housing is not fictional entertainment - but REALITY. I understand Black America is not a monolith, but the socioeconomic and sociocultural status of the Black America I speak of is in real trouble. Viola Davis is a fantastic actor but her talent is wasted in The Help. Black Americans need STRONGER and MORE POWERFUL and PROGRESSIVE IMAGES IN FILM!! Hello... The Mammy character is dead. The Uncle Tom character is dead... or should be. Let's move forward.I'm not sure what Black America you THINK you know, but the Black America I know is one of profound sadness. This is 2012! Not 1960! Have you ever spent anytime at all in an inner city ghetto? Have you ever seen project tenements in Kansas City, MO, Memphis, TN or Atlanta, GA? You've been BAMBOOZLED (a movie that should have won an Oscar) into thinking that all Black Americans are well educated and financially secure. Most Black people aren't lawyers, musicians, rappers or professional athletes. Black men are in fact more likely to be in prison than in college. Why is that?One of my greatest wishes is for gifted and talented Black actors, directors and producers to pool their intellectual and financial resources, devising ways to create better images and stories for the Black community instead of feeding into a racist Hollywood that does not (and has NEVER) had our best interests at heart. Be honest with yourself... Hollywood and their corporate sponsors could give a rats ass about the Black community, but they don't mind striping our daughters naked.Doesn't anyone else see a problem when the only way Black Actors can become so-called "successful" - is when they either sell out in an interracial relationship, have sex with Billy Bob Thornton on screen or sell degrading images of their people as being pimps, drug dealers, whores, gangsters, buffoons and ...maids?If you have any shred of self-respect you will stay away from not only this movie The Help, but every movie like it. Rent and/or buy Bamboozled and The Great Debaters instead. You'll feel better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploits real suffering, and panders for sympathy without doing anything genuine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a hard film to adequately review, because so much is right with it, yet at the same time so much is wrong. Or if not "wrong," at least there are some major tones that simply did not work for me.The cast is spectacular. Emma Stone is not just adorable, but a skilled and marvelous actor. You don't need me to remark that she has a stellar career ahead of her. The rest of the cast includes some of those great character actors you see in the better films, but can't quite remember where you've seen them before. but that's a plus for a character actor, as their appearances, therefore, always seems fresh.It feels very awkward for me to mention the tone that felt wrong. The abuse and inhumane treatment endured by black people 50 years ago is hard to watch today. The pain inflicted, and the behavior of the oppressors can only be called an "evil" situation. One hopes that evolution has done its work, and social justice prevails today. If not perfectly, then at least to a tolerable degree.But that is part of the problem, to me. This film seems to merely recycle old tropes of injustice. It seems to be, as one of my professors used to call it, a "pot stirrer." Lots of agitation and angst and shame and sympathy just for the sake of chaos--- but here it doesn't seem to be authentic. It certainly doesn't seem to go anywhere. It's almost as if the writer has taken an easy issue guaranteed to provoke outrage and anger, rather than doing the authentic, and difficult, artistic work necessary to invoke compassion and healing. This film might be, to be blunt, merely counterfeit social justice. It might be a brazen attempt to "push buttons" for undeserved sympathy. I sincerely hope I am mistaken, and overly unkind.Granted, that's a subtle point. But that's also why I found the theme of the film a bit objectionable- it seemed as if the filmmakers were taking advantage of most people's natural and gut-level decency to elicit an audience response on a tabloid level.Further, who would DARE to criticize this film? It's almost as if it were "criticism proof." Therefore unsound dramatic treatments will go by without comment. Given that I think that was done deliberately, even if somewhat unconsciously, this movie takes an honorable and lofty struggle for which many people suffered and even died, and shamelessly exploits that to make a few bucks at the box office. Think about it- what insights or "new" themes were introduced here? I'd say none. It may be an example of what Plato called "pandering," going for the cheap points via a stimulus-response fest.I hope I am wrong- I hope it is really just a matter of me not responding to this particular cinematic venture. If I am even partly right, however, it bodes ill for our modern shallow and thoughtless "junk media" environment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oddly, I enjoyed the help. it's a strong story well told, beautifully photographed with exceptional period feel, and is sincerely and expertly performed.Despite is weighty veneer, it's also patronising and manipulative. I don't know for sure but I'm guessing this movie is made by white folk, with the usual feel-better gloss about a terrible subject. Leonard Maltin wrote that this film's lone failing was its stereotypes. Certainly Bryce Dallas Howard's Hilly is he most obvious example but really the movie is peppered with stereotypes: the shallow housewife; the modern go-girl (who just happens to be an diamond in the rough, just to emphasise that its what's inside that counts, and that white people have real problems too); the bimbo with a heart; the mother who wishes she had the strength; the oppressed but wise housemaid; the bread-winning husbands that look the other way, and so on and so on.It might be cathartic for white Americans to make and see films like The Help but really they're not fooling anyone. The Help is shiny and clever, but to me and surely many other non-Americans, its shallow, narcissistic and and unfairly self-congratulatory.Somewhere there must be a filmmaker and studio that has the balls to tell modern audiences the stories of the real struggle of African Americans against their white oppressors; something that contains a stronger resolution that a swell of pride and a cold sore. I'll take that over this sugar coated Oscar bait thanks.</fullReview>

UGH. Not my opinion of good taste, this film makes every white woman in the south a bitch and every black woman holier than thou. Where is Michele Bachman's opinion, now that we need her.

		<fullReview>I had eagerly awaited the movie as the book was an absolute masterpiece. I was rather disappointed. My guess is that people who have not read the book will like the movie. It is well acted and makes for a good story -- just a different one from the story written in the book.One semi major character is changed from a very complicated person -- sympathetic but hardly enlightened or heroic -- to something entirely different -- a converted true believer. Other characters simply become flatter and more "stock" than in the book -- though that may be inevitable when adapting a novel written in three first person voices into a movie.The main problem with the movie is that it really does not attempt to capture the violence, brutality and fear of the period. In the book these things hang over the characters and there is a real sense of danger. In the movie "danger" is spoken of but hardly palpable. Segregationists (aside from the one villain, Hilly) appear more rude than brutal. As a (white) southern man who lived in that era I know it was a lot tougher than that.Overall, it is a good movie. If the source material did not exist I'd rate it higher. But being adapted from a much more nuanced and stronger work, it suffers in comparison. See it. But read the book. And especially take young people to see it who may not be willing to read the book first. Because even glossed over, it does show a side of American history that the younger generation may not fully appreciate. Maybe it will spark discussion and maybe some of them will read the book for a fuller understanding of how things used to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So help me...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife had recently read the source novel and was most keen to see this movie adaptation, plus I have a keen interest in the US Civil Rights movement and was likewise keen to see it. Perhaps it helps to be an American to appreciate some of the nuances a bit better, but I basically found this a sentimentalised and overly patronising story, with as much resonance as an episode of "The Waltons" or "Little House On The Prairie". The basic idea of the young college girl writing up her town-life experience and causing controversy as she does so was used before in "Peyton Place", that historical but much decorated cinematic piece of soap opera, which for me is about the level the film achieves.In addition, one of the major plot-lines (regarding the shall I say, tainted "gift" of a pie) was immediately apparent to me because of a similar scene I recalled from the seminal 70's TV series "Roots", which dealt with the big issue here more exhaustively and realistically. There are lots of episodic scenes demonstrating the ebb and flow of "the help's" struggle for acceptance, with some drop-in insertions to the narrative from real-time, real-life events such as the murder of Medgar Evers, but I felt the direction catered to the cosy and felt little real drama throughout. Similarly I felt the acting to be showy and shallow by pretty much everyone in the cast, indeed no-one came across as real and I failed to engage with the characters. The depiction of time and place is excellent but students of this era looking for insight and emotional connection with this shaming episode of modern American history should buy or rent out "Roots" instead. Oh and make sure you get out of your seat quickly at the end to avoid the overblown Mary J Blige power-ballad over the end-titles which only adds to the disconnect here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>(The white girl who cares about) The Help</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You is kind. You is smart. You is important" is the mantra that "You is kind. You is smart. You is important" is the mantra that Abileen Clark (Viola Davis), a domestic worker in Jackson, Mississippi in the 1960ies, uses to comfort and empower her employer's daughter. Neglected by a mother who finds her too chubby and cumbersome, and a constantly absent father, Abileen is the only caring adult in the girl's life, the one who's there for her through real and metaphorical storms.Based on the bestseller by the same name written by Kathryn Stocket in 2009, the movie version of The Help, directed by Tate Taylor, tells the story of the young aspiring writer Eugenia (nicknamed Skeeter and played by Emma Stone). Skeeter is different from Elizabeth (Ahna O'Reilly), Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her other friends who spend their time playing bridge, organising charity events and being snooty. Instead of trying to find a husband, Skeeter's focusing on her career. She also believes that black domestic workers shouldn't be treated as subhumans; a radical view stemming from her relationship with her old nanny Constantine (Cicely Tyson), who raised Skeeter before disappearing without a trace. After landing a job answering housekeeping questions for a newspaper column, Skeeter, who knows nothing about housework, asks Elizabeth to let her domestic worker Abileen help her. After a short time in Abileen's company, Skeeter realises that life as a black domestic worker isn't all rosy, and the idea is born to collect the stories of all the invisible hardworking black women surrounding her and her friends and write a book. Initially reluctant Abileen eventually succumbs and convinces her friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer), an outspoken lady who has just been fired by Hilly to help Skeeter realize her dream. As the film progresses the audience is treated to various displays of racist stuck up behaviour, bad parenting, loyalty and silent resistance. "This isn't about me. It doesn't matter what I feel", Skeeter promises early in the film which turns out to be mainly about her, Elizabeth, Hilly and the ostracized housewife Celia (Jessica Chastain). As New York Press' reviewer Armond White points out the main aim of the film is to entertain, which might explain the lack of engagement with the subject matter at a level that considers the changes that have influenced discussions about race, gender and power in America since the sixties. The approach makes for a dated film that requires the audience to ignore the most important change; that black American women no longer rely on white spokespersons to voice their concerns. Abileen's, Minny's and Constantin's primary function in The Help, a film that does little to challenge traditional racial power dynamics, and translates black agency into steeling and black pride into frying chicken, is simply to help us distinguish good whites from bad, coward and victim whites. The Help is a film that suffers badly from a shallow treatment of a complex subject matter and blatant slapsticky stereotyping (incl. Minny delivering one Chappellesque line about chicken after the other, among them "Frying chicken just makes me feel better about life. I just love me some fried chicken"). The ethos of the film is that of Skeeter; quite radical in the 1960s, less so in 2011. Black underprivileged women playing second fiddle to their white counterparts isn't the problem. It's just a pity that the white women, having forgotten how much they loved their black nannies as children, let the black help raise their children but not use their bathrooms. For someone in tune with this ethos it makes sense that Skeeter is the one who contributes with ambition and skills, and her informants (even if they, like Abileen, also are aspiring writers) with sensational stories about daily humiliation to be turned into literature by Skeeter. To assume, as Skeeter does when finding out what happened to her nanny, that the old woman, who at least until the day she disappeared had a brave and caring daughter by her side (LaChanze), wouldn't survive another minute without Skeeter isn't outrageous given the logical framework of the film, and similarly there's nothing strange about Skeeter's narcissistic reluctance to leave the thirty something informants in the racist town for an attractive job in New York. A concern that reminds me of a that of the man who approaches a group of girlfriends in a bar, asking them what they're doing there all alone.Different approaches at different times; that's how to make any story relevant at any time. Nothing illustrates this better than the example of The Stepford Wives, the 1974 novel by Ira Levin which was adapted to the big screen in 1975 and 2004, and to TV in 1980, 1987 and 1996. Also dealing with oppressive and reactionary ideals, each version of the original story reflects the time in which it was made, with hypnosis being the tool of domination in the 1980 version, role reversal in 1996, and a woman being the master brain running the show in the 2004 version in which the women have become sex- and cash machines. In response to Taylor's dealing with The Help, nothing feels more appropriate than to conclude in the same non-innovative and slightly offensive manner that characterizes his take on the story: You is patronising. You is irrelevant. You is out of touch. (This and other movie reviews to be found on the blog "In the Words of Katarina")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This was an incredibly moving film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Three very courageous women decide to tell the unique story of what it's like to be a black female helper taking care of white children set against the backdrop of the civil rights movement and the rampant bigotry of the time. I thought this film was very moving throughout; a particular scene that comes to mind is when a helper is betrayed after a life long service to a family. It's the most powerful scene I saw in a film in 2011 and my heart just sunk as I watched it. The performances are solid right across the board. Bryce Dallas Howard is serviceable and Emma Stone shows she can do more than comedy. But this film belongs to the performances of the two helpers; Viola Davis and Octavia Spenser. Viola is clearly a fantastic actress. I liked what she did in Solaris (thought she was underrated), LOVED her brief but very strong role in Doubt and this performance just puts her in the next level of actresses for me. The suffering and heartbreak of this character just emanates from her; her performance makes this film great.Octavia Spencer (Minny) was a newcomer for me at the time I first saw this and I thought she provided some of the more light hearted parts of the story (which it definitely need). I initially didn't know what to think of this film and was surprised at the buzz it was getting. I expected it to be a bit cheesy. But after seeing it I definitely get it. Like the Blind Side, I think it's really resonating with people. It's clearly not the feel good movie of the year, but it's highly recommended.Enjoyed my review? Keep in touch!

		<shortDescription>Brilliant !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie will hold a special glue to anyone who has been a Gone With The Wind fan , for the rest it just might simulate them to revisit those history lessons . The film is brilliantly cast , there being not a single dull moment. The film revolves around three very different women who form an unlikely friendship in their quest for a common goal. It is much more then just being about the state of events in the 1950s at the South .Its a portrayal of a waning tradition that still grips the peninsula even after a century of the Civil War which was fought to abolish the exact same custom. It raises serious issues - demarcation of people based on skin color , making another human being walk in incessant rain rather than allowing her(it?) to use one's own bathroom , makes us reflect that we still aren't very far along the vicious prejudice. The movie also touches upon how the untarnished mind of a child is capable to love the same person he would grow up to walk all over on, of how society can be a venomous influence in conditioning the brain on so much discrimination. In the end it also hints that even after being subjected to centuries of venom , the heart still has the capability to love, that there is still hope for all of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfect. A movie about the civil rights movement in the 1960's responds with a light hearted approach to the chaos whilst conjunctively addressing the hardship of 'The Help'. Whilst the in-story author requires help from the help, to right about the Help may seem disorienting, Tate Taylor (Director) does this in a way that no other Director seems to be able to do correctly. Great camera work located at about 30 minutes, where the camera spirals upwards, following Emma Stone up the spiral staircase is a shot that has been remembered by myself and is something I look for within movies today. However, this shot and the shot at the end credits place it comfortably - in my books, as the shot which is on par with final shot from 'The Passenger'. The end credits in particular allow the actors the right of recognition which they all deserve. Keeping to the underlying message right down to the point. A film which is undeniably rare for our time, a perfect 10 out of 10, 5 out of 5, masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but the book was way better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book was a fantastic read and I think the movie did a decent job of bringing it to life. Set in 1960s Mississippi, The Help is about a white girl, Skeeter Phelan, who collaborates with black maids to tell their stories of what it's like to work in a white household. They hope to narrow the racial divide and improve conditions for blacks. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer put up excellent performances as the maids, Aibileen and Minny. As president of the county's Ladies' League and leader of the racist campaign to build separate toilets for blacks in every household (not to mention Skeeter's friend), Hilly was also just as smooth and poisonous as I had imagined her to be. Emma Stone was alright as Skeeter, but a lot of her inner struggles in the book didn't really come out, so I found it kind of hard to connect with her. While I think the movie was pretty good, its inability to make us think about our behaviour in the present-day context stopped it from being great. I also didn't like how some of the characters' reactions to Skeeter writing the book (Stuart and Skeeter's mother) were made more extreme, as it led to an oversimplification of the situation in that era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is not bad at all, but its way too over-hyped. I guess its because of the theme. Films with the topic "civil rights" or "second world war" and others always get a bit better reviews. The film is touching, but it didn't get me so far, that i would say "wow, that makes me really cry" What really annoys me about the film is the Hollywood/American touch of the film. Sorry guys, i have nothing against America, but its a bit not authentic- and i didn't mean the not authentic behaviour of Jackson Ville, what the author/director intended. I mean especially skeeter, who is that innocent and such a perfect girl, without any appeal of racism or other bad characteristics. The whole impact she achieves with her book seems to me quite unauthentic. And for me the facts about the civil war are even a bit whitewashed or sugar coated. They could even draw more attention how bad the situation for the black people really was.What i did like was the combination of martin Luther Kings parts of his speeches and the impact on Jackson ville.In conclusion i liked the film, but if you want to see a more realistic and for me more touching film about civil rights, than i would rather watch "to kill a mockingbird" from 1962 http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056592/?ref_=nv_sr_1</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Study in Cruelty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie about shallow cruel women living in the 1960s in Mississippi and their black maids. Cicely Tyson, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, Leslie Jordan (Bernard from Boston Legal) and Allison Janney all have minor but juicy roles. Tyson is like watching an alien. Your eyes are glued.The cruelty is about putting others down with a big smile, patronising, and shunning. The main villain is Hilly Holbrook played by Bryce Dallas Howard (a supercilious female). I ached for revenge. Some revenge came in the middle of the movie, but there was no grand finale of revenge the way you would expect from Hollywood. She just plodded on and on being her bitchy, self-absorbed self.The scene that hit me most emotionally was when a maid was fired without cause, and she went into the child's room she had been caring for and touched each mark on the wall where she had recorded the child's height over the years.One of the most interesting characters was Celia Foote played by Jessica Chastain. We are introduced to her as a skinny Marilyn Monroe clone air head bimbo who has not the ability to even boil water. Gradually she becomes a more tragic character, even though she remains an air head bimbo. The townspeople are unbelievable rude to her. Her maid gradually teaches her to cook and to have some self confidence. The message is she too has a right to happiness and respect even if she is stupid. The others are jealous because she landed the handsomest and richest guy in town. It is a beautiful movie because you stay sympathetic to her even when she continues to get drunk and barf at a fancy dress ball.One strange feature of the movie is it had it happy ending about 3/4 the way through, then they just kept tacking on denouement after denouement like some spoof symphony that could not get on with ending.</fullReview>

The entire cast did a fantastic believable job in making this story come to life.It was something you could watch with the entire family. It literally gives you an inside view of how "hired help" was treated back then. It also showed you what it was like to be part of the upper elite and how so many dared not speak their opinions for fear of being cast out.It showed you that not only did the help do their jobs but some of them honestly cared for members of the family they worked for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having never read the book but always wanting too, The help was an obvious choice whilst choosing a film for a quiet night in with friends.Set in the 1960's, The Help tells the story of two black maids trying to make a decent living in the south. A heart warming, controversial tale of a struggle to be heard in a civilisation full of deaf ears.Kudos to Taylor for representing both sides of the story. She portrays the ignorant racists as well as Skeeter's endeavour to make the world realise the immorality of the oppression. Emma Stone plays this well, despite bordering patronising a few times. Minny on the other hand manages to find a balance between an eye rolling, finger snapping, sarcastic stereotype and a headstrong, witty character. Aibileen also does this and still manages to keep it genuine as she creates a bond with one of the children she cares for telling her 'you is kind, you is smart, you is important' this was an important relationship in the film because it educates the audience about the emotional bond that developed between maids and those that they cared for.Skeeter's tell all book provides an opportunity for a power shift from the black staff to their white owners and back and forth, providing a roller coaster of entertainment for the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-acted, emotionally satisfying human drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been a number of films about the Deep South during the Civil Rights era, mostly ("Mississippi Burning" and "Ghosts of Mississippi" being examples) concentrating on the political struggle for equality. "The Help" is a recent film which brings a slightly different approach to this period, concentrating on the relationship between well-to-do white Southerners and their black maids. Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan is a young white woman from a wealthy family in Jackson, Mississippi. She has ambitions to make a career in writing and journalism, and plans to write a book about the experiences of black maids (referred to as "the help") working for white families. Unlike most of her friends, Skeeter is a liberal on racial issues and is horrified by the bigoted views which she has heard other white women express, often quite openly in front of their black servants. She hopes that her book will help to expose this sort of prejudice, but finds that no maids are willing to be interviewed. Eventually, however, two maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson, come forward. Both have good cause to be dissatisfied with their employers, especially Minny who has not only been sacked but also falsely accused of theft. Minny's employer Hilly is a particularly unpleasant individual, with an obsession with forcing black maids to use separate toilet facilities from the families they work for. The real reason for Minny's sacking was that she used the family's indoor bathroom rather than use an outside toilet during a thunderstorm. (One thing I have never understood why people like Hilly, who obviously has a poisonous dislike of all black people, did not simply employ a white maid; perhaps they could not find any white women willing to work for the low wages that black maids were paid). Some films with a "civil rights" theme, "Mississippi Burning" being an example, have a male-dominated cast, but "The Help" is very much a "women's film" with all the main roles, both heroines and villains, being taken by women. There is an attempt to give Skeeter a boyfriend, but their brief friendship- it never really deserves the name "romance"- fizzles out when he disapproves of her book and of her views on the race question. With that exception, all the male actors play very minor roles. With the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard from "The Village" and Viola Davis, who greatly impressed me in "Doubt", most of the leading actresses in the film were faces I had never seen before. (I must admit that I did not recognise Howard, here a brunette although normally a redhead). I understand that Jessica Chastain actually made seven feature films in 2011- a quite remarkable work-rate for a modern actress- but this is the only one I have yet seen. Chastain plays Celia Foote, Skeeter's only ally among Jackson's housewives. Although Celia's husband is from the city's wealthy elite, she herself is from a working-class background, which means that the likes of Hilly despise her as poor white trash who has got above herself. Although historically many poor whites were just as racist as rich ones, if not more so, Celia's experience of being on the receiving end of bigotry makes her a much more liberal employer. (Minny goes to work for her after being sacked by Hilly). Chastain's is one of a number of excellent performances in this film; the others come from Emma Stone as Skeeter, Davis (even better here than she was in "Doubt") as Aibileen and Octavia Spencer as the sharp-tongued Minny, a woman determined to fight back against prejudice. (Spencer won a "Best Supporting Actress" Oscar). I would have a couple of criticisms of the film. Howard as Hilly, like some of the other actresses playing the snooty society matrons, plays her character rather too much as a one-dimensional stereotype, the snobbish upper-class bitch. The sub-plot involving Minny's chocolate pie seemed out of place, the sort of vulgar humour which would be more at home in a Farrelly Brothers gross-out comedy than in a supposedly serious film. I would not, however, agree with the criticism some have made that the film demeans African-Americans by showing them as dependent upon whites for their emancipation. It is the black characters here who display real courage in bringing their working conditions to public notice, far more so than does Skeeter. She risks nothing worse than losing the friendship of a few people she never cared for in the first place; they risk the loss of their jobs and their livelihoods, and possibly also violence from white racists.Despite my criticisms, I felt that overall "The Help" was an excellent film- a well-acted, emotionally satisfying human drama with some powerful acting performances, and one which shed an interesting light on this period of American history. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help is the movie of the year...!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2008,I had a chance to watch a movie that stood on it's strong performances and an excellent adaptation from a Tony Award winning play...........I'm talking of the movie 'Doubt'.The movie had nearly the entire cast nominated for the Oscars that year.One performer was Voila Davis,who had strongly caught my attention for her class performance.She had a screen space of hardly a couple of minutes .....but she exploited those moments completely to show us an authentic portrayal of a concerned mother. This year in The Help,she again manages to move us with her acting potentials.She does the role of a black maid who raises white children.The movie is set against the backdrop of racism, wherein the maids (all colored women) from Jackson come forward to give in their experiences in the houses of the whites where they are employed.And each ones experiences comes together to take in the shape of a book by Anonymous, thanks to Skeeter(Emma Stone.... another notable character in the movie),which turns out to be popular but also a threat to some of the white women who have to face the consequences of their mindset(one hilarious moment being when Mrs.Hilly eats the pie made by Minny........an incredible revenge I say)...oh yeah .........Minny....Octavia Spencer,I should mention has done an outstanding work....one class apart performance......and even Jessica Chastain manages to grab your attention as a dumb white mistress(Ms.Celia Foote) to Minny but she is extremely good at heart(which I believe is more important to call yourself a human being). Viola Davis as Aibileen is not only just impressive but is the real show stealer.The performances of the women are so brilliant that the viewer tends to overlook everything else about the film. But what makes the performances so strong is beautiful adaptation of the screenplay and a good job from the director ........Tate Taylor.....he surely does deserve kudos.What I loved about his work was that he could purely read my mind....I gave it a thought .......is the movie about racism?.......NO..........it is only about the maids who are doing an incredible favor to their mistress.......raising their children.........and in return these women get treated like shits.I adore the way he made this point clear across the film. The movie on a whole has been brilliant.....after a long time I got to see a movie that made me laugh,cry,thrill.......and most importantly made me feel humbled...It is surely one of the best movies of the year!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the movie The Help is a work of fiction, here's a true story: I offended someone today when I proclaimed at work: "I finally saw the first 5-star movie of 2011: 'The Help'!"Of course, with a touchy subject such as this, it's a 50/50 chance you'll offend with someone with this movie and subject-matter. Granted, I thought I would be in good graces since the person I upset was black and I only briefly mentioned it where she could overhear it.Apparently, her beef was mainly for the fact that the prejudice portrayed still runs true today ? don't I know that! Anyways, like I always say about most work places: "Why even install carpet in the office, when the floor is covered with eggshells?"This movie was moving, brilliant, wonderfully written, emotional, well-acted and stirs up enough emotions to make us all think twice on how we treat each other. I know I stood back and was actually ashamed of being white during this viewing.Rebel Skeeter (the always wonderful Emma Stone) is wanting to write a book against her (ENORMOUSLY) racist bridge-playing peers and in the POV of "the help," i.e. black maids when "the deep south" still treated non-whites as inhumanly as possible. It's not easy for a VERY hard working servant to give their story, but with great courage it happens. And then it happens?it hits the fan.Loved this movie. The performances all around, whether you love the individual or HATE HATE HATE the character, were pitch-perfect. The dialogue had be both rolling and angry (in a good way) at the same time. And the pacing, despite the more-than-2-hours running time was completely well used.I also love the fact that it was?fiction. Some people are claiming this as heavy-handed. Bah. This was a perfect summarization of the travesty that happened back in the 1950s/1960s and like my fellow peer realizes, still today. SEE THIS MOVIE?and then look at ourselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could say that all racism is in the past but I think we all know that is not true. However, we can appreciate a film that brings this particular injustice to the forefront. This movie brings everyone to the table in that respect. Many would rather not be there and many more will simply not see this film but perhaps however slowly, we may all eventually come to recognize racism when we see it. Maybe someday we can rise above the amount of melanin in a person's skin, but coming in a year when our (first black) President was forced to prove he is a citizen of the United States by showing his birth certificate in a press conference for the first time ever (even though 3 years prior he had already shown the legal form for his state), and coming in a year when the debt ceiling was held hostage for the first time ever, and coming in a year when the Speaker of the House for the first time ever, publicly rebuffed a sitting president's date request to give a speech to both the House and Senate, it is clear that day is not today.This film is not perfect but it is necessary even so many years after the civil rights act became law. I can't think of a sadder statement.</fullReview>

The light, fluffy, glossy look and woeful acting (from a good female ensemble cast) strips away the suffering and hardship reducing the feeling for the characters (which should be it's focus). Instead of staying truly serious to the subject matter this is flipped into an ugly light-hearted entertainment journey (trying to create the Helps versus the nasty white housewives).The film was interesting but limited, with most of the second half giggling and obsessed with a 'poo pie' and failed to show the 'Help's' as anything other than minimally reluctant nannies (not slaves).I would wash away my small memories of this film, in a way that would sum up this forgettable, washy, disappointment of a film. I think too much fun was had, and ultimately was the focus, of a Mississippi history lesson that never took off. 'To Kill A Mocking bird' this most definitely isn't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Should Receive Oscar Nominations, And It Deserves Them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "The Help" is like living the days of black women back in the days and witnessing the struggle and hardship in almost every aspect of their lives. This is easily one of the best of the year, or at least one of the most touching movies of the year for me.I should have seen this back in the summer but I ended up with other choices. 2011 has been a good year for movies, especially with a number of blockbusters that are not at all bad (No, I am not talking about Transformers and Green Lantern). Although, there may be some competition at the Academy Awards this year, I still believe that "The Help" will get away with some wins which it deserves.To start with, it is the stunning performances.Emma Stone, taking the leading role of Skeeter, has shown the audience that her acting can be much more than "Easy A". It is a big step forward and she has definitely given a Oscar-worthy performance. Indeed, she is also essential for the story development because it is basically her concern and passion that drive the later events and keep the surprises coming.Viola Davis from "Doubt" is also one of the protagonists. Playing one of the black maids named Aibileen, she portrays the emotions of fear and hope. From a passive character to an active help to Stone (Skeeter), her performance is incredible and totally realistic. And of course, having been a Oscar nominee once, this time her even better performance absolutely deserves recognition from the Academy once again.Then we have Octavia Spencer who has the role of Minny, also a maid. The performance is again Oscar-worthy. Her "tougher" appearance and personality are what make her stand out and have a different attitude. But indeed, the bottom line is Minny and Aibileen are united by an opportunity to change, to let their voices be heard.Last but not least, we have Howard. I would be surprised if she is not nominated at Oscars this year, after her amazing performances in "The Tree of Life", this, and "Take Shelter". As a housewife who has Octavia (Minny) as her maid, her character is the "boss" of the housewives. The scenes when she bursts into rage are superb.Other performances are also good in "The Help", but I guess the above four are the ones that I find outstanding. If the Academy recognizes this film, I believe there is a high chance that at least two nominations of Supporting Actress will be from this, and it will be hard to pick one for sure."Change begins with a whisper". That is the kind of story "The Help" wants to tell. As the movie approaches the end, there is a great number of touching scenes that can make you cry. And throughout the movie, there are scenes that can make you laugh, hard."The Living Proof", as a soundtrack played at the end of the movie when the closing credits roll in, is an extraordinary song. It is beautiful music, and its lyrics and meanings fit the theme of the movie perfectly. There are also other great songs played, also near the finish of the movie. Again, "The Help" should also be a great competitor in the category of Best Original Song at Oscars."The Help" is a combination of astonishing performances by a number of great actresses and a well-written story which I guess most viewers and the Academy will like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a horrible movie. Everything so new and clean. Mississippi and the south and the north weren't that clean. Freshly painted buses for the maids to be taken to the white folks? Cars with no dirt on them? Dresses of the rich folk and the po' with no wrinkles? Oh, come on.What is it with Skeeter's hair? It appears to be curly from the 2000's...not realistic....when was that curly hideous hairstyle popular? We had no maids in the 50's and 60's, so I can't comment on their treatment by the white folk. I'm sure they must have put them down.A job is a job, unfortunately, whether it is working as a maid for a white family or a slob in a factory. You suck up to the bossman or bosslady. Of course it is demeaning, but it is that for everyone.A very hard movie to make it through...just too fake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help What A Fabulous Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is phenomenal. Truly one of the best I've seen in a long time and I attend movies weekly. It's an inspirational, courageous and empowering story about very different extraordinary women in the 1960s South who build an unlikely friendship around a secret writing project that breaks society's rules and puts them at risk.The movie is filled with poignancy, humor and hope. Also brings forward messages that all audiences should take heed of, regarding who we are as people,skin color is not a factor.All performances were outstanding,deserving of even more public recognition, awards and credits received. Should have won the Academy Award for sure.I saw this movie a few years ago but can still convey to friends and acquaintances my favorite scenes that made such a lasting impression on me. Mostly those with a comedic flair that packed such a powerful statement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Help Yourselves to This Rousing Tale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An inspirational drama, The Help (a deft adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel) is a rousing film with an endearing heart and subtle poignancy that is sometimes overlooked, but once discovered is a certain crowd-pleaser. Set in Jackson, Mississippi at the dawn of the Civil Rights movement, Emma Stone plays the plucky, fresh-out-of-college Skeeter, who is just plain enough to stand out in her clique of well-to-do white housewives who, beneath their frivolous goings on, treat their black house- helps like slaves. Aggrieved at the racial bigotry she witnesses, and determined to break into the New York literary world, she resolves to write a book that will allow the town's black maids to give a voice to their experiences. Her idea is met with lucrative publishing prospects, but finding any maid willing to give her the real story is a problem. Viola Davis plays Aibileen Clark, who carries a sorrow that is only partly built from a lifetime of servitude. She has lost her own child to racial prejudice and is faced with the growing horrors of racism every single day at work. Then there is her feisty, too-sassy-to-suffer-forever friend Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) who undergoes similar humiliation at the hands of the meticulously- coiffed society princess Miss Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard). Although with some trepidation, the two finally open up to Skeeter and once they do, the other maids join in and stories begin flowing. Soon, through clandestine meetings, they manage to start something that becomes a force of real change!The Help paints its characters, black and white alike, with a very broad bush that adroitly pushes the audience's buttons to elicit laughter and tears. On the surface, The Help might seem like another discourse on the evils of racism. But look closer and you will find that it is a much more complex tale. While the story takes place at a time of seismic social upheaval, racism is just a sidelight in a story that centers on the commonalities that the women faced in the repressive air that filled the early 1960s. In Tate Taylor's hands, a storyline that could have been mushy and preachy becomes genuinely stirring. He succeeds in creating characters you really care about and delivers its message without resorting to sickly sweet sentimentality or becoming too self-congratulatory. And then there are the charming performances that give the story such heart. Taylor expertly juggles all the characters and their stories, providing each actress a chance to stand out in a flock of fascinating women. Stone has an innate likability and is sparkling as Skeeter. Howard embodies the hissable Hilly with a vibrant panache. Jessica Chastain delivers the wonderfully tacky, white- trash Celia with flair, giving her pathos and earnestness. Both Allison Janney and Sissy Spacek are faultless in their maternal turns. But it's Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer who breathe life into the movie in their career defining performances. Davis gives Aibileen an elusive truth that jumps off the screen and delivers a perfectly nuanced performance (her hypnotic gaze alone could carry a film). Spencer plays a wonderfully cheeky Minny, offering plenty of comic relief, and a respectable honesty to her sass.The Help picks its audience up and carries it along in its engrossing, affecting wake: and then, like the best nursemaids, it calms us down with a large spoonful of healing syrup. The Help not only has its 'pie' but eats it too (Pun intended. Be assured, you'll never look at chocolate pie the same way again)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing after listening to the audio book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The audio book version of the novel "The Help" is award-winning, done by 4 (3 main) different actresses that really bring it to life.I wasn't quite ready to let go of the characters and watched this movie, hoping to prolong the experience. Unfortunately, it's a much over-simplified version of the story and the people involved. The adaptation to be a much shorter on-screen story is not bad - facts and events are shifted around to basically tell the same essential plot.Overall, I found it kind of cheesy, especially coming from the *excellent* read version, which goes much deeper.If you're coming to the film without reading/listening to the novel, it's probably more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never heard of the novel of the same name before, but it's one I will look at. The Help is about Aibileen a hardworking housekeeper in 1960&#x2032;s Mississipi, who with the help of local white writer Skeeter Phelan talks about her life as a black servant in a time of extreme racism.I really liked it. Some parts moving, some insightful, it's a beautiful looking (and sounding ? the score is lush throughout) film cinematography to a beautifully serene score. It has the right combination of tear-jerking moments, pathos and humour. A tear in my eye was found.The female cast are amazing. Bryce Dallas Howard and Sissy Spacek especially, And check out Jessica Chastain who plays Celia Foote ? she is BEAUTIFUL and going to be a star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally caught this on TV the other night and stayed up very late because I couldn't shut it off. What a great movie. It definitely lives up to all the hype I remember from award season a couple years ago.Set in Mississippi during the 1960s, a southern society girl returns from college determined to become a writer and proceeds to turn her friends lives and a Mississippi town upside down when she decides to interview the black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent southern families. The entire cast is so flippin' fantastic; (Allison Janney, Emma Stone, Jessica Chastain, Nelsan Ellis, Sissy Spacek, Viola Davis.) And while I can't remember who won the academy award(s?) I will tell you who surprised me was Bryce Dallas Howard as the bitchy society girl. I just didn't expect that sort of range from her, what an evil woman but again everyone involved was great. I'll admit to being uncomfortable and angry with certain scenes (as I was meant to be) but also proud because the world is a changing. 01.07.14</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie for it's message. It's also a great way to remind people what America was like in that time period. I feel as if this movie extends further from segregation and more towards the fact that we are all created equally. The story is wonderful. The comedy was genius. I love everything about this movie. One person wanted to stick up for those that weren't being treated fairly and so she did. It was a brave thing to do. Especially when it turned her into an outcast. But did that bother her? Of course not. She set her own personal values aside in order to make a difference. This movie had me laughing. It had me crying. It had my heart breaking. Then it had me leaping for joy. I think everyone should at least give this movie a chance. It could change your entire perspective on life.You is Kind. You is Smart. You is Important.</fullReview>

No matter what race you are, so much can be learned from the story line of this film. Although this film was based on times that we no longer live in, it did an excellent job portraying it in a way where viewers could relate, understand, and be entertained. This film is not just to bring awareness to past history, but it is also a film that contains different scenes that will make you laugh so hard, scenes that will make you fall in love, and scenes that will make you cry of both sorrow and joy. It is unbelievable that such a great, appropriate, and family friendly movie, can contain all the factors that us as viewers enjoy to sit back and watch. I definitely recommend this film to everyone! It is a film that will open your eyes, and also bring unity within different races, and appreciation for bold people who one day took a stand for freedom and equality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just finished watching The Help and I'm deeply touched. I remember not caring to watch it at the theater as I thought it could be "slow and boring" and I have been proved completely wrong.The Help is one great stirring story that easily captures you and gets you choked up several times during the playtime. It is supported by stunning performances by all the actresses who portrayed their respective characters in the best way there is, not to mention the superb direction and other technical aspects. This is the kind of movie that is intended to resonate across the world. It enormously transcends the theme it portrays and highlights a serious issue that doesn't belong only to the past. I believe that this movie should be watched by everyone who has the slightest interest in movies and not only avid drama movies fans. One last issue I want to point out that might have been missed by some people despite being implied several times during the movie, most prominently in the last scene. This movie does not only pose the question of whether you treat your maid gently and respectfully, and what they would say about you if they get the chance to do so. It also addresses a very important and significant issue (in my community at least)of how close you are to your children, who has the most profound and significant impact on them, and where the maid's job should end and yours,the parent, should start. I sincerely look forward to watching more of these masterpieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Words cannot express how excited and anxious I was while watching this film. With mysteries lurking in ever corner, the audience just didn't know what to expect, except the unexpected! Emma Stone's role was played extremely well; the writer who's trying to do her research by interviewing the black servants in America during the 70's. Octavia Spencer, who played the role of "Minny Jackson" did a smashing job of serving a plate of well? do I really have to say? Anyway, the antagonist, Jessica Chastain who played Celia Foote was most definitely asking for it! In fact, everyone who were following the path of Apartheid were! I must say, I normally read the books before the films but 'The Help' seemed to funny judging by the trailer to postpone watching it! Fantastic, filled with fun and enigmatic encounters, this is a definite must watch! Everyone will definitely enjoy it, without a doubt!!! Watch the film and make up your own mind!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Help" at the movies with a group of female friends. The character development in this film is really a great match for the story line. I have a list of my favorite characters which you likely agree that they are all an enterprising bunch. The storyline is in a remarkable setting brought to life from a time of racism. I love that the movie presents the perspective of a number of the characters instead of just being from the perspective of just one character. It definitely has some hilarious moments and even some tear-jerking moments. Its definitely not just a film for women or women of a particular race. It's a film that all can enjoy. They couldn't have picked a better cast to play these characters. They really sold the story line to the viewers leaving us wanting to know more as it was served. It's a fan favorite movie that I can definitely watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help. An aspiring author played by pretty Emma Stone during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the African-American maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis. Subject is sensitive but treatment is not. In fact most of the time it is balanced, comical take on the racism that makes it an easy watch rather a shocking watch. If we talk about performances, Octavia Spencer treats big time with her delightful portrayal of Minny Jackson for which she was awarded an Oscar. Viola Davis also stands tall with her sincere portrayal of Aibileen Clark. Whole movie is crafted like a girl's movie so there is very less for male actors to show-off here. Movie makes its point but never hits you hard so you may not think much about what you experienced after end credits have gone down. Nevertheless, it's nicely crafted easy watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting too much from 'The Help', 'cause I dislike most of the Oscars Best Picture nominees from 2011, but I was pleasantly surprised when I finished to watch The Help. It isn't s film with great depth, and it really isn't an accurate depiction of a gritty ambient full of racial tensions; but the story itself has good intentions and succeeds in developing so many characters that it alone makes it deserving of my praise. And the acting was very good, I mean, everyone did a good job. Emma Stone, Bryce Dallas-Howard and in a high level Viola Davis and Jessica Chainstain. I consider Spencer performance to be a bit overrated since she wasn't even the best supporting actress on the film. Davis was great,forced but she showed great range. I liked the art direction too, very pleasant and eye-candy. And while I disliked the exaggerated vilification of Howard's character, the film showed a somewhat Spielberg-esque style:A drama that never takes itself too seriously. Sometimes it works , and that was the case of The Help. Maybe because the story is very sad and dark after all, so the moments more 'up' are needed to not scare the 'mainstrean' audience. I think if the film had used the real ambient whose the book it was based on was set, the critics would probably love it and admire it's guts and the realism. But since it choose to be a 'lighter' version of the events, it wasn't well received. Well, I personally liked it for what it is. A great mosaic of well developed characters whose connections are the friendship and the racism. A harsh time. Being said, I recommend this film. 7.5/10</fullReview>

But that's not the point and if I had to rate this idiosyncratically, it is a good film.The cast is outstanding... I mean this could just be the film with the cast who are totally into their respective characters of the book. I loved Bryce Dallas Howard &amp; Octavia Specner, but who really stood out with her portrayal is Jessica Chasatin (I have watched Mama &amp; ZD30, but this is just too impressive of her). Fantastic! And the music is great, too. What troubled me is the screenplay and when it skipped elements like it had a time constraint it felt bad. But I understand how the editor might have had terrible nights editing it into reason. The costumes are fine and my appreciation to the art crew.Tate Tylor had no reason to adapt the sensational book, but since it has been I'd give it a one-time watch. And the minor changes I mentioned before actually work for the movie. And let me take this opportunity to ask all the people to read the book so that you LOL &amp; produce ire at the same time about the much-discussed topic. It is one of the most enjoyable books I've read.BOTTOM LINE: It was real treat to watch the words of the book go real on reel and I am happy the cast was able.

		<fullReview>The Help is a film about Black maids in a small Mississippi town set in the early 1960s. You gather that as the news covers the funeral of JFK at one point.The film is set on the eve of the civil rights era then but such things move slowly in the Southern states and here we have black women who practically raise the white kids from infants onwards and as they grow up they become like their parents including the prejudice and the cycle starts again as the maid raise their kids.Even though the discriminatory behaviour has been toned down for the film, part of it still feels very uneasy although in reality things were probably a lot worse for real life maids.Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer stand out from the cast as two of the maids. Also good performances from Jessica Chastain, Bryce Dallas Howard and Emma Stone.It may not be as powerful as you think it would be. Given that it seems to be aimed at a female audience you get the feeling the director did not want to cross a certain line and make it more hard hitting.Its funny as well as emotional and an interesting tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In order for a movie to be good, there has to be some good acting. I'm glad to say that this film, The Help has exceptional acting and that is why it's such a great movie. At first, I was skeptical of seeing this but after the great word-of-mouth this film has been spreading, I thought it was time for me to check it out. As a movie that deals with racism, it's dialed down a notch but it's still powerful nonetheless.This film is about a 23-year-old, white Mississippi girl who wanted to change the lives of black people for the better. She decides to interview some maids, Abileen and Minny so she can tell the world their lives from their points of view.The acting is just beyond belief. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer led this movie with their powerful performances as the slaves. Jessica Chastain is certainly making a name for herself. I can say the same for Emma Stone as well. I also loved the evilness by Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly because I just loathed the character in the movie.Overall, this is a great, powerful film that will have you cheering at some moments and in tears in other moments. I won't give anything away, but I loved that one scene that involved a funny confrontation between Hilly and Minny. I think that also made this movie great because of some unexpected humor. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartful Story With Oscars Coming Its Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess it came at no surprise that "The Help" was going to garner some awards during Oscar time. But the big winners went to those who brought their tickets to see this brilliant movie. The riveting performances by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer will make your melt faster than a snowball in a microwave with their scintillating performances. I was a bit disappointed with the DVD because there was a lackluster of bonus material. In addition to that over four minutes of scenes were deleted. All we get is a five minute music video, which makes me cringe because I felt cheated when I purchased the DVD. If that's the case then I advise everyone who missed the movie I'd say skip the DVD and watch the movie on your local movie stations. It's still a quintessential movie that's rich in story and detail and something you shouldn't miss.I had the honour to see the opening matinée last year and I saw it a few more times after that. It really is that special. It's doubtful if there is any accuracy behind this movie based on the epicenter era of the civil rights movement came into fruition. The script compliments Kathryn Stockett's best selling novel and if you liked the movie, you will absolutely enjoy. The story of three dynamic women in Mississippi is likely to keep readers and viewers intrigued. The central plot of writing a book that exploits the dark truth about the racial intentions in the city of Jackson upper class Caucasian's and their subservient black helpers by keeping it low-profile so that retribution does not come towards them.The humor was customized in the way the upper-class socialites from Jackson behaved and their initial reaction once this novel has been published. Bryce Dallas Howard was the perfect choice for the leading antagonist Hilly. Sure she was not sore on the eyes, Hilly was still the definitive character you just purely love to despise. Jessica Chastain was amazing in her scene stealing performance as Celia as she successfully tries to keep it real. Viola Davis was drop-dead gorgeous and shapely figured as Aibileen even though from the book I was given the impression of her being frumpy and out of shape, but I'm not complaining. Octavia Spencer was right on the Minny...I mean money as she just nails her role and the interviews she gives is very captivating. The hidden secrets behind Skeeter's (Emma Stone) childhood maid was a more integral part of the the plot from the novel. The casting was really sublime and it was great to see small roles from veteran performers like Sissy Spacek, Cecily Tyson and Mary Steenburgen.From reading the book to watching the movie there is one thing a did on both occasions. I rooted for this dynamic triad an hoped that they all have a happy ending and overcoming all obstacles that get in their way. The movie and the performances look and feel so believable you never ponder for a minute that it is a work of fiction But for those who want 100% accuracy, i suggest you watch a documentary of the South during the Civil Rights Movements or to spend time and speak to someone who lived in that era.If you're looking for that one movie that will truly move you, then "The Help" should really fit that bill. This film is as equally intriguing with a script that's equally as poignant as the book and the performers played out their respected roles subliminally. it doesn't matter if you read the book or seen the movie first on both accounts you are in for a real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparison of the book and the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a person who'd just finished reading the book on which "The Help" is based and who'd just watched the film, I'd like to say a few things about the differences between the book and the film and how that reflected on the story.The film represents a much shorter version of the story than the book. The major differences, and the ones that I thought were NOT beneficial for the story, are as follows.- Constantine's daughter is black, not white, like in the book, and all her background story is missing. This is not OK, because Skeeter's mum's reaction to her sudden appearance in the house in this case is hardly clear.- Skeeter's mum tells Hilly off when she comes to her house, something that she didn't do in the book since she didn't even know about the book. The character of Skeeter's Mum, like it's done in the book, would have never understood the her daughter's book and would have never been proud of her daughter the way she is in the film.- Also in the book Skeeter decides not to write about her mother had done. In the film she does.- It's not also really clear that Skeeter's mum has cancer and that she's really ill.- Aibeleen doesn't get a job in the magazine, like she does in the book, which I think is a shame because it represents new beginnings for her in the book. In the film she is basically left with nothing.- Then there is Minny and Miss Celia. Minny actually saves her life when she calls a doctor when Celia has a miscarriage. In the film Mr. Johnny just says, "She got better after Minny appeared in the house", which in my opinion is sort of strange and doesn't explain at all why he says that she had saved her life and why he is so grateful to her and offers her the job for the rest of her life. It is therefore very unconvincing in the movie, when he does that. - Incidentally, Celia in the book also never ever learned how to cook.- Also, the whole ominous atmosphere in Celia's house, the air of mystery is absent from the film, which is a shame, as well as her frequent miscarriages (only one is shown and very briefly, without showing Minny's involvement, which is crucial) as well as Minny's constant fear of Johnny.- It is also not shown that Minny is actually really scared to lose her job when the book comes out.- Now, to Aibeeleen's son. In the movie he's "killed". By whom? For what? We don't know. In this case I think it would have been better to leave it the way it was in the book ? that his death was an accident. I can see what the film creators were trying to do, but it didn't quite work.- Also, in the church when they congratulate Aibeleen on what she has done, they don't even lock the door ? a small detail that would have shown, how much they are all still scared, which, I think, is important.- What I find is also quite important to the story and something that was hardly if at all shown in the film is Skeeter's social isolation after her fall-out with Hilly. That's the cost she paid for disagreeing with everyone else in town and for trying to do something about it.- Also, how Skeeter's mother constantly criticized her is not shown, which would have added comic value to the film but also explained why Skeeter was so attached to Constantine. - The story with Elisabeth, how she'd never really liked her child Mae Mobley and never treated her well is also omitted from the film. It would have been much more painful to watch Aibeleeen leave the family if we knew what she meant for little Mae Mobley.What was also different from the book but what I DID like, was the cause of the conflict between Minny and Hilly, which was sort of unclear in the book: Hilly just started telling everyone else that Minny had stolen silver from her for no apparent reason rather than she wanted Minny to work for her. So I find that the thing with the bathrooms in the film actually works better.What I also liked was the way the characters were cast, especially the character of Hilly, as well as Minny and Aibeeleen.And the way love affair with Stuart was shown also worked well - it was much shorter than in the book, however the filmmakers managed to grip the essence of their relationship in a few scenes.All in all, good effort. But the book is even better - more multi- layered and more powerful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year is 1963, and Skeeter returns from college to find life as usual among her privileged set. She's the only one in the Junior League who notices that the black servants must silently endure insults and degradation at the hands of their oblivious employers. She decides to write a book about how the help really feel about their jobs and asks to interview several maids. This is socially risky for Skeeter and seriously dangerous for the maids.I loved the book and was glad that the movie is just as good. The cruelty heaped on the help by their snooty bosses is heart-breakingly portrayed. Bryce Dallas Howard was surprisingly good as the nasty queen bee of the Junior League and Emma Stone is refreshing and likable as the brave Skeeter. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer play Aibileen and Minny, two long-time maids who risk everything to contribute to Skeeter's book. They both give outstanding performances.Life in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1963, is recreated in fine detail and the script is witty and honest. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Which Skeeter is Better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved, loved, loved Viola Davis as Aibileen. She overpowered the movie with the sense of her history and background through her sheer presence on the screen. She'd just be standing there framed in the shot and you knew what she'd gone through and how she carried the weight of her regrets and sadness on her back. I can't rave about this performance enough. She so embodied Aibileen, in a way even more than what I imagined. Her last moments were stunning, saying goodbye suddenly to Mae Mobley and the fear of leaving behind what you've always known and loved. This to follow a dream you might fail at, but either way your hope and faith says you must take the opportunity in the name of all you have lost. In her walk down the road to the bus you know without her saying that taking part in the writing of The Help she has done all in her power for Mae Mobley's future and because of that she has the opportunity to pursue her son's destiny to become a writer herself. Through love and letting go of the hate and disgust she's put herself on the road to a better future no matter what roadblocks she faces. Hehe, yeah I got a lot of unspoken messages out of Viola Davis' performance.Jessica Chastain rocked Celia Foote! Even though a lot of what I loved about the character was slimmed out of the movie I thought Chastain really took every moment to embody Celia. The screenwriter did a solid job keeping enough about the character that her arc didn't feel choppy or all over the place. This gave Chastain a good foundation for the character but I feel like the actress worked well not only as her character but in conjunction with Octavia Spencer as Minny and with the cast as a whole. Her role was a rather physical one in comparison to Viola Davis who had to stand around and emote. Chastain really excelled in this aspect. Balancing seems to be a skill she excels at. Watching the second time I found myself even more moved by her entire story as her relationship with Minny was a powerful as Aibileen's relationship with Mae Mobley.Sissy Spacek as Missus Walters rocked it! Wow! I could have watched an entire movie with her and Minny in some kind of Odd Couple or Grouchy Women knock off. She added such dimension I believe to both Minny and Hilly. In fact, I think she made the movie version of her character pop in ways the book version washed out. Cicely Tyson as Constantine Jefferson did the same thing for Skeeter except she only had one scene to do it. Talk about a master! From that one scene you got the movie version of Skeeter's motivation and the root of her ability to withstand her family and friends opinions and disapproval. The moving scene where she packs her belongings and touched Skeeter's height markings?wow, nothing even need be said how much she loved Skeeter. I hate to write so little when the performances were so powerful but a lot of their accolades are directed to those they supported.Ahna O'Reilly as Elizabeth Leefolt and Allison Janney as Charlotte Phelan were fine in their respective roles. O'Reilly portrayed Elizabeth as what she was a follower. Janney very subtly worked her role as Skeeter's mother. There were a lot of changes to her story arc and so there were changes to the character. I didn't love these changes but I feel like they were no reflection on the actress.As for winning any of the Best Ensemble Awards I believe they are totally deserved, even with my criticism for some of the acting. This might seen hypocritical to some ? I don't think so though. The acting was solid in the movie. There was a lot of different elements to the characters and the plot to balance and if the director seemed to drop the ball at times that wasn't really the actresses fault. I guess what I'm really saying is I think the missteps I perceived were in the acting upon my first viewing were not acting problems so much as direction problems. Perhaps he was too close to the material or the people involved. Perhaps balance is not his forte. As a story lover some of the characters didn't quite jive with their arc on a specific level, but for most I believe it works on the more general one.The movie was good. It didn't blow my mind like the book though. I would have loved to have seen a little more of the finer details transferred from the written medium to the visual. Still I think everyone ought to at least see the movie if you aren't one for reading. The cast is worth the effort.To read more about the adaption of the book to the movie: http://yaykisspurr.wordpress.com/2012/04/12/which-skeeter-is-better/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sensitive and entertaining like the novel and wonderfully acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have read and enjoyed the novel by K. Stockett, you won't be disappointed by the movie, on the contrary you will love it, too. The picture proves definitely up to the novel, that same entertaining and sensitive touch is evident from the first shots, and it's very easy to be drawn into the story and the characters.Certainly, "The help", both the novel and the movie, does not have the sharp and dramatic edge of "The long walk home", and although truly committed while representing the condition of black maids working for white families during the 60's, some light is shed, in a way that racism and intolerance are to be counterbalanced by the idea that something could really change. Focus in on the womens' relationship, and also the contrast white-black is explored from a female point of view, around the themes of motherhood and the role of women in Southern society, inside a story where the male point of view is almost absent.The movie is wonderfully acted, once having read the novel, I could not have thought of better interpreters, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Emma Stone are exactly how I had devised Aibileen, Minnie, and Skeeter in my mind. It is as if the story and the characters I had devised in my mind while reading the book, were visually developing through the picture. Also the characters of Celia, Hilly and Skeeters's mother help compose a great female cast, and make the movie truly enjoyable from beginning till end. In the end, a movie definitely worth watching, in the same way as the book was worth reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew not much when the movie first came to the cinemas, but after seeing the trailer I was intrigued. I expected something a little less serious, but if the movie was in any way different than it is, it wouldn't be this good. The story is extremely difficult emotionally. It deals with a problem that was an issue not so long ago, and I believe that is what makes it so powerful. People who took care of their children, them, their entire lives were treated, by them, like slaves. No respect, no consideration for their feelings, their problems. I was actually considering leaving the cinema after 40 min because I got so enraged by how those women were treated I could barely stand it. Why was that so? Primarily, the acting. Every character in this movie was played to the point of perfection. Bryce Dallas Howard and Viola Davis were astonishing. One can feel nothing but hate for Hilly, and nothing but sorrow and love for Aibileen. Another staggering performance was the one by Jessica Chastain. I found myself wanting to jump into the movie and just hug that woman's character through and through. Such cuteness I have never seen! The only minor problem is Emma Stone who got a little lost in the sea of these marvelous performances. All of the above named characters simply "ate" her on the screen. One more name worth mentioning is Octavia Spencer. She was my favorite character. Strong and powerful, but also extremely gentle and frightened. As is presented, the movie's leading characters are women. Another thing that deserves an absolute A+ is the contrast of the exterior space and the interior of the people. The hairspray generation, the houses filled with thousand of colors and at the same time such dark and evil personalities. See this movie and take everyone you know to see it. It is powerful, staggering, at times hilarious, and it has a beautiful message. This movie will bring out the best of you, and surely bring out emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate chick flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have I ever seen a movie in which males mattered less, apart from feminist/lesbian niche products like "Better Than Chocolate"? When I read Kathryn Stockett's book I thought that its description of an all-female world would thwart its straightforward conversion into a screenplay. I was mistaken. In fact, the males in the book were still slightly more prominent, especially Minnie's abusive husband Leroy. In the film, he is never seen at all, although to some extent he remains a menacing presence. And the senator in the book, an old Southerner who to the dismay of some of his guests suggests that the days of Jim Crow are over, is completely omitted.Leroy's absence obviously softens the film. Same goes for the rewriting of the character of Mrs. Phelan; her "conversion" to post-segregation mores makes her more likable for today's audiences (Klansmen apart). These changes turn the film into a typical feel-good movie. I think it will stand the test of time, both in itself and as a adaptation of a novel; whether critics will come to like it one day is a different matter.On a different note, if you are a foreign speaker and naturalized Midwesterner, you will have some trouble understanding the black slang and even the speech of some of the white characters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth the watch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was invited to a preview screening of The Help, I was unsure of what to expect. This may be easier to understand when one takes into consideration that Walt Disney Studios are responsible for the distribution of a film that is targeted at the older woman, the single hardest demographic to coax into cinema screens presently. Having read the book, (read review here) I knew the director had a lot to prove. As a fan I was wary yet excited at the evolution of this great book and the reception it's had worldwide. It is an unfortunate truth that Hollywood rarely makes the most of the projects it gets it's hands on, in terms of quality at least thus, the concern for an international bestseller making its way into the lap of Disney is an obvious worry.However, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is a well-constructed piece that remains loyal to Stockett's text and demonstrates the fear, discrimination and seething hatred that seems to have been so apparent during the 1960&#x2032;s of KKK riddled Jackson, Mississippi in a clear and poignant way. In contrast to other reviewers critiques, I did not find the film overly sentimental or sappy by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, Tate Taylor is to be credited for the realism he has managed to instill in the direction and in the screenplay, which he adopted from Stockett's text. For me, there were several outstanding performances, especially Octavia Spencer as outspoken Minny Jackson, the maid who rises above her many unfortunate choices in employer.Bryce Dallas Howard is perfection as the evil, scheming Hilly Holbrook and Emma Stone as the well meaning Skeeter Phelan is wonderful to watch. Viola Davis is also excellent and brings to Aibileen's character the dignity and honour that Stockett communicates in the book. As to be expected in a film dealing with racism and segregation, there is much drama and disturbance but, unlike similar genres of film such as Mississippi Burning, there are many comedic moments that create equilibrium. Sissy Spacek makes a long awaited return to the screen in a hilarious and fitting performance as Hilly's dotty mother, providing the right balance of light- heartedness to an otherwise serious and very real subject matter.Scenes to watch out for are Minny's famous pie scene from the book (readers will know exactly what I mean!), the 'camodes rather than the coats' scene and the glitzy reception scene which mirrors the false identity of all of Skeeter's white associates. Overall, the film is one of the best of 2011 so far and hopefully will serve to further the book's reputation. Well worth seeing I give it an 8/10.All Rights Reserved © Copyright 2011 Michelle Lacey (Michelle Ní Láitheása).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge never tasted so sweet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1963, a young journalist and aspiring novelist returns to her hometown, Jackson, Mississippi, at a time when the civil rights movement is gaining momentum. Her job on the Jackson Journal ? writing a column on house cleaning tips ? leads her into contact with the experts: black women who are the nannies, cooks and housekeepers for rich white folk. Thus begins an unlikely alliance that exposes the indignities suffered by black maids at the hands of Southern belles who ironically spend their idle moments raising money for African charities. The ultimate revenge of the maids is both funny and gross. The movie evokes many emotions; laughter, tears, anger and perhaps even shame. There are wonderful performances by the maids, Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis, who surely must be in the running for Oscar nominations.The book on which the movie is based is pure fiction but the interspersing of historical facts ? the murder of a civil rights campaigner and the assassination of President Kennedy ? create the feel of a true story. The excesses of the era, from Ford Thunderbirds to the women's dresses and hairstyles, are authentically depicted. And there are real parallels between the fictional novelist (Skeeter Phelan ? played by Emma Stone) and the book's author, Kathryn Stockett, who was born in Jackson, raised by a black nanny, and who struggled to get her first novel published. The movie can also be viewed as a social commentary on the times. As such, it has been criticized for its stereotypes, caricatures, hyperbole, even racism. Such a criticism would be valid for a documentary but not for a work of fiction. Perhaps the criticism is an indication that the topic can still hit a raw nerve.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some really nice acting here....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "The Help" has received TONS of great press and a ton of SAG and other awards, I am also aware that there is some controversy concerning the film. Some people have felt that the film was a bit paternalistic--as it might be interpreted as yet another story of a rich, enlightened white lady going out to help all the downtrodden black folk. I am just not sure if I could see this or not--especially as the black women in the film end up showing LOTS of strength during the course of the film. BUT, I am also a white guy--and it's not fair for me to automatically brand the film one way or another. Just be aware that there are a few who resent the idea of this film.I could discuss the plot, but LOTS of other reviewers have discussed this. So instead, let's talk about what I liked and didn't like. I liked the acting. The problem, however, is that giving any of these actresses awards is tough as it's such an ensemble cast. I can truly understand why the Screen Actor's Guild chose to award ALL the cast a joint award. The direction was very nice and the movie was well filmed. The script was also very nice--and quite inspiring. My quibbles are VERY small---very, very small. I felt that a few characters were a bit one-dimensional (particularly the lead villainess). Also, the ending of the film seemed to drag out a bit and wrapping it up a bit sooner. It wasn't a bad ending--but tightening would have heightened the overall emotional impact.So my advice for you is to see this film. While I still think "Hugo" is the best nominated film this year, I can see the merit in "The Help" winning and "The Artist" sure seems to have a lot of momentum. So, do yourself a favor and see all three--all three are terrific.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yesterday, I had a 3 hour break in-between classes, and a free movie on my AMC Stubbs card, so I went to the movies. Unbelievably the only thing playing at my time was one of the movies I didn't want to see, The Help. Isn't it funny how the movie you never want to see always turns out to be great? The Help is based on a book by the same title, and follows a young writer, in the mid 1960s, looking for an idea. At a party, she notices how horrible people are to the African American help and decides to write their story. Of course it's a scandalous idea that can get them all killed, but Skeeter finds one woman brave enough to tell her story. This movie is funny, heartwarming, and inspirational, not to mention the acting is top notch. Viola Davis deserves an Oscar nomination for her performance, which is one of the strongest I've seen all year. The Help is an amazing story, with a terrific cast, and a big upside. It has a unique and inspiring story that takes us back to a very tumultuous time in American History, and I can't recommend it enough!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First rate reminder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) has spent 4 years doing her degree in the North before returning to 1960s Jackson, Mississippi, where her eyes are opened to the unconscious prejudice which is constantly directed towards the black domestic staff by the over-privileged housewives of the area. Skeeter determines to collect the personal recollections of the domestic maids for publication as a small step towards righting these wrongs.Let's get something straight - I am an ageing white man from rural England so, apart from having grown up through these times, I have nothing in common with any of these people. I am, however, a human being and this is, above all, a story about human beings and how they show - or don't show - their humanity towards each other. I have not read the book on which this film is based.Like The King's Speech, The Help is not just a worthy film, it is also an entertaining one. The characters are all engaging and rounded people, and are all well played. The film is frequently moving and, more frequently, very funny. The period is nicely evoked.Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer have been singled out for praise for their performances as the two domestics who are first to tell their stories: for me, however, I most enjoyed Jessica Chastain's performance as a bimbo who is not as empty-headed as she at first appears. Her performance was funny, emotional, and haunting, and vastly different to her performances in The Debt and Texas Killing Fields. Bryce Dallas Howard's monstrous queen bee was both funny and chilling. In truth, all the principals had their moments.The film is not perfect. It is a touch too long, and what it says is, at this distance in time, something of a given. However, it says it well, and entertainingly, and if it changes one person's point of view - for there are still plenty of people out there who match the types here - then it will have done a good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very entertaining . . . not great, but entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is a very entertaining movie about how a group of strong women make a minor dent in the injustice of segregation. As a movie, it does a serviceable job, but as history it comes up a little short. Here is a movie that contains a lot of fine performances and some nice moments, but seems to dance around the uglier side of The Civil Rights movement. By the end, the problems of the main characters seem to have come to a fitting, non-violent conclusion. Yet, the real-life history of this conflict would be written in blood.Based on the book by Kathryn Stockett (which I haven't read), the story takes place in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960s which, at the time, was run by the brass-bound segregationist Governor Ross Barnett, who had the support of The White Citizen's Council that was determined to keep the black population in its place. In social standing, blacks are subservient to whites and the plight of black women in the work world is cleaning the houses of white families. They clean house and raising the children while the white women fuss about their looks and their social status.The focus of the film begins with a young idealist, Eungenia "Skeeter" Phelan (Emma Stone), who has returned home from college to find that the maid who raised her from birth is no longer working there for reasons that her parents refuse to explain. Skeeter becomes curious about the woman who work in her home and in many homes in the south. "Who is taking care of their children while they are taking care of ours?", she wonders.The focus gradually drifts to some of the maids, mainly Abileen Clark (Viola Davis), a quietly wounded soul who lost her son, and Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer), an open-faced, boisterous woman whose frustration at being treated like trash by her hateful employer (Bryce Dallas Howard) is quickly coming to a boiling point.Skeeter aspires to be a writer and has an offer from a New York publisher (Mary Steenburgen) to write a book of personal accounts from the point of view of southern maids (all anonymous, of course) exposing what it is like to work in the houses of white folks, raising their children and cleaning their toilets. This is an unwise proposition given the climate of the times. The white population of Mississippi is determined to stop the progression of Martin Luther King and the civil rights movement and that has black women over a barrel. The maids around town want nothing to do with the project: they need work and cleaning houses remains the only work available to them. At first, the only two women willing to participate are Minny and Abileen, but slowly the numbers begin to grow.What I liked about The Help is the manner in which it paints the black women as individual characters, especially Minny and Abileen. They both have separate and distinct personalities and both have different agendas. They don't just stand as static, noble props for the movie to lean on. Abileen's fury over her son becomes her motivation for getting involved with Skeeter's book and Minny's fury over being treated less-than-human by her employer becomes hers.The pure emotional heart of the movie is felt by the presence of actress Viola Davis, a wonderful actress that I've been watching with joy for years in films like Doubt (for which she got her first Oscar nomination), Eat Pray Love and last year's forgotten gem Trust. Here, as Abileen, she plays a grieving mother who's quiet frustration over the loss of her son is felt in her very presence. There is a moment deep in the film when she sits at her kitchen table and describes to Skeeter the carelessness of her son's on-the-job accident. There is something in her eyes, in her voice, and in her body language that speaks to the wound deep in her heart. You can feel the fury of this grieving mother. This is a moment, I think, that will get her an Oscar nomination this year. She gives the film's best performance.There is one character, I'm afraid, that doesn't work at all. That is the one played by Bryce Dallas Howard - Ron's daughter - who occupies the role of Hilly Holbrook, Minny's pathologically racist employer, who is so full of unmerciful venom that it washes over into cliché. She wants a legislation passed that would forbid the maids from using the same bathroom facilities as their employers. This was a real issue at the time, but the movie plays it as an overwrought plot device designed to climax with a moment in which she eats one of Minny's pies, laced with a particularly disgusting ingredient (read this paragraph again carefully and you can probably deduce what it is). It is a moment that might fit in American Pie or There's Something About Mary but seems wrong-headed in a movie about the Civil Right's Movement. I was hoping that some humanity would come to Hilly with the revelation of a past connection with Celia, but sadly, it never does.I think that The Help is a good movie, a movie with some important things to say and some performances that could turn it into a great movie, rather than just a good one. It is entertaining, but it is also kind of safe. It dances around the uglier sides of life in Mississippi under segregation and comes to an ending that closes the book on the characters with a lot of victories. We never sense that the struggle has just begun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help is a very compelling drama about domestic life for women of color during the early '60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this very compellingly historical drama with my movie theatre-working friend who seen it twice before. We both enjoyed this fictional account of many of the African-American female maids and their stories they tell to an aspiring author named Skeeter (Emma Stone). Among those female servants, Abileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) provide the most interesting of their trials of working for their employers. The most mean of the white employers is one Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) who gets most of her comeuppance in the most dirty ways one can imagine. Then, on the other side of the tracks is Celia (Jessica Chastain) who somehow becomes Minny's savior and vice versa. There's also good supporting turns from Sissy Spacek, Cicely Tyson, Mary Steenburgen and especially Allison Janney. Since I haven't read the book, I'm sure there are some details I haven't been privy to that I'm sure might have made this movie even more compelling. But what I've seen is good enough for me to highly recommend The Help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help: A Delicate Dance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many stories in our sordid and sorry history that deserve reverence and a delicate hand when talked about. They should all be told, absolutely, and hopefully learned from, but we must always remember that how the story is told can influence the listener almost as much as the story itself. It can be a tightrope walk along the line between pride and piety and you want to be careful which side it falls on.The Help is set in Jackson, Mississippi during the central part of the civil rights movement. A young white woman named Skeeter wants to write something real, something special and she finds it in the socialized and institutionalized mistreatment of the African-American hired help. She ventures to gain their trust and their stories in a dangerous effort to give a voice to the silent underbelly of high Southern society.This film has been #1 at the box office for three weeks and already is a huge success for the studios. It marches along each weekend as the little movie that could. Some will credit that to the original book already being a best-seller, but we've seen plenty of best-seller adaptations that fizzle sadly on the big screen. Even a well-told story needs excellent execution in order to swing a whole new audience and The Help is boiling over with just that.Emma Stone, as the stubborn and righteous Skeeter, delivers her most dramatic turn to date and does not fail to impress. Yet the real power comes from the surrounding cast, packed with outstanding performances ranging from beautifully heart-wrenching to disgustingly evil. Starting with the two maids, shown with touching grace and power by Viola Davis (as Aibileen) and Octavia Spencer (as Minny), these wonderful actresses anchor the film in layers upon layers of honesty and courage. On the complete other side of the spectrum, Bryce Dallas Howard delivers a stunningly devious performance as Hilly Holbrook, the resident alpha Stepford wife, clinging to the old ways and old hatreds, fighting the oncoming social change with each of her pearly white teeth and perfectly french-tipped nails. Her quietly controlled rage reminded me constantly of Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil, such poise built around such poison. Jessica Chastain also did a splendid job as Celia Foote, trying desperately to get acceptance from anyone at all, even if it comes from her maid.As director, Tate Taylor, tried to softly, but honestly, capture the time and place of 1960s Mississippi. There was tension throughout the movie, keeping the audience wondering when the violence of racism was going to strike, but Taylor always kept it just off screen, tempting the horror without needing to show it up close. He also crafted some wonderfully delicate scenes with the character of Celia, shedding light on yet another part of women's history kept in the dark for far too long.However, as I mentioned earlier, it is a delicate dance and this story can be seen from the angle of another "white person ends racism" story, but I feel that would be shortchanging the core of the story. Stone's character doesn't free the maids from servitude, she just gives them a voice, an outlet which was up to that point held far out of reach.One of the few things I found unnecessary was Stone's boyfriend Stuart (played by Chris Lowell). Stone feels much more natural and relatable as an gawky outcast, never fitting in with all her married high society friends. The need to show her swing back and forth in the world of troubled relationships just felt like a step too far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is set in the 1960's where colored people had little to no rights and mainly focuses on the colored maids working for the "white" people.I didn't really want to see the movie but it got great reviews so I decided to check it out. I must say this movie was quite touching and very well done.The cast is excellent with award worthy performances from Viola Davis, Emma Stone and Octavia Spencer - the main cast. The acting was amazing and there was great chemistry among the respectful classes of people in the film ( the whites and the blacks).The script was well written and I love the balance of comedy and drama. There are some intense scenes however the comedy makes the movie more enjoyable rather than just a movie to make you feel sad all the way through. There was a perfects balance there and I loved that. The film also took you on a roller-coaster of emotions. Sometimes you were sad, extremely happy, angry or laughing. Its also one of those movies that can hold your interest from beginning to end.With great performances, a brilliant script and a film so touching and inspiring, The Help is definitely a must-see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's see now, who will be nominated for Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress of 2011, Viola Davis or Octavia Spencer? Bet your bippy that either one or both are going home with a statue. This is one heck of an excellent film because it SHOULD awaken Caucasians to how we humiliated African-Americans for so long. The film is so gripping, it hurts. I myself saw in Washington, DC buses marked "Whites Only." I saw segregated rest rooms, water fountains..you name it. And of course things were even worse for blacks in Mississippi where the movie takes place. How strange.Black maids were good enough to make meals, serve meals and tend to white children but not good enough to be equal in every aspect with whites. How vividly I remember Mississippi racist governor Ross Barnett finally challenged and beaten by Jack and Robert Kennedy. Our President and Attorney General got sick and tired of all the murder and mayhem Barnett knew about yet always had alibis and excuses. Indeed, the racist was taken down and OUT, thank God. "The Help" is a vivid look into those rotten years and why intelligent evolution began to take place. Kudos to the entire cast of this very excellent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high expectations before seeing the film. I had just read the book and liked it a lot, one of the best I read in 2011.So, therefore the movie made me disappointed. The film taking several shortcuts and simplifying the story too much. The perspective of the book (Skeeter's) was changed to be the perspective of the maids, mainly Aibileen and Minny. I felt Skeeter was reduced to a bi-stander and not the driver of collecting the interviews and writing the book as in the original text. Take the story of Skeeter and Stuart. It had been cut down so it did not make any sense why he was so gloomy, drinking to much.I urge you all, movie audience and the film makers, to read the book!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is the most amazing movie I have ever seen. It touched my heart so much, it just made me see things in such a different way. I dried out my tears watching this movie, complements to the writer/s of this movie and all the actors/actresses. Once again most amazing, touching, creative and honest movie ever. I will never forget this movie, it will always stay with me! The storyline is just so amazing, and you will 100% love this movie. I can promise you that! Once you start watching the movie you will not want to stop, I can guarantee you that! A lot of very good actors/actresses play in this movie and that just makes it even better to watch. There are so many different scenes in this story but they all somehow blend together and mix well together, and this is what makes this movie amazing.</fullReview>

Not only did it bring tears to my eyes (and cheeks, and chin, and blouse!) it made me laugh, made me contemplate and also reflect greatly on the history and thought provoking truth that the film so touchingly, and truthfully depicts. It was beautifully directed, fantastically acted and above all, this films ability to touch the hearts of all those in the theatre really made it a magical experience. Not only is it a film with an historical message, it is a film with a mood; hope. I could go on, but I won't. All I have left to say is please go and watch this incredible film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It took me 3 days to read the book and I went out and watched the movie right afterwards, with every detail still fresh in my mind. Of course in a book based film there will be some differences, details that get left out. I was thoroughly pleased with this film and how close it came to the book. The things that were changed or left out are understandable. There are a couple of small things I wished the movie stayed true to: Constantine being a large, tall woman, and of course the way that Stuart left Skeeter. Although, I would have been happy if they left out him leaving all together and had him stay with her :) The cast they chose was incredible. I am a huge Emma Stone fan, but I have to say that Hilly's character was my favorite. That beautiful woman played that horrible part so well. And please let me revert back to a teenager for a moment and say that Chris Lowell is a hottie. Last but not least... I saw interviews saying that Aibileen's character was really going to have to work hard to fill the shoes and believe me, SHE DID, but I have to say that Octavia Spencer was outstanding. Minny stole the show. This is an incredible film and I will watch it over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Help Wanted ( and Needed )</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&#xfffc;This film is mildly recommended.No, I didn't read the book, but I did see The Help. There seems to be a bit of a well-deserved "blacklash" about the whitewashing done in the well-meaning and well-made film adaptation of the popular best seller. And I can honestly agree with the uproar over the many candy- coated scenes of Southern discomfort and stereotypical female role models presented in this earnest film, a film that only hint at the violent and racist times of the sixties during the fight for equality with the Civil Rights movement. Yet, I can still recommend it due, in large part, to the terrific ensemble of actors that bring the right "help" to elevate this mawkish and sentimentalized material. It's 1964 and everything is literally black and white in Jackson, Mississippi. There is an hidden underbelly of prejudice and hatred in this town that rarely manifests itself, except for the fine production values that capture the tiers of injustice and social division. ( The art direction by Curt Beech and costume design by Sharen Davis work wonders to show this disparity of class struggle.)All the female characters become walking caricatures of strong-willed Southern belles, which may have been the case back then, but seems to me to be inspired too heavily with the leftover carcasses of other good ole country women's empowerment ilk, feel good films like Steel Magnolias, The Divine Secrets of the YaYa Sisterhood, The Blind Side, and Fried Green Tomatoes that outwear their welcome long before the film ends. You know, you've seen the types before: the modern thinking progressive heroine, Skeeter, ( Geez, even the name sends shivers! ) well acted by the talented Emma Stone; the prejudiced beauty queen and mean spirited ringleader, Bryce Dallas Howard ( another fine performance ), the pretty and obedient trophy wife (Ahna O'Reilly), the bubble-headed but kind sexpot ( Jessica Chastain ). Even their elders, nicely played by Allison Janney and Sissy Spacek are rich, pampered, and stereotypical products of that era. Them crazy white folks with unique Dixie names like Hilly, Celia, Jolene, and the aforementioned Eugenia "Skeeter"!Well, it seems that Skeeter wants to write a tell-all book about the black repression and their indignation from the point of view of the black maids, the later day "Mammies" of the Sixties decade. Praise the Lord we've still got the strong caring types in our Merry Maids Southern labor force of black help. Leading the way are stoic, loving, and wise Aibileen and angry, dependable, and comic Minny, coming to the white folks' rescue, a-cooking, a-cleaning, and a-rearing their children and making it right by telling the world their tales of woe. Seriously speaking, it is a minor miracle that wonderful actresses like Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer inhabit these roles. They supply the dignity and power to this underwritten and highly predictable roles. These actresses contribute such strength and nuance to their characters and should earn some justified nominations this award season. Director / writer Tate Taylor does a commendable if somewhat lackluster job with his film. His film marginalizes the seriousness of its subject matter and is perfectly content to become the mellowest of melodramas with its feel good message of womanhood and liberation overshadowing the Civil Rights movement and the ugliness of discrimination and segregation. With its rather slim but diverting story and its far too obvious plot devices and routine structure, The Help is another example of a promising idea that avoids any complexity or depth, a film more interested in the nostalgic haze of yesterdays than the harsh realities of the black struggle for equality. The uplifting hopeful ending also seems false and unrealistic. In fact, the whole film seems hopelessly unrealistic to me. It is as if the film's sole purpose is to entertain, simplify, and amuse, and on that level, it efficiently succeeds. But it's the actors who pitch in and rescue The Help from its own limited rose-colored vision. Grade: B-NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Believable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought that this movie was supposed to be set in the American South in the 1960s. But really it seems to be set in an alternate universe where nothing makes any sense. How is it that the protagonist has grown up in the same society as all the other (racist) women, yet has a completely modern, 21st century viewpoint? Things just don't work that way.Racism in the movie was portrayed as a pervasive but ultimately trivial issue. The movie reduced racism to the petty meanness of society ladies, largely skirting issues such as sexual harassment and mob violence. We have one scene of police brutality and another scene with a vague reference to a shooting, but these events seem to come out of nowhere and vanish without a trace afterward. What happens to the woman who is arrested, after the arrest? We never find out.Another thing that bothered me about this movie was how the black women are portrayed as largely feeble and helpless until the white women ("Skeeter" and Celia, in particular) teach them to stand up for themselves. This was partly due to the fact that the movie was, first and foremost, about Eugenia's coming-of-age experience and not about "the help" at all. But still, it was dissatisfying.In addition to these issues, the characterization was rather poor and the cinematography was nothing special.I wish I were more well-versed in history, so I really lay into this movie properly. But even as my uninformed self, I could tell that there were many things wrong with this movie. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old clichés, same old stereotypes, same old story ... its been done before (over and over)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like this really make me despair. The contrast between black people and white people's reaction to these kind of films confirms that despite the veneer of living in a post racial world, we merely coexist, are not really integrated in any meaningful way underneath that comforting false veneer. Generally, speaking, overwhelmingly, white people have called this film (and the book its derived from), one of the best things they've read/watched, very funny and entertaining, a must watch film, whilst black people in general have found it "hard to watch", a rehash of old themes and stereotypes, and even humiliating/insulting.Regarding the themes and the content of the film itself, its all been done before (over and over again) ... nothing new here. A movie purportedly about racism afflicting an oppressed community, but actually about the experience of the affluent white person defending that community. "Cry Freedom." "Mississippi Burning.",&#xfeff; the list goes on ... The fact that films like 'The Blind Side' (and now possibly this), receive such wide acclaim and become box office hits (despite the protestation of minorities who feel infantalised by the film), tells an uncomfortable dynamic of existing race and power in our so called post racial world.This film is nothing more than a self congratulatory, self aggrandizing, condescending and patronising attempt at yet another make over of the great white hope theme. Having said that, I have no doubt that this film will at the very least be nominated for an Oscar, and very likely actually win one - after all, we DO like to see ourselves portrayed on screen as the great saviour, or the great WHITE hope - don't we?.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolutely the best movie of the last few years. Loved it. Laughed, cried, related, remembered, and remember Martin Luther King's speech I have a dream. This is an awesome movie everyone should see. Racism is disgusting and should never be. This movie was so good and had such a great message I didn't want it to end. I grew up with racist parents and grandparents and I can tell you I could very well have ended up prejudice but I hated it then and I hate it now. We make choices in life if we are going to do right or wrong and we all bleed red. If people can't get along on earth what makes anyone think God wants them in heaven? This was wonderful how they presented what was still going on in the 60s. I saw the racism and hatred with the watts riots, the tension in Long Beach, and the hatred from both sides. This movie was presented so good and had such great aspects to it that it was the one movie in hundreds I have seen that I would even want to give a review on. Acting great, story great, and even if it was just a presentation of what things went on and might not have been about a particular family...this was pretty darn accurate by what I lived through in the 60s. Thanks for the movie. It was a delight to watch and I give it a triple A rating. All families should watch this together and discuss it after because it truly should win every award out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help, based on the novel of the same title, deals with the rise of the black help in the 60's in the overall quest for equality between the races and more specifically the equality of civil liberties. The film plays out as a neat 3-acter with barely any surprises along the way. For a film dealing with these sorts of issues it is surprisingly black and white and straightforward. The soundtrack is nothing more than sugarcoating for the overly pretty sceneries and often annoys. Some roughness to the film seems sorely lacking, it almost plays out like a cartoon. Fans of the film should also want to check out the 2007 film 'The Great Debaters' (Denzel Washington, Forrest Whitaker) with a comparable premise which suffers from the same, in my opinion, weaknesses.6/10</fullReview>

Finally she accepts to speak about her job conditions but she is nervous. In her book Skeeter speaks about Aibileen but also about Elisabeth Leefot, Aibileen's boss, and about Minny, the friend of Aibileen.She speaks about Miss Hilly Holbrook, a 24 years old woman who is the president oh the Junior League and active in all charity. She is Minny's employer, but she is a very racist girl.-In conclusion- It's a good film which deals whit the black segregation. To my mind it's a too long film and I dislike it because it's not my favorite movie genre. I think it's however a movie to see because it's welldone , it's down to earth and realistic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would like to share my opinion about the movie The Help (La couleur des sentiments). This movie was adapted from the novel by Kathryn Stockett. The Help talks about the conditions of the black maids in Mississippi in the 1960s and their relationships with their bosses.The question is : why do the rich families ask black maids to raise their children, while they refuse that the maids use the bathroom in the house ? Isn't it by pure racism ? In this society, the color of the skin decides which feelings an individual must have and how he needs to behave. Skeeter, the heroine, decides to write a novel and she interviews the black maids who have spent their life taking care of prominent southern families. We discover the life of these women. They are mistreated by the society, denigrated by their bosses but loved by the children they raise. These maids are extremely affected : we can see their difficulties and how they face their situations. The variety of stories of the different maids allows the audience to be affected differently. It depends on each one's sensitivity. The Help is a movie about women. The character of Skeeter represents the modern woman who tries to get her liberty through her work. She is the opposite of Hilly Holbrook and her friends who want to continue the traditions. The director of the movie never judges but he simply describes how things were during racial segregation in the United States. After seeing the movie, we understand how the American society of the 1960s was. Humor as well as emotions are waiting for you, allowing to understand this difficult social and racial subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film came highly recommended by classmates of mine, and I must say it did not disappoint. After watching this film I now can't wait to read the book.The entire story is based around the theme of social problems. In the film the social problem of race issues are represented when a small minority group makes the choice to speak out and about life as they know it in their small town of Mississippi. The premise of the film starts with Skeeter (Emma Stone) graduating from college and in desperation to start her writing career takes a job writing for a cleaning column at the local newspaper. Skeeter struggles with understanding the simple mindedness of her childhood friends when it comes to how they treat their staff. Skeeter, desperate to share her observations, decides she would like to write about it all but in the perspective of the maids. At first and as expected, the maids refuse to help. After a stroke of courage, Aibileen (Viola Davis) does concede. Skeeter and Aibileen meet and the stories begin to pour. Aibileen's good friend Minny (Octavia Spencer) finds out about the secret meetings of Skeeter and Aibileen and also decides to join in with her story. Many other soon follow their lead to take Skeeter's writings to a much higher level than even she anticipated.The social problems theme in the movie is relatable to that of the film the Green Mile. Although the characters in this film are not being physically abused the maids are constantly being abused verbally and emotionally. Given the time period in which both of these films take place the social problems are almost identical. Both films deal with race as the issue as well as have at least one person of a different race that is able to see past social status and color to try everything they can, to make some sort of difference. In my opinion both the musicality and the lighting not only made this film extraordinary, but helped to re establish the theme of the film. Examples of this can be seen in many different scenes. For instance the lighting constantly reminds us how taboo it is for women like Skeeter to be seen with the help. When Skeeter travels to Aibileen's house to discuss the book, the lighting is dark helping the viewer to grasp the uneasiness as well as restate how unsafe, and illegal it was for Aibileen and Minny to be collaborating with Skeeter. The same can be said for the musicality of the film. Very often there is soft subtle music playing in the background giving the viewer the extra push to feel what the characters are feeling. Specifically in the scene where it is raining and everyone is made aware of how Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) feels about the help using the restrooms in her house. The scene starts with slow, soft, subtle music by the end of the scene Minny has been fired and is walking in a storm the slow heartbreaking music gets louder forcing the viewer to be emotionally vested in what just took place for Minny, and once again re iterating the theme of what is or was socially acceptable in that time period and in the film. For a film that takes place roughly 50 years ago in the civil rights era, and primarily focuses on the social problems of that era, it was both entertaining and engaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good cast in typical feel-good story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to fault a movie like this, when it seems perfectly aware of what kind of movie it wants to be, and does a great job achieving its goal. Basically it is a typical feel-good story, set in a small town with obvious racial tension. The story is at times predictable - though that often feels irrelevant for movies like this. It has been criticized for being another "white savior" movie, where the white character is needed to help the black characters out of their situation. I agree that it is too bad that there still are so many movies about this kind of stories being made, this movie handles it quite nicely.The highlight of this movie is the cast. There are some great performances in this movie from actors I was completely unfamiliar with. Mostly the "helps" are doing a great job, enhanced by convincing (to me) costume- and set-design.I wish that this movie would have had higher ambitions, gone longer in exploring the good side of "evil" people and the bad side of the good - making the characters all more human. There is a scene near the end where a certain character reveals a side of herself. I wish that this could have been a thread throughout the movie, that this ambivalence was given - not a reveal. I guess it would have been a different movie, but definitely a more interesting one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help is a must-see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently, I have re-watched 'The Help', and I can already say, the film is even better the second time I've watched it. This film is a true masterpiece and I'm surprised that people disliked the film. Still, opinions are opinions, and it seems that they have their own. In this review, I will go through a summary of the film, talk about the characters, the presentation, the problems and my opinions on the film.The story is about an aspiring author named Skeeter choosing to interview black women to write a book full of their views on situations. During the story, many scenes occur emphasizing the discrimination back in the 1960s. The jokes that show up in this film are hilarious and the scenes of drama are done perfectly. You feel empathy for the main characters when they're put in certain situations which could end up changing for the worst. To sum it up, the story was brilliant and I couldn't find any problems or flaws with the story.The characters each have their own unique personalities and stories. Unlike Frozen, the characters and support characters actually mean something. They have stories that leave you in tears. Minny is a hilarious character and has two lines that stay in your mind for a while. Skeeter is a very interesting character. The story emphasises her desire to write a book, and eventually, that dream comes true. Abileen is very three dimensional and has many great moments. She is a great character because without her in the plot, the story wouldn't be able to develop. Overall, the characters are brilliant and even the smaller characters are as good as the main.The presentation is great. The lighting is vibrant and smooth, and the houses and sets are bright and spacious. The trees and plants in this film are bright and green. One thing I like about the lighting is how the film is possibly set in summer. They have obviously done a good job with the lighting, and it makes the film's scenery pop.With every film comes a problem. One of the problems of the film was too careful not to offend anyone. They held back on the truth of what the times were like back then, but I'm sure they wanted to keep this film at a 12+ rating. Another problem is how saturated the lighting is. Yes I was praising the lighting for looking smooth and vibrant, but the colours seem unrealistically bright at times. In conclusion, I think this film has done a good job with showing off 1960s America without going overboard. While they may hold back on a few aspects, they make it up to you with hilarious comedy, great drama and memorable quotes. If you see this film in the shop, I recommend buying it to see how it holds up for you. I give this film an 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen much better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to watch a film about racism, I do not recommend this one. While it may do a few things right, it suffers from numerous flaws. I didn't really care for this film that much, and it could have been a lot better.A young woman named Skeeter who is trying to become an author during the civil rights movement of the 60's decides to write a book detailing the lives of African-American maids and how they're treated. As the word about her book gets out, many more African-American maids come to her to help her write her book by telling her how they are treated.The first issue I have with this film is that it's overly emotionally manipulative. At some points in the movie, it feels like director Tate Taylor is grasping for straws to find anything which might draw an emotion out of the audience. This can be distracting at some points in the film because it's used a lot. In this case, however, I found most of its attempts to be ineffective at giving me a connection with the characters. The only one which was effective for me was the one used at the very end of the film. However, none of the other sad scenes in the film worked. I find this flaw a lot with feel good movies, and I wish that directors would try to avoid this as this is one of the main things which can bring me out of a movie.Another flaw is that most of the characters are overly cliché and are caricatures. The characters seem to be everything you would expect to find in a film about racism. They make almost every white character to be a racist. Also, they make it so one progressive white character is able to see through the conflict and want to help the African-Americans maids in the film. Also, some of the black characters are very stereotypical and somewhat racist. The film makes it so that almost every black character loves fried chicken. In fact, they show this several points in the film. I really wished that they didn't do it because I found that to be kind of jarring. Since about all of the main characters felt reductive, it sort of took me out of the film.Another area the film misses in is that it doesn't show the absolute lows of racism. It doesn't need to be hyper-violent, but it should at least have enough violence to make it hit hard enough with the viewer. Since it doesn't show enough violence to give it an accurate portrayal of how life really was like for African-Americans in the 60's, I felt like the movie was too safe. A movie about racism being too safe is never a good thing. There are some movie plots and settings that I feel require for their movies to focus on the absolute lows of their setting. Racism is definitely one of them.Also, the main character, Skeeter, feels very anachronistic. It feels like Kathryn Stocket (the author of the book this film is based on) projected her own modern-day fulfillment to have such a progressive minded, white female. If someone like Skeeter wanted to write a book about interviews from African Americans from the 60's, those kinds of people usually came from the North and even then, they would be treated with violence. However, to have that character come from the South and write a book like that - it's simply wish fulfillment on Stocket's part. No book like "The Help" would have ever existed and it would've never been published during the 60's. Because of this, the atmospheric feeling of institutional racism does not feel very realistic in the film.Another flaw is the movie's overall length. I feel like the movie could've been a lot shorter. I'll even argue that it could've been cut down to just under 2 hours. Since it was relatively slow-paced, there were several times when the film didn't have my full attention and other times when I wanted it to end or get going with its main story. One of the plot points which could have been cut from the film was Skeeter's relationship with Stuart. I didn't buy for a second that Skeeter would've been attracted to him and would've gone out with him for quite some time. Wouldn't she have concluded from the beginning that he was a racist and not want to have anything to do with him?With that being said, that's not to say that I liked nothing about this film. To me, its biggest strength lies in the acting. Many actresses give amazing performances. Emma Stone, Viola Davis, and Octavia Spencer both give amazing performances and they helped to carry the movie very well. However, some performances weren't that good. Bryce Dallas Howard gave an overall good performance, but there were some times when she sounded over-the-top. Also, Jessica Chastain wasn't able to act convincingly as a drunk without sounding annoying and cringeworthy. It had weak performances, but most of them were overall solid.Also, the film does a good job at reminding us that the African-Americans who wrote the book had to face not only threats of violence from the hateful backlash of angry whites in their hometown, but also a multiplicity of indignities in their hometowns, including being forced to sit at the back of buses and having to use separate restrooms.In conclusion, while this film does a few things right, it is weighed down by being overly emotionally manipulative, using several cliché caricatures, not hitting the lows of racism well enough, an anachronistic plot, and the slow-pacing. Of course, the majority of its acting and how it displays hardships that African-Americans faced are good, but that's really all I can say for this film. It could've been great, but it didn't do that much for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stories do the fight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is sweet and polished, too much for my taste. I would have preferred less Spielberg and more Altman, less sugary reality and more wandering and friction. I like that it opens up a portal to a world, perhaps often talked about or acknowledged in historic importance, still rarely seen from the inside of houses and neighborhoods - it's Mississippi in the 60s during the Civil Rights sweep.The main device that gives the story shape is nicely simple - a plucky young girl wants to tell a story that enters life beneath the facade of formalities and finds truth. She aspires to be a journalist and not like the other ditzy Southern belles who idle at parties. We understand the story to be as much a vessel for escape from the confines of that world as a revelation. In 30s screwball she would have been a hardnosed news reporter who fights for her place in a male world.Her story, having no first hand insight, is a collection of stories by maids who step forward to talk about their life and mishaps. Their stories are assembled into a book, published from New York, which is a hit and finds its way home, opening up a portal in that life whereby white people end up reading the stories of maids they had ignored all their life in the same house. The film as this book and aiming for a similar function of gathering up stories to enlighten.It is as instructive and eyeopening about the subject I guess as 12 Years a Slave and about the continuation of much the same oppressive order of things, an apartheid state. But it sticks less because it sugarcoats more, redeems good guys and punishes bad and washes everything clean - so you leave it with all the work done for you and brushed aside instead of something you will carry back home. Indicative of this sensibility perhaps is that the girl makes it and leaves for New York while the women have to go back to helping around the house and this is lost in the jubilee. This is not the version the subject really deserves - that would ideally come from a black Cassavetes, someone who enters a house not to tidy up.Davies is suitably strong in a stoic role - but what amazed me was Chastain, to have known her as pensive and ethereal and to see her here so natural as a complete but lovable ditz with a big heart. What a marvelous woman who can swap bodies and selves.</fullReview>

Any guesses as to why.. every talent and casting agent will readily tell you. Guaranteed without one name attached, it does not come anywhere near as close (and her part in this production is limited). There's only a small number of names that incite you to search out what other work they would have done.. she is one. As for this film, she brought the audience to the table, and it is a very worthwhile experience for those who might not have gone there without her participation. The number of individuals labeling themselves 'actor' is huge... but those who are truly talented, in addition to being a full-fledged 'movie-star'... now that's a minuscule number.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>predictability saved by the power of female acting chops, especially Viola Davis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be giving this a higher rating that it deserves; it's a predictably plotted story and you know how a lot of it's going to go, what lessons may be learned by and to whom and so on. But like The King's Speech, it's nice to see an Oscar-bait(ish) movie that has strong performances (with one exception, which I'll get to momentarily) and on its own terms is pretty good. Not very good, or great, and The Help may be overrated, but it carries a strong message and I liked seeing these actors as these characters together, for the most part.As a story surrounding the Noble White Savior(TM) it surprised me how the cast was handled very evenly (Viola Davis got a best actress, not supporting, nomination for good reason and probably should've won all things considered). I thought it would be the Emma Stone show, with her as the Mississippi writer who works for a local paper but gets inspired by what she sees with the local maids working for generations (basically linked by blood and heritage and all to slavery) and gets a book deal about what it's like for 'the Help' to work and live. I though that all these other women (this is very much a woman-centric movie as well, which is commendable, albeit directed by a man) as small side characters. Not really the case, which helps since if you get tired of seeing one character it'll soon flip over to another.I heard from a few friends in the years before seeing this that Octavia Spencer's Minny was over the top, playing up the "mmHMM" Big Black Lady stereotype and got an undeserved Oscar. I thought she was fine, and more than that really, and got to portray a fully fleshed out character, and especially put against two very different white ladies - Bryce Dallas Howard's Hilly and Jessica Chastain's Celia, both she works for at separate times - we see how she can be your best friend or your worst enemy (if you push her far enough and hard for a long time like Hilly).If I had any problem it was with Howard, though that may be more in the writing; she's the one clear antagonist, but by and large because whenever she's on screen, even if she's sitting peacefully and only saying a little bit, there's a feeling like 'oh wow, what's she about to say now or put on that ugly-mean thing that has the guise of 'Southern Gentility'. But with what little she's given I found Howard more caricature than character, while Chastain, also seemingly not given quite a lot with a white-trash lady like Celia, she was a lot more fun and interesting and had real dynamics to play with (and tragedy as well). Perhaps I'm wrong and Hilly was fun to play as well, but I'm not sure I saw it.The heart of the movie though is Davis, and without her I probably wouldn't recommend the movie as much as I do. Yes, the great Allison Janney, in just a handful of scenes, does wonders as she always does as Stone's mother, and Emma Stone's Skeeter herself is really good as well (a few moments that should be especially tear-jerkery, like with a revelation surrounding a formerly employed maid who raised Skeeter, feel earned just by how much the actresses commit and don't let a lot of falsehood enter their performances).But I just felt the movie take it up a notch or two with Davis there, and I'm sure (first-time!) director Tate Taylor knew that as well. Just simple scenes showing Aibileen playing with the little white baby girl, or protecting her under a mattress during a tornado, there's just so much warmth to play with but also a lot of horror from that period of time in history, and she finds it all. Even (maybe especially) when she says little and is just standing there, exhausted, sad, trying to hide her deep-seated rage, Davis reminds us not just about how good she can act but about the constant, just understood horrors of the black experience at that time and place.In short, The Help is highly watchable as an actor's movie, and compensates for a little over-length (I'm not sure where, but it could've lost ten minutes somewhere I bet) and with things moving at a pace where you know how things will end up with this book coming out and who may or may not get it. Needless to say the ending also caught me off guard for how emotional it got, also genuinely and to a point where I was sold by what the actors were doing but also the deeper implications of what this ending meant for everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I really like about this movie, is the portrayal. It's not just the beautiful dresses they use in that era. It's the point of view we see all this. This movie give us all a little more understanding about the apartheid. We meet this young girl, Skeeter who's brave enough to listen to a voice who's not normally heard. It meant much at that time to not being friends with the "blacks" and Skeeter is then interviewing them anonymously. The movie shows us also the heartbreaking relationship Skeeter have to her "house-helper". She comes to a shock in the movie where she finally gets the explanation why she left. The movie shows some clips about their relationship and it's so heartwarming and so kind. What I also liked about the movie, was that you learn you have to stand up for those who don't have a voice, and how important it is to make a difference, no matter how small or big. What I missed was that some of Skeeter white friends should have stand up and join her in some way. There's much portrayal of what is fair and about consequences. I wished Skeeter's mom would have had a bigger development during the movie. We see that she's all about other opinions about her, and I wished she just gave that up and supported Skeeter in the end. If you see the movie, you will understand all this.</fullReview>

Common sins in large parts of the movies and that at no time compromises the film.

		<shortDescription>A Must Watch Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel of the same name, The Help is the perfect adaptation. The story is powerful and inspiring, the the cast is simply perfect, and though there are some differences between the film and the book (as there always are with adaptations), The Help is the perfect example on how to adapt a book into a film.The cast as a whole is amazing. It's great to see Emma Stone show a dramatic side apart for her usual comedic roles. Octavia Spencer is perfect as Minnie Jackson, a role she was born to play; a well deserved Oscar on her part. The rest of the cast played off each other wonderfully. I was entertained throughout the film, there was not a dull moment. I laughed and laughed, and felt sympathetic for some of the characters. I read the book after I watched the film, and it was just as entertaining (with few minor differences). Usually when I read a book that was adapted into a film, the book is better. The Help is the exception, as both are enjoyable.Overall, The Help is one of those films everyone should watch. It's a part of American history in the 1960s, between white and black. This is a problem we still face today, though we have made some improvement. What makes this film so compelling is that it tells the story from the perspective of the colored maids and the struggles they dealt with. Great storytelling, amazing cast!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very successful and captivating, but something's missing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Help" is an American 2.5-hour film from 4 years ago written and directed by Tate Taylor. He did not get that much awards attention, but still this film was one of the big players during awards season 2015, especially for Jessica Chastain, Octavia Spencer, who won an Oscar for it, and Viola Davis who came very close as well. The core topic here is racial equality in the years and decades where it was the biggest issue in America. We follow the lives of a couple Black housemaids from the perspective of Emma Stone's character, who writes a bock on the women's lives. There is one main antagonist played by Bryce Dallas Howard, a racist young woman, and it's a bit of shame that she did not receive real awards attention just like Stone, whose own family and relationship with men plays a crucial role in here as well.Tate Taylor did a fine job here in letting this not become too serious of a film, but include a couple funny parts as well, such as the famous pie scene of course, or Sissy Spacek's hilarious character or Emma Stone's constant struggles with men. This kept the movie from being just much full of itself and taking itself too seriously. Still, during many parts, it does of course. Spencer, Davis and Chastain all played their parts well, but I am not so sure if they really deserved all the honors they got. To me, it was a good watch and almost never dragged despite the massive runtime, but I felt that in terms of greatness something was missing here and I enjoyed Taylor's next film, the James Brown biopic "Get on Up" at least as much as this one here, even if it did not have the deep political and racial references of "The Help". Still, I would call "The Help" a good watch, even if I do not consider it one of the finest films of 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The voice of black maids in the early 60s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That pretty much sums up 2011's heralded "The Help," which stars Emma Stone as an aspiring journalist who encourages black maids (Viola Davis &amp; Octavia Spencer) to chronicle their experiences for an article as the Civil Rights Movement kicks into full gear in 1963 Jackson, Mississippi. Bryce Dallas Howard is on hand as the uppity biyatch and Jessica Chastain plays an amiable Marilyn Monroe-ish housewife.I like films that involve rural blacks, like "Mississippi Burning" (1988) and "Waterproof" (2000), and "The Help" falls into this category. The movie provides a window into early 60's Southern culture and the plight of black women. Despite being snooty, Bryce looks great and Jessica looks even better, nice and curvy (she reportedly gained 15 lbs. for the role, which I wish she'd keep). Emma is effective as the protagonist, but she's too good-looking to for the role since it calls for an early 20s woman who's never been asked out on a date. Why sure! Nevertheless, this is a solid period drama with authentic Mississippian locations.The movie runs 146 minutes and was shot in Clarksdale, Greenwood and Jackson, Mississippi.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film tells Skeeter Phelan's efforts to write a book based on interviews and testimonies of black servants serving in the homes of wealthy white families of Mississippi. Directed by Tate Taylor (who is also responsible for screenplay, based on the Kathryn Stockett's novel), the film has the participation of Emma Stone (Skeeter), Viola Davis (the servant Aibileen), Octavia Spencer (the servant Minny) and a number of talented actresses.This film deals with interesting questions, starting with the race issue, which is still a ghost hovering over the US, and the issue of civil rights and the rights of employer over the employee. From there, the film gives us to know moments in the life of these servants and we see that, in spite of their humility, they're essential for those families, where women have the appearance of not even knowing fry an egg. The cast fulfills its mission very well but without surprise us with supreme interpretations. The only exception is Octavia Spencer, who touches us and moves us in the role of Minny, justly deserving the single Oscar that the film won: Best Supporting Actress.Our society often doesn't hear the voices of most humble. However, without them, society would fall like a house of cards. We all need each other. This film is about this: humble people in search of a voice, trying to tell their testimony, having right to speak, feel and live.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're looking for an informative Civil Rights movie, this probably isn't for you. Although the movie does give its viewers a good idea of some civil rights issues during the 60s, I think that the dramatization takes away from the history of the era. It's more of a drama about relationships, than a historical film. The movie revolves around Skeeter, a white journalist, searching for black maids who are willing to share their stories with her. I thought it was interesting to learn about the crucial role that the maids played in the families that they worked for. They practically raised the children, and yet they were treated horribly and received very little pay. Despite my interest in the maids' stories, the "white savior" aspect of the movie bothered me. Skeeter rescued the maids, and in the end she advanced in her career as a journalist when she earned her dream job. Although it is powerful and interesting, I think that the movie is a bad representation of important history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is an extraordinary film that makes the viewer laugh, cry, and has every minute of their attention. Unlike some Civil Right's movies that take a more serious route, The Help is more light hearted where it ties together an "unlikely" friendship that would occur during its time period, yet is still very effective to get its moral across. Together, Skeeter's ambition, Aibileen's generous heart, and Minny's wit, spark a "revolutionary" movement across Jackson, Mississippi. The Help not does not just focus on the life of the 3 main characters, but draws attention to their help and support to main people in their lives, such as Aibileen's nurture in trying to boost little Mae Mobley's self esteem, who is imperfect to her mother, (Aibileen' tells Mae: "You is kind. You is smart. You is important"), Minny's own nurturing of her employer, Celia Foote, as well as Skeeter's attempt to nurture her relationship with Stuart. The Help is truly a beautiful film that captures the concept of equality for all, and that friendships matter solely on acceptance and care, rather than race or ethnicity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The help is a film full of emotion, and hope, telling the story of the black housemaids in southern Mississippi and their relationships with their white employers. A college graduate of Ole Miss, aspiring journalist and society woman of Mississippi, Skeeter Phalen, goes to work on a piece that evolves into a sort of exposé on the help and their relationships and feelings toward their white counterparts. Throughout the movie you are taken on a journey of highs, and lows, that is very emotion evoking. Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson are the two main maids that Skeeter gets her information and stories from, however once they start talking, many more women tell their stories as well. There is a background element of the secret that Skeeters mother is keeping about the mysterious disappearance of Skeeter's family's own housemaid which is just another one of many elements that keep you wrapped around the story and wanting more. The whole story serves as a kind of hopeful element of this time, among the tragedy that is touched on throughout the movie, it doesn't seem to focus so much highlighting the very terrible ways that whites treated their black slaves in this time, but rather on the fact that through the use of Skeete and her sympathy and interest toward the help that not all white people were terrible people back then, which serves as the element of hope for society throughout the movie. Overall I was very impressed with this film and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is interested in historical happenings of this nature, or are just in the mood for a heartwarming story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help was an amazing movie but was slightly difficult to watch at times due to the poor treatment of the colored maids and how strong of an influence society had on how they were treated. However, the movie was inspirational and brought an onslaught of many different emotions. I loved how they incorporated events such as Kennedy's assassination into the story to give a feel for the time that the movie was set in and even the struggle of Skeeter having a job instead of a husband and family which showed how people were still adjusting to women's rights. The actors and actresses did a phenomenal job of portraying the struggles of being colored as well as the ignorance and 'better than you' attitude of the white employers. The humanity of the characters was outstandingly developed and showed that during this time period, even though blacks were treated as though they were trash, their actions and emotions showed that they were faced with the same situations as whites plus had to deal with discrimination to top it all off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a wonderful and moving film. Throughout the duration of the movie, I laughed, I cried, I clapped, I cringed with discomfort and squirmed with anticipation. The range of emotions I experienced can be credited to not only the excellence of the story writing but the quality of the acting and the personality of the actors chosen to portray each role. I especially appreciated that the focus was to develop the characters of the maids as opposed to the white ladies that they worked for. This allows for a consistency between the main character's goal to write from the Negro perspective and the goal of the film itself. Unfortunately, it seems that some critics think that this film and storyline are not realistic. It has been criticized for simplifying the complex race relations and omitting the various forms of violence that characterize the time period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tells the story of black maids in the south before the Civil Rights movement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is a story about black maids in Jackson, Mississippi who are mistreated by their white bosses. However, there is a young white journalist who wants to help them by writing a collection of stories of what their life is like. Originally she has a hard time getting people to volunteer to share their stories, because it is very risky. However she manages to get lots of volunteers in the end and she published her book. Fortunately for the maids, they aren't punished because their bosses are afraid to admit that the stories are about Jackson, because there are embarrassing stories. Specifically about how one of the bosses ate a pie made out of her maids poop. This is a great movie for seeing how African Americans were mistreated in the South for so long. It is ridiculous that the whites believe that they can't use the same toilets as blacks because they carry certain disease, yet they allow them to take care of their children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over all the movie I thought had a touching message and was brilliantly acted by all the actors that portrayed these characters. As a movie based of a book I say that they followed the book pretty well. The reason this movie did not get a perfect 10 from me will be very apparent if you look at the historical inaccuracy of the book. Although the movie does portray a broad range on the 1960 from Jim Crow laws to the KKK and even Kennedy's assassination it down played the way living in Mississippi in the 1960's would have been like. Instead of showing the horrificness of killing, rape, abuse, lynching and racial slurs it was substituted by mean hose wife's who crated drama. Although maid at that time were a lot closer the the children then their own mothers were it doesn't excuse the fact of the movie tiptoeing around what it was actually like down south. Another thing that they hovered around was the maids telling the story knew and told of why it was dangerous but the sense of the physical danger they could face was missing. Overall it was a well casted movie and very touching storyline but not historically portrayed well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's a nuanced depiction of a certain aspect of American racial segregation (domestic 'help' provided by black women to white families) on the journey into the civil rights movement.Unlike other films on this topic, this isn't a dark or unsettling movie. None of the characters meet a tragic demise. The Hell is moving, yes and doesn't shy away from realism, but it's produced in an upbeat, often very funny, style.In fact some of the scenes are laugh out loud funny. There's a brilliant, pivotal moment where the disturbing practice of getting black women to go outdoors when they need the toilet, is turned into a hilarious opportunity to humiliate a domineering white socialite.It was also nice to see a film in which all the lead actors and the main supporting actors were female. I thought they all played their parts perfectly, including a deserved Oscar-winning performance by Octavia Spencer.This is a great little gem of a movie that really surprised me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie about discrimination in the South</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very good movie. It was interesting to see what's life was like for African- Americans back then and what they had to go through. It was crazy that they were treated that way and that they couldn't even use the same toilets because they thought it would spread disease. It was cool and inspirational to see how one person could make a difference just by telling other people about what it was like. It was also strange to see how dangerous it was just to share their experiences and how it could have very serious consequences. It was inspirational though that they were brave and did it anyways, especially Skeeter who didn't really have anything to gain by challenging the norm. Overall it was a very good movie, even though it was pretty sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thought this film, there are many main ideas that bring out the reality of the Solid South during the times of civil rights and integration. Although the reality of the South was much worse than the movie portrays, I believe the movie carries out all the ideas it involves with great proficiency. The Help shows an attitude of love even towards those who hate and hurt those you love and even yourself. It shows a persevering way of life and creates an environment of hardships and despair with JFK's assassination and the death of the main characters son, to demonstrate how awful life was, especially for African Americans, in this time. Furthermore, nonviolent ways of life is shown, allowing the historical fact that nonviolent actions were what changed generations (ie, the actual book The Help written in the movie). Overall, I greatly appreciate the timeline and plot of this movie and find it to be incredibly inspiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about the fight for equality and an end to African American discrimination through the eyes of a young white southern woman and two African American cleaning ladies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is an inspiring movie about African American discrimination and is based on the book by Kathryn Stockett. It goes through the lives of numerous people in Jackson, Mississippi. Although the transition from book to movie isn't perfect, the writers did a good job at including all the story lines and characters, showing the importance of each one no matter how little a role they had. A really emotional part was when Aibileen had to say goodbye to Mae Mobley at the end of the movie, knowing that she was the only good influence in the girl's life and that her mother wasn't able to take care of her the way she deserved. This scene was put together well and had just as much emotion in it as it did in the novel. The writers did a good job at showing the struggles Aibileen and Skeeter faced when trying to coordinate and get together to write the book about the poor conditions of "The Help" in white households. Overall, this movie is a good representation of what African Americans had to go through in the early to mid 1900s and I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help is more than just a "Good Movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help, before it was turned into a movie, was a great book. Though it painted the conditions of the South during this era in clean, easily digestible strokes, it told a great story of life in that situation.The movie, on the other hand, was more than just a great story. It payed justice to the book, and then some. The actresses and actors did a fantastic job fleshing out the characters, and giving more depth into their character development. They gave them a new life, picking up the few two-dimensional characters and turning them into characters we could sympathize and identify with.My only issue is that the movie leaned on the portrayal of a "great white savior." It plays on the fact that "only the young white girl can offer salvation", and also leans on some stereotypical caricatures that Hollywood is all to fond of using. Altogether though, it was a good story, with both comedic and tragic parts. I would recommend the book, though, before the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After some resistance, Skeeter is able to record the testimonies of several African American women who work as "the help" for white, Southern families. They reveal how they are treated as well as the secrets of the families they work for. This film in set in the 1960's Civil Rights era. It is two-sided in that it shows there were white families and people that were in favor for equal treatment of African Americans. The film is able to convey messages of equality in an uplifting tone through use of comic relief. The scenery of Mississippi provides beautiful views throughout the film. Emma Stone is a fun character and seems really genuine with the interviewees. Viola Davis (who plays Abileine, a maid) is an amazing actor making the film more realistic. In summary, I would recommend this film to those who are interested in historical films as well as people who enjoy Emma Stone as an actor.</fullReview>

Just like everyone else, I agree that this is a great cast, many of them delivering subtle and powerful performances. Although there are sad moments, heartbreaking moments, there are also very funny moments too. You can feel humanity resonating here and there. The story is not dark. There is hope, there is a trust in the good side of people, a warm feeling from friendship and humanity that comfort your heart a whisper that says "love will conquer in the end." The villain, Hilly, was an excellent example of the pharisees and their hypocrisy.She presents herself as the most godly woman in the community but actually she is the most godless person among them. Hilly is presented in contrast with Celia, who is a little crazy and unmannered, but very sincere and sweet. This film shows us love, hatred, patience, honesty, courage, and after all...love your enemy. :)</fullReview>

It's the Disney version - meaning it's not gritty and raw - it's neat and clean, meant to not offend anybody but the everything is there even when it's only hinted.The movie's long, over 2h30, but it has a lot of ground to cover and before I looked it up I didn't even thought it was that long. It can only mean that it is a smooth experience. I don't mean smooth as in it's a blend, monotonous movie because it's not, you are pulled into the story and get emotionally invested without getting too riled up - it's Disney after all.The source material is good but the cast really did an amazing job.

		<fullReview>I guess the movie achieved what it aimed to achieve: to make me care about the subject, to make me upset, and to make me hate our American ancestors a little bit more. But hating is OK in this case, because it's a proof that I truly enjoyed this movie.The director takes us to Mississippi, around the time of the Mad Men. Although, in this case, it's all about their wives, their lifestyles and the silly habits they developed to look like they have a happy life and a perfect family. The reality though is that around the house, they owe everything to their black maids. A group of hard working and lovable African-Americans, who have to put up with humiliations and hardships on a daily basis, in the fear of losing their jobs. However, a glow of hope presents itself for these ladies: a young and courageous white author who was raised by one these maids decides to take action and sets to publish a book about their stories for the world to read. But will the maids overcome their fear to tell the world what they are going through, or will they carry on with their lives as if nothing was happening? Two of them find the bravery to talk, and that's how we get to discover the social differences of those years and the ridiculous contradictions from a time when no contact was wanted with black people, yet you allowed them to raise your own children! You didn't let them use your bathroom, yet you let them cook and touch your food, etc?All these elements of injustice are the perfect ingredients to make for a touching and often upsetting movie, but it does find ways to be amusing, and it's super entertaining from the word go. I honestly laughed more than I was angry. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I am willing to say that i would have loved for the movie to last a little longer. Watch it.

		<fullReview>The help is a movie about a girl who wants to be a journalist and who writes a book based on the experiences of the black maids that work for her friends. The movie handles a difficult subject really well, bringing lightness to it, so that it won't get tiring for the audience, but, at the same time, it doesn't robes the subject off it's importance and seriousness. The story follows the lives of many characters, not only the main ones, but it doesn't gets confusing, as many movies with more than one stories to show gets, and, as I said previously, it doesn't gets tiring to watch. The performances were great and that helped a lot the film to be as good, but the set and the costumes contributed as well. There was only one thing I didn't like, and that was the ending, because it didn't keep up with the movie and got stuck into the corny happy triumph that many movies have as an ending. Other than that the Help is a great movie, so 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania."The Help" (2011) is very well made, strongly acted motion picture about things, that we usually don't see on screen. I'm not saying that intolerance, racism is something rare in pictures, but it's a rare thing to see it shown from this angle. It's not entirely gruesome or villain actually, "The Help" is a good feel type of a picture, which shows the very gentle side of that part of history, the most gentle if you ask me. But it worked for me, i was involved in characters, i was moved couple of times and that makes this picture good.Overall, 8/10 for "The Help" as i has some stellar acting (including Oscar winning role), very good directing and i say not traditionally directing, and good script. This is definitely not a gruesome look at those hard topics of our society, and therefore some are going to like this movie even better. Solid picture, definitely of those must see movies not entirely for a groundbreaking movie-making, but for the importance of the subject.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sometimes feel like Academy Award nominated films do not necessarily appeal to the masses. Some require a lot of thinking. Some require a lot of emotional commitment. The Help is so powerful because rarely is anything written by the point of view from these maids who practically raised children from the 60s while their own kids were farmed out to relatives back on their side of the tracks. Davis and Spencer were perfectly cast as two women with extremely different character traits working to fulfill the same goal. They were the perfect yin and yang and it was beautiful to see their strength and courage portrayed on the screen.That said, The Help has managed to simultaneously generate Oscar buzz while appealing to demographics across the board.Twitter @zackisthe</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The outstanding cast and engaging emotions, make The Help a must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People want to believe that they have courage, but they are unwilling to speak against social norms for fear of rejection. In The Help, Skeeter, an ambitious, white writer tries to explain what it is like for black women to serve white families during the civil rights era. Due to the social separation between the two races, she faces many obstacles in an attempt to compile stories from maids, such as Aibileen and Minny. The film does a great job of explaining the social differences at the time, while still giving the audience a deeper meaning to consider. The dialogue creates distinctions between the white and black characters through a difference in education. Although all of the characters talk with a slight southern accent, the white characters speak with sophisticated vocabulary, while the African American characters sound uneducated. The quote, "you is smart, you is kind, you is important," said by Aibileen, shows the limited education available for African Americans at the time. The way the different races talk about one another also indicates this separation. Hilly, a white housewife, insists on the necessity of separate bathrooms in houses due to the risk of catching "black diseases." The filmmakers make a point to show the different distinctions, giving the audience a better understanding of the social norms at the time. Through the use of heavy subject matter and humor, the filmmakers grab the audience's attention in an engaging way. The cruel accusations towards the maids, and brutality displayed by the white police officers, keep the film impactful, but the filmmakers incorporate humor to lift up the film's serious tone. Minny brings the humor to the film in her sassy comments. Humor is present when Minny tells Skeeter "You ain't got nothing left here but enemies in the Junior League. You done burned every bridge there is. And you ain't never gonna get another man in this town, everybody know that. So don't walk your white butt to New York, run it!" The filmmakers set the tone through serious events, but develop a more unpredictable plot by including humor. The unpredictability adds to the film's overall enjoyable story. Through the acting of Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, the audience can better understand the characters they play. Viola Davis successfully portrays her character, Aibileen Clark, as a loving, hardworking individual. Davis delivers her lines with a tired voice, suggesting that she commits herself to her job. We also get the idea that her character is good with kids by the way she lights up around her boss' child, Mae Mobley. Davis is able to change her delivery to fit the scene. Octavia Spencer entertains the audience with her sassy interpretation of Minny Jackson. Spencer does this through mannerisms, such as pursing her lips, standing with her hands on her hip, and rolling her eyes. These mannerisms that Spencer uses add to the idea that her character is very head-strong. Octavia Spencer also delivers lines in a loud, bold manner. When Skeeter is interviewing Aibileen, Minnie storms into the scene and states, "And just what makes you think colored people need your help? Why you care?" Octavia does not hesitate before she delivers this line, adding to the confidence of her character. These actresses add believability to the film with their genuine portrayals of their roles. This film sets a precedent for future films discussing controversial topics such as the treatment of African Americans. This movie is not only entertaining, but it also sparks thought about how the audience treats others. It plays with the audience's emotions to ignite a passionate response to the subject of the movie.</fullReview>

Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and other great actors form the cast. It is set in Mississipi, USA, in the 1960s (during the African-American Civil Rights Movement). The plot tells the story of a white young woman called Skeeter (Emma Stone) who is a journalist. Skeeter decides to write a book about the point of view of the black maids, showing the racism that they suffered at white people's house where they worked. To write her book, Skeeter get the help of Aibileen (Viola Davis) and other black maids. Skeeter and the maids end up suffering reprisals because of the book."The Help" is an amazing film that can make you laugh and cry because of the emotional stories that are told. It shows how complicated the relationships between black and white people were in the 1960s, and shows how silly some people can be because of the racism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is a film adaptation of the novel of the same title by Kathryn Stockett. It features an ensemble cast that includes Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jessica Chastain, Sissy Spacek, Mike Vogel, Cicely Tyson and Allison Janney. The movie was adapted for the screen and directed by Tate Taylor. The film is about a young white woman, Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, and her relationship with two black maids, Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson during Civil Rights era America in the early 1960's.The three very different, extraordinary women in Mississippi build an unlikely friendship around a secret writing project that breaks societal rules and puts them all at risk. From their improbable alliance a remarkable sisterhood emerges, instilling all of them with the courage to transcend the lines that define them, and the realization that sometimes those lines are made to be crossed-even if it means bringing everyone in town face-to-face with the changing times.Though arguably guilty of glossing over its racial themes, the film rises on the strength of its cast.Outstanding performances and a delicate approach to racial tensions make this film a cut above other inspirational period dramas.Aimed at heart and conscience, it may have overdone moments but remain worthy of close attention.Perfectly written, acted, directed, and produced, it's as moving on its fiftieth viewing as on its first.Definitely,the best film of the year when it was released.</fullReview>

The good 'White Folk' are evil doers when it comes to matters of race, and the blacks are all angelic good innocent victims.

		<shortDescription>Enough to be really good, but not really great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are only three films I saw that ever reached the same level of greatness as did the books they were based on: "To Kill a Mockingbird," "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," and "The Exorcist." Coming close, but just missing were "Jaws" (no fairy-book ending for Richard Dreyfus's character in the book) ? and "The Help."Yes, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer do a fabulous job. Yes, Emma Stone is vivacious, spirited and fetching. But Bryce Dallas Howard makes a caricature of the sinister, racist-to-the-core Hilly, and the movie never gives enough time to see the poignant turn-around Skeeter's mother accomplishes, nor lay out the real dangers the servants faced by telling tales out of school. Much of the book's comedic effect is also lost. Some great lines in the book are dropped. ("He was drunker than an Indian on payday".) Celia's white-trash ferocity as she possibly saves Minny's life was also skipped over, diminishing an already diminished role in the movie. These are just a few of the several disappointments with the cinematic version, none of them fatal to the experience, but letdowns nonetheless.Still, this film can't help but satisfy because the book it is based on is so incredibly strong, and the times it depicts are so indelibly emotional. Wisely, the movie takes full advantage of being able to do what a book cannot; the real-life footage of the Medgar Evers murder, TV clips of civil rights marchers being beaten, the rousing news reels of Martin Luther King ? all hit on a gut level where a book cannot, especially for those of us who lived through them and saw them first-hand.My overall advice: See the movie first ... then really treat yourself by reading the book. One is a great appetizer; the other is the full meal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the books' sense of urgency.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched The Help, almost immediately after finishing the book. Now, when comparing The Film to The Book it was based on (generally speaking), one major rule of thumb almost always applies: The Book is better. The Help is no exception.Accordingly, with the novel still so fresh in the back of my mind, separating my mind from the book in order to enjoy the film was an almost impossible task. No matter how hard you try, you just can't quit comparing the two, nitpicking every detail and being frustrated with everything they changed. Nevertheless, I was still able to enjoy the film for what it was, though I am glad that I possessed full knowledge of the actual story.The Help tells the story of black domestic servants in 1960's Jackson, Mississippi. It focuses on white Miss Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan, and her efforts to give a voice to black maids by writing their stories from their perspective and thus giving them an opportunity to be heard for the first time in their lives. Among the black women, Aibileen and Minny are the two key characters.So let's just get the "bad" stuff out of the way. One of the elements in the novel that I enjoyed the most was the incredibly delicate bond of trust and understanding that builds up (over an extensive period of time) between Aibileen and Skeeter. It really does take Skeeter a long time before she finally wins Aibileen over and convinces her to share her deepest feelings with a white woman. In the film, this process felt rather rushed, like Aibileen just woke up the next morning and decided to do it. What bothers me about this is not just the fact that (oh, cliché) it was "better" in the book, but mostly because the film forgets to underline WHY it took so long. Not only is it much more clearly explained in writing that these black women face an incredible danger in divulging their true feelings about the white women they work for, the film also fails to capture the palpable tension and sense of urgency of the book. These women aren't just risking their jobs, they are risking their lives, AND the lives of their loved ones. They're in danger just for being seen talking to a white lady. I found this to be a rather big flaw of the film.The film also lacks a lot of the character development I was hoping for. Quite a few character changes were made, so that in the film they all just kind of appear out of nowhere, and more or less seem to go about their business without ? again ? the big "why" of it all. One of the most underexposed characters was a woman named Celia Foote, who is a poor white trash girl who married way out of her league ? and because of it, has to face the constant disgrace and condescension from the other stuck-up, "sophisticated" white ladies. Celia is just the sweetest, loveliest person in the entire story, and her relationship with her maid Minny is heart warming. The fact that they barely included this in the film is a real shame.OK ? if I keep comparing the film to the book, this review will never reach its end. Obviously, there is a lot more I could (and certainly want to) say, but it's not really relevant to the effectiveness of this review. So, moving on.At least they got the actors right! Each and every one of them was cast spot-on to their character. Emma Stone is wonderful as Skeeter ? capturing her youthful daring and naiveté perfectly. There's also something about her voice and attitude that make it clear that this girl is different from her snooty bridge club peers. Viola Davis is the perfect Aibileen ? all I kept thinking was, damn, she should have gotten that Oscar. Her performance is very moving and heartfelt. Octavia Spencer did actually win an Oscar for her role as Minny, and it was well deserved. She is exactly as I imagined Minny to be ? sassy, smart-mouthed and with an attitude that could render any white woman speechless, even if it means losing her job a dozen times. Celia Foote is played by Jessica Chastain, and I fear I'm at risk of doubling over in superlatives to describe how perfect she was, so I'll just leave it at this.The Evil Witch in this story is Hilly Holbrook, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. I'm not sure how big of a compliment it is to say that she is very good at playing a snide, cunning racist ? so let's just say she is a very good actress. Another actress worth mentioning is Allison Janney, who plays the role of Skeeter's mother. Though she is not quite like I imagined her the way she was in the book (there we go again...), I always enjoy her performances very much and this one's no exception. Oh, and Sissy Spacek plays Hilly's mother, and she is a delight to watch. I got the feeling that the director extended her role to a little more than what it was in the book, just to give her more screen time. I don't blame him.Overall, the film is properly paced and reasonably well-constructed, though some creative liberties are taken here and there considering the timeline. In comparison to the book, it is a little disappointing, but I can't think of a single book-to-film adaptation where this wasn't the case.I still rate The Help 8 out of 10, because I think it is an important story to be told and the performances are stellar, but if you have a little more patience, I strongly recommend reading the book instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With a cast of fascinating characters at its center and a strong screenplay to accompany it, "The Help" does a great job at showing the importance of expressing one's self</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most important reasons why writing in general is a very good life skill is because it is one of the many ways in which we can express ourselves and tell everyone else how we are feeling and explain why we are feeling this way. Editorials and reviews on certain subject matter, like what you are reading right now, are great examples of writing on a personal level. Sometimes, it's definitely tough doing so given the backlash you think you will get from what you write. In the end, it's good to express issues and concerns from both sides regarding a certain issue. A great example of a film that demonstrates the importance of this theory effectively is Tate Taylor's racial drama, "The Help". The film is set in Mississippi in the early 1960's and centers around a young white college graduate (Emma Stone) who has just landed a job as a journalist. When she has learned that her favorite childhood maid (Cicely Tyson) has quit working for her family and notices that her friend (Bryce Dallas Howard) has an extremely negative attitude about African-American maids, she decides that she wants to write a book about the lives of these maids and learn more about what they undergo on a daily basis. Among the maids who agree to share their experiences with her are a maid (Viola Davis) who has lost her son and forms a special bond with the daughter of the white woman she works for, and another maid (Octavia Spencer) who is a good cook but has an unfortunate reputation of being fired frequently due to her back talk. The biggest reason why I enjoy "The Help" as much as I do is really because of the ensemble cast and the characters they play. Emma Stone is a very likable actress and I enjoy her in most of the films she's in, but I think that this is probably her finest role yet. On top of the fact that she successfully proves that she's capable of this sort of dramatic acting, her character is interesting as well since her motivations regarding why she is writing this book make her credible. In fact, I'd like to see Stone in more dramatic roles in the future rather than in comedic roles like in "Easy A" or "Crazy, Stupid, Love." since I know she's got great potential and has good looks to accompany it. I also thought Viola Davis gave an exceptional performance in this picture and her relationship with the daughter of whom she works for was very well handled. I liked the connection that they shared and that the kid liked spending time with her more than she enjoys being with her actual mother. This relationship also effectively demonstrates the struggles African-American maids have with raising the kids of white housewives and how it affects them emotionally. Bryce Dallas Howard seems to be having a blast playing the cold-hearted, racist antagonist and she's enjoying every minute of being on screen. Octavia Spencer also turns in an impressive performance as a maid who may be too honest to everyone around her, for better and worse. I also liked Jessica Chastain's performance as a Marilyn Monroe type housewife who is shunned by all the other women in the area who hires Spencer to help her with her cooking, but treats her with much more respect than anyone else who's hired her. Most of the ensemble cast which also includes Mary Steenburgen as a writing editor and Sissy Spacek as Howard's more patient mother are very good. I would be lying to my readers if I said "The Help" was without flaws since there are a few, but they're not too hurtful. One criticism is that Allison Janney's Southern accent in her role as Stone's mom is kind of obnoxious. Another criticism and probably the aspect of the film that I most could have done without is the romance between Stone and Chris Lowell as her boyfriend. This part of the film feels much more forced and sort of puts the plot to a halt. While it's not really terrible and doesn't dominate the picture at all, it was unnecessary in the plot to begin with. The main reason to see a film like "The Help" is for the sake of the talented ensemble cast and the colorful characters they bring to life. "The Help" is also well worth seeing for the main moral which inspires us that writing is an important means of expression and a way of making your points of view heard to other people. Even if you're not a fan of racial dramas, I honestly think you should check it out so you can have a better perspective of whatever overwhelming dilemmas these characters undergo.</fullReview>

I've heard about Martin Luther King Jr. and his speech but I didn't care about it...until I watched this movie due to my teacher's suggestion. "The Help" is something that I can't imagine. We have maid and some of us treat their maids well but some will not and maids in my country are somehow respected because it's difficult to find a loyal and good maid now. Those black people, they would not turn bad if their masters wouldn't treat them as a property. They are all people, we are all people. I just can't imagine how you can treat the others that bad!

		<fullReview>The Help (2011)Definitely a great movie about a writer telling the point of view of the African-American maids who works for white people in the 1960. I think the only problem with this was the begging because it was a little bit slow, but this is an excellent drama with a twist of comedy sometimes, is brilliant and really good, the performances are beyond perfection, a clever screenplay and the plot will "touch" your heart (or maybe teach you something) after seeing a little bit of what people pass in the past just for be black but also the love others can show even when they don't have to.

		<shortDescription>addressing the criticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first learned of "The Help" - having never even heard of the book - I almost immediately heard conflicting descriptions of it. The praise was that it was a thought-provoking account of the Civil Rights era. The criticism was that it gave white people most of the credit for the movement and relegated blacks to the roles of servants. Now that I've seen it, I'd say that there's some truth to both descriptions. Part of what we see is that the white employers put on the veneer of civility but clearly view the black servants as beneath them.There is the problem that the end story is basically through the eyes of a white person telling the stories of black maids, so it does seem to be giving her extra credit. But in the end, I think that the movie came out very well. Octavia Spencer - who won Best Supporting Actress for her role - is particularly good (especially when you see the trick that her character plays with the pie).The movie also forces one to think about the current state of race relations in the United States. We may have a non-white president and the younger generation may be the most colorblind, but can we be certain that racial tensions aren't simmering beneath the surface? All in all, I recommend the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Help" is ostensibly about "Skeeter" (Emma Stone, pretty, but ineffectual) a privileged, college-educated white woman in the 1960s of the American South, who decides to collect the stories of the black maids who have worked for the families of those she knows well... just as the civil rights movement is about to explode.This premise intrigues. The problem is that the focus is spread thin. There are many story lines to follow: Skeeter is the only woman in her group that isn't married, so we must keep up with her courtship with the troublesome (at first) Stuart (Chris Lowell), who is foisted upon her by her well-meaning gal pals; Charlotte (a perfect Allison Janney), Skeeter's mother, has cancer and vacillates between being sick and well; she also was responsible for firing Constantine (Cicely Tyson, who looks ancient), although we don't know that at first, so the movie "hints" at some kind of "drama" that we must wait to find out about; then there are the stories of all Skeeter's gal pals, their husbands, kids, and maids... I mean, I was exhausted trying to keep up with all of it... it was, in fact, a soap opera.Where do our loyalties lie in this movie? We often hear the voice-over of Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis), and, indeed, she is the first maid that Skeeter approaches, but she is not the star of the film and the story is not told only through her eyes. Skeeter is supposedly the "writer" in this story, and she does manage to convince a New York publisher, Miss Stein (a brilliant Mary Steenburgen in several brief scenes) that she has a story to tell... but the fact is, it is not her story. All she has done is essentially transcribe what the maids have told her. How this qualifies her to go off at the end to NYC to pursue a career as a writer escapes me. Prior to this, she stumbled into a position at the local paper covering a housekeeping how-to column, and the way she got the tips for that was by interviewing the maids! So, I'm sure she could put together a sentence, but the fact that she essentially was a transcriber does not make her a "writer." She does, thank God, divide up the royalties she gets from the book between herself and the maids that told her the stories, but, again, I don't get how she is anything more than a typist. And then we have to endure this incredibly contrived scene where Skeeter, despite her offer to go to NY to pursue her dream of being a writer, tells Minny and Aibileen that she isn't going to go, because she has to stay there to "be with them" considering all the "trouble" she's created. Give me a break--like what would she do? Shelter them in a basement? And then, at the end, as Aibileen walks away from her last job and reflects on her life and how she always thought there would be a writer in her family--her son (who was murdered), states in her final VO that in fact SHE was the writer... and that is by virtue of the fact that she "wrote down" her stories that she ended up telling to Skeeter. If Skeeter had really wanted to "help" them, she would have submitted Aibileen's stories to Ms. Stein instead of "copying" them. Honestly, what did Skeeter write? Nothing original as far as I could tell. The most interesting storyline of the film, to me, was between Minny and Celia (a perfect Jessica Chastain), the white trash girl who married good. The scenes between them were touching and earnest and heartfelt. Race lines were crossed; it was really the story about two women helping each other through difficult moments. I could have watched an entire film just about the two of them.Another revelation is Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly Holbrook, who is obviously the Queen Bee of Skeeter's gal pal group. She is convincingly racist, cruel, elitist, snobbish and completely self-centered. It was a pitch perfect performance, as was Sissy Spacek's as her mother, who has a touch of Alzheimer's, but not enough to keep her from putting Hilly in her place. A special mention must be given to Leslie Jordan who plays Skeeter's irritable boss Mr. Blackly. It's quite clear that he can deliver a punchline with the best of them; he got me howling in short order with his eye- rolling, sarcastic blasts, not to mention his amazing somersaults later on in the film (a completely unexpected scene).Still, the film belongs to Octavia Spencer. She was hysterically funny (effortlessly), could go from dramatic to sad to desperate to joyful--hell, she could just about summon up any emotion asked for her at a moment's notice. In reading the script, I could see that she took some lines that could have been delivered flatly by other actresses and gave them a life that I can't imagine that even the screenwriter had thought of. I really hope that she will not get the "Oscar curse" and will be rewarded with challenging roles that will take advantage of her gifts. I will gladly follow her career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as I'd heard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film begins with Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) giving a brief insight into the lives herself and her community who work, for the most part, as domestic staff for the white elite of Jackson, Mississippi. How she's spent most of her life raising white children and how she'd recently lost her own son. And Minnie, her friend, (played by Octavia Spencer) loses her job due to an inability to abide by unjust rules and hold her tongue as she's expected to.Meanwhile, Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan (played by Emma Stone) has returned home from college with a degree and plans to use it. An idea that is lost on her friends and family who saw college as a means to an end in their quest for suitable husbands who could support them and their future children in the manner they've become accustomed to thanks to their upbringing. And while Skeeter(Stone) finds a job writing a column about cooking and other matters she has little to no expertise on and a valuable resource for the column in Aibileen (Davis), she soon finds her real passion in chronicling the life, times, and injustices of African American domestic servants in Jackson.I've heard the criticisms leveled on this film and, in all honesty, they're not wrong. It's depiction of racism is, for the most part watered down or rose-colored. And the film's main antagonist is a twitchy social butterfly whose only real power is her standing. That might make sense if her near-senile mother weren't heckling her in the background during those important social events. It is funny, the characters that are the actual focus of the film are endearing and the conclusion is satisfying enough without being too far-fetched to be believable.</fullReview>

However, I still though it was a good film, since:1 - Emma Stone is hot. 2 - The acting was very good, despite the poorly constructed characters. 3 - I find racism a very interesting subject.The United States is a country which had a very interesting cultural phenomena: systematic racism between ethic groups. And I like movies that portray this phenomena, such as this one. Even though from a technical point of view, I should have given this film a 4/10 or 5/10, since it is really mediocre and I wouldn't recommend it for someone who harbors no interest in racism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help is Watchable And Refreshing But A Little Too Simplistic in Portraying Racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The society we live in has a deep impact on what we wear, how we think, where we go etc. The moment your thoughts or behavior begins to veer away from the society's, you get the evil eyes, the dirty looks and the stinging scoffs and only with determination and perseverance can you change the viewpoint of the people around you. In The Help, Charlotte played by Allison Janney regrets firing her maid Constantine under pressure from the society. An incident parallel to this happens towards the end of the film with Aibileen, Hilly and Elizabeth, with Elizabeth reminding us of Charlotte, Aibileen reminding us of Constantine and Hilly of that supercilious lady who pressurized Charlotte to fire her maid. Hilly however is very young unlike that lady, but her influence is equally powerful over the society.The outcome of the two events is different: in the first case, the bad lady wins outrightly, but in the second case, it isn't Hilly's win but Aibileen's. What's also interesting here is the effect of the two incidents on the babies ? while in the first case, a rebellious Eugenia supports the help unflaggingly when she grows up, we are not sure what little Mae will do once she grows up. But we hope for the positive, especially with the civil rights movement underway. In this sense, the dominant yellow in the poster of 'The Help' signifies hope, and the universal presence of women in the film indicates the impact of women, who are closest to the help, in bringing a change.The Help is pretty homebound in addressing racism as it tells about an aspiring author's efforts in writing a book about the living conditions and experiences of the African American maids of the South from their point of view. She begins her work by interviewing her close friend's help clandestinely and gradually getting support from the other African- American maids as the Civil Right Movement intensifies. The author- reporter Eugenia Skeeter is played by Emma Stone, while the help is led by Aibileen (played by Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer). The main problem with 'The Help' is that it does not venture a step further, and the only thing we know about Civil War from the movie is that it was going on and things were bad. The role of men is left out entirely or kept bare minimum, and this may keep away most men from watching the movie. It would certainly have been more interesting if the involvement of men in the issue had been considered to a larger extent. Leaving this out, what I disappointed me was the film's approach towards racism itself. The 'commode' and 'Minny's pie' were two trivial issues that were taken as the main motifs in the film. We have Hilly as the nemesis who screams out 'I AM A RACIST!' and seems like a caricature than an actual character. Does she not have anything to do except thinking about ways and means to demean her help? Viola Davis' presence uplifts the film from becoming another entertaining middling dramedy but her lifelike approach contradicts the satirical approach by the other actors. The latter is especially visible during the climactic scene between Davis' character Aibileen and Bryce Dallas Howards' Hilly, when Aibileen reproaches Hilly's bitchy, manipulative and racist nature by slandering her as a 'godless woman'; as Hilly is more like a caricature of a petulant racist mean girl, the weight of those words did not apply much to her. A 'godless woman' would've been more effective had there been more seriousness in the character of Hilly. I remember how the characters in American Beauty successfully evolved from being simple caricatures towards the end, and so find it slightly disappointing that almost everyone apart from Viola Davis remains somewhat gimmicky throughout 'The Help'. She should've gotten a suitable script that did justice to the humanity she brings to her role. It was majorly because of Davis that many audiences and critics failed to notice the schmaltz and maudlin in parts of the script and this irks me because another film 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' was lambasted by critics for its sentimentality even though it, to me, did adequate justice (at least in Hollywood sense) to the subject. It also surprises me that she was nominated for Best Actress when her role was supportive, and she would've had far better chances of winning had she been nominated for the appropriate category. Octavia Spencer was wickedly funny as the sassy Minny, but she was selling her punch-lines like the comedian Octavia (she's done a lot of comedy, including in a Disney Show) instead of a sassy Minny speaking the dialogs, so it was more of a show rather than an act. Chastain as Celia Foote reminded me of a ditsy Marilyn Monroe, especially during the party scene but it was silly to nominate her for this movie instead of 'Tree of Life'. The Help is a very watchable film, but falls short of effectively depicting the situation of African Americans in the South during the 50s in the time of Civil war; it does however manage to convey the influence of society on individuals. More importantly, we see how writing and speech helped in giving voice to the African Americans.My Rating: 6.3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Help" is one for the Ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the movie because it followed a logical sequence that captured the genuine vernacular of the period. The attitudes of the characters in the movie are not fictitious; they represent the real attitudes of an oppressing group. The condescending stereotypes and attitudes did not die with the end of the era, some of the accompanying lifestyles did. Some of the families who employed house cleaners and other domestic help were not rich or even middle class people. They under paid their help with sub-minimum wages and expected much more return than investment. They enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle at the expense of the black domestic workers who served for little pay. The most important aspect of "The Help" is the moral implications of how domestic workers affected the lives of the children they raised, befriended, and loved. Despite the mistreatment they often endured, many of the workers attached themselves emotionally and the families rarely reciprocated. Some of the young children identified with the domestic service providers more than they could relate to their own biological parents. The maids often instilled a strong sense of self-esteem and a proud, but healthy, confidence into the children they raised for white people while they struggled to do the same at home. The dichotomy between their surrogate roles within white homes and their reality often produced major psychological torture and emotional turmoil. The same superior attitude that demands special privilege and entitlement prevails today, but the issue is no longer just black and white nor is it confined to the South. "The Help" dares to scratch the surface that illustrates a mild realization of the actual degradation imposed upon an innocent cross section of American society. I highly recommend this movie to every American who likes history, especially in light of our society's preoccupation and fascination with many aspects of the lifestyles of the rich and famous. This movie will serve as moral tonic and a dose of reality for families and school aged children old enough to understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The American Civil Rights Movement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last week we watched a film which was absolutely amazing and made a great contribution to our general knowledge. We can mention some data: Title: The Help Genre: Drama Author: Tate Taylor; kathryn Stockett Director: Tate Taylor Actors: Emma Stone, Viola Davies, Octavia Spencer Characters: Skeeter, Aibileen, Minnie Plot: During the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960's, Skeeter decided to write a book detailing the African American maids' point of view on the white families for which they worked. The most important thing was the hardships they go through every day. Aibileen and Minnie were brave enough and they could demonstrate how they were treated by the white people. They made a big change. Reflection: Through the film and the text we read, we learned how black people were treated in 1960's. Racism and discrimination were the most important themes of that period. The film showed us that if you really want something, you have to fight for it no matter the consequences. It also taught us to love our enemy, not to fight with violence. The best way to overcome any problems is praying for them. White and Black people are the same, because we were created by God with the same dignity. For that reason, we have to love and respect each other. This film is worth seeing because we can learn many values.(This review is published with permission from my students' parents as the result of classwork done with this movie's plot and messages.

However, this movie is actually fantastic. It made me laugh, it made me cry and it made me shake my head in disgust that human beings were ever treated in this manner. The film had a strong political and social message throughout without actually making it intrusive. Instead, the excellent characterisation engages to the extent that you almost miss them when the end credits finish. You care what happens to these women. This shows racism for exactly what it is: completely ridiculous, cruel and disgusting. If you cannot see humanity in others, you lack it in yourself.

		<fullReview>Very well made with a nicely paced plot that always keeps the audience interested. Some great performances also add to the enjoyment; Emma Stone played the inquisitive graduate, Skeeter Phelan with great assurance. Viola Davis as the central character Aibileen Clark was really excellent, as was Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson. Bryce Dallas Howard was also first-rate as the main villain of the piece, Hilly Holbrook. I also thought that Jessica Chastain as Celia Foote did an excellent job.A film that has a real feel-good factor, it very much concentrates its focus on things from the perspective of the women, on both sides of the story, but in particular the maids. I found there were some very touching moments along with quite a lot of humour. It's set at a time and place where a lot of things were changing very rapidly, particularly in the aspect of race relations and you can see a lot of ignorance and bigotry. I should point out that not all the employers are bad; there are one or two stories that relate how the maids were cared for very well.

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Tale About Rural Southern United States</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed watching 'The Help' as films on historical data has always been of interest to me. What I find frightening is how this appears 'new' to most people, the treatment of house servants during those days when in reality people chose to ignore the issue. Bringing light to it now doesn't justify the actions by these so-called prominent families. What I find most disturbing were some references that their maids were considered like members of the family. Sadly this just isn't so. A member of the family would sit at the dining room table with the family sharing a meal. You would go visit a family members home. You would shop in public with a member of the family. A member of the family would be introduced as a 'relative' and not as 'Minny or Abileen my maid' and told to go fetch Mrs. So and So a glass of iced tea. No, these women aren't 'like a member of the family'. They are your employee.Separate but equal. A phrase that most people in the South considered to be a fair comment. There was nothing equal when it came to race relations in those days.As for the movie, I like how certain references to events were named such as the assassination of President Kennedy and Medger Evers and what transpired in the town of Jackson during those events. The clothes and styles of that era were remarkable and the acting was on point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb bittersweet film about how human failings may be overcome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film is set early in the nineteen sixties when race matters were at a nadir, it carries so much that is good about human nature and how we can all help to overcome absurd hatred of our fellow human beings. The film does not pull its punches preferring to hold our attention through profound and enlightened observation of the characters we find in Jackson, Mississippi. The central theme is one of black maids (the help) bringing up white children and it is in this context we see the kind of loyalty, love and affection we are not necessarily expecting.The film has pathos in abundance as we witness the hostility and contempt that is shown towards the maids by their white employers. But there are exceptions to the rule and it is through these we witness the building of bridges between adults as well as children. Built firmly upon drama and strong comedy too, the script keeps us totally immersed in the characters, whether we like them or loathe them. And the acting and direction is as good as it gets, regardless of who you want to talk about.Although it is a long film (two hours and twenty minutes) no shot is wasted and no loose ends left by the film's conclusion. But its greatest success is the chemistry between the characters which is so uncannily profound we can feel it, touch it, see it and hear it. It is so very close to eavesdropping on real events. Full marks to the casting crew then. And this is one of those films that allows you to make up your own mind about what you should think and feel, for whilst it observes very profoundly it does not try to condition. It simply places facts on the table of life and leaves the questions and answers for you to work on.Of its type it is the best film I have seen in a decade or more and I urge you to see it.Full marks because it warrants no less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A noble message and a great cast makes an excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Racism is nothing new. It has been around for several millennia. Films about this topic are almost delivered as much as adaptations of Marvel comics. Of such films, I have only seen two fairly decent ones about racism in the south. These are "To Kill a Mocking Bird" and "A Time to Kill." "The Help" marks the third one on the list. This movie takes a different perspective from the norm. Its focus is through the eyes of a young aspiring writer and a group of maids that work in southern homes. This movie is not down and ugly like "Mississippi Burning" or "A Time to Kill." Nor is there any suspense, action, or death. It is presented as a drama with strong bits of humor, emotion, and sadness.People fail to realize that racism is something that is taught from generation to generation. For centuries, blacks were always seen as lower than the white citizens. It is not by choice; it is what they know. The unfortunate thing is that people choose not to change these ideals. White people in the South are not evil; they are ignorant to see African-Americans as human beings. This is the central theme to this movie and it makes it great.In addition with a great message, "The Help" has properly the greatest ensemble cast of 2011. Viola Davis gives a subtle, but stellar performance Aibleen Clark. It is more than obvious that her character is in pain, yet wields strength and courage in a world full of bigotry. Octavia Spencer as her friend Minnie is easily the most likable character. She has her way with people who cross her (beware of her pies). However, she presents herself as a strong-willed character that is smart and funny; she can take a matter head-on and succeed. Emma Stone pales in comparison between Davis and Spencer, but she makes her character her own. She is not afraid to stand up for what she believes in?which certainly adds in giving her a solid performance. Other noteworthy roles include: Jessica Chastain, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Chris Lowell.The sets, costumes, and cinematography seems a little limited, giving it a more TV movie look rather than a feature film. This isn't bad though?the theme and cast are enough to sell this movie as a success. However, I was little disappointed in the ending.

		<fullReview>I am no critic to read the book and then watch the movie and list out the discrepancies. I do read a book if i enjoy the movie, if i felt something was out of place and could have been better in the original form.As for The Help, i don't have to read the book to understand the plight of colored people in the most bigoted state in US. It's a movie that has all the center characters play a pivotal role and it's hard to draw a line between lead actress and supporting actress. And everyone has played their part exceptionally well.Octavia Spencer is the one that impressed me with her "sassy-mouthing"; Viola Davis with her bereavement and a will to survive without a son despite the prejudice; Bryce Howard for her Holier-than-thou attitude and if one asked me if the character Skeeter was in some way impressive, i would say "Nay!". Everyone else seemed to fit the role except for Emma Stone.The movie is powerful in the way it brings out a overtly denied truth of discrimination, set in the time when the movement culminated. Minny Jackson provides the much needed humor with her "sassy-mouthing" and Octavia Spencer totally deserved the Oscar.And now it's time to do justice to the literature; to read the book the movie was based on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Tradition is the illusion of permanence"......Woody AllenSometimes traditional bad behavior does not change unless it has no choice. Like making it against the law. The only thing unlawful in the time this movie is set, is talking or writing about this bad behavior, that is not only legal but the respectful norm. Laws, by the way, written by people who engage and revel in it and have the audacity and the self righteousness to enforce it on others.Occasionally we need a movie or a book like this. Not to pass on guilt or to make money on emotional anguish, but just to remind us that we have evolved. We are reminded of a time when, we saw what could be called destructive traditional beliefs that were not right, or used to enrich those who perpetuated the paradigm for selfish and hateful reasons, evaporate and rise to a more healthful and heartfelt heaven.It reaffirms that reform can happen. That good can win out over evil. ("you are a Godless person Miss Hilly" the maid cries). All we have to do is want to be better and that means we can have a dream and make it come true.</fullReview>

She wants to be a writer and comes up with an idea to write a book with tales from the town's maids. The story takes place in Mississippi at a time when it was illegal to even think about civil rights. So, Skeeter meets the maids in secret.So, the book is about the stories and how Skeeter is ostracized for not being as racist as most people in town.

The film is charged with personal, societal and racial conflicts adding several layers to its plot. The dialogue is rich with Southern dialects and colloquialisms.

		<fullReview>This is the first time that I am attempting to write a well analyzed review for A MOVIE AND ABOUT HOW THIS MOVIE MADE ME LAUGH AND CRY. The Help according to me is one of the best movies to have come out in recent times. Right from the performances to the storytelling everything was just next to PERFECT. There are moments in the movie when you will cry and there are moments when you will laugh and isn't that what storytelling is all about. The movie is about how the African American maids were treated during the time of the civil rights movement But the movie has so many layers that it hits at so many levels. Most of the stories in the movie are about how there existed discrimination during that time and how the African American COLORED maids were treated by the families they worked for but it also gives beautiful examples of some employers being good to their maids and a different kind of discrimination which exists for a girl who has just gotten married rich and is considered WHITE TRASH. So you see discrimination in so many forms: discrimination because of skin color, discrimination because of wealth and other forms. The relationship these maids have with the children that aren't theirs is also beautiful. There are so many scenes that move the viewer especially the one in which Constantine is fired and Cicely Tyson is just so fine in the scene where she makes an impact without even opening her mouth with no lines at all. This one is sure going to my favorites list. Please don't miss it. It would touch you at so many levels that you would feel that why you hadn't seen it earlier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few moments of lumpy throat emotion but no Cry Freedom.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I whizzed through the novel by Kathryn Stockett. It's an easy read and a couple of evenings took care of it without any great aching of the brain. It's no Tolstoy (it's not even as demanding as a Stephen King) but certainly more entertaining. The trouble is, it's popular. Very popular.And then came this; the popular, the very popular, film adaptation.I rail against the hysteria that follows a new fad, particularly films and books. I have a real aversion to being told what I must like and how much I should like it. I resisted Harry Potter for a good few years until my nieces insisted I read it to them. And then? Actually I though thought the first book was bland and distinctly average and, had it not been for the gentle urging of a respected friend, I would have stopped at book one. The Help, apparently unable to speak for itself, is another work being touted by the world's media as a great, a must-see, an Oscar certainty? It's another cinematic bandwagon laden with unthinking passengers who are enjoying the mild hysteria they're experiencing and justifying by the ever-growing mountain of awards that is burying the film.For those who walk around with their fingers in their ears, it serves up the story of a privileged white girl who, in a bid to launch her writing career, hits upon the idea of writing a book from the point of view of the slaves, sorry, the help, who keep her home, and that of all the homes of the rich white folk in the deep south of America, going. It's onto a winner from the outset and has no work to do because, let's face it, we all know that racism is evil and, for the most part, the white folk have learned that much of what they did was despicable.I entered the cinema with an expectation, and perhaps even a determined hope, if I'm honest, that the film would fail for me and I'd leave unmoved and with thoughts overloaded with disdain to hurl into this post. I left with a slightly modified view and an emotional tickling i.e. not as severe as a bashing.I strongly suspect The Help is 2012's Driving Miss Daisy, to wit, we'll shower it with accolades now but in a few years we'll realize we've been hoodwinked and, actually, it's not very good. Yes, it serves up a few good moments of lumpy throat emotion but it wasn't sufficient to make me blub. Yes, it has something to say but it lacks the impact of, say, a Cry Freedom in its day. This is a classic case of preaching to the converted and allowing us all to feel good about ourselves because we agree with the message. I'm guessing it won't reach many die-hard KKK members and therefore will have no impact on the persisting issues.But there are plenty of high points, not least of all Jessica Chastain who is rapidly becoming one of my FAIDs (Five Allowed In Dreamtime ? more on that in a later post) along with her unofficial sibling (is it only me who sees it?), Kelly Reilly. Her turn as Celia Foote is huggably engaging but, alas, she plays little more than light relief to the weightier roles Aibileen, Skeeter and Hilly. Viola Davis is sincere in her portrayal of Aibileen, the matriarch of her community, and the focal point for those handing out gongs but for me this is an ensemble piece and I don't think any actor stands out as more deserving than another. Although it may earn gold, it doesn't have gold written across it and I'll hark back to my comment about Driving Miss Daisy.Emma Stone is not the Skeeter I imagined as I read the book and she's coasting here, well below the quality and impact she previously promised in Easy A and even Zombieland. Alison Janney, yet again, enhances the group effort and Sissy Spacey has fun in a pantomime cameo.Much of the story is abbreviated for pace but the biggest cause of irritation comes at the end credits in the form of Mary J. Blige's horribly jarring song, The Living Proof, that is saccharine pulp and both too modern and too twee for a film that, despite it's lightweight failings, is a film worth spending a tenner and a couple of hours on.It's good. It's very enjoyable. It'll make you feel good about yourself for being on the side of justice. But it's a little like eating an entire loaf of white Mother's Pride toast with marmalade; it goes down perfectly but sometime after the event you'll realize there was no substance to it and you require something more, well, real. This year it earns four stars from me but I expect, if you ask me to watch it again in five years, I'll settle on three.</fullReview>

The book goes into much more detail than the film (as books always do). The film doesn't go into the depth of friendship between Skeeter and Aibeleen in the way the book does. As a film regardless of the book it is alright and worth watching. Emma Stone does a good job as Skeeter but the Hilly character is all wrong. She just isn't evil enough. Minny and Aibeleen are also well cast.Basically it's worth a watch if you haven't read the book, if you have it's not worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Outstanding film detailing the lives of maids in Jackson, Mississippi before the Civil Rights Act of 1964.The film is outstanding not only with superb performances by the ensemble cast, it details the nastiness of prejudice and how it was deeply rooted in the institutions of the old deep south. Their rules regarding the alleged place of the African-American in society were absolutely revolting, but nevertheless, must be told.When a group of maids agree to tell their stories to a young liberal aspiring writer in the town, we're in for quite a ride. Despite the fact that she was nominated for best supporting actress, Jessica Chastain, as Celia, the writer, was given top billing. She is really the black sheep of the town with her liberal attitude.A terrific film with Viola Davis leading the way as the maid who will inspire others, as well as supporting Oscar winner Octavia Spencer, who reminded me of this century's Hattie McDaniel.It was said in the film that Margaret Mitchell never allowed Mammie (McDaniel) to express her feelings. The actresses in "The Help" did just that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A celebration! A miracle that is both entertaining and lyrical.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever happened to the old-fashioned films that didn't need special effects, talking animals or huge action scenes? Relax, here's one to help you calm your nerves. The movie "The Help", based on the best-selling novel (that me and my mom read) by Kathryn Stockett, is just as lyrical and enjoyable as the book itself. Being a movie that is 146 minutes long, you have to give credit to Tate Taylor, who is not only the screenwriter and director of the film, but is also Stockett's childhood friend who definitely promised to stay true to her book without falling apart. Set in the segregated, 1960's Jackson, Mississippi, the story follows three women: 2 African-American maids, Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer, in her breakout, Oscar-winning performance) and Skeeter (Emma Stone from "Easy A"), a white college-grad who wants to be a writer, but ends up writing a cleaning column for the local newspaper. Aibileen hasn't seen much hope in her life after her son, Treelore passed away years ago. She's basically tired of working for white women who are basically racist toward the maids and don't like raising their own children. All she wants is for her stories to be told. This comes into the point of Skeeter, who had a maid, Constantine (Cicely Tyson), who disappeared years ago. She also has to have a controlling mother (Allison Janney) and doesn't want to be controlled by her or her friend Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard), who, along with her friends in the Junior League, happens to be racist as well. Skeeter comes up with an idea to write a book about what it's like for a African-American woman working as a maid. When Aibileen and Minny join this "secret" project, this proves to be a great idea by changing and breaking the rules and the society in which they lived by, angering Hilly and surprising everybody in this small Southern town. "The Help" is NOT a chick flick, to be clear. This is a movie for everybody and it is a movie that a mother and her son can enjoy together (I should know because me and my mom loved it). It has great characters, a warm heart, and something for us to believe in: Hope. I was definitely anticipated to see this movie right after I read the book and I had no idea that this movie would actually become a big hit. Now we know. The all-star cast is electrifying. Emma Stone is amazing as Skeeter. The character Hilly in the book is more of a snobby Southern diva who wants just segregation and how everything should be done her way. Bryce Dallas Howard does play it, but adds a few sides of her to show that there are some good things about her. (I basically loved her and her comeuppances). Jessica Chastain is perfect as Celia Foote, a Southern belle who is basically being shunned by Hilly and her group, but finds a friend in Minny. Now for the scene-stealers: Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. They are excellent when you see them. Davis captures her shining moment yet in her first leading role, bringing light and hope for Aibileen. Spencer is hilarious and warmhearted as Minny, who has some secrets that has to be kept somewhere secret. If there was a movie that has to be talked about other than "The Hunger Games", I choose this one because it is funny, sweet and it feels so authentic to the period and you want to be cheering for the three women for making a change and finding courage in their lives. I think this movie itself is a dream come true for anyone hoping to tell their stories. What a miraculous movie. What a celebration.</fullReview>

To remember Martin Luther King Jr: "The ultimate tragedy is not the oppression and cruelty by the bad people but the silence over that by the good people." And: "In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends." Miss Skeeter mother last words: "Courage sometimes skips a generation. Thank you for bringing it back to our family." Better one but n/one. Miss Skeeter, among the looking away cowards, stops serving the Hilly Holbrooks, thinking and acting herself. But was it not time change? The American ending: Minny as servant in a household where real humanity rules. The book a stepping stone for Miss Skeeters career in New York. And the becoming writer Aibeleen on the long way towards its goal, her long walk at the end of the movie. And the others. Ready and waiting for the urging time change. But: between the lines of the mothers kindness is still her readiness to dismiss a serving slave Constantin when she believes it is needed. And still decides the Hilly Holbrooks over Jacksons mind. Aibeleens reason to help is: 'God.' Is the preachers: "See, courage isn't just about being brave. Courage is daring to do what is right in spite of the weakness of our flesh. And God tells us, commands us, compels us to love. Amen. See, love as exemplified by our Lord Jesus Christ, is to *bent yourself in harm's way for our fellow man. And by your fellow man I mean your brother, your sister, your neighbor, your friend and your enemy. If you can love your enemy, you already have the victory" As children the white are colorblind, listening to Abi's: "You is kind, you is smart, you is important". And Miss Skeeter remembers what Constantin told her. Her mother did not choose her life, it picked her. But you, you're gonna do something big with yours. You wait and see." The movies American message is mirror clear: it depends on you what you do. The three woman as for runners: as maid, as writer, as journalist can you do it as long you do not accept on you property: "You know Hilly, if I didn't know any better, I'd say you've been eating too much 'pie'."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am really responding to the wide range of personal responses to this film. I think that when one tries to paint a works of art with one's own historical view or agenda, we lose sight of what the director/author intended. I can't abide someone criticizing a film because it doesn't depict things the way they are today. Does that negate any film with an historical base. This is a single slice of life portrayal with well meaning people using the hand dealt to them. To say that they are caricatures is really unfair. We focus in on principal characters who carry the weight of the movie. When we look at the larger picture, we see an oppressed and manipulated group that we don't see. But they are there. They just don't have the wherewithal to make change. Sometimes it would be life threatening. Granted there are some cheap thrills. The famous pie or the young white housewife and her foibles. But this makes good storytelling. It doesn't damn everybody. There are some good people and there were some good people. I personally believe the author did a superb job of creating the tension that existed. Nothing happened simply. It's also about turnabout. Let the fifties speak for themselves. Few ever had an advocate like these.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help, based off of the 2009 novel by Kathryn Stockett, tells a story of three courageous women who join together to uncover ways they are mistreated as African American housemaids in the 1960's. Taking place in Jackson, Mississippi, these types of actions were unheard of. If caught, the members of "the help" would face arrest, never be able to find work again, and be shun from the city, however this did not stop them telling their story. Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, played by Emma Stone, has just graduated from college and come back to her hometown. After scoring her first job as a cleaning advice columnist which she is clueless about, she turns to Aibileen (Viola Davis) who is the African American housemaid of an old old childhood friend. to ask for advice. In doing so, she begins to notice how poorly Aibileen and other members of the help are treated, inspiring her to write a novel though the eyes of the help. Skeeter knows the dangers this can cause for Aibileen, ignores the consequences. After much convincing, Aibileen agrees to help, eventually recruiting her best friend Minny (Octivia Spencer) and other maids to join in the fight against the cities unjust treatment of the help. The writing of this book soon becomes much more than any of the women involve could have imagined, giving each of the maids a voice as well as a chance to finally tell the world what was seldom spoken of. It transforms into an important movement that was able to change the entire city of Jackson, Mississippi and the lives of all housemaids around the state. The theme of this film focuses on racism and courage. Racism is unfortunately the more serious of the two, as it brings many back to the cruel and shameful acts placed on innocent African Americans. The film steers away from much of the hate crimes happening in the 60's, yet still shows how racism had an impact in a more subtle way. Throughout the film, the town is adamant on the idea of creating separate bathrooms in the homes of those with maids. Many scenes show Aibileen and Minny sneaking around to simply use an inside bathroom or being forced to use separate outhouses. Skeeter was one of the few who saw the wrong in this and to a chance to make a change.In a more positive light, "The Help" brings attention to the moral courage of the African American women of Mississippi. Throughout the film, Aibileen is shown patience and kindness to the most racist white families, raising their children to have respect for all people, including themselves. She works hard to make them understand their worth in the world often repeating kind works of encouragement, "you is kind, you is smart, you is important". Beyond everything else, Aibileen, Milly, and other maids show courage as they tell their stories to Skeeter, risking their freedom, their jobs, and their families, all for the sake of future generations. The movie The Help shows a true testament to the courage of the women of the past, and the limits they were willing to reach in order to stand up for what they believed in. Women, just as those portrayed in the film, have paved the way to our future. This well written storyline sends a positive message to all generations, leaving all that watch a sense of urgency to stand up for what they believe in and make a difference in what's wrong in the world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the best selling book of the same name by first time novelist Kathryn Stockett, we are transported back to a lightly fictionalized Mississippi circa 1960.This is a time when folks were either white or coloured, simplistically whites had the money, privilege and law on their side and used that power however they goddam pleased. Of course, rich white folk would need "Help" running their large houses and bringing up their children whilst they pursued more worthwhile pursuits, like Bridge and gossip.The story is fictional and focuses on a group of rich white ladies and their "negro" maids, Abileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer - Oscar winning for this role). To counterbalance the institutionalized and accepted racism clearly on view, we have Skeeter (Emma Stone), who whilst not totally convinced, is at least asking the question why everything is like it is. Skeeter acts as the modern audiences window into this strange and rapidly changing world.Skeeter is an aspiring reporter gently teasing out a story from the reluctant maids, in the hope of producing a book detailing what the "Help" really thinks of their life, work and those employing them. There are huge and life threatening risks for those involved in helping to write the book. Starvation, trumped up theft charges and worse, are all real possibilities in a world that Skeeter can never truly enter.Some employers look after their staff with respect and dignity over many years, treating them as family. However, seemingly the younger generation, do not. For many, the line between slave and employee is a fine one indeed, lives blighted or destroyed at the passing whim of a rich woman's choosing.Notable characters are Celia, ostracized and desperate to be accepted by the "in crowd" yet doomed to fail, Hilly (Howard), a vicious and small minded woman and the easily influenced Leefolt (O'Reilly). Skeeters mum (Janney) is a good woman but is tied to the past, despite her own humanity and intelligence desperately chafing at the conventions of the time.This is a film that has been embraced by book clubs, schools and history teachers and it is easy to see why. The acting is uniformly good, especially Davis and Spencer who bring a quiet dignity and respect their roles, acting as representatives for all those that had no voice at the time. Davis whose brief turn in "Doubt" with Meryl Streep, again proves her acting ability.Perhaps the most shocking realization is that this is not ancient history, such events are only fifty years ago. Separate bathrooms for "them coloreds", who may bring bring different diseases to the house and yet can be trusted with the families supposed prize possessions, their children.The film is uplifting, funny and poignant in parts although not as hard hitting as the book and does on occasion appear somewhat "airbrushed" to avoid offending current sensibilities. Whilst not a Hollywood ending, loose ends are tied better on the screen and justice seen to be done, the book exists in a more realistic shade of grey.There is much to enjoy and much to be ashamed of but overall this is film that deserves to be seen and discussed. We are never too far away from such events to take the freedoms, acceptance and tolerance that most of us enjoy, for granted.Summary A film that any audience can enjoy, serious, well intentioned albeit somewhat sanitised version of the book which in itself perhaps only scratches the surface of what life might have been like for those in service.Fine acting and a great story make this a recommended watchhttp://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two hours of painful contemporary history.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so good it's impossible to put in words all the deep feelings it aroused in me. Compassion, outrage, humiliation felt for the oppressed..., a mind-boggling experience that everybody should undergo and that, at the end of the viewing, one will come out of it with an expanded view, with a kinder comprehension about oppressed minorities. The acting is magnificent, beyond all eulogies, the solid craft --perfect script and impressive acting techniques-- employed in delineating every single character, principal or secondary is something to be seen to believe it.The recreation of the 1960s is outstanding, in every respect: colors, fashions, cars, props, the hyper feminine way women displayed at that time, shrieking and giggling like stupid Barbie dolls, the macho men all tied up in knots, and the terrible, awful, taken for granted routine of everyday living with... slaves. Black slaves, people suffering every moment of their lives the constant fear and humiliation of being exploited by white people and worse of all, being resigned to that condition. I think this movie should be required viewing in schools, not only in the USA, but all over the world. I couldn't find any flaws whatsoever in this admirable production, technical or otherwise. A perfect movie in every sense, extraordinary actors, superb director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I watched this movie, I would have said Emma Stone, who? What a great performance. A sublime performance from Viola Davis. I could mention the majority of the cast. I will have to mention Sissy Spacek; as a child I loved her performances, with this film there was no need for rose tinted spectacles.I joined this site to write about probably the worst film that I had seen.Now I write about an excellent film. It's great to see a film without male leads that's not a chick flick it's just about being somebody. It had me in the film very quickly and didn't let me go until the credits rolled.The casting was superb and the pace of the film was spot on.Just watch this movie and enjoy the acting, the scenes and the carnage that unravels.

		<shortDescription>501st Review: Good film about injustice and hope</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is more than just the civil rights struggle in the early 1960s. By focusing on a small community but giving us both breadth and depth it covers a lot of territory. We get to see how it is possible for one human to believe it's OK to treat another just because they can, or worse, believe they should.This is a strong well-made ensemble film, particularly notable for strong, well drawn female characterizations - if fact there are almost no male roles here to speak of, but it resolutely not a "chick flick" - this is a good drama with purpose, insight, humor, and shock.All in all this is one of the more rounded dramas of the year and is definitely worth your time - the acting is superb from all involved and make it a rewarding watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't read the book, but seeing the movie you can see both the appeal (to a certain crowd and the Academy) and the dislike that will built inside some viewers. This works as a fairytale (sort of), but has some fine acting to back that up. Jessica Chastain is the first name that springs to mind. A superb turn and very inspired. It feels like she is/was a star for a long time, when you see what a line-up she has/had for 2010-2012. And I don't see an end to that career anytime soon. Of course you also have to name the ever-wonderful Sissy Spacek. It's glorious how much fun she has with her role.Of course all the other actresses (mostly female cast) are good too. The turn of Emma Stones mother (her characters mother that is), is played nicely, but there is a turn of character in the movie that just does not feel right. It does work for the movie, but just by an inch. And of course the overall role of Emma Stone could be questioned, but that would take a direction, that I do not want to take my comment on the movie.So if you are up for a light drama, you will enjoy this very much. But bare in mind, it is not really perfect (Bryce Dallas Howards character has quite a few moments, where she doesn't "act" as the character should)! Try not to think too much about it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My husband and i both just finished watching and loved this movie. The acting and the filming are SUPERB! And by no means just a chick flick. Filled with surprises and emotion that rivet the soul. I grew up in the deep south during this time period and i know what the "race" struggle was like. But this movie is not just about "race". A lot has to do with upper class house wives. I am white and always knew that African Americans were given a raw deal. This movie will shock you,make you sad and warm your heart in a wonderful way.It is a lengthy film but it flies by because you just don't want it to end. Loved every minute of it! The props and costumes for this era were spot on! You will enjoy this immensely,no matter your age! I would watch this movie AGAIN. It has so much substance and emotion with a climax that will leave you cheering! One Academy award was not enough for this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beautiful, inspiring and heart-wrenching!The movie, based on the controversial best-selling novel by Kathryn Stockett, is enjoyable and heart-warming at the same time. The story shows how in the 60's, even though slavery wasn't there, "coloured" people didn't have much freedom, opportunities, etc. and how so much discrimination still existed.The screenplay could have been a little tighter and challenging, and the characters could have had a little more depth. But, all those shortcomings are overcome by the powerful acting and the interesting protagonists &amp; antagonists. I don't want to point out any one particular actor's performance. The casting is just perfect and couldn't have been better.The last words Aibileen tells Hilly in the last scene of the movie, "You a Godless woman! Ain't you tired, Miss Hilly? Ain't you tired?" had the impact and feel the climax needed.A Must-watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE HELP has proved critically divisive and rightfully so. When it gets it right, it's marvelous. When it gets it wrong, it's shameful. Still, a magnificent group of actresses render this film as sweet as chocolate pie -- made not by Octavia Spencer.The first decisive critical split comes in the characters. Just like so many nostalgic period works we see, writers forget to develop characters - only archetypes. These women are divided into two groups, White Racist Hussies and Color-Free Saintly Perfections. There is Black, there is White, but there is no Gray in THE HELP. Morality is so sadly made into an on/off switch any three-year old can figure out. In dealing with an issue still so pungent as American racism, Tate Taylor (writer-director) should know that things are much more complex than are presented here. However, so much praise is due to Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis. Their individual performances easily stand alone, but in tandem they create a tangible energy and ambition. Moments they share provide some hope for contemporary cinema. Emma Stone is also great. I hesitate in evaluating her because she hesitates in her own role. She is so well-crafted for modernity and self-referential comedy. Visibly, she was working hard to adapt to the period style. It paid off. The rest of the company does as well as possible in their stereotyped restrictions with special applause for Jessica Chastain as Celia. It's a long way from THE TREE OF LIFE, but here she brings to life THE HELP's most vivid and realized character.The photography is fine. The colors look like a children's book and some of the bright hues do breathe life into an otherwise deadened 60's suburbia. Sound, design, make-up, and costumes all do well enough jobs that I don't feel like complaining and I can't find a reason to commend. Not so in the editing room. The picture is long. Towards the end, it isn't bothersome at all. However, the opening of the film could have lost five to ten minutes of footage as introductions drag on and on. Sure enough, rewatching the first half-hour uncovers one unnecessary scene and two that are egregiously long. Also, the final confrontation between Aibileen and Hilly seems an appendix. It does nothing for the film but offer one a chance to shout at the other. As if Taylor were trying to tie up the film with a nice bow regardless of the fact that Aibileen had just lost her job. Here again, THE HELP ends on a strangely certain note. Civil Rights was only a dream in 1964; the movement only beginning to gain speed. If there was a happy ending for Aibileen, it wasn't at the denouement of THE HELP.Disregarding the archetypes, the bad coda, and some numbness, THE HELP did beautifully conjure age-old imagery of White kids being raised by Black women. It's one that so many of our parents remember. Was that a way to improve race relations? Were those awful days polishing silver the seeds of a great improvement? THE HELP might mean many things here. It might mean Skeeter writing a revolutionary book. It might mean Hilly "helping" herself to a nice slice of pie. It might mean Aibileen raising children while hers is at home. The point is that help needs to come from everywhere "and it needs to start with the truth," as they say. Black ladies will raise the kids. Black ladies write the books. Black ladies clean the kitchens. Black ladies write the newspaper columns.But the most unfortunate flaw in the film is that a White lady saves the Black ladies. Perpetuating the thankless circumstances that need to end.74.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Help' is definitely one of the top films of 2011, a triumph in a year where so many films have been awful.The acting is the strong-point, actresses like Jessica Chastain, Bryce Dallas Howard, Emma Stone, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer have all excelled themselves in this film. Stone's performance starts off pretty weak but gets better and better as the film continues. Octavia Spencer definitely deserved her Oscar but Viola Davis' performance should have been awarded too. Jessica Chastain's character is simply delightful, she plays this nervous, giggly person very well and I can't wait to see more of her acting in the future. My favourite performance in this film was Sissy Spacek however, despite her role being very small, she was just hilarious.The script was pretty good, I never got the chance to read the book but as a film I would say it's good. There are some real laugh-out-loud moments and there are also some scenes which could make you cry. Sometimes it can feel as if the characters are being portrayed very simply.Overall, I would recommend this film. It's pretty good and didn't get the amount of hype it deserved, particularly during the awards season. I wouldn't describe it as a feel-good film because of its topic but it discusses the issue very well but provides a lot of comedy too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jessica Chastain a revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Playing the outcast, former white trash, housewife, Jessica wasn't a main role but she stole all her scenes. I walked out of the movie saying 'who was that'? The character very much channels Marilyn Monroe, with her breathy vulnerability and blonde bombshell look, and Chastain achieved this. But she also showed how kind and isolated the character was. It provided an interesting side plot to the main story, and showed it wasn't just blacks who were ostracised for no good reason, and also that Chastain's character, Celia, was open minded and individual enough to see that her maid, Minny, had something to offer her -- friendship, cooking, commonsense -- and shouldn't just be ignored because of her colour. To me it was a metaphor for why racism is stupid: Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) spends her time spreading hatred but it's so destructive whereas Celia (like Aibileen and her love of children) is a force for good.</fullReview>

Later after being very careful because these actions are forbidden by law, the word gets out about the book and many more house maids decide to tell their story also.* Special Stars- Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastian, Bryce Dallas Howard, Ahna O'Reily, *Theme- Caring people come in every culture, color and race.*Trivia/location/goofs-Oscar nominated film &amp; cast and won for Best Supporting Actress- Octavia Spencer. Early film release of the Oscar Year. An interesting period film, but goofed with using the modular/plug phone handsets in dialog close-ups and use of liquid "White Out" (not in general use) in critical plot point scene.*Emotion- An enjoyable ensemble cast of actresses that did an excellent job in telling a story about the South in the early 60's. It conveys the segregation and balances that negative with the goodness of the White southern society of the time. The plot was very balanced with humor, pathos and good pacing with several unforeseen plot points through in for additional good measure. A good time at the movies.</fullReview>

A great story told by fantastic actors.The great thing about this film is that it doesn't hover on the political issues of those days, but focuses, on the life of the help.It tells a great story of a women, Skeeter, who truly loved her nanny, and is on a career to become a writer, Emma Stone portrays the role of the only real women in Jackson, that isn't scared to speak her mind about what is wrong with the world.Aibleen, a truly inspiring figure who probably works for the worst women ever, but herself stays an honest loving person, who raises the child of Hilly, the evil queen of Jackson.Then we are also introduced to a Woman - Celia, who is cast out by society in Jackson for the perception that was adulteress. In the end, she proves herself to be the best kind of person, who sees the good in everyone, and treats her maid with love and respect.All in all the film tell a scary story about how maids were treated in those days, but inspires as it each of the characters find their own happiness.

The whole movie is a big drama, welded with a real touch of class, from the director to the actors and actresses. There is something wrong about some actresses. I could say 50% of the white women of the movie, over act, kicking all the hard work that the rest of the cast has done to do this master piece. It is a long movie, but you never get bored, because talks about the real life all the time. You will not find cheap violence, in fact you will not find any violent scene at all, something that it is almost impossible in US films these days.

		<fullReview>Tate Taylor's 'The Help' was one of my most awaited films of 2011 and I finally got to see this spellbinding film yesterday. I haven't read the novel on which it was based and yes the film does take place in 60's Southern America when racial tension was high. It also touches on class distinction as is shown in the conflict between Celia and Hilly. The film majorly has a female cast as Taylor looks into the lives of suburban housewives and their helps. But that's not to say it's only for women. After all a film about women doesn't necessarily mean it's audience should be limited to women.The 60's setting is impressive. It seems to have captured that period quite well thanks mainly to the art direction, costumes, score and performances. The editing is brilliant because even though 'The Help' is quite a long movie (longer than the average flick) it doesn't feel that way and I never looked at my watch while watching. The camera-work is good too especially how it brings about the feeling of space and follows the actors.Coming back to its themes, while it deals with various issues, Taylor never spoonfeeds the viewer. He has penned a solid screenplay. The dialogues are very cleverly written and the use of humour is brilliant. 'The Help' has a unique sense of humour. I doubt blackmail, or as Minnie says 'guarantee', has ever been funnier on film. The characters are also a delight to watch. There's the quiet and courageous Aibileen (Viola Davis), the feisty not-to-be messed with Minnie, the fiercely independent Skeeter, the vivacious Celia and so many more.Taylor has assembled some of the finest actresses of the current generation such as a bubbly Emma Stone, a lively Jessica Chastain, a hateful Bryce Dallas Howard and of course some of the best all time actresses that include the magnificent Viola Davis, the remarkable Octavia Spencer, the superb Allison Janney, the terrific Sissy Spacek and of course the wonderful Cicely Tyson (who delivers a powerful performance despite having short screen time).On the flipside, the male cast isn't that impressive. The actors don't get much scope. They are used as fillers.However, in the end, this is only a minor flaw and I could care less when taking the big picture into account. 'The Help' is easily one of the best films of the year and one of my favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A resonating stand for the erasure of racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Help" is a cathartically fulgurating hurricane of powerful emotions formed by the causticity of racial discrimination and by the heartwarming stand taken against it principally by a brave triad of ideological warriors, portrayed by Viola Davis as Aibileen, Emma Stone as Skeeter and Octavia Spencer as Minny. The journey they embrace to cure society from such a destructive social malaise sheds light on inarguably incandescent acting showcased especially by Octavia Spencer's bi-stellar performance of deftly amalgamating an entertaining hilarity and a tear- flooding lugubriousness in her every appearance and Viola Davis for her masterful talent of accentuating the piercing torment delivered by the pointless yet painfully sharp blade of racism. Apart from the mesmerizing acting, "The Help" also displays its expertise in transcending compelling emotions in its imagination of delicate situations and continuing with an even more dramatic followup that will assuredly trigger a deluge of tears. Although the film assuages the perils of leading such an insurrection during the time, it still succeeds in epitomizing the elation associated with bearing the courage of commanding such acts. Overall, "The Help" is a poignant tale that shows the early cleansing of an annihilative idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've finally gotten around to watch this movie, and I'm glad I did. Here's proof to how Hollywood doesn't need to spend tens (or hundreds) of millions for special effects, CGI, or the very latest and most expensive camera equipment.How true everything in it is? How distorted and inaccurate? We may never find out. But the fact is, it doesn't even matter: in some way, sometime, everything might as well have happened back then - and much more, too. Obviously, not everything can be told in one go, but that's not a problem either. I think the fact that the story can remain balanced between tragedy and comedy makes the whole issue easier to process, which means a wider audience might be open to it. And that's always good, in more than one way too.The cast is brilliant: there wasn't one character, primary or secondary (or even tertiary) I could've overlooked with no emotional reaction to them. The crew did a fantastic job too: the costumes, props and music really set the atmosphere of the era, cinematography and editing also just how they should be.Nothing excessive or unnecessary in this movie, and nothing inadequate either. Whatever is in it however, will quite probably make you feel and think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Help", critically and commercially praised as "extraordinary" and "sensational", was a film that I felt must be overrated. What a surprise to find that "The Help", written and directed by new-comer Tate Taylor, is hardly exaggerated, and happens to be THAT funny and THAT feel-good. Emma Stone brings her classic heart and spunky pizazz to a character that, without an actors touch, could have been overtly dull. And though it is Viola Davis who appears to be getting all of the critic's love, I think that it is Octavia Spencer who really pulls her weight in the film. Not only does she consistently remain side-splitting hilarious, but she captures a passion the film is lacking in the help department. (This is no way means Davis didn't use her acting-chops with elegance, simply that she was not the break-out maid). As Jessica Chastain's second (of many) film in 2011, she manages to still be youthfully tender and jubilant; who could have predicted this same time last year that Chastain would hypnotize audiences and command the screen? Who could have guessed that Bryce Dallas Howard would continually make a splash as the "bad" one? Certainly not me, and I'm sure not many of you either. But here I sit, and here you read: unable to help but smile thinking about "The Help" and all of the subtle and vibrant performances that litter this years only film with a predominantly female cast. A film that makes women proud to be where they are, who they are and gives us all that little bit of courage we were missing previously.The only facet of this deliciously well-composed film that fell-flat was the "romantic-interest" of Stone's character Skeeter. It's always nice to have a good man for a strong leading-woman, but one who is so unnecessary and, frankly, boring has no place in a film as flamboyant and thought-provoking as "The Help". A fatal writing flaw that ruined the film's masterful quality and intense shining excellence. A must see of 2011, and surefire Oscar bait.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The HELP and the Women Behind the Scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the best seller by Kathryn Stockett and adapted and directed by her childhood friend Tate Taylor, The Help is a personal film that is affecting in its depiction of social injustice in the treatment of black females who served as nannies and maids in the Old South during the turbulent 1960's. As an ensemble piece, it features a host of memorable, Oscar caliber performances.A black female, Aibileen (Viola Davis), in Jackson, Mississippi, during the 1960's relates a story of life during that period where white families relied on black housekeepers to cook, clean and even raise their white children. These housekeepers in effect became second mothers to these children and did so for generations. Aibileen works in one such household, as does her combative friend, Minny (Octavia Spencer), who works for the stern Hilly (grandly played for nastiness by Bryce Dallas Howard). Fresh from college, Skeeter (Emma Stone) has a reunion of sorts with her old friends (including Hilly) from the community. Absent is the local outcast, Celia (Jessica Chastain), who is shunned by the group. Dreaming of being a writer, Skeeter has been curious about the life of these house servants and the injustices and humiliating treatment they must face that border on outright racism that has been passed down from family to family. Even as a child, Skeeter has fond memories of her own housekeeper Constantine (Cicely Tyson) who left one day under mysterious circumstances. Encouraged by her publisher, she decides to write a book based on the experiences of these servants. Under the fear of being discovered and fired (or worse), one by one these black women come forth to tell their stories. When civil rights activist, Medgar Evers, is murdered, it creates a firestorm of violence as these women risk everything to get the truth in print, and the results will forever alter their lives.As a chronicle of a lesser known civil rights issue and injustice, this film offers some interesting insights into a modern form discrimination. While most of the white community is portrayed as villains and almost caricatures, perhaps that's just the point: that such a backwards culture existed not that long ago. There are a number of subplots including the attempts to set up Skeeter on a blind date and Celia's awkward attempts hide her domestic inadequacies from her husband by hiring a maid. Then there is the fate of Skeeter's Constantine that is heartbreaking.As much as the acting is superior across the board, the film does not quite work as a whole as well as one would hope. The narrative seems a bit uneven so things don't flow smoothly from scene to scene. It's the only thing that keeps the film from being even better than it is. In a way the parts or scenes are better than the whole, and many of those scenes are quite good and authentic. Despite its serious subject, the film does have its humorous moments especially in the infamous confrontation between Minny and Hilly where justice is served! It is the highlight of the film.There are any number of performances that shine particularly Davis (a standout), Spencer, Howard, Chastain, and Stone. Even Sissy Spacek has a witty, offbeat role as an elderly mom at odds with her daughter Hilly. But it's the film's moments that will stay with you; they buoy The Help into our hearts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is a story about a young woman who goes to Jackson, Mississippi. She goes in search of a job, especially journalism. When she arrives she meets her childhood friend, who is a complete utter racist. But she then shows sympathy to the black maids known as the help and has an idea to write a novella about the p.o.v of the help. But her meticulous friend has other plans.Now, this movie is show stopping, the acting by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer is FLAWLESS. With Oscar buzzing all over the place for this movie, I wanted to know why? So I went to see this movie with high expectations from all of it's five Oscar nominations and I found it to be a wonderful, beautiful account about racism and chance and most of all revenge for nothing. I hope this movie will come along the lines of such classics like Forrest Gump.This movie is a "thematic" movie. Although this movie is not perfect, it is still a great movie 4 1/2 movie reels from me. I hope you like my review. Thatmoviecritic101.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an amazing film which is so moving and makes you feel that the story is true and not fake.When you don't think people could be that mean you start to feel hatred towards them and would not want to back down from the horrors you might face for answering back.This film will move you so much you would want to tell people how you feel about the story line and how it expresses your emotions to a level you have not seen before yourself.The film shows you that there is no wrong or right to what people believe in but everyone has their own views on life whether racism is right or wrong depending on how it is expressed and shown as.I believe this film would change many people's perspective on life and try to imagine people in more difficult position than themselves and realise that their own life is not that bad and concentrate on others lives that are not so brilliant.This film might be long but is an amazing film which you need to watch as it focuses on the helps side rather than the bosses side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent! One of THE BEST movies of 2011!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*Note* Although I had already written a review of this, I decided to write a new one because, after watching the movie and understanding the movie in it's entirety (the first time I saw it, it was being shown without subtitles, so I didn't get much), I have a more positive spin on the movie and some new stuff to mention *Note* I know this movie is over-hyped, but I really love it. The story is about a girl called Eugenia (Emma Stone), known by most people and often called by her nickname ''Skeeter'', who after her maid (and life-long caretaker, who loved her possibly more than her own mother) Constantine, is fired without a justification, she decides to round up a number of maids (including her friend Aibileen (Viola Davis), who is the first to enlist in the task), and write a book about what it's like to be a colored maid working for white people in their town of Jackson, where there is much discrimination and hateful demeanor towards colored folk (especially by Ms. Hilly, who is played by Bryce Dallas Howard, and has a bad-tempered maid called Minny, played excellently by Octavia Spencer).The cast is probably why this movie is such a hit and why it's actually so awesome! Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, and Bryce Dallas Howard all do excellent jobs, and even Emma Stone as Skeeter does very well. There is NO ONE in this movie that DOESN'T do a good job with their role, except perhaps the guy who's called Stuart, Skeeter's on-and-off love interest. All in all, cast ROCKSSS!!The script is also great, although most of it's probably entitled to Kathryn Stockett, who wrote the novel by the same name that this movie is based on. Despite this, the dialogue, the HILARIOUS comedy, and the incredibly emotional scenes (which I have to admit to have shed a tear or two at some ;) ), all work well within the movie, and are all necessary in a movie like this. The score, I have to admit, is in my opinion hardly noticeable, except during some of the dramatic scenes. All in all, an amazing movie! DEFINITELY A MUST-WATCH!!! I guarantee that if you like drama films that are also hilarious, you will have a blast with this. You BETTER believe I am gonna buy this on BD/DVD Combo Pack, (and you just might too...)!! I LOVE ITTT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About human kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a very good blend of warm and cold, dramatic and heart felt scenes. It's a classic story of bad versus good, and progress of humankind, therefore I don't think its right to emphasize this whole racial issue just alone. It's kind of like with Schindlers list, which is a Disney version of the holocaust. Never the less, the feeling when leaving the theater, teary eyed, it's worth going to see it, and realize "the help" existed back than. Very well made and amazing performances, but perhaps too much of a "film" to relate to history and its discussions that follow and which you can read in other reviews. Just enjoy it for what it makes you feel. Human.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help made quite a splash when it topped the box office list and stayed there for a pretty long time, fending off horror movies, sci-fi blockbusters and romantic comedies. Enough time had passed, though, to be able to admit that it's really not all that great, and very far from the 'best film of the year slot'.The Help isn't a bad movie, but it treads very familiar ground, on one hand showing once again how awful racism is, while also white-washing history and giving it a very politically correct treatment. The story is pretty touching, in a manipulative sort of way, but it's been seen many times before.The acting is what makes The Help worth watching after all - Octavia Spencer and Viola Davis are both truly terrific, and they manage to crawl completely into their characters' skins take the viewer back through time to the early 60's. Bryce Dallas Howard and Jessica Chastain are excellent too. Emma Stone almost ruins it though, as she really failed to convince me her character was real or that she wasn't a girl from the 2000's playing in a period piece.Overall, a watchable movie - acting, pretty cinematography and costumes, and good editing give it the 7 stars rating - but not a very memorable one.</fullReview>

It works because director, Tate Taylor skillfully and effectively was able to translate a novel, loved by many, on to the screen. No easy task.Most of all The Help works because of the tight knot ensemble cast. Each worthy of a mention - Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Allison Janney, Anna Camp, Eleanor Henry, Emma Henry, Cicely Tyson, Mike Vogel, Sissy Spacek, Brian Kerwin, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Ahna O'Reilly, Chris Lowell.

		<shortDescription>The Help is a must see.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is smart, witty, scandalous and a tear-jerker all in one. Tate Taylor took a risky chance writing a movie that brought us back to a dark period in American history due to racism an inequality. He did a very good job creating the experience of the movie to be surprisingly light- hearted and touching. With help from leading actresses Viola Davis, Emma Stone, and Allison Janney; these women did an incredible job making the Mississippi, Southern style of life come alive. The movie explains the relationships between African American maids during the 1960s and their families they provided for. With constant care taking, daily routines and chores many of the maids went about their lives saying very few words to the white folks. When Miss Skeeter Phelan, a University grad with a passion for writing, comes back to town, she stirs up a hot pot of drama. Persuading the maids to tell-all about their unspoken stories and redemption towards white families they have worked for, may have sounded like a good idea at the time. Lets just say that some thoughts are better off not spoken. The passion and friendship Skeeter shows towards these women is truly touching and heart-warming. This movie shows how the determination of one person can change the lives of many. At some point everyone is forced to make the choice of either staying with or breaking the status quo. The light humor and strong Southern accents will definitely keep you intrigued throughout the entire movie. The Help is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is an inspiring and hilarious journey of racial tension in the deep South. This movie shows both sides of the racial segregation in the 1960s. It shows the hardships of the African-American maids and how they coped with their situations. Likewise the movie also showed the Caucasians' moral dilemma as they were faced with either siding with the truth that ingratiation is the answer or continuing with the old ways of segregation. While racial tension plays a major role in The Help, it contains comic relief to alleviate the harsh tone of the message communicated by the movie, but also maintaining the message's integrity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is the most touching movie I watched from 2011. Great acting was performed by all the stars especially Emma Stone, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. The story brought me back to the old times when racism and equality was so much a problem in America. There was a miss in defining equality. Colored were forced by the law to be a low-life worker. Aibee was the one approached by Skeeter to write story about her feeling in a book. In order to make a change, Aibee thinks this book is one of the way of it. What makes it touching is how colored people keep their feelings for a long time and try to love the white all the time. Love your Enemies.Not only its great story, this movie also insert several good things to be learned and reminded. Good parenting is one of it. Nowadays, we may found parents like Elizabeth who several times neglect her child and so dependent on maid. The story may tell us a cynical fact that we forget sometimes. Another thing is how colored care each other and make them feel good and strong. They teach us to be human, to have each other.It doesn't give so much twists and surprises but it does give us very nice drama. No wonder this movie get so many nominations in movie awards. I love it. 9/10My favorite scene is when Mae Mobley follow Aibee's words. "You is kind, You is smart, You is important". That makes Mae comfortable and knows everything will be okay. Good parenting, I think. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie. Painful situations that hopefully in this day and age are corrected. I wish some caucasian people would have to be maids to African Americans. There should be a movie about that. You will note that I write in the manner of the late Andy Rooney; dry humor and irony.The two actresses who portrayed the main maids looked wonderful at the Golden Globes. I cannot remember their names, but they are excellent. They were both up for awards, I think, and one of them won. They looked so wonderful as their real selves, all glamorous and youthful.Some of this movie reminded me of Driving Miss Daisy and Fried Green Tomatoes. There was a Southern feel to the movie and portrayals. If they say tomatoes are in the pie, watch out for the real ingredients. If you have recently committed some sins toward someone, you will get paid back big time.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'THE HELP': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another 2011 Academy Award 'Best Picture' nominee, this one being financially the most successful of the bunch. It's an unbalanced film combining serious emotional drama dealing with real racial issues with exaggerated sentimentality and cheesy comic relief. It was written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Tate Taylor, which he adapted from a book (of the same name) by Kathryn Stockett. It's an ensemble piece in which three actresses were also nominated for Academy Awards (Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain).Emma Stone stars as Skeeter Phelan, an author in 1960's Mississippi who recently graduated college and moved back home with her family. She discovers that the maid who raised her (Cicely Tyson) has quit but is suspicious about what really happened to her and can't get much information out of her parents (Allison Janney and Brian Kerwin). After witnessing more abuse of other maids she's come to know in the area she decides to write a book from the African American maids point of view about working for white families. At first many are afraid to help her, out of fear what could result from it, but she slowly earns the help of one bold maid name Aibillen Clark (Davis).The movie is hard hitting at times but other times the drama feels far too forced. Still it's much better than the likes of something like 'THE BLIND SIDE'. It's also filled with odd comedy including those involving fecal matter. None of that quite comes off right but when the film works it really works and is very memorable at times. Davis is outstanding in the lead and Chastain and Bryce Dallas Howard (the two would be sisters) are both exceptional in supporting roles as well. I found Spencer's character to be too much of an exaggerated stereotype forced to deliver the bulk of the bad comedy, which Spencer does a good job at but not an Oscar worthy performance (due to the directing and writing of her role). The movie as a whole is a mixed bag but definitely worth a look.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd0S1srQ9T8</fullReview>

I don't know those line are exactly like in the book or not, but I think those lines are the message in the movie ... every colored maid at that time want to pass through to the youngest (white toddler) the true essence of life so when they grew up they can change the future.My heart goes to Viola Davis for brilliant performance to bring the sad, afraid, and hope on those eyes ... I mean what an acting ... she may be lost for the doubt, but without a doubt the Oscar this year for the leading lady is hers and ... for the screenplay is worth an Oscar.So ... moviegoers you need to see this film, this is really really really good ... when I said triple really ... it means best ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far from Perfect But Carries a Welcome Message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Help" has so many positive things to say and is full of such good actors giving such good performances that it's pretty hard to outright dislike. It's one of those movies that seems really good while you're in the middle of watching it but begins to fall apart somewhat when you think back on it. I wonder how much different the viewing experience would be if you'd read the book on which it was based (I have not). As it is, there are many parts that feel like they're in the film because they're in the book but weren't as fully fleshed out in the movie as I imagine they were in the novel. An entire storyline involving Jessica Chastain as a helpless housewife who turns to her black maid to help her is welcome because it gives Chastain a chance to deliver a winning and immensely likable performance, but I'm not sure what it really had to do with the rest of the movie around it. The character played by Allison Janney doesn't make much sense at all. Representative of a certain kind of white person who's basically well meaning but allows peer pressure to turn her eyes away from the injustices of segregation, her character is first portrayed as a foolish and vain woman with whom we're supposed to be disgusted and then turns on a dime to become a champion for her daughter, played as appealingly as always by Emma Stone, when her daughter writes an expose of white oppression from the point of view of the black household staffs. And don't even get me started on the character played by Bryce Dallas Howard, an unlikable actress anyway who's given a gross caricature to play, so vile but ultimately so juvenile that she threatens to undermine the entire point of the movie -- if all racists were as silly and as easy to dismiss as her, all of our race problems would be solved.Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, as the two black maids at the center of the story, deserve the accolades that have been directed their way. My only complaint, which is really a compliment, is that Davis had been given more screen time.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is a great movie to see that I would definitely recommend to anyone! It was written and directed by Tate Taylor. The Help is an entertaining, funny, touching, and moving film that keeps your attention the whole way through. It opens up our minds and takes us back to that time period of the Civil Rights Movement. The movie takes place in the South where the whites are upper class. The actors did a phenomenal job with portraying their characters. One of the main characters played by Viola Davis is a "maid" to a white family. But as the movie goes along a viewer soon realizes that the term "maid" becomes irrelevant. The maids are more like nannies than anything else. Not only do they cook and clean, but they also raise the children in these families like they are one of their own. I definitely recommend it to anyone, the whole production team produced a great film and you really felt as if you were taken back to that time period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This four Oscar-nominated film has finally set ashore here in the theater and is destined to be a gratifying crowd-pleaser. It is a resourceful reference to the color discrimination period almost 50 years ago in USA. The film is able to find its resonance elsewhere in the world painlessly, even for a Chinese like myself, discrimination is commonplace among human societies, and we can all empathize with the characters and enjoy the theatrical conflict with some well-infilled satisfaction after a lengthy 150 minutes. From director/writer Tate Taylor (who has a supporting role in another Oscar-favorite WINTER'S BONE 2010), THE HELP interweaves a lively portrait of the bitterness and felicity of the lives of black helps, through a young white girl's intervention to harness their stories as the source materials for her book. Maybe one can argue that all the twist-and-turn is too hoary for the audience in the 21st century, but propped by an all-out effort from a superb cast, the film miraculously enjoyable and the epiphany comes with a perfect tempo, arguably a supporting role, Viola Davis demos a tenacious mojo on screen and her emotional flare-up is wondrous to watch, Octavia, Bryce, Jessica are among the elites of the nearly all-female supporting groups (Viola and Octavia is my current win in the leading and supporting actress respectively), and old hands like Allison, Sissy, Cicely and Mary also showcase their meticulous scene-stealer dexterity. All these accompaniments has induced that Emma Stone's appearing leading role awkwardly being eclipsed by her co-stars and her performance is nevertheless a safely touching one with somewhat abating stringency. The film has a winning charm in its refined settings and costumes, it has everything we can expect from an orthodox Hollywood drama feature without any sumptuous bravura, it deserves the crown as the highest domestic grossing ($169,598,523) film among all 9 BEST PICTURE nominated films in 2011.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt like this was trying to be an epic drama but at times descended into triviality.Though the topic of race relations was obviously prevalent in the film, it wasn't put up to much scrutiny or analysis. I've heard some people drawing similarities to The Blind Side in regards to this topic, which is in some ways true because it refuses to delve into the issue more and the characters are very flat and not prone to change of any kind. The dialogue was also very sparse at times and had a hard time keeping me interested.That being said, I enjoyed how they did take on another topic more thoroughly, and that's how the lives of suburban mothers rotates solely around gossip and every person seems to be constantly on their guard, waiting to point out something that they find irritating amongst their fellow neighbors. I don't think I've seen a film cover that topic successfully since 2006's Little Children.There were also some good performances in the film, including those of Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, and--even though her character was very one-dimensional--Bryce Dallas Howard. Thomas Newman's score was also brilliant--prevalent when it needed to be and subtle the rest of the time.Is it perfect? No. Will it please the wider audiences? Most likely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Help" needs no help in reaching for more success. It has captured the hearts of critics and moviegoers alike; it has been nominated for a few Academy Awards and was a surprise box-office hit. Writer-Director Tate Taylor's film about an aspiring Mississippi writer in the 60's who decides to write a book detailing the lives of African-American maids through their point of views did sure help uplift my spirits upon watching it. I thought it was a sensational, inspirational movie that was "maid to love". Taylor's tailor-made script and direction helped make it one of the best movies of the year, but the Academy sure needs some help because they snubbed Taylor for both director and screenplay Oscar nominations. Emma Stone stars as Skeeter Phelan, the go-getter young white Southern writer who gets a gig writing a laundry column in a Jackson, Mississippi newspaper; that was the gateway that brought her the idea on having African-American maids detail their challenging experiences as maids in Southern homes of wealthy, white families that even had segregated bathrooms built for the help. Viola Davis also stars as Aibileen Clark, an African-American melancholy maid who eventually decides to spill the maid beans to Skeeter. Octavia Spencer co-stars as Minny Jackson, the vociferous maid who is no Minnie Mouse when it comes to proving her points, whatever that means. All of these performances from the Big Acting Three of "The Help" (Stone, Davis, and Spencer) were remarkable and Oscar-worthy. Davis and Spencer both received Oscar nominations for their grand performances, but I think the Academy was stoned by snubbing Stone. With Spencer as the frontrunner for a Best Supporting Actress win, Octavia will soon be a "Spencer: For Hire" by being offered lucrative roles in major future productions. Other stellar supporting acting performances which helped "The Help" have one of the best acting ensembles of the year come from Allison Janney as Skeeter's sick mother who pressures Skeeter to get married, Bryce Dallas Howard as the racist villain Hilly Holbrook who is simply pure evil, and Jessica Chastain with her Oscar-nominated performance as the scene-stealing southern socialite Celia Foote. How could I have chastised Chastain by not including her in the aforementioned Big Acting Three of "The Help"! So, let's call it the Fab Acting Four of "The Help" with all apologies to Janney, Howard, and the rest of the solid cast of thespians in this movie. There are some touching scenes of "The Help" that will help for you to have your weepie-hankie handy when seeing those heart-tugging moments. So help me help you and let me recommend for you to seek "The Help". ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entirely different way to explain "civil rights"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does a movie so thoroughly immerse you in its story that you find yourself truly lost in the epic, captured by the soul of a tale that causes the deepest kind of introspections into your own morays, or a stripping away of the naiveté that may have created them. So it is with "The Help," a simply masterful tale that in its epic understatement creates a movie that could fundamentally recharacterize how we view the civil rights movement. "The Help," adapted from the Katherine Hockett novel of the same name, is a fictionalized story of Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone), a young deep- South author seeking to tell the tale of the lives of black maids and nannies in mid-1960's Jackson, Mississippi through their eyes, and in their words.In telling the humble, and often humiliating, tales these women offer, "The Help" becomes a civil rights movie of an entirely different kind, one seen not in the form of protest and division, but one of man's inhumanity to man. "The Help" confronts the viewer with a reality our sensibilities reject, yet compels us to acknowledge. Viola Davis stars as Aibileen Clark, the maid first approached by Skeeter with the shocking proposal that she discuss her life as the primary caregiver to children in white households. Davis' performance is astonishingly and brilliantly on-the-mark, richly earning her Oscar nomination for best actress. Clark's role is vital in the film's exposition, because if we do not accept her as the conduit through which the stories of other maids are delivered, the movie fails; yet Davis' portrayal of Clark as the sublimely humble heroine confronted to act with the courage of her faith resonates perfectly in the unfolding story. Clark's own story leads us to her friend Minny Jackson, played superbly by Octavia Spencer. Spencer's precision delivery of Jackson's wit and skepticism is the perfect contrast to the humble and understated Aibileen, and forces us to make sure we trust Skeeter's motives in writing her book. "The Help" is a richly woven story of still-persistent attitudes towards black Americans in the deep south; that we hear Clark narrate passages from Mississippi law governing the "treatment" of "coloreds" astonishes the viewer all the more, realizing that while the story may be fictionalized, their legally institutionalized treatment was not. Those attitudes of race hatred are rolled masterfully into the manifestly detestable character of Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), the socialite in charge of the local junior league, and self-appointed leader of the response to the "colored issue." "The Help" isn't perfect - it comes perilously close to weaving too many characters into too short a time, and at that the movie rings in at a plump 2:26, even after some apparent harsh last-minute editing. Side stories from the book involving a senator's son, Skeeter's mother's ill health, Skeeter's nanny Constantine played by Cicely Tyson, to name only a few, are incorporated, but abbreviated or changed substantially. Fortunately, the underlying story is so strong that the film doesn't become fragmented or suffer as a result. Many movies are characterized as an experience for their special effects , grand cinematography, or epic scale. "The Help" is just such an experience, but for none of those reasons. It is the compelling performances of a tremendous cast that draw out the tremendous story of real people fighting real prejudice in a region that sees that prejudice as perfectly normal and acceptable. That "The Help" compels the viewer to live in their shoes, if but for a brief time in the abstraction of a movie theater, is a monument to its greatness."The Help," in and of itself, is a fictional tale. Yet the masterful way its fiction reveals and explains its underlying truth, represents a simply brilliant piece of movie-making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another film based on a novel. This story, written by Kathryn Stockett, takes place in the '60s era and touches the delicate matter of racism.The place, is Mississippi. The matter, is the other side of the coin. The Help, needs to express and have its voice heard. Emma Stone (Skeeter), in search of her dream in being a writer, gives the chance to plenty African-American maids to introduce their view and tough experiences they have to deal every day.It's a really emotional film and you can feel the nerve-braking that a lot of people had to go through on both sides of the "game". Viola Davis (Aibileen Clark) does a truly magnificent work, so is Octavia Spencer (Minnie Jackson).The photography is bright and the locations beautiful. Even though the characters are going through some hard times, it keeps reminding you the beauty of colors and their uniqueness. The music lineup is equally worthy, featuring artists such as Bo Diddley, Ray Charles, The Orlons, Webb, Pierce, Four Seasons and others.Sweet story, with a humanitarian-historical importance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Help" is about black women being employed as maids and nannies in Jackson, Mississippi back in the racially-tense early 1960s. Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) is an independent tomboyish young lady who could not help but notice how badly her bridge buddies were treating their black maids. This terrible racist attitude was most exemplified by the pretty but contemptible Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), who was not even shy about her nasty behavior. Skeeter then secretly interviews maids Aibilene Clark (a serious Viola Davis) and Minny Jackson (a sassy Octavia Spencer), who bravely tell Skeeter their stories of oppression in white homes. How will the town react when Skeeter's book finally gets published?The movie is another example of excellent ensemble acting. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer have the showiest roles. Spencer, in particular, figures in the most memorable scene about how her Milly character gets back at Hilly using a pie. Emma Stone is also quite good as the modern thinking Skeeter. Jessica Chastain sparkles as Celia Foote, a naive housewife from the poor side of town who was ostracized by Hilly and her friends. The more minor characters of Sissy Spacek (as Hilly's mom) and Allison Janney (as Skeeter's mom) also make their mark despite their shorter screen time. Cicely Tyson has a memorable moment in her brief and silent screen appearance as Skeeter's nanny.The treatment of the serious story is light, with just the right amount of humor. It is a Disney production so we do not really expect this to be "Roots" or "A Color Purple." The subject matter in itself may not really appeal too much for all audiences especially in this part of the world, but the message of hope and redemption will make this movie universally meaningful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a big fan of movies like The Help. I was hearing about it for months and I was tired of it, but I knew deep down that it would be good. Then, I witnessed it for myself, and now i'm... a helper? Well, a fan of The Help.The film revolves around a sweet white girl named Skeeter(of course played by Emma Stone) who, unlike the others around her, likes black people in 1950's Mississippi. So in order to give maids,such as Abeline and Minny(played wonderfully by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer in possible Oscar glory roles) the justice that they deserve, she decides to write a book from their point of view.The Help sounds like it would be a straight-forward drama. Usually racial movies are pretty serious. But The Help, while being dramatic, blends with humor, and actually has a lot of memorably hilarious moments that stay with you long after.The performances from everyone all around, especially from Davis, Spencer, and Bryce Dallas Howard as the evil Hilly, are fantastic. There are a couple of tear jerking moments, don't get me wrong, but The Help is lighter than you'd expect.It's a wonderful movie, even if it doesn't end as well as it should have. Despite it's ending, it's one of the year's best and is definitely worth seeing. If you're like me and you didn't want to see it, please do. Honestly, you won't regret it.A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A satisfying film with superb acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I finally watched "The Help", a movie which, considering the precursors, has good chances of earning a considerable number of Oscar nominations next Tuesday. And it sure didn't disappoint me.The story revolves around the society of Jackson, Mississippi, in the 60's, focusing on the relationship between the black maids and the white women they work for. There's Skeeter (Emma Stone), a modern young woman who, unlike most of her lady friends, has graduated from University and has aspirations of becoming a writer. As a result of his job as a "homemaker hints" columnist in the local paper, for which she asks maid Aibileen (Viola Davis) for help, she decides to write a book about the Help.The film, hence, has a powerful message about tolerance and equality. I felt that, though this works well and gives the film depth, sometimes it gets a little too obvious and makes it falls into the sentimental, tear- jerking territory. It's not like it bothered me, because it didn't, but I just thought it could have been handled a little more subtly. But hey, Disney's involved in it, so what did we expect?The strong point of the film is the female cast. The actresses are perfect in their roles and they truly shine throughout the film. Emma Stone, as Skeeter, brings really well the modernity and the wit her character requires and Bryce Dallas Howard, though a little "cartoonish" sometimes as the evil and despicable Hilly Holbrook (which is understandable) really delivers too. But I found the following three performances even better: Viola Davis, as the suffered Aibileen, does great in the most heart- breaking scenes and shows once more what a good actress she is, after her short but top-notch role in Doubt, where she outshone everyone (even Meryl Streep!). In spite of this, I'm having a little problem about her being considered the lead for all the awards. Though she's one of the centers of the film, she is missing in a big part of it. Secondly, we got Octavia Spencer, as the sassy Minny Jackson. It's true that hers is not a difficult role to play, but she's really really funny and one of the best parts of the film.And last but not least, the wonderful Jessica Chastain. Her Celia Foote could have easily been played as an over-the-top, one-dimensional bimbo, but she brings a depth and humanity that make her character the most endearing and likable in the film, in my opinion. I enjoyed her scenes with Minny the best.Overall, "The Help" is a perfectly enjoyable film, with amazing performances and an interesting storyline. It doesn't get tiresome at all, despite its considerable length, so I really recommend it. Regarding the Oscars, though, I do not think it should win best picture, but I'd be happy if one of the ladies took home the award, which seems likely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good script for a Great story, Great acting for Good characters ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A woman-centered film about the treatment of black maids in Jackson, Mississippi during the 60's? the kind of pitches that instantly remind of "Mississippi Burning" and "The Color Purple", as if Tate Jackson's film, "The Help" was only begging for critical acclaim and Academy Awards. But if we were cynical enough to judge a movie only by its plot, we might also be able to judge people by the color of their skin, or their ethnic background... while there's so much more that justifies "The Help" success.Those who didn't have black maids as children, at least grew up with the immortal Pop-culture image of Hattie McDaniel in "Gone With the Wind" or the iconic Mammy-Two-Shoes in "Tom and Jerry" cartoons. I, myself, from a Moroccan background learned many stories about my Mom being raised in the 60's by a 'dada', which was the affectionate word used for black nannies, subtly masking the tragic reality of these women's historical backgrounds. My generation didn't have these 'dadas' but only maids from the country's poorer area, and the ways some were treated echo the film's saddest subplots. They were not all victims, as for my part, still have great memories about the maid who took care of me, whether it was cleaning me after 'I finished', or in the shower. My nanny stayed with us almost 20 years, and will forever be part of my greatest memories. Indeed, there are many maid stories and it's the combination of them that highlights the harsh reality of racism. The film is told from the perspective of Aibileen Clark, Viola Davis in one of this year's best performances as a veteran maid, interviewed by the heroine, Emma Stone as Skitter Phelan, an ambitious girl whose journalism rhymes (unfortunate cliché) with feminism. The film still doesn't fall in the convenient trap that would portray all the maids as victims but it features one of the most recently despicable villains: Blythe Dallas Howard as Hilly Holbrook, the authoritarian President of Jackson Junior League. Hilly embodies the ugliest part of racism, the one disguised with a condescending paternalism, mostly made from the sentiment of domination provided by wealth and education. Indeed, as much as many women were raised by black nannies in my country and in the film, most of them would never allow their daughter to marry an African man, except if he was rich and educated. The economical racism is still relevant today, especially if we dared to imagine, a rich black woman behaving like Hilly Holbrook with a Mexican maid. The treatment of racism in "The Help" is its greatest accomplishment, because we don't have burning crosses and Jackson is surprising Ku-Klux Klan-less ... although they felt necessary to include a scene of violence so random I wondered if it was really needed. I think the most thought-provoking aspect of the script was precisely in the way racism was depicted, something as banal as routine, and as natural as our most basic daily actions, which didn't make it less hateful. Toilets play a significant part in the film, sometimes much more than needed even for comedic purpose, but this perfectly shows that racism can be less about the glorification of a race than a constant reluctance toward one: refusing to touch someone or to sit on the same toilet... How many of us said that without being racist, were not attracted to a particular race, black, Chinese or even white? Some of us have precisely dealt with prejudice, and not necessarily as victims and the film mirrors if not our racism but our guiltiest thoughts and unconscious capability to sort-of understand racism, which turns us into accomplices. In "The Help", many white characters are not racist, but they participate to it because of their incapability to resist peer pressure and display tolerance in front of people, on the top of them, Skitter's mother Charlotte, Allison Phaney proving her immense talent to play motherly figures in Best Picture potentials and Ahna O'Reilly as Elizabeth Lefoit the mother of the adorable little girl, mother by title since Aibileen Clark, her nanny, is obviously the only real mother figure. Many scenes features this ambiguity of behavior, provoking in our open-minded consciences frustrated reactions. Needless to say that Skitter does resist to this pressure, since she's the one who made the book possible but strangely, I thought her character was too stereotypical while the film should have elevated itself above those clichés. Some scenes sounded probably great on the paper, but on-screen, embarrassed me a little, especially a romance that started from nowhere, and as I expected, went nowhere (like in many all-female cast, male characters were underdeveloped) and some maids, Eugenia's nanny to name one, were too 'noble' not to remind of the good old' wise black person cliché. It's one thing to avoid one-dimensional villains in a film, but it's even better when you don't make the opposite mistake and make some people unbelievably good when the hardship they endured would have made them tougher. This is why the most interesting performances came from Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson and Jessica Chastain as Celia Foote. Both demonstrated, not without humor though, that the rejection endured by women in the 60's wasn't only based on racism, and some of the greatest scenes feature either Minny or Celia, or both, and I wouldn't be surprised if they received Oscar nominations, with a win for Spencer."The Help" will probably garner many awards in 2012, but I wonder if it does justice to the novel it's adapted from, because its main flaws come from a script whose parts could have been more equally developed, avoiding some subplots and enriching others. It's still one of the best films of 2011, but it really feels like it took its original story and inspiring message for granted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute must-see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched The Help on DVD after hearing all the hype and also hearing how my mother and her sisters 'forced' my grandmother to watch it (i'll come back to that later).I read some previous reviews and several said how 'unreal' the threat of danger was. People, lets keep in mind this is a Disney affiliated film. Disney would never let a lynching, a brutal attack or a rape be shown in this film (although ALL these acts occurred during that time). They will IMPLY, but never show. Hence when Milly is attacked by her husband all we hear are screams thru a phone. But I will commend Dreamworks for doing a good job of IMPLYING the REAL threat of danger. When Aibileen (Viola Davis) and the other black man are asked to get off the bus b/c 'some n*gger got shot', they both become nervous, they both hit the street with motivation and intensity. Even though neither once of them said "we might die tonight, hurry home", They both KNEW they had to get home quickly or they could end up dead/injured themselves. It was a very touching scene for me. Almost a little too real.But going back to my 88 y/o grandmother, who helped her mother clean houses before she became the FIRST black employee who worked at her local JCPenny's in the 1950's in TN. My grandmother has always had a hatred for white people but do to the era and her upbringing, she would always smile in a white person's face when spoken to, even in the face of true ignorance (like when a white man asked her where he could find a 'n*gger red' flannel coat within her department). Ultimately grandma watched the film, she didn't cry, but she did share that when her white employers were out of town not only did she use their toilet she also took a bath in their tub. But really, who cares?? Is she not the same person who had to clean it anyways!?!?!? The bathroom issues in The Help are quite true. Racist southerners have been around for ages and their idiotic thoughts have been around even longer.I'm sorry if ya'll were looking for a more technical review of this movie but I can't give it to you. The movie is great. A little watered down but I think its out of necessity. Watch it and judge for yourself. But even if you don't like it, I hope the movie at least makes you think about your actions and the actions of those around you, past, present and future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching this. Wow.........You might have already read the official storyline, yes, thats exactly it, a young white girl writing the story of the oppressed negro women.The white girl is Emma Stone (Easy A). With her Japanese cartoon like large eyes and exaggerated expressions is a sweetheart to watch.Viola Davis is the first of the black women who agree to tell her story. She is just simply brilliant. We can literally feel her pain in her eyes. This is the first time I am seeing her and she just blows you away with her acting! Jessica Chastain is the main villain in the story, a quirky narcissistic character, who almost sees a black person as an animal from some other species - fantastic performance.This film reminded me of the Gandhi movie. Its that moving. And I was left wondering, why do we have so much conflict in this world. Its just like in those mid 1900s as portrayed in the movie. Aren't we just being silly? Is so simple to be loving and accommodating. Instead we live a life of constant tension and conflict! Its so very very sad.........Go see it and have a beautiful time. :-)..............Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compelling story about racial prejudices. It avoids sentimentality, and keeps our attention throughout the full 146 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was a bit reluctant to book tickets for this movie, as I assumed a bittersweet story. And that it was screened in one of those multiplex, popcorn riddled theaters did not help much either. I stand corrected, in hindsight, on both counts. It was not overly sentimental at all and the audience behaved a-typical, both in the positive sense of the word.In spite of the considerable, above average length of 146 minutes, the story has a drive of its own and keeps our attention from start to finish. This is mostly due to the ingeniously constructed script. Events initially seeming to leave an open end, are fulfilled later on to be seamlessly integrated in the plot. I cannot think of many suggestions to edit away redundant scenes, or to strike some of the participants.An enormous number of people appear throughout the film, all of them needed to make up the story. For some reason this did not overwhelm us viewers. It was always clear who-was-who and what their role was. One word of advice: skip reading the Plot Synopsis on IMDb for this movie. It certainly will leave you confused behind, by giving a needlessly fragmented view on the story line.The only problem I have with the story is that it not only covers black and white racial prejudices, but also is populated with black and white characters, figuratively speaking. It cannot be that all blacks in the movie are good, and that nearly all whites treat them badly. This one-dimensionality may emphasize the general tendency of the story, but it is unrealistic and uncalled for. Within these confines, all actors are believable and perform very well.The open ending does not leave us unsatisfied, rather the contrary. Maybe it is the best solution to wrap-up the story. You can expect that some of the main characters will face difficult times, in spite of the momentum in the positive direction that is caused by the book that they helped to make. We see an example near the end where one of the helps is fired for the wrong reasons. This sort of revolutionary collateral damage cannot always be avoided, neither in movies nor in the real world. Racial prejudices won't disappear overnight, and may even take a few generations to overcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not perfect, but quite interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I watch a movie about racial oppression (either it is set during the slavery period, or the subsequent segregation, or the current combination of volatile cultures), I cannot avoid some suspicions about the authentic intentions from the screenplay. Due to the fact that the subject is controversial, it can be used as a basis of intelligent and provocative reflections...or it can simply be used as an easy trick to draw attention and provoke emotions on the spectator. Which one of both categories does the film The Help belong to? I honestly cannot assure it, because its tone changes with an alarming frequency, from predictable soap-opera clichés to genuinely honest drama with a deep emotional resonance. Nevertheless, I think that the balance of the film definitely falls on the positive side, mainly because of its excellent performances and a precise narrative which never looses the focus on the main message.The screenplay from The Help shows the classic traces of a "compressed" story, in which some important points feel hasty or superficial, while other elements occupy space without substantially contributing to the story. Ie that that is normal in book adaptations, and I am sure that screenwriter Tate Taylor (who was also the director) tried to preserve the best he could from author Kathryn Stockett's book. However, I would have liked to see the time spent on some elements (such as an useless love story) invested on developing better some of the very interesting characters who do not have enough time on scene. Another small folly comes from the funny moments, which occasionally feel excessively forced and predictable.However, that did not avoid me from liking The Help pretty much because of the brilliant performances and the generally well written screenplay. The interaction between the characters Minny and Aibileen is among the best elements from the film, and it does not leave any place for sentimental manipulation, because it did not need from any exaggeration in order to perfectly express the suffering from the characters and the catharsis of simply venting their painful memories and sad experiences. Even though The Help is not based on a true story, it feels like that because of the sincere performances and the realism of the situations depicted, which are unfortunately credible in the historical framework the movie is set.As for the actresses, Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer bring extraordinary works which are absolutely worthy of the acclamation they are both receiving. Even though Emma Stone feels a bit darkened by Davis and Spencer, that does not avoid her work from being solid. Oh, and I don't wanna forget Bryce Dallas Howard bringing a perfect performance as a villain simultaneously worthy of hate and sorrow. So, despite some tonal and narrative irregularities, The Help definitely deserves a recommendation as a very interesting experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthy but weaknesses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kathryn Stockett's book on which this film is based (originally turned down by 60 publishers) and co-writer and director Tate Taylor's movie itself have both been outstanding successes in the United States where this tale of prejudice and racism towards house maids in 1960s Mississippi has clearly resonated in a country which has moved on sufficiently to elect a black president but still exhibits discrimination against African-Americans in so many aspects of its society. It is unquestionably a worthy work, championing an underprivileged ethnicity, class and gender and providing a slew of challenging roles for female actors, both black (Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer) and white (Emma Stone, Allison Janney, Bryce Dallas Howard and Jessica Chastain).But as a film it lacks a strong narrative drive and pacing, while the characterisations are one-dimensional with only Janney's character having any real nuance or complexity. And the book and film have been criticised for representing a white heroine as liberator of the black helps instead of suggesting that they were capable of self-empowerment. In spite of these weaknesses, this is a distinctive and well-made movie that has something to say and should be seen and taken to heart.</fullReview>

While all the ladies do an outstanding job with their roles, it's Jessica Chastain as a Marilyn Monroe ditz character who really shines. See her in THE DEBT and then this. You'd never know it's the same actress. The New Meryl Streep. For all those who compare this and all movies based on novels: This is a movie...NOT THE BOOK.

		<fullReview>Wow.Have to say, there isn't a movie this year that played on my emotions as much as this one. Sure, there might have been better film this year, but this one really pulled the heartstrings. Based on the bestselling book by Kathryn Stockett, the Help is a darn good film.The film is set in the early 1960s in Jackson, Mississippi during the Civil Rights era of America. The cast is superb; it's what really makes this movie. Emma Stone stars as Skeeter, a young writer intent on writing a book from the perspective of the black maids during this era. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer star as two of the maids that Skeeter interviews. Viola is excellent as Aibileen, an older maid who has seen much through her time. Octavia stars as Minny, a very funny character who provides great comic relief.The rest of the cast is just as excellent. Bryce Dallas Howard (50/50) portrays Hilly Holbrook, the town's racist and 'villain' of the film. Jessica Chastain (Tree of Life, The Debt) is amazing as Celia Foote, a sort of outcast in the town, despite her fancy home and clothes. My favorite character of the film, even though she doesn't really fit into the main plot all that much. Sissy Spacek also stars as the hilarious mother of Hilly.The plot is fairly simple, and plays it very safe in the racism aspect. Really, what makes this film is the varied performances by it's all star cast. Viola Davis, particularly, deserves an Oscar nomination. &amp; dang, give Jessica one as well! I mean, if not for this, then the Tree of Life. Ah, but enough ranting. GREAT film. Watch it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨If you can love your enemy, you already have victory.¨ The Help has received a lot of Oscar buzz and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets many nominations, but I was a little disappointed after watching the film since I had such high expectations for it. The Help is a good, solid movie, but it just didn't live up to all the hype for me. Racial and segregation films like this one have been made before with much greater effects. This film felt a bit light at times, and reminded me a lot of Fried Green Tomatoes. I can't help but think this film could've been much stronger considering the strong cast it had and the social issues it was pointing out. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's novel of the same name, and it was adapted for the screenplay by director Tate Taylor himself. This is Taylor's second film, after having made a small film three years ago named Pretty Ugly People. Taylor, a relatively unknown has jumped to fame with his work in this movie, but considering the material I think a good director could've brought so much more to the story. In a way this seems to be a light drama which is touching a serious and dark period for many people. There are some funny moments, but the movie is really long and drags during some periods of time. I thought that the last half hour was probably the best part of the movie and you end up leaving the theater with a smile in your face. It's a good movie with some terrific performances, but I just was expecting so much more.The Help is a reference to the maids in Jackson, Mississippi during the 60's when racial discrimination and segregation was really strong. Civil rights movements had begun, but separation between whites and blacks was still very much an issue. The movie centers around several Southern society girls and the relationship they have with their maids. Skeeter (Emma Stone) returns home after college to take care of her sick mother (Allison Janney) and gets a job at a local newspaper writing housekeeping articles. Since she has no clue whatsoever about housekeeping she decides to interview the maids. Skeeter is sad to hear that the maid she grew up with and was like a mother to her has left to Chicago, but realizes there might be more to it than her mother is telling her. Skeeter is the only single girl since all her friends are already married and have children. Her best friend Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) is president of a local society and has come up with the idea that every family should have a special and separate bathroom for their maids. This of course, because of fear that they will transmit some sort of disease to their children. Hilly is very cruel towards her maid Minny (Octavia Spencer) and one day in a dispute fires her. Minny then finds a job working for a very nice lady named Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain) who's just arrived back in Jackson with her husband and live in a huge house. She is very disorganized, but Minny helps her get the house organized. Meanwhile, Skeeter realizes how terrible most maids are treated and decides she wants to write a book about the help, but written with the maids point of view. Skeeter begins interviewing her maid's best friend, Aibeleen (Viola Davis), who has had a lot of experience working with high society white families. Hesitant at first Aibeleen then begins opening up and convincing other maids to tell their stories to Skeeter and the result might shake things up for the residents in Jackson, Mississippi.The best thing about The Help without a doubt is the performance from the entire cast. Emma Stone does a great job as the lead character fighting for the rights of some of the maids which have been such a great help to her, but at the same time realizes that her friends will probably be upset with what she's doing. She still speaks what's on her mind and isn't afraid to point out the things that are wrong. She is very courageous. Viola Davis is just excellent and will probably receive an Oscar nomination. She also has a lead role in my opinion and she is just good in every movie she's in. She does a great job at repressing the anger she sometimes feels after suffering so much injustice. Her friend Minny, played by Octavia Spencer, doesn't do such a great job at repressing that anger and sometimes explodes. Spencer really surprised me in this film; she does a great job and absolutely nails her role. She will get a lot more job offers after this. It's hard to pick just one performance because everyone in this film does such an outstanding job. Jessica Chastain is excellent in this movie in her supporting role and perhaps gives the best performance of all. She is sweet and naive, but also feels broken due to her incapacity of bearing children. It's really sad considering she probably would be a lovable mother, unlike the rest of the society moms who can't even pick up their own kids and leave it all to the maids. I can't end this review without mentioning Bryce Dallas Howard who is just so good at being bad, mean, and cruel. She truly is scary in this movie and plays an excellent villain. The Help is a good movie, I just was expecting a little more from the story, but still go see it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help (2011) - Chance Begins with a Whisper!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from the best-selling novel by Kathryn Stockett, "The Help" is a comedy-drama adaptation that stole the hearts of many movie lovers. With an all-star cast including Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jessica Chastain, Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen, and a special appearance by Cicely Tyson, and a beautiful adaptation to a powerful novel, "The Help" is the movie that will steal your breath away. Set during the Civil Rights era in the early 1960s, the movie talks about a young white woman, portrayed by Emma Stone, and her relationship with two black maids, portrayed brilliantly by both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Stone plays a journalist who decides to write a controversial book from the point of view of maids, expressing the racism they are given, when working with white families. This is quite a beautiful masterpiece, and it's one of the best movies of 2011. I was completely stolen into this movie from it's funny moments, to it's heartwarming messages. I loved this amazing casting ensemble, and they deserve total Oscar consideration. Emma Stone is wonderful for her third performance this year, Bryce Dallas Howard is incredible as the character you love to hate, Jessica Chastain is just magnificent, but it's both Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer that deserve Oscar nominations for their performances as the black maids. This beautiful script has helped create a movie filled with heart, emotion, truth, and courage. There was nothing in this movie that I did not like, because I was blown away by the sight of what I've just seen. This movie delivers powerful messages involving the Civil Rights movement, and how blacks should be respected equally. From the powerful messages to the incredible cast, "The Help" is the feel-good movie of the year, and you won't be disappointed because this is a powerful, and beautiful masterpiece for the ages. I hope this gets the Best Picture nomination of 2011. "The Help", in my review, "emotionally powerful, an exhilarating masterpiece".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best titles of 2011</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is one of those rare movies about women and heavy social contents that is pleasant and delightful to watch even when it's not supposed to be. All the credits go to the ensemble cast that knew exactly what to do and gave the exactly tone that each character needed in a so amazing way that seems that the director wasn't important at all.Viola Davis, as Aibileen Clark, once again amazes us with a simple but dense performance about a strong woman with a fragile heart wounded by harsh times, prejudice and ignorance. The same can be said about Octavia Spencer, as Minny Jackson, making both of them a partnership so intense and perfect as Thelma &amp; Louise.Brice Dallas Howard is very different from her previous works and an excellent choice for the role of Hilly Holbrook. Sometimes being tender and comprehensible, sometimes being the worst ignorant people that you could ever met. Her performance is a mix of great small and exaggerated doses, making you sometimes laugh but most of the time wishing the worst for her.Jessica Chastain, as Celia Foote, for sure is the most charismatic and funny character, but being funny doesn't mean that she's just there to relieve audience from the drama, but to show them the other side of it.Emma Stone is a great young actress, but her performance is too modern and for me it doesn't fit so well in the whole context of the time set. Maybe her performance had that clear purpose, as her character is young and ahead of her time, but seems a little dislocated anyway in a movie that cared so much about important details of that time.Even being a little bit long (Chris Columbus is one of the producers, so that could be imaginable), the movie has a huge importance to show people a part of the American history that explains a lot of our present. The racial problems in Mississipi state was just a fragment compared to other places and nations and the movie is also an emergency sign because the movie can be set in the 60's, but it's actually pretty current when we compare the progress and realize that most of what is shown still happening in a disguised way.The Helps isn't some ordinary 'dramedy' nor a chick flick as some people think. It never makes you feel fooled with a magical happy ending. It's sincere, fragile as the main characters are and a very important part not only for American history but human rights history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that everyone should see</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no such thing as a "perfect movie" and "The Help" is not an exception from that rule. It, however, falls into the select category of "must see" movies.The excellent qualities is not the primary reason why everyone should see "The Help" , although it boasts a sharp and intelligent screenplay (Tate Taylor) based on a famous New York Times Best Seller book of the same name (Kathryn Stockett), a masterful directing (Tate Taylor), a grand ensemble of talented actors (see below), and a memorable soundtrack.What truly makes "The Help" a must-see movie is that it powerfully shows on the big screen something that most of us might have learned, heard, or read about, but have never experienced or seen with our own eyes. This is a case where a picture is worth a thousand words. It might be impossible for us to travel back in time and immerse ourselves into the ugly reality of the sophisticated humiliation and quiet suffering flourishing in Jackson, Mississippi in 1960s. "The Help" with its emotionally charged, vivid images and a compelling, thought provoking story manages to capture the essence of the historical and social setting. "The Help" is also a good lesson of humility for all of us. Nowadays it is easy to be disgusted and terrified by the atrocities that some well- educated, church going wealthy white folks were committing about 50 years ago in Jackson, Mississippi. It does not cost us anything to condemn what everyone now agrees was terribly wrong. We do not need to be brave, courageous, or insightful to do that.We might even consider ourselves a better, wiser, morally superior generation with a stronger self-awareness. A hard to swallow truth of the matter is that 50 years from now the future generation will be judging us. Good chances are that they will be just as disgusted and terrified with some of our behaviors, with our positions on certain social and moral issues, as we currently are terrified and disgusted with the behaviors of our ancestors.Despite what some critics say "The Help" is not a caricature or a simplistic social pamphlet with an obvious agenda. It maybe does not have a depth of a Dostoevsky's novel, but it is definitely offers a comprehensive, multidimensional view on a very complex problem. It successfully blends several well-developed story lines, each adding a unique value to the movie. Moreover, below the surface "The Help" has some strong thought-provoking undercurrents valuable for independent thinkers. One of these well-hidden but very powerful messages is a striking conflict between a pillar of the society Hilly Holbrook, representing the empty hypocrisy of the human religious traditions, and a quiet, ordinary African-America maid Aibileen Clark, representing the power of a genuine faith in God. On the outside, "Miss Hilly" (Bryce Dallas Howard, in a vivid and memorable performance) is one of the most respectable members of the society, a loving wife and a caring mother, a good Christian who is all about charity balls, helping poor African children, and giving proper respect and recognition to the "Help". On the inside, however, Hilly Holbrook is a hypocrite and a Chief Pharisee of the town. It does not take a long time for her ignorance and patronizing attitude to turn into a web of lies, cruelty, and deception. You could call her a monster, but please be aware that the same monster might be quietly (or not so quietly) growling inside of you. That is why Hilly Holbrook's moral failure becomes a stern warning of critical importance for all of us. Especially, if we do not want to hear the words that stunned her at the end of the movie: "You are a godless woman, Miss Hilly". And all the charity balls did not matter anymore. On the outside, Aibileen's life is terrible. She is alone. The worst imaginable personal tragedy has been haunting her from the past for many years. Her hard and valuable work that she pours her heart into is not noticed, appreciated, or even fairly compensated. She has to endure all sorts of abuse and humiliation both on the job and outside work. On the inside, however, something truly beautiful is happening with Aibileen (Viola Davis, in a strong, nuanced performance). Something allows her to show extraordinary love, courage, and faithfulness, to overcome both the personal tragedy and the hard life circumstances. Through many thoughtful, authentic details the movie makes is very clear to us who supports and empowers Aibileen all the way - the same God that Hilly Holbrook has somehow lost in the middle of her perfect high charitable life.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The black maids of Jackson, Mississippi, the "help."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize this is a work of fiction, based on a book, but having lived through most of this, growing up in the south in the 1950s and 1960s, the story seems to be very plausible. The 1950s and 1960s that I knew, and depicted in this movie, were part of the "transition" years between slavery, which was abolished, and true freedom. Well-off white families had black maids, often referred to as "the help", paid relatively little and, at least depicted here, ordered around and expected to be slaves to their employer, even though they were "free" to leave. But they needed work, times were hard, and they often raised white children while other family members raised their own children. That is the situation in this movie, depicted in Jackson, Mississippi. Was Missisippi in the 1950s and 1960s the most racially bigoted state? I don't know, but a former co-worker who happens to be black attended Ole Miss back then and he said it was a very difficult environment.Emma Stone is aspiring journalist Skeeter Phelan, herself raised by a black maid (Cicely Tyson) who had almost become part of the family. Now Skeeter was back home after graduating from Ole Miss and began to clearly see the situation, and how bigoted her former friends were and how poorly maids were treated. She wanted to do something significant, to give voice to their plights, and sought to write the book, The Help, based on interviews she would do with maids. Perhaps the key maid character is Viola Davis as Aibileen Clark. The other is Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson.Skeeter's friend and now housewife is Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly Holbrook. Hilly becomes the main activist for keeping maids separate and "in their place" which includes a petition to require all domestic employers to have a separate bathroom for their black maids. As the story moves along we witness Skeeter and Hilly becoming former friends as their personal agendas drive them in different directions.The movie is well-written and well-acted. It tells an important story of that time. While it is a very serious, and often sad, subject the story is also sprinkled liberally with humor. Especially the "special" chocolate pie that Minny bakes for Hilly after Hilly had fired her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching and inspiring story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is set in the 1960's in a conservative part of the USA, where an upper class white young woman writes about the lives of maids."The Help" is an engaging and emotional film. It tells the story of an upper class woman, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who is obnoxious beyond words. She treats other people with no respect, and perhaps even more disturbing is that the white people around her sees no problem in her behaviour. A wannabe journalist calls Skeeter stands up and asks the obnoxious woman's maid to speak up. A chain of events is set rolling.It is pleasing to see Skeeter and Aibileen's dedication and courage to stand up against the tide. A woman unpopular in her neighbourhood, Celia, is also a welcomed addition to the cast as she injects warmth and humanity into the film. She sets an example by being truly equal with her maid. The strong bonds between the human right pioneers and the maids are inspiring and touching. There is much to celebrate in "The Help", as it demonstrates the good nature people can have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A realistic and often beautiful picture of the decaying South</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 2009 novel by Kathryn Stockett, Tate Taylor's The Help depicts the patience, loyalty, and courage of black maids who cooked, cleaned, and raised the children of white women for many decades and who were often subject to abuse and humiliation by their employers because of their race. Emma Stone's performance as a young writer who records the stories of several maids in a book she is writing plays a prominent, if not decisive, role in the film, yet it is mostly carried by the brilliant work of Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer whose performances as Aibileen and Minny are at the core of The Help's ability to stir deep human emotion.Filmed in Greenwood, Mississippi but set in Jackson, Cinematographer Stephen Goldblatt, aided by Production Designer Mark Ricker, creates a realistic and often beautiful picture of the decaying South with its dirt roads and once stately mansions now falling into disrepair. As the film opens, Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis) tells us that she is a maid like her mother before her and has raised seventeen white children as their surrogate mother. The film is Aibileen's story as well as that of her friend Minny (Octavia Spencer) as told to young Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone), a college graduate who comes back to Mississippi with the intention of becoming a writer and quickly realizes that she no longer fits in with her former friends, the perky bridge-club types whose racism lies just below the surface.Taking a job at the Jackson Journal as the writer of a cleaning-advice column, a subject she knows little about, Skeeter turns to Aibileen for help. When Skeeter discovers that her mother (Allison Janney) has fired Constantine (Cicely Tyson), the maid who played such a loving role in her life for 29 years, she decides to write a book consisting of interviews with the maids of Jackson, hoping that they will tell their story for the first time in public. Bravely facing the danger of being seen in close contact with a white woman, Aibileen agrees to talk to Skeeter, writing down what she wants to say rather than responding to questions.Although Skeeter's publisher wants more maids to contribute, the risk of putting their lives on the line is an obstacle the others are not yet ready to confront. Soon, however, after a falling out with her employer, Minny agrees to join the project followed later by other maids, fed up with the way they are being treated. The project becomes a cathartic experience for the women, able to say out loud what they have been suppressing for a long time. While the portrayal of some of the white women in the film borders on caricature, for example the villainous Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard), some of the more interesting characters are fully developed human beings.Prominent among this group are Celia (Jessica Chastain), a rich ditzy Marilyn Monroe type who hires Minny and is taught how to cook and clean house, Skeeter's mother Charlotte (Allison Janney) who seems to be one of the few who are able to learn from their mistakes, and Hilly's mother Missus Walters (Sissy Spacek), who is able to enjoy a good laugh at her daughter's expense when Hilly becomes the recipient of an extremely gross incident which, though it has a point to make (unlike most Hollywood gross-out comedies), goes on much longer than necessary.While The Help is not a documentary and does not purport to present an all-inclusive picture of the racially-motivated beatings, lynching, and routine killings in Mississippi in the early 20th century and into the 50s and 60s, it still accomplishes what it sets out to do ? to educate and entertain a generation largely unaware of the conditions of African-American women in the South before the movement for equality gained a foothold. While The Help may be sentimental (an unforgivable crime in some quarters these days), when Aibileen looks a little girl in the eyes and tells her: "You is kind. You is smart. You is important," every tear that may be shed has been dutifully earned. If that is called "pandering" to white folks, so be it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the most entertaining movie of the year but a movie that is still worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to be honest this isn't one of the most entertaining movies I seen this year but it's still a movie that is worth seeing. The story takes place in the 60's with the civil rights movement and has to do with the mistreatment of black housemaids during that era and what blacks went through. And revolves around a writer Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan(Emma Stone) writing about what the black housemaids went through and tries to get it published. This movie takes place in a conservative era and portrays most of the whites as arrogant one dimensional superficial characters. I guess it's needed to show the cruelty the blacks faced during that era but sometimes it just seemed a bit forced at times. Maybe I had to have lived during that era to get a better understanding though. The movie is a bit dry though and it sort of reminded me of books I had to read in middle school although it's based on a novel. It was sad to see how the blacks were treated in a degrading and demeaning manner in that era. Nothing new to anyone that graduated from high school but still leaves a bit of an impact. If your looking for a fast paced movie with some shock factor in some genre like this you might be a bit disappointed. But this movie does a decent job of showing the feeling and emotions of blacks during that era. And their perspective of what is going on at that time. This is a good movie to show in school during class in order to educate the students but it's not a movie that I would watch again. But it makes you think when it's over, especially about how the blacks were forced sometimes no matter how hard they worked they didn't have enough to give their children a proper life. I am not going to lie and say it's one of the most exciting movie of the year it just lacked the focus but it's a film that is worth seeing and has good character development and that applies to the side characters as well.7.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mmm. Oscars buzz is in the air like the smell of fresh baked pecan pie! First slice is The Help, a sort of alternative history of Jackson, Mississippi in the turbulent civil rights era.The Help has three main heroes: plucky Skeeter Phelan, serious Aibileen Clark, and feisty Minny Jackson. Skeeter returns to Jackson with the goal of being a writer. The story that interests her the most is that of The Help (ding!). She attempts to get Aibileen to divulge tales of running the households of white women, but Aibileen fears for her safety and refuses. However, circumstances surrounding the mistreatment of her friends leads Aibileen to begin spilling the beans. Other maids soon join in and BAM - best seller!At first glance this film is everything it attempts to be: a story touching on the racism of the day, a heartwarming plot driven by strong characters, and a bit of good fun in the process. However, I felt that the characters played as mere stereotypes, and the true feeling of the era was softened either by nostalgia on the part of the author, or intentionally as a means of selling a feel-good story.Each character's role, while well defined, never allows for any real change. Skeeter didn't ever have to build up courage to write The Help; she simply took some screen time convincing everybody else to get on board. It didn't change her already super-modern, open-minded viewpoint, and it didn't make her a champion of civil rights. She sold her story, reaped the benefits (with surprisingly few downsides), and moved on. Aibileen stayed the strong central figure behind the idea of getting African American maid's stories heard, but didn't stray from that serious face she wore so well. There were a few moments of laughter, lightness, but she took little convincing to put herself in harm's way and in the end, payed a very mild price for her revolt against the white system that controlled her life. Minny Jackson ? comic relief. Hilly Holbrook ? the racist villain. Celia Foote ? silly woman too simple to understand racism. Obviously a drama such as this will have some stereotypes, but it went all the way to the top.Hilly Holbrook seems to be the only real racist in the picture. She's young, angry, and determined to keep those sub-human colored people out of her bathroom, but not from handling every other part of her life. The movie portrays every other young elite woman as just following in step, not really concerned with race, but more with being socially accepted. Add to that every male and person over the age of 40 seems perfectly well balanced in their views on race. I'm not asking the movie to be a venom-filled, dark affair, but I think it paints Jackson in an untruthful light. I'm from the South, so is Queer. I know racists and they don't delicately prance around the issue today, and I'll put good money up that they didn't back in the '60s. Every bit on Kathryn Stockett talks about her upbringing in Jackson and her relationship with the African-American who raised her through the 1970s and in to the '80s. New York Times admits she pulls her punches on attacking the racism she witnessed, although they spin it as her being more "interested in the affection and intimacy buried beneath even the most seemingly impersonal household connections." I didn't get that from this 2 hour 20 minute film, but maybe the book covered the "affection and intimacy" in more detail.With all its problems ? minor plot lines wrapped up with a cheap line, a complete lack of any character growth ? it wasn't a bad film. It was heavy-handed (Oh look, a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird!), but it had some charm, entertainment value, and the southern accents didn't irk me nearly as much as I had expected. I do feel that my criticism is warranted. If you're going to tackle an issue like racism in the heart of the most racist parts of the country, you've got to commit. The Help simply lacked courage.Maybe I wanted the civil rights version of Inglorious Basterds, but this fictional history pulled short on any real content or poignancy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies i ever saw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERSI have no doubt that this is one of the best movies ever made. The only regret I have is not reading the book before I watched the movie. I re- watched this masterpiece so many times I can't even count. It's an authentic way to show the audience the suffer afro-American women had in the past. The story as so relate-able, touching and the characters are full of soul. The story of Minny and Celia has leaved me in such a emotional rage. I loved the dynamic between those two characters that are so different. The performance of Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer were flawless. The end scene were Celia made the dinner for Minny telling her she will always have a home and place to work was so touching. Or the scene were Celia told Minny about her miscarriage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful and Entertaining!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a semi-comedic take on the "mammy" period of the 1960's, "The Help" is an entertaining and heartwarming movie with a star-studded cast to match. It shows that there can be good found in people, as well as hate. The film demonstrates a side of the Jim Crow era at its worst in the south, and a young woman who was willing to unveil the sad depiction of live-in house maids and their short-lived bonds with the children they cared for. Emma Stone is impressive as the strong willed "Skeeter" who defiantly writes a book depicting the experiences of black maids in the south. Jessica Chastain is almost unrecognizable as the darling Celia Foote who adds an endearing character to an otherwise purposefully unlikeable cast of characters. Not to mention the phenomenal demonstration of strong will and friendship from Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, who both received Oscar nominations for this movie, (With Octavia Spencer in fact, winning for best performance by an actress in a supporting role) and who inspired to have strength and hope through unbearable times. It is also hard to forget the malicious Hilly Holbrook played excellently by Bryce Dallas Howard that moviegoers will definitely love to hate. The film does a great job of adapting the book to the big screen and is sure to make one feel a range of emotions. Although some may dislike the depiction of the mammy archetype in this film, it will not fall short in the entertainment aspect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Good For What It Is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am far from this films target audience. Most films that center around racial prejudice such as Crash, The Blind Side, or Remember The Titans tend to simplify the issue and tend to have the feeling of a T.V. movie or a class lesson video, so I don't usually hold them that high in regard. Which is why I was shocked at how much I ended up liking this film.The films plot centers around an aspiring journalist (played by Emma Stone) trying to write a book of stories about the lives of black maids working for rich, white families in Jackson, Mississippi during the civil rights movement. As such, it has the common themes of family, prejudice, acceptance, and understanding seen in these sort of films. The thing that sets it apart is the story and characters are generally well written. Everyone has well defined characters, even if some of them are a bit cliché, and they all act and react the way there personalities say they would. You can actually see these people existing in the real world, which allows you to connect with them much easier. As much of a trope as the stay-at- home, airhead 50's housewife is, I find it pretty entertaining, especially when such characters are fleshed out and interact with each other.On top of that, the film understands when to let the audience laugh. Even though it is mainly a drama, the humor in feels very genuine and constant, even if it can be a bit sit- com like at times. This is what separates it from films like Crash as it doesn't let the message drag the movie down and make it depressing. Also unlike Crash, The Help doesn't talk down to the audience. It gets it point across just through the flow of the story, without having to resort to dropping a giant anvil marked "racism is bad" on your head. It shows that there is more to racism than just hate. It can also come from societal pressure or be taught from birth. The movie respects your intelligence, and that's a rare thing to find in films these days.The film gives you drama and a few laughs and treats its subject matter with care. The characters are well written and well acted. To top it all off, you got a soundtrack that has Johnny Cash, Bo Diddley, and even a little Bob Dylan. What's not to like. Consider this a strong recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humble Help -- So Hard To Find, These Days.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jackson, Mississippi, in 1963 and the segregation is iron bound. A feisty young local journalist manqué is hired by the local newspaper to write a household advice column. This prompts in her an interest in the black maids who service the community of higher-class white housewives. A volcano erupts.You see, the white folk live in them big white houses and the white womens they have dare hairs up in piles on top of they head and they demands that the silber be polished just proper for when they entertaining. The black folk lives in them shotgun houses in they own districk and eats fried chicken and rabbit stews all day. They need them maid jobs powerful bad because the menfolk, they don't make no money toiling at the mill.I know. It sounds like an afternoon television special that should be shown in a civics class, but it's better than that. The first thing that impresses the viewer, after the initial exposition, is the presence of social borders that are more effective in keep people in and out than the Great Wall of China was at defeating Mongol raiders. The social world is divided into strict categories.It's a binary universe. You are either "in" or "out." You are black or you are white. You are a man or you are a woman. You are respectable or you are white trash. There isn't much in between. (Poor Truman Capote.) And within each of these socially constructed categories, there is an intense sense of schedule, of the proper time to do things in the proper way, the time for politesse, the time for slap downs. The heroine, the would-be writer, is an affable and outspoken redhead with frizzly hair, given to wearing Mexican shoes and not yet married, although she's in her twenties. Her mother, Allison Janney, nervously asks her, "Honey, it's past your time and you have no boy friends. Tell me, have you ever had any, um, unnatural feelings? Like feeling towards girls?" That's scheduling for you. And here's social class. A naive but pretty and friendly young blond, Jessica Chastain, moves into town, drinks too much, wears revealing gowns, speaks a little too freely, and can't cook anything but corn pone. When she shows up with a covered dish at a party by the local doyen from etiquette hell, nobody answers the door. They hide from her view behind the furniture and speak in whispers. As one of the well-groomed guests observes, she's "white trash." Well, let us not run out of space by going on too long about the keenly observed characters and plot, which is weakened only in the last quarter or so, when everyone winds up happy except the witch. The witch's performance is splendid, by the way, but then everyone involved gives an unusually tuned performance. The editor has caught Viola Davis, as the principle maid, doing some marvelous acting. Sadly, there is the hint of cloying stereotypes. Man, the director has gotten respectable Southern women and their cliques down pat, but he overdoes it with the nameless horde of carefully made-up butterflies mincing around, fluttering their delicate hands and turning every sentence into a melodic carol that ends in a question mark. And the African-Americans, while human and hardly saints, don't seem to have anything in the way of vices. They simply accept the insults and burn with unspoken resentment.Of course, the central theme is the way maids are treated as robots and the way the robots take their revenge. The black maids receive what sociologists call "non-person treatment." They're not really there, and the exchanges are either functional ("Get me an iced tea?") or perfunctory ("That's a mighty purdy dress, Mizz Scarlet.") Those social borders are noisome. For one thing, they have two sides. After hundreds of years of being bulked up, they now operate to effectively keep categories comfortably apart. African-Americans in particular have a solidarity that other minorities can barely understand. It's asking a great deal of them to sacrifice that hard-earned group loyalty in the name of an equality that many of them see as a façade. Would you want your daughter to marry one? Neither side is especially anxious for that to happen.I'm not even certain that the tendency to feel more comfortable with others who share your appearance and culture is so unnatural. Every big city has its Chinatown and Little Italy. And when "Planet of the Apes" was being filmed, the chimpanzees ate with the other chimpanzees, the gorillas ate with the gorillas, and the gibbons hung out with the gibbons. Maybe it's better not to think about it. It's certainly EASIER not to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE HELP is based on the novel of the same name by Kathryn Stockett; this is more than just a movie...its an experience. Set in Jackson, Mississippi at the dawn of the civil rights movement, a couple of women take clandestine steps to make a change for the good. Skeeter(Emma Stone)a fresh Ol Miss graduate returns home to where her mother is eagerly awaiting with the major thing on her mind is to find Skeeter a husband. However, Skeeter is determined to become a writer and gets her start by taking the help/advice column for the local paper. Skeeter wants something more substantial and begins the greatest experience of her life. With help from her best friend's maid, Aibileen(Viola Davis), she decides on writing about the true unhappiness of the many black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent white southern families. This undertaking begins slow, but Aibileen convinces more of her friends to come forward. In secret Skeeter and the maids collaborate on putting their stories to paper. In spite of Skeeter's white friends, she has definitely forged a sisterhood with the willing maids that eagerly await the finished product...Skeeter's novel. The high class women of Jackson can't put the book down, unassured that it is actually about them through the eyes of their own maids. Whispers can make a change. THE HELP makes you want to read the novel if you didn't read it already. A very strong cast in a very entertaining film. Other players include: Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spenser, Ahna O'Reilly, Anna Camp, Sissy Spacek, Cicely Tyson and Leslie Jordan. Worth watching again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Down here in Brazil, we -- or at least I -- had the impression that this movie was going to make some subtle observations as to the employer/domestic relationship. It was looked forward to as a contribution to comparative ethnography. What a surprise! The movie was neither dramatic enough to be a drama nor comic enough to be a comedy. Pity Divine from the old John Waters movies wasn't still alive to do the part of Hilly. At the conclusion of "Pink Flamingos" many decades ago, Divine did a memorable star turn with dirt the dog had left behind, so Divine might have brought some dimension and resonance to the heavy-handed scene in which Hilly eats chocolate cake, whereas the performance by the little Hollywood actress, whoever she is, had barely enough richness for a remake of National Lampoon's Dorm Daze. Audiences aren't resentful of being hammered with the obvious seven times over? E.g., that Aibeleen, not the white woman, is the standard-issue cute toddler's only real mother? As for the repeated returns to the face of the wounded child in the window, shameless, shameless, shameless. Anyone with a serious interest in employer/domestic relations -- and not merely in smugly being on the right side of a battle that, at least in the terms stated, was won a long time ago -- would do well to get hold of the Brazilian film Domésticas, which I believe is in video stores in the U.S. under the title Maids.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help...good acting but has anyone seen "The Long Walk Home?""</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thankfully the acting is great and that alone supports the whole movie. While the story is especially moving, we have been down this road before in MUCH better films... EXAMPLE, check out the movie that came out in 1990 "The Long Walk Home" which was pretty much ignored at the time... with Whoppi Goldberg (when she was an Oscar nominated actress fresh off Color Purple) and very ironically; Sissy Spacek! Whoppi that year won the supporting actress Oscar for "Ghost" (well deserved for a predominantly comedic performance...no complaints there)...just she was ignored for a best actress Oscar nod for a performance in LWH that mirrors Viola's performance. If you loved The Help, see Long Walk Home. One other beef... I can understand that current audiences love a good poop, bathroom humor joke in a comedy (most recently "Bridesmaids"). But in a drama as this, was there are more creative way to make the point of the pie eating scene? This movie goes for high drama and settles for sophomoric humor in that one part. That to me is pretty sad, as was attention and detail to the period. Emma Stone's hair with products with Aveda products to enhance and shine her curls, to make her look like she is on the cover of a 2001 Vogue? Looks like she just stepped out a Beverly Hills salon. Does not look like a girl of the period. Minor maybe, rest of period seems pretty well depicted ... unless I missed something else. Not a great film, but a flawed film with great performances worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering all the praise that's been heaped upon it?not to mention Oscar nominations and other awards?"The Help" left me feeling rather ambivalent. Yes, it features some "very important" themes and it begs to be called a "movie about issues" (namely, racism and women's rights). And yes, the actors deliver fine performances?Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Emma Stone, and Allison Janney are outstanding, as is Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays the delightfully detestable antagonist (probably the best role of her career?certainly better than anything she did in that "Twilight: Eclipse" nonsense). But something about this film just lay flat. The moments that were meant to stir up emotions failed to do so, the plot just kind of meandered with no real suspense or uncertainty, and a main plot device (one of the black maids extracts revenge on a racist former employer by baking a pie that contains a decidedly unsavory and rather putrid ingredient and savoring the racist's enjoyment of it) is almost vulgarly offensive enough to distract the viewer's attention from the alleged moral indignation he/she is meant to feel for the unjust treatment the maid has received. Ultimately, the film is a disappointment, despite the strong performances of its cast, and I'll be thoroughly perplexed if it wins any Oscars at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great To See So Many Great Female Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Help, The (2011) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Jackson, Mississippi in the 1960s is the setting for this drama about a young writer (Emma Stone) who wants to tell a true story about the help in her state. She gets two maids (Viola Davis, Otavia Spencer) to tell their stories of working for white people during a troubled time. THE HELP is an extremely entertaining movie and one that rightfully ended up getting a lot of attention from not only critics but also the mainstream who were able to turn this into a surprise hit. I'll start off with a couple minor issues that I had with the film with one of them being the first fifteen or twenty-minutes were a tad bit too slow in building up to where the heart of the story actually is. The second problem I had is that the film at times is way too cute for the subject matter. Jackson, MS in this period was quite an ugly place but you really wouldn't know that from this movie as many of the darker moments are put in the background. Yes, the message gets across but I can't help but think a darker edge might have helped. With that said, the movie is still a must-see because on a technical level it's quite flawless and it features some of the best performances you're going to see. What I enjoyed most is that we got so many great roles here for women. This here isn't very easy to do as you're lucky if a movie can get one strong female character but THE HELP offers up at least half a dozen, which is rare in these times, which is a real shame. Emma Stone is perfect in her role and what I enjoyed most is how you can see her paying attention to the stories being told to her. Many great actors say the most important thing to do when acting is to listen and it's something Stone does very effectively. Both Davis and Spencer are terrific in their parts and it's their performances that really makes the film. The two of them are so believable in the parts that you can't help but care for them and want to see things change. The supporting cast includes strong performances from Bryce Dallas Howard who plays a real piece of trash and Alison Janney playing Stone's mother. We also get another very strong performance by Jessica Chastain who steals every scene she's in. With this film, TAKE SHELTER and THE TREE OF LIFE you can't help but say this actress had one of the best years in recent memory. At 144-minutes the film actually flies by with its beautiful look, strong cinematography and of course the great message behind the stories.</fullReview>

Also, this movie is all over the place.There is something that one of the maid does in this movie that at time or today wouldn't be possible to do without going to jail no matter your race.Viola Davis is a terrific actress, but you don't get to see that in this movie, better watch her in Law Abiding Citizen.

		<shortDescription>The most truthful 1960s film I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard the good reviews coming from this movie, I knew it was a movie to watch. I had no expectations for this movie. I thought it was going to be just a typical racism movie. But no, it was so much more. With tremendous performances from Viola Davis and Emma Stone, it brought tears just hearing the words they say. The acts of selfishness from the main antagonist Hilly is quite harsh. It made me think that if it were me, I would fight right back. But this movie is not just very dramatic. It had very funny moments where a maid bakes a pie for Hilly and says that it is her feces although it isn't. The help is an example of what we don't realize. We don't realize what goes on in our real lives. We don't see that people are getting abused behind our backs. But what the help really is trying to tell us is that with certain help, the unheard voices are heard. The help ,which is found through Skeeter(Stone), gives the maids a chance to be heard. To be appreciated. We need to respect everything. It may be hard but with the right help, anything is possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Courage sometimes skips a generation. Thank you for bringing it back to our family." Skeeter (Stone) moved back home to Mississippi so she can get some experience writing for a paper before she can move to New York. When she gets a job answering letters about cleaning she asks one of the maids for help answering them. A simple job about cleaning turns into something major that changes the course of the town. This is a very difficult movie to watch, but this is a must see. The subject matter will infuriate you and the Hillary character is one of the best movie villains to come along in awhile. For a movie that at its most basic level is about interviewing people for a book it is very engrossing and moves along pretty quick. This is a very emotional movie that will leave you thinking and wondering how you would have behaved in that situation. The cast and acting alone is worth watching for. Emma Stone gives a great performance and is hard to believe this is the same girl that was is "Superbad". Overall, the first real Oscar contender for best picture and numerous acting awards to come along this year. A definite must see. I give it an A...Amanda gives it an A+.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An exceptional window into the human soul that will shake you to the core and change your life. This meaningful and emotionally rewarding experience is unique in its honesty. If ever you questioned life, living and the differences that divide, The Help is a welcome wake-up call that serves as a reminder of how important it is to have friends that will support you through the best and worst of times. It's one of those rare films that sneaks up on you and crawls deep into your heart. It poignantly addresses important social issues without casting judgment and allows its vibrant characters to unashamedly display their weaknesses. Tate Taylor's direction is heartfelt and his well crafted screenplay gloriously magnifies Kathryn Stockett's critically acclaimed No. 1 New York Times best-selling debut novel. The cast shines in their respective roles, particularly Viola Davis as Aibileen, the heart and soul of the film, and Octavia Spencer as out-spoken Minny Jackson. Equally brilliant is Bryce Dallas Howard as the bitch from hell, with Jessica Chastain unforgettable as the wounded and lonely, fish-out-of-water Celia.

		<shortDescription>The World Should Not be Divided by Colours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing that "The Help" talks about the race issue in the US, and it usually is the kind of theme qualified as strong contender in the Oscars, plus having quite good reviews, I went to watch with high expectation. And it turned out that it really was a great movie. It delivers a truly strong message.I have to shamefully say that I was really not aware that the 'colour' issue was so serious back then. I knew there was racist issues, but only after watching the movie that I know it was serious racist issues. And even more surprised that it was just in the 1960s, more recent than I imagined. Well due to I was only born in the late 80s and such a shame that I have little knowledge about the earlier happenings. (By the way I really do not understand why Blacks are labeled as 'colour', I thought White is a colour too, I remember having it in my box of colour pencils)People always say the later generations are luckier as everything just happens to be so much better and easier now, and we did not need to deal with the difficult situations that the older generations used to deal with. Which I think is true, maybe we are really lucky.Being personally born and raised in a multi-racial country myself, I know that my country has had a race riot too (also in the 1960s). So I am really lucky to say that now things have turned out to be better and people live a more harmonious life. People from different races are more united now.But also growing up in a multi-racial society myself, I know that achieving racial harmony is actually not an easy task. Although we do mix around with people of different race, but usually it is only minor interaction. It is still not easy to spot a whole group consisting different races. But I am also glad that things are improving, which is how it should be. We as humans should always improve, not just the technology that improves.The actors and actresses delivered a really strong performance in the movie. No doubt that this is a strong candidate for next year's Oscar nomination, especially I think it deserves nomination in Best Leading Actress and Best Supporting Actress (Viola Davis as Aibileen Clark and Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson). And not to be overlooked is Jessica Chastain which I think once again delivers after noticing her from "The Tree of Life". And this time proves that she can be a versatile actress.So this movie should really be a reminder to us that as a modern human being, there really shouldn't be any more racial issues. Yes it had happened before but it was the past and we now have to learn to be a better human. And anyone with a brain and heart should know that there should not be anything that separate us humans as we all live on the same planet. And no one chose to be born as any race, so we should all have the same rights.And I really do not think that there should be any colour labels anyway, as no one is born blue or red or green or silver or gold, we are only either fairer or darker.*Do feel free to visit my movie blog http://joethemovieblogger.blogspot.com/ for other movie reviews too.

Tate Taylor did a very good job in both directing and the screenplay. Emma Stone was a good choice, and of course the Oscar nominated Voila Davis did a spectacular job. Davis is a great actress, no one could argue with that. To my surprise, Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer performed amazingly. Chastain really showed us in this movie that she is versatile, she was able to make us sympathize with her as a vulnerable wife in "The Tree of Life" opposite Brad Pit, in this movie she showed us she can also play the sexy, southern, naive wife. Also, to my surprise, Spencer shocked me that she can combine both good acting and being funny, it will be after this movie that Octavia Spencer will be in movies that could show us more of her talent. Watch out for the Oscars, some of the ladies in this movie "may" be competing against each other at Academy Awards in 2012.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, heart-warming, and elegant. It is a truly stunning movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when I first read the book. The power from the story leaped from the pages and came to life all around me. So when I heard there was going to be a movie the only thing I could think was "please let it be good!" And now I finally saw it and I feel in love with the story all over again. At first I was a little curious at Emma Stone playing Skeeter because her in her previous movies just didn't throw at you "southern-belle" but then again this is probably one of the first outcast southern-belles to ever appear in movies, so her playing the outcast is more like what she does. She proves she can play many roles and this is just one of her best yet. This time, however, she goes into one of the most controversial topics to ever appear on the big screen.She plays Skeeter, a college graduate who has great ambition and wants to be an accomplished writer but is sadly in 1960s Mississippi, a place at the time that greatly lacked the ability to accept change of any kind. So her options were running low but what she wanted to do was what anyone could do. However, before she can move to New York and start her own "Happy Working Song" she'll need to prove to the editor of the company she wants to work for (and most importantly herself) that she is a serious writer. So she asks her friend's black maid Aibileen to help her with a book about what it is like to be a black maid in Mississippi. Soon after Aibileen joins, many other women come up and ask to help with the book. So now Skeeter, Abileen, and Aibileen's smart-mouthed best friend Minny work together to change the way things work in Mississippi.Between the three leading actors: Viola Davis as Aibileen, Emma Stone as Skeeter, and Octavia Spencer as Minny; the power comes directly from all three of them. However Viola Davis had enough power to carry the movie on her own. Up to this point we've only seen her on the side-lines as a supporting actor or cameo. Now we get to see what she can do and she doesn't disappoint.The Help is perfectly crafted with powerful emotion and amazing performances from the three leading ladies. You will cry and laugh with this unforgettable story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shallow Treatment of a Complex Subject with Strong Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't read the best selling book the movie The Help is based on. Nor have I paid much attention to the controversy about a White central character telling the story of black maids in Jackson, Mississippi. I can only judge the movie by what appears on screen. You get the sense the audience is being manipulated. This is where you're supposed to laugh; this is where you should cry. It feels like a paint by numbers movie lesson about the ills of racism that comes across as a bit shallow and sunny despite the subject matter. There is a moment in the film where you see a newspaper headline about the Freedom Riders who were pioneers in the civil rights movement. If you've seen the powerful and unforgettable PBS documentary about these real life heroes, The Help will come across as a flimsy and pale attempt at depicting a complex and disturbing issue that still reverberates today. What the movie does have going for it are the strong performances of the mainly female cast. Emma Stone is earnest and full of luminous spunk as Skeeter Phelan the author of these women's tales. Viola Davis is understated and deeply touching as Aibileen, the first maid to open up to Skeeter about what it's like to serve in a White household. Octavia Spencer in a standout role as Minny Jackson is funny and fierce as the maid abused by both her husband and employer Hilly Holbrook. Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly conveys the essence of a cold heart wrapped in femininity to perfection. Jessica Chastain takes her character, Celia Foote the girl from the wrong side of the tracks and imbues her desire to be accepted with both sweetness and pain. Cicely Tyson is unforgettably moving in her flashback scenes as Constantine the Phelan family's lifelong maid and Skeeter's surrogate mother.The Help is designed to be a crowd pleaser that leaves the audience saying can you believe how these people used to behave in the South and that's the problem because segregation and discrimination were not only problems confined to the South. And, although we've come a long way since 1963, I couldn't fail to note that many in the audience where I watched the film have Black nannies raising their children. The movie is just a little too satisfied with itself and I don't think we're ready to be patting ourselves on the back just yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, ordinary and chilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bryce Dallas Howard chews the scenery, Violet Davis and Octavia Spencer seem to have sprung, passionate and inexorable as trees-of-life. Jessica Chastain stirs my empathy and sympathy as an erst-while poor white young lady who desperately needs the help and then some of an African-American maid. The breezy, affluent white men of the deep South cruise along seemingly oblivious of racial trouble just between the veneer of Southern hospitality. It amazes me how the human soul can become inured to almost anything. I can remember traveling in the old streetcars in downtown Detroit, never making eye contact with any persons of color - as if that was just the most natural attitude or perspective one could have, minister's preaching that that stance represented God's will. Movies like "Long Walk Home" and "Something the Lord Had Made" touched me more poignantly, when, for example, in the latter, Black people nonchalantly step off the sidewalk to allow white folks to traipse on by. In "Long Walk Home" we feel the pain of a Black maid who walked in heels for 15 miles. Bryce Dallas Howard is the repository human lightning rod in this film in terms of gathering in the viewer's sense of outrage, injustice and disgust. Like any good tragedy, it is the villain that makes the story work, and Howard could very well be nominated for a best-supporting Oscar for her inimical artistry in this film. I guess the most disturbing facet of this movie lurks behind the curtain: the fact that actresses as gifted as Davis and Spencer may not be able to find enough roles that Hollywood is willing to market, in this economy, in this society. It is sad that when art clashes with profit, the latter most always takes the field. This film is inhabited by consummate artists who can do more with an arched eyebrow, a look in the eye or merely by their very stance - than actors of lesser prowess can manage with scintillating scripts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am happy to write a review for this film. It has been a long time since I have seen a film which actually stood up for something. This entire cast presented a brilliantly acted, honest, sincere depiction of what happened during these troubling times. The humor throughout this film provided the right amount of comic relief, but did not take away from the severity of these horrible issues. There were so many great performances that I could write for hours about each one of them. I definitely do see this movie being up for Best Picture, and well as Best Ensemble cast. The women in this film held their own and produced a KNOCKOUT of a film. Congratulations to the writer, producer and director of this film, please take your bow! And congratulations to all of the women who brought us a dose of reality, you make me happy to be a WOMAN.... Enjoy your moment..You All Deserve It!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'd think this film would be some trite statement about racism. In fact it was a touching, human, simple but well woven, story which is touching and beautifully directed. The acting is superb and the characters excellent. It is set in a clearly racist era and location (Jacksonville, Mississippi), yet gracefully pulls out the subtleties of power structure and desire to conform that allows normally kind people to reinforce prejudice. The sub-plots are also superb (i.e. relationship between the main character and her mother). The news coverage of the civil rights movement is also brought into the film fluidly without dominating the story. Beautifully crafted but not 'arty' so a perfect film for families (no violence, sex and only very little (mild) swearing).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The book is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the book. I thought it was a bit fluffy, but it didn't quite cross the line into schlock. The movie, however, had too many melodramatic moments, especially toward the end. I'd have to read the book again, but I don't remember the scene where Abilene's church has a celebration for her, or where Abilene and Minnie tell Skeeter to not worry about them, that her success in New York will make what they did worth it. I could be wrong. Maybe it just didn't seem as sappy in the book.I also thought the movie actually minimized the attitude that whites had toward blacks by making it seem like the racism in Jackson came from mean-spirited people like Hilly, as if it wasn't rampant among everyone.The whole pie-eating thing trivialized what the maids went through and how they must have retaliated at times. It was too over-the-top in the movie and too much emphasis was put on it to the detriment of other parts of the story that would have rounded it out better.If you're on the fence on whether or not to see the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book. It might take a little longer, but it will be a more satisfying experience.</fullReview>

The actors were amazing especially Emma Stone this was definitely her best performance yet. in my opinion the movie was just as good as the book which doesn't happen very often. Emma Stone is not the only good actress in this though all the actors added to the films including Bryce Dallas Howard who portrayed 'hilly' amazingly. By the end of the movie I was in tears it is such a powerful movie that really makes you think about how different things were in the 60s. This movie inspired me definitely a must see!</fullReview>

Talk about courage and friendship, what an understatement. I couldn't imagine living back when people had such small minds but that's how it was. This movie was touching and very real, with a no hold back on feelings and the actors portraying them. Back to Bryce was amazingly cunning and bitchy while Emma was the sweetest but stood her ground! Sissy was hilarious in her small role that had a massive impact. Viola Davis drew me in and took me along for her ride of heartbreak and triumph. Oooohh don't forget Octavia Spencer, she was AMAZING!

		<shortDescription>2011's best drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the outset, I have to say that I have not read the novel by Kathyrn Stockett. Written for the screen and directed by her good friend Tate Taylor, The Help is one of the must see movies of the year.Strung together on a modest budget of 35 million, it has become one of the sleeper hits of the year with a domestic gross of over 160 million and still counting. Set in the background of 1960's civil rights struggle in America led by Martin Luther King, The Help focuses on the plight of African American housekeeper community and struggles against their racist white employers in suburban conservative Jackson,Mississippi. With an all star outstanding cast, it tells the story of a single independent white woman (Emma Stone) and her dogged pursuit to bring to light the plight of black cleaning maid community. When two of the help of the conservative households in Jackson come forward to tell their story, the struggles threads a thin line between fight for survival and a better future and fear of death from the dreaded and bigoted Ku Klux Klan. Portrayed brilliantly by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, the desperation and fear of the marginalised and oppressed Black community comes to fore with outstanding performances which is a sure bet for supporting actress nominations for both the actresses. The ensemble cast includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Jessica Chastain, Chris Lowell,Alison Janney and veteran actresses Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson .The performance of Cicely Tyson is one of the most the emotionally poignant scenes of the movie and though she has a screen time of just under two and half minutes, her performance is bound to make you reach for the tissues.The Help is a movie which will highlight how bad it was in the 1960's and how far we have come albeit with a long way to go to still achieve equality for all marginalised communities.The movie will make u get angry, frustrated, it will make u cry, and feel for the desperation of the maids and still manages to have its feel good moments.It is by far the best drama yet this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even with the mostly female cast, this is definitely a film for females and males alike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the opening weekend, The Help sat at number 2 in the box office, the next three weekends after that it sat at number 1. I saw it this last weekend and it ended as number 2 again.Based on a book of the same name, The Help follows the lives of African- American maids in the South during the 1960s. Issues like racism and civil rights are obviously apparent here.The film has grossed over $141 million with a budget of only $25 million. Quite a theatrical film feat if ya ask me.The main focus of the story is obviously on "The Help" book and the character that wrote it. Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, portrayed so elegantly by Emma Stone, is the author of said book. After coming back home from graduating at University of Mississippi, she finds that her childhood maid, Constantine, had quit. To Skeeter this doesn't add up as her maid was beloved.Seeing Emma Stone in such a serious drama like this one gave her a lot more respect. I've only known Emma as a comedic girly actor in films like Superbad, Zombieland, Easy A, and Crazy, Stupid, Love. Aforementioned comedies like those didn't present her true acting potential. This has to be Emma's best acting so far! I thought her popularity was over exaggerated this year, but I was wrong. It'll be interesting to see how she plays Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man.Other honorable mentions would have to be Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, who played the two main maid characters in Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson. The two combined presented most of the dramatic and comedic aspects of the film. I really enjoyed their performance. Truly were devoted to their characters. Well done!Everything about this movie was well done. The acting was great all around, the sets were visually appealing, the music flowed, the direction was there, and the story was great. It's hard to pick out something bad.9/10 Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't read the book prior to seeing this movie and I had no real expectations of what it was about but had heard this movie was worth seeing so we went. The story line was gripping from the first scene and kept my interest throughout. The friendships and relationships that were portrayed were insightful and captivating. I will say this movie will probably garner several academy award nominations. My only fear is that some of the actresses in this film will be nominated against each other. My picks are Octavia Spence for best supporting actress, Emma Stone for best actress and Mary J. Blige for best song. I can also see Alison Janney and Viola Davis receiving similar nominations.I was so overwhelmed with thought and emotion at the end of the movie that I sat there contemplating what I had just seen. Added to this was the song "The Living Proof" that was written and performed by Mary J. Blige that plays during the first part of the credits. MJB perfectly captured the emotion of the movie when she wrote this piece and she sings it from her soul. Check it out on YouTube.I am going back to the theater to see this film again and it will become part of my DVD collection as well. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie. It will change your life for the better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sitting through "The Help" I was immediately entranced by the stellar performances of Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer as Aibileen Clark and Minny Jackson. Both carried the film with exceptional wit, warmth and strength that couldn't have been done by finer actresses. I recommend watching the movie for their performances alone. As the credits rolled and I started my drive home however, I began to reflect on the film and began to find some cracks in its veneer.The largest complaint shared by "The Help's" critics, myself included is its tone which at times becomes too light and airy. Indeed the filmmakers seem to gloss over showing the true nature of racism or for that matter the true nature of spousal abuse. The inherent graveness of a maid divulging information about their employer in 1960's Mississippi just isn't there, at least not to a realistic level.The film also stumbles on its portrayal of many of its white characters. Emma Stone's Skeeter is immediately sympathetic but shows little development or character flaws. Bryce Dallas Howard's Hilly is likewise one note and hollow. Her southern belle act and tactless racism becomes more of a caricature than a real person. It makes me wonder how Skeeter and Hilly could have ever been high school friends.For all "The Help's" faults however, there is no getting around the stellar performances from its two heroines. The story really is fascinating and the comic set-pieces achieve their goals. In fact I would say the film itself achieved its goals; my argument is they should have aimed higher.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

One of the best movies that addresses racism realistically - You know, not everyone was evil while some were "evil"... much like the real world. The movie, was for the most part non- confrontational while accurately demonstrating a dark time in history... and shining the light on a person or group can make a difference and pride in ones self isn't a bad thing. The movie is well over two hours but keeps your interest the whole way... The movie takes you through several emotions and is very entertaining. GO see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My memories of this time in our history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the strength and measure of this movie is not in how closely it followed the book, or whether the characters were one-dimensional or fully developed, but rather in what memories it evoked in the viewer. I was a college freshman in 1963, so I well remember and was reminded of the unfairness of that time. I particularly remember a heated discussion I got into with a Sunday School teacher. I don't remember how it began, but it devolved into her saying to me, among other things, "Well, you wouldn't a colored person to spend the night in your home! And surely you wouldn't want to eat a meal in their house!" I thought this was just plain stupid, and said so. In fact, the maid who worked for us had spent several nights in our home when my mother was at the hospital with my grandmother. And she cooked my meals at our house, and I truly couldn't see the difference in that and eating at her house. By the time I met up with Mother for church, word had already reached her of my disrespect to the SS teacher. She just looked at me and said, "MUST you do things like that?" But she never told me not to. I think she was torn between agreeing with me and not wanting me to be disrespectful of my elders.Incidentally, I was informed that one referred to "coloreds" as "women," not "ladies." I asked why, and was informed that that was just the way it was. Once again, I replied with, "Stupid!" I also remembered the water fountains in the local Montgomery Ward. The shiny, new, water cooler had a sign above it that said, "Whites," while the old, stained, chipped water fountain (not cooler!) had a sign that said, "Coloreds." How reprehensible! I did not know from those days that some whites did not want or allow their maids to use the toilets in their homes. So I actually learned something from the movie.When I saw this movie today, sitting on the row behind me were 3 black ladies who were about the age to have been maids during the '60s. I felt such shame, wondering what painful experiences they must have been remembering.I would have liked to have seen more comments in these reviews about people's personal reactions and memories, and less synopsizing of the story.This is one movie I will look forward to purchasing when it becomes available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give it a chance &amp; make up your own mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Has some of the best acting ever and can be appreciated for that fact alone. There's a lot of controversy over using black life in the Old South as a backdrop for a young white woman's self-awakening. It's certainly guilty as charged on that count, but it's so high-quality it can still be enjoyed as a movie and as entertainment. It's not posing as a documentary, it's a Hollywood tear-jerking, inspirational, feel-good film with some fantastic characters and performances all the way around.Yes, I'm aware the book never happened, and that there are some excellent reasons why not. A real-life Skeeter would've been quickly discovered and discouraged - to put it mildly. The police and the Klan (often the same men) would've also firebombed some of the maids' houses and probably the church, too, just for good measure. At least one of the maids would've suffered terribly before being murdered or framed and imprisoned. So it's also a Hollywood fantasy, albeit a terrifically realized one. But guess what? Name your favorite movies and see how well they live up to reality. How many mob bosses were anything like Don Vito or Michael Corleone? Could Mexican farmers round up seven great gunfighters to risk their lives for them for $20 apiece? Or make it seven samurai doing the same thing for a bowl of rice a day. How closely did the Malcolm X movie actually follow his autobiography? See what we're getting into here? Like my father once said: "You pay your money and sit down and then you decide for yourself how much of it you want to believe." The point here is to just relax and enjoy some epic acting - not hambone emoting, but truly nuanced portrayals and skillfully designed and actualized characterizations. Give "The Help" a chance and make up your own mind about whether you like it or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up in Alabama and was in my early 20s at the time of this story. I can understand some of the criticism from Black Female writers when they talk about the extension of "Mammie" stories, and, not exposing the real horror and violence of the period. But, most of us in that era were shielded from the bad. But we did experience the everyday life of the love and life of our "maid". The real fiction is that no one had the courage to write the novel at that time, instead of 50 years later. The movie was true to the book. It is just wonderful to see a movie that exposes history and teaches us lessons in life, with humor, sadness, great dialog, and no sex nor violence.</fullReview>

While I did enjoy watching it, I found that some of the story lines as well as the depth of some of the characters, especially Elizabeth Lefolt, suffered from the necessity of shortening the story to fit it into a 2 hour and 17 minutes movie. The acting of all main characters was solid, with my favorites being Minnie Aibeleen and Mrs. Walters. It is an entertaining movie to watch, but it does not measure up to the book.

		<shortDescription>A Movie That Helps To Expose The Racial Divide That Yet Remains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unintentional and revealing shock of this movie isn't how the trailers and previews misled the audience as to the nature of this movie, but that the marketing arm and distributor felt that it was necessary (perhaps rightly so) to depict the movie more as primarily a comedy rather than a drama in the first place. Fifty years after this period piece takes place, the irony is that the emotional drama and power of this movie arises for its "contemporary" audience from the likelihood that we can be shocked by this movie at all and its ability to push the audience's racial button after all this time. Like the hidden embarrassment of sexual products on commercial television, this movie seems to have dared to expose the dirty laundry in a balanced drama, lightened with elements of humor.Unlike The Stepford Wives (2004) that used comedy as its primary platform to expose the dichotomy of the 1950s with todays societal values, The Help in the same way Uncle Tom's Cabin published in 1852 (there were not movies back then) brings to the mainstream audience a serious but balanced and mainstream acceptable version of the racial divide of the 1950s. The Help is a break through movie for our times that oddly enough may or may not hold up in 50 or 100 years unless it becomes memorable for its revelation at least in mainstream movies, the racial blindness of its history America still retained so many years later at the Civil Rights era. Or maybe like Schindler's List (1993), the shocking but revealing World War II drama, The Help may be able to retain its historical value aside from its present day exposure of today's America's subconscious.The Help is a deeply revealing, emotional compelling inward look at America and allows mainstream America to become sensitively aware of the thin veneer that remains covering over the racial prejudice that still pervades America today, even as the gains made over the past 30,40 years have been wiped away, especially with the Great Recession and the political atmosphere that has become a backdrop of everyday existence for African Americans and other minorities in this Country.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted this movie to be good but I was disappointed at how we saw more about the white families than about the maids and their families. If the filmmakers wanted to be an historically accurate think-piece, they really should not have made the trailers make the movie seem like a comedy. If they wanted it to be a comedy, they shouldn't have included some of the more vicious racial elements. It ended up being a movie that made you laugh at parts and really made you squirm in your seat at other parts but left you feeling like you were robbed of something that could have been really great. All that being said, however, it was a pretty good main-stream movie touching on the subject of household help and the racial tensions involved in the nascent Civil Rights era of the 50s and 60s that I haven't seen before. It was interesting to see how these women so bonded with their employer's children and how the children saw their maids as their second (or even "real") mothers.Basically, it was a good movie but don't expect to learn much from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw a preview of this film last night, and it was one of the most moving films I've seen in quite a long time. I went through all of the emotions: anger, sadness, happiness...there were plenty of laughs and plenty of tears.Emma Stone shines brightly as the films headstrong protagonist, Eugenia (Skeeter), who barrels against social injustice through her compilation of the accounts of numerous Black maids in 1960's Jackson, Mississippi into a compelling novel. Emma shows off her range, giving us a both a no-nonsense, determined Skeeter, as well as a softly emotional, tender Skeeter, as we are privy to her inner motivations.The casting of this film is impeccable. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer are wonderful in the roles of Aibileen and Minny, respectively, Viola providing the heart and soul, Octavia the lightheartedness and laughs. Jessica Chastain is a breath of fresh air as the kind, whimsical, somewhat air-headed and misunderstood Celia Foote. And who could forget Bryce Dallas Howard as the villainous Hilly, whom we despise with all our hearts. I could not have chosen a better cast for this film, as all were truly capable of their roles, and brought this film to life.I give this film 8 of 10 stars, because though it was wonderfully insightful and touching, I felt the pacing was somewhat slow and meandering, though there were a few bursts of high activity. There were also a few cuts from scene to scene that did not flow well. Overall though, I thought this movie was fantastic and I would definitely see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LOVE This must see movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this film were total fiction bearing no relation to reality, it would still be worth seeing for the fine acting and production values--even if some of the young white women approached "Southern Gothic." But it wasn't fiction--at least, the depiction of Southern society wasn't. As I watched I kept drifting back to small-town South Carolina in the 1950s, where I grew up. It was moving and disturbing to be reminded how black people were treated then--loved and yet "kept down in their place." Our neighborhood was all middle-class and every family had a maid. There were plenty of boys my age, we visited in each other's homes, and called every maid by her first name. One even started a baseball team for the little white boys, for which her reward was a visit by the Klan.Our maid helped my mother cook and clean. One of my parents picked her up and took her home every day--and she rode in the back seat. She ate her lunch in our kitchen--without being allowed to use our utensils. I remember her eating with her fingers. I do not remember ever seeing her use our bathrooms. I thought about that during the movie and truly cannot recall what she did, an embarrassing gap in memory.I do remember when my father was out of work and our maid had to be cut back to three days a week. I actually cried; she was a member of our family. When talk about civil rights began in the late 1950s, my mother became annoyed at our maid for getting "uppity." And so it went. We moved to central Florida in 1961, where there were no maids.Travel back in time with this film. It's quite real, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disney does racism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film won a deserving best supporting actress Oscar and lost out a best actress Oscar to a performance in a film that as of this writing has an IMDb score of 6.4, that more than anything sums up The Help. The important story is overshadowed by a more marketable one, which to Disney's credit is what they do best, they are marketing juggernauts. As for The Help it never feels genuine, in the same way that most people of a certain age remember white Christmases, when in reality the historical data shows there were actually very few. That is The Help, a white Christmas from our past that is marketing induced rather than a truly honest memory of the way things were.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Casting for all the wrong roles.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love how this film has a great casting, but the acting is a bit rubbish on the Caucasian side of the cast. Other than that, I love the film for its message.Emma Stone is awesome. Viola Davis is QUEEN! Octavia Spencer is amazing in the film.The others are amazing, but I think that they are suited for other roles. But that's just my opinion, though. I really think that they could have pulled more out of the book rather than historical footage of people alive then. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. This is like the first film that I've seen them in. And I love them in the roles that they were casted in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Change begins with a whisperStarring Emma Stone, Viola Davis and Octavia SpencerScreenplay by Tate Taylor.Novel by Kathryn StockettDirected by Tate TaylorBased on the bestselling book by Kathryn Stockett, this movie is powerfully evocative and really makes you think. It's not a fun movie, it's quite disturbing and pulls at your heart strings. The acting is top class all the way through and the attention to detail is superb. We are transported back in time and there's no way back until the final credit.Having said all that I found it a little bit boring. For all the emotional impact, I like my movies to excite me in some way. And this didn't to be honest. For me it lacked a little bit of something to keep me hooked, to keep me on the edge of my seat. And there was one extra problem. I really needed subtitles. I couldn't understand half of what was being said. When you can't hear or understand every other line that's being spoken it doesn't help!But I'm in the UK and that southern drawl ( or whatever it's called) was pretty hard to follow!7.5/10 Mainly for the acting and the attention to detail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than you would expect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe you believe that there is no need for yet another movie about black segregation and the civil rights movement and think that it has no pertinence to modern society's form of racism, but you have to admit that this was a decently done movie. At the very least, it avoids many of the pitfalls that other racial segregation movies fall into. It demonizes a pretty small amount of white characters, and aptly addresses how peer pressure was more important than hatred in continued segregation. Also, it only focuses partially on race. The selling point of the movie is the racial aspect, but it's more about being a maid and getting the story told. We don't hate Hilly Holbrook because she's racist, we hate her because she is unappreciative of the work that Minny does for her.All of the characters are easy to follow, which is remarkable considering how many important characters there are. Even when they were talked about by other characters, I had no trouble figuring out who the characters were referring to. You won't need to know everyone's name, but you likely will know 80% of the names. Even the absence of Constantine, who only makes one brief and profound appearance, has an important role to the plot that is exposed well enough to understand easily. We get unique emotional access to every character, almost none of which is accomplished by means of racism. One character point that was really good was Abilene's attachment to the children she raised. It showed how much pride she took in her work despite her disgust at Mrs. Leefolt, and also let us know that she didn't just remain a maid out of necessity.The story is extremely character driven, which is mostly possible because it is based on fiction and not on any historical events. A historical time period, yes, but that's different than being tied down to an event that has to be shown and slows the plot down. I got the sense that the author is not that fond of southern culture in general, especially since Skeeter is the protagonist and is trying to break away from that culture. One viable quip that can be made is that the black maids are made to be too perfect. This could be said for Abilene, but Minny brings plenty of humanity to balance this out. Not faults exactly, but we definitely don't get the sense that Minny is perfect in any way. The same goes for Skeeter, who isn't black but is on the side of the maids. I suppose you could also say that it is partial against men, since all three men that have any kind of importance are made to seem kind of stupid. But then again, guys are stupid, and the women had plenty of faults themselves.Those issues aside, it's a very engaging story that keeps you interested and even entertained at several points. The pacing is great and there's a good balance of how much each character is shown. It's a bit long, especially for the genre and feels longer because of how the story continues on for a while after the book is published. The acting is great from almost every part. I thought Emma Stone and Allison Janney deserved Oscar nominations just as much as Jessica Chastain.Don't choose this if you're looking for something about the civil rights movement. If you hate movies like that, I would suggest that you give this one twenty minutes. There's minimal white guilt-tripping and racism is only a part of the plot, not the whole thing. It's a good family movie despite the PG-13 rating. Also, it's good to watch if you want to go into any form of journalism or communications field. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Help' Packs In Some Serious Girl Power And Is One Of The Best Films Of Its Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Crafted with care, told with composure &amp; powered by strong feminine energy, The Help is a wicked combination of comedy &amp; drama that manages to touch on serious issues without ever discarding its funny side. Entertaining &amp; enlightening in equal doses, this period drama is a roller-coaster ride of emotions that delivers a powerful jolt while also boasting moments of genuine laughter.Set during the 1960s, the story of The Help follows a young woman who aspires to be a successful writer and, after witnessing the poor treatment of African-American maids from their employers on a daily basis, decides to reveal their side of the story by writing a book detailing their experiences. Assisting to bring her noble work to life are two maids who work for her white socialite friends.Written &amp; directed by Tate Taylor, the film packs a few dense moments in between but maintains a lighthearted tone for the majority of its runtime. Taylor could have gone for a serious, hard-hitting drama about the racial injustice &amp; hardships these housemaids go through on a daily basis but the witty dimension gives this tale an accessible layer that gets the job done without trying too hard.Production design team does a fab job at recreating the required 1960s setting, Cinematography is expertly carried out, for the images brim with warm palette &amp; bright lighting while fluid movements of the camera keep the drama sharp &amp; resonant. Its 146 minutes runtime is never felt, thanks to its steady pacing &amp; first-rate editing. And Thomas Newman's score is able to evoke the apt emotions with its serene tracks.Coming to the performances, The Help features a powerful ensemble in Emma Stone, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jessica Chastain, Allison Janney &amp; Sissy Spacek, and all of them get their moment to shine. Davis delivers the most powerful performance of them all, and is closely followed by Spencer. Stone is absolutely adorable, Dallas Howard does well with what she is given, while Chastain pretty much steals the show &amp; is my absolute favourite here.On an overall scale, The Help is a skilfully directed, deftly written, brightly photographed, smartly edited, calmly composed &amp; ingeniously performed cinema that could've done a tad more with its provocative themes but in the end, it still succeeds as a rich example of its genre that's enjoyable, amusing &amp; illuminating. Sophisticated in all filmmaking departments, strengthened by a casting powerhouse &amp; keeping a firm grip on the viewers' senses, The Help is one of the best films of its year that's worth your time &amp; money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film brings to life some of the most well written characters and scenes in 2010's, making it a favorite amongst filmophiles. Emotional charge throughout the film is summed up perfectly by chemistry between the actress'(!!!), which really is phenomenal. To be able to show this disgraceful part of our (American) history and put it into drama that outgrows its genre (with comic additions) is something not many filmmakers did. So many emotions and shocks are served, that you really wish it to be fictional. The sad part is, this really happened not so long ago. Fascinating as it may seem, realness of the situation makes a film soulfull and even better. Connection between characters and viewers are "awarded" with real explosions of emotions; that just shows what masterpiece this motion picture really is, standing from a viewer, that can connect perfectly with "the help". Maybe, I will find myself writing another review of the film, but certainly after I read the book, which, as I learned, has to be even better like in every other book-to-screen adaptation. If this is possible...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help is the movie that can teach the world with its an amazing messages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is a movie that focuses on the life style of the white and colored people of Jackson, Mississippi in early 19 century. Emma Stone, who played the character of Skeeter took a risk of contacting the black maids in that city to gather the information about their life/what it looks like to be them. The major actor/actress with their character names are: Emma Stone played as Eugenia Skeeter, Viola Davis as Aibileen Clark, Octavia Spencer as Minny Jackson, Bryce Dallas as Hilly Holbrook, and Jessica Chastain as Celia Foote. Skeeter was an educated young lady who wanted to be a write. In those days majority of the women are stay home moms. Skeeter had a pressure from her mom and her society that she wasn't married even if that wasn't her first priority at that time. Skeeter had a job, and that made her different from the other women in the society in those days as well. Skeeter asked Aibleen if she could interview her what it looks like to raise other people's children while her own kinds are looked down by others. Even if she wasn't 100% happy to do that because of the risk that could come with it, she finally agreed. She continued her interview, but still she needed another maid to gather the information from since her publisher, who lived in New York pushed her to do that. While Skeeter and Aibleen were doing the interview secretly, Minny, Aibileen's friend caught them, and she went crazy. She was so sad that Aibileen agreed to take the risk of doing the interview. Minny's anger didn't stay longer. She also decided to join. Her publisher kept pushing Skeeter to get the information at least from dozen of them, which wasn't easy to find all these colored maids who would be willing to give the information. The pressure from white people on the black people had become worst. The black kids are killed on the street, black and white people couldn't share the same taxi, they didn't have pay vacation, and the black maid couldn't use their employer's bathroom. These and other unpleasant deeds encouraged others to give their testimony, and Skeeter got lucky. She was able to gather all the information she needed and also she added about the maid who raised her as well. Her book titled The Help finally published. Their voice was heard by others through this book. Skeeter finally got a job in New York and Aibileen got fired from the job. Doing what Skeeter did wasn't totally easy at that time for her and also for the maids. But courage and determination is what you can see in all of them to do what they did. The themes of this movie are: moral implication. The way white people treated their maid had a huge effect on their moral and totally on the community of black people in that area. The other theme is social problem. Also human relationships and moral riddle are two of the themes that I found critical. The relationship between Skeeter and those maids has brought the life change of that community though the risk was huge and tough. The themes of The Help reminded me the movie called 12 Years a Slave. The messages of these two movies are very similar for me. Many different techniques were used in The Help. One of these many techniques that were used was, the lighting. In the scene where Skeeter interviewed Aibileen, the light wasn't very bright and this showed to me that they were hiding from others and that the decision they took was moral riddle. The other one is the scene where Celia made speech at the charity meeting. In this scene, the angel of the camera showed that there is a boss and employee relationships between Celia and the maids. This is relevant to the moral implication. Generally, the help is a very teaching movie that can be message to the whole world. These problems are not limited to Mississippi. People around the world can learn from this movie since the themes can be important messages to the whole world as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie after seeing it on a list of top movies to watch. And I have to say it is indeed a must watch movie. The story was well written, acting was on point and it had high points as well as sad points.I like to judge a movie by how many emotions I feel while watching it and how quickly it can make me shift between those emotions. This movie did just that and it was on the ball every time.Emma Watson was great in her role as was everybody else. Her supporting cast was excellent. If you want to see a movie about the civil right movement that gives you a good perspective of what people on the front lines felt,but that isn't that offensive, this is the one to see. Being from Canada I do not have a lot of first hand knowledge of what took place during that time, but travelling to the South frequently I would like to have a better understanding. This movie let me see the things I already knew but from a different point of view, the human one. I give this film two thumbs up and highly suggest that you watch it to see for yourselves why I am giving it such high praises.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An aspiring author (Emma Stone) during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the African-American maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis.Exactly how accurate this is, I have no idea. My assumption is that it is fairly close to the truth. The idea that a maid is the daughter of a maid, and that maid is the daughter of a "house slave"... this seems about right. Because slavery ended does not mean racism went away. And because slavery ended, it does not mean the former slaves suddenly had access to better jobs. Maids and butlers seem like the next step to keep the (unfortunate) continuity.The costumes and hair deserve much credit. Emma Stone unfortunately looks like Lindsay Lohan in this film, but others are almost unrecognizable. Allison Janney? Wow. A simple change of hair and she is whole different person...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*Contains Spoilers!** Summary and Visual Analysis on The Help</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie based on a novel originally written by Kathryn Stockett, is showcased in three southern women residing in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960's. The movie showcases a spectrum of individual personalities in the lives of Aibileen, Minny and Skeeter (known as Eugenia Phelan.) The movie was primarily focused on the struggles these women faced in a very racially biased south and the adversities women faced on the job market in the 1960's. Stockett created beautiful waves in how she made individuals aware of the ugliness that can happen in life, but the beauty that occurs within that ugliness when times are unforgiving. In the case I'm thinking about, Skeeter, played by Emma Stone, was an aspiring journalist living in Jackson on the forefront of race issues in the south. Skeeter, while searching for her dream job, was also searching for Constantine, her family's loyal maid that was suddenly "let go." In the search for Constantine, Skeeter realized that the maids whom supply services to her friends (essentially labeled "the help") are treated extremely differently than white employees. Later, Skeeter decides to create a column in a local newspaper to display this "mistreatment" and unfairness being done by the families of these maids in the south. Skeeter gets the "okay" to do this through having tips also written within the text in order to gain authority from her primarily white readers.In the column, Skeeter decides to use her comrades to tell their stories in order to obtain excessive attention with hopes to change the trend of blacks being extremely mistreated and unfairly rewarded for their services. Aibileen, a maid and partial nanny, agrees to share her misfortunes and tips for being a maid in the column displayed in their local newspaper. After endless efforts to get more maids and "help" on board with the project, Aibileen's friend, Minny also agrees to share her adversities. Since the column in the local paper was so scrutinized by the individuals who employ the maids and nannies, Skeeter essentially put her works and the words of the help into a book, published it, and entitled it, The Help. (Shmoop.com, 2015)The novel and movie truly opened eyes in a different light. Stockett focused on the women that suffered through the race imbalances in the south. In doing this, a white woman and two black women worked together toward a common goal: to forever cease the harsh realities of being a poorly-paid and treated maid in the deep south during the '60's and '70's. Viewers are able to witness comedy and heart-felt emotions all while receiving a not-so-common history lesson. Not only were these women facing excruciatingly harsh realities in regards to race, but on the job front as well. Skeeter, a young white female was unable to find work for a long period of time. Individuals in the south were not comfortable with allowing someone to essentially "choose the wrong side" and make that information public. Stockett really grand slammed this novel turned into a movie because of the bases she covered. One scene I remember vividly in the movie occurred when Minny, a maid of individuals who treated her below them, though really hilarious, acted in a way that only she could justify. In this scene, Minny baked a pie that she personally delivered to Hilly Holbrook, her house employer. At the end of the movie, it is apparent and learned that inside the pie that Minny baked for the villainous Holbrook, Minny placed her own feces in it. It's little (disgusting) acts displayed like that which really bring humor into a very serious issue. Additionally, Minny gets abused by her husband each night, another adversity she faces in addition to her job. (Shmoop.com, 2015) After I read the first couple chapters of this book, I knew I wanted to see the movie. It is fascinating to me how little individuals know about things that are sublets of the bigger pictures. Sure, we all learned about the endless imbalances of racial issues in the south and across America, especially in the 1950's through the 1970's. But who ever actually thought of the jobs within that conflict that showcased women specifically? It's very moving to me that Stockett focused a novel turned movie on something so miniscule in regards to the "bigger picture" of race, but so damaging to so many women's lives. I admire that she wrote about three different women of more than one race working together to achieve and tackle a goal much bigger than themselves. The Help showcases how America was very close-minded and stubborn to the fact that women of more than one race were gasping for some kind of hold of society and were never rewarded it. Through Skeeter's work and the stories of Minny and Aibileen, The Help was a success and showcased more than enough history for me to open my eyes.</fullReview>

The range of emotions I experienced can be credited to not only the excellence of the story writing but the quality of the acting and the personality of the actors chosen to portray each role. I especially appreciated that the focus was to develop the characters of the maids as opposed to the white ladies that they worked for. This allows for a consistency between the main character's goal to write from the Negro perspective and the goal of the film itself. Unfortunately, it seems that some critics think that this film and storyline are not realistic. It has been criticized for simplifying the complex race relations and omitting the various forms of violence that characterize the time period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is directed &amp; written by Tate Taylor and features an A-list ensemble led by Emma Stone, Viola Davis, and Octavia Spencer. The film is set in Jackson, Mississippi during the early '60s of the U.S., back when the country was still segregated, and follows avid college graduate Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan who earns a job as a columnist for a local newspaper to fulfill her aspirations of becoming a writer. However, as she comes to know the black household maids belonging to her closest friends, including friendly Aibileen (Viola Davis) &amp; sassy Minny (Octavia Spencer), as well as the lives they have to deal with every day, she decides to do something incredibly important yet out of law: publish a book consisting of stories from the largest number of negro maids she can. Along the way, unlikely friendships are made, some bonds are broken, and the truth will inspire.The poppy poster for this film screams "chick flick!", but do not let it mislead you like it did for me. This is a film I implore you to watch. What we have here is an very underrated, truthful, smart, emotional showcase that is handled with such vivid beauty by everyone involved. I can safely say this is one of the most well-executed &amp; well-written films I've come across in some years. Tate Taylor's last film was this largely ignored indie, but this one will truly bring him to light. Why? Because he brings the troubled and evocative experiences of all parties to light magnificently.They can come from something as anger-inducing as a racist bridge club's bill preposition for a separate bathroom in every white home to something as raw as a white 4-year-old thinking of her maid as her mother. In fact, that strong but risky relationship is such a solid and emotional drive for the story as well as a flesher. When Skeeter is devastated to learn that her lifelong maid Constantine was fired by her prissy mother because of old age, it immediately follows with a flashback that establishes the special connection that they shared. When the maid's fate is presented later, it is arguably one of the most emotionally powerful "quiet" scenes I've seen. Even Aibileen finds it hard to think of leaving her master's little daughter, Mobley Mae. Aibileen's true character compared to Mae's mother is breathtakingly established with Mae's words to the maid, "You are my real mom."Many people are criticizing how the majority of characters here are stereotypical; yes, they're all different people common in a segregated society, but thanks to the creative and acting department, each one of these people, even the ones that start out hackneyed, are given layers of flesh and depth that makes each one of their stories a thoughtful yet entertaining journey. Both Viola Davis and Emma Stone are pushed to their respective powers, exhibiting quiet courage and fierce respect for one another. Bryce Dallas Howard, portraying a racist club leader, makes her Hilly Holbrook such a clever and hateful antagonist. The elderly black who plays Constantine shines in her short scenes. But Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain's work has got to be the most intriguing and interesting relationship in the film. Spencer lends a cautious wit and an unstoppable comedic spark to Minny, an already well-realized character, and it's amazing to watch her entire perspective &amp; approach towards whites change during her service for kind but social outcast Celia Foote (Chastain). A particular scene where Foote willingly sits at the same makeshift table with Minny establishes that there's soul to be found in both races, absolutely true. My only real problem with the film is that its sense of realism is slightly off. Certain situations that are overly racist seem too evil to be true. Tech-wise, Thomas Newman delivers a perfect score as always, having delved into my soul in 2013's Saving Mr. Banks. It takes a little more time than usual to be fully immersed into the American life of segregation, but once racism and all of those issues are realized on screen, then the film will have you on a hook. I was honestly adamant about seeing this movie, thinking it would be this sappy boring drag made for young ladies, but, man, there was not one dull moment of screen-time wasted here, everyone was perfect in the role, and it hits just the right mark on heartfelt impact. I can see why it got that Best Picture nod in 2011...it's one of the best of that year.</fullReview>

I feel the movie lacks of a true 'activist soul,' which it needed to become a flawless work of art. Again, the female performances and the 'drama' underneath the personal history of each character made me enjoy the process of watching it.We need more movies that explore these subjects, but also, empower the people in it, more than just an anonymous book.

		<shortDescription>A Heartwarming Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is an extraordinary film that makes the viewer laugh, cry, and has every minute of their attention. Unlike some Civil Right's movies that take a more serious route, The Help is more light hearted where it ties together an "unlikely" friendship that would occur during its time period, yet is still very effective to get its moral across. Together, Skeeter's ambition, Aibileen's generous heart, and Minny's wit, spark a "revolutionary" movement across Jackson, Mississippi. The Help not does not just focus on the life of the 3 main characters, but draws attention to their help and support to main people in their lives, such as Aibileen's nurture in trying to boost little Mae Mobley's self esteem, who is imperfect to her mother, (Aibileen' tells Mae: "You is kind. You is smart. You is important"), Minny's own nurturing of her employer, Celia Foote, as well as Skeeter's attempt to nurture her relationship with Stuart. The Help is truly a beautiful film that captures the concept of equality for all, and that friendships matter solely on acceptance and care, rather than race or ethnicity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie. An emotional roller-coaster, highlighting the racial inequality and prejudices of America's past. Not perfect - some scenes seem unnecessary, and the whole thing isn't entirely seamless. (The unnecessary scenes don't weigh on the movie though, as they are often contain humorous detours). Also the ending is a bit too neat, and quick, after the slow, deliberate build-up.However, the flaws are more than negated by the beauty, spirit and emotion of the movie, and the feeling that you are witnessing history and change in the makingGreat performances all round. Octavia Spencer won the 2012 Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of Minny and Viola Davis and Jessica Chastain got Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress nominations respectively, all of which were well-deserved. Emma Stone showed that she is more than a comedy actress, putting in a superb dramatic performance. Remaining cast, which includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Sissy Spacek and Allison Janney, don't put a foot wrong.Surely a classic: a sad reminder of the racial injustices of the past and an uplifting reminder of how these were overcome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Help" is the definition of a drama movie and it has to do with the human rights and it returns us back to time when white families had African-American people to work for them. This movie is based on the book which wrote by Kathryn Stockett and shows all of these and how difficult was for those people to just survive with these situations.I liked this movie very much because of the direction which made by Tate Taylor who I believe that he did a spectacular job. I also liked this movie because of the interpretations of Viola Davis who plays as Aibileen Clark and she was just outstanding, Octavia Spencer who plays as Minny Jackson and she also did a nice interpretation. Another good interpretations made by Emma Stone who plays as Skeeter Phelan and Bryce Dallas Howard who played as Hilly Holbrook.Finally I have to tell you that "The Help" is a movie that makes you feel all the feelings of those people and how difficult times were there. I believe that it's a must see movie and I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am deeply touched by this movie! It goes without saying that it is superbly made in every aspect regarding movie-making standards, no need to comment on that. What I like the most about it is that it doesn't aim to shock you, there are no scenes of open physical violence, no extremes of any kind yet it gets to you and very much so! It is a serious, sad, and painful subject and takes a truly talented and skillful artists to show all that but still make a movie that you enjoy watching. Although you get soaked in and emotional and can't avoid thinking about pointless cruelty of human nature, injustice, selfishness (and questioning yourself on those issues) while watching this movie doesn't live you depressed and negative - on the contrary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Help" delves into the issue of color discrimination and very sensitively puts the story of social discrimination on the blacks. The story is seen through the eyes of a black maid who brings up the children of whites and ultimately gets fired from her job as the children grow up. The similar faith goes with some other black maids of the surrounding. The plot revolves around few American families where the blacks served as maids and in return couldn't even use their wash rooms. The theme comes quite vividly in this social drama. Slow at times and at times losing its pace, many sequences of the film are quite touching and make you emotional. The film deserves a big applause for the touching drama and a tremendous performances from the lead, especially Octavia Spencer who gets an Oscar nod as the black maid, Minney and Viola Davis as Aibileen.Rating: 3 stars out of 4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is set in the strict segregated state of Mississippi. Living in the midst of the civil rights movement, being a colored maid, called the help, makes life much harder. An eccentric twenty-three year old novelist wannabe, Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone), decided to write a book about the perspective of these ladies about the family they work with. Skeeter Phelan, just like the other 1960s white kids, grew up in the arms of their family's help. She loved her almost more than her own mother. Skeeter has dealt with numerous problems regarding segregation laws and her friend, Hilly. With the help of two unusual maids, Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer), Skeeter successfully publishes her book.Tate Taylor, director of the movie, intended the viewers to leave their twenty-first century mind behind. The movie was set to give watchers the feel of living in 1960s America before the racial acceptance we have today. From what I perceive, the movie wants viewers to think about how far our country has social equality not only in race but also in gender. I notice that most of the women in the film were striving to find husbands who could provide them a good life. The movie, for me, depicted male dominance of the past. This gender inequality was also shown in the African-American side when Minny's husband hit her after losing her job as a help.Living outside the United States, my knowledge about the American history is limited and watching this kind of movie broadens my understanding. Aside from the history factor of the movie, I also thought that the little kid in Aibileen's care was fantastic. To be honest, Aibileen and the little kid's acting made me move to tears for a little bit. My family also used to have a help back when I was young and those scenes made me nostalgic about my past. There were some things I thought that did not fit for the movie though. It was the scene when Minny showed a can of Crisco, which is a food shortening, to Celia while teaching her how to cook. I just thought that the design of the Crisco can was too modern for that time period. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the watching the movie.</fullReview>

She is tired of all the traditions people continue to maintain while the world outside is changing. When outrages keep piling on, she asks the housekeepers to tell their stories.This is a humanistic film. It has eye opening insights into the southern culture of that time. It has shocking scenes and funny scenes... and shocking funny scenes.The best part of this film was the introduction of so many great actresses to the world.

You participate in the film, feel empathy and enjoy it.The story is about the hard life of a black American maids in the homes of white during the time of president Kennedy. In these confused times, we are shown the racist problems in a very clever way - above mentioned plot. They pulled out a large number of social problems of everyday Americans, focusing on the deep human values &#x200b;&#x200b;that naturally stay deep within us demanding to overcome ourselves, to reach them and start living with them.

		<fullReview>I love this movie various reasons. One of it being that it deals with a writer who has found a scoop which also means a lot to her. The other element is that the movie is dealt with real events, social problems that were in the following decades abolished. The movie gives the audience the social problems and yet keeps the movie in a light jovial, comic atmosphere.This is true and I have learned it the hard way that the majority of people don't want to end a movie on a sad note, leaving the audience feeling down. We did a production of Romeo and Juliet at our school, the audience was with us when it came to the love scenes and fights but when it came to the star crossed lovers death and the sorrow of the parents the crowd just wanted to leave all that sad behind. I can understand this because frankly I don't want to go home from a film or play feeling pathetic, unless what I have witnessed was a masterpiece of a performance. This movie THE HELP got a brilliant harmony of seriousness and joviality.Know some of you might be surprised to find that the situation from where I write, which is India is still the same. What was the scene of MAIDS in the US in 1960's is the scene of MAIDS IN India TODAY. The Maids are treated the same, I can say this with certainty because right here at my own house I see it. The servant has a toilet in the garden which she can use, separate glass for the maid to drink tea from and off course the maid is not supposed to use the sofas to sit on, only the floor. This is the scene of maids all around the country; you can easily find that out by asking someone who leaves in India. The African American women were so much more defiant than the maids here and cooler too, I am just never having a pie by my Maid :P I Know the scene in India will change in the few decades ahead. All I can guarantee though is that I won't do these things to any human being and this movie is also the FIRST REVIEW I'M WRITING.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a difference between fantasy and myth, and for me this film is an attempt to mythologise the not-so-distant past, but ends up being only a (good) fantasy, inviting viewers to feel good too easily. Fine performances, overly-fine sets. That being said, good idea to mythologise the past, surely! But not without impacting the present, in other words, it is too easy to feel good coming away from this. In moral terms, it is nearly a black-and-white (no pun intended) presentation of the era, distancing itself too easily from messier, greyer reality. Perhaps it is worth it to simply let us play at being the daughter and the white person of our dreams, but I think today is worth too much to accept such a rendering of our past.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed "The Help" but for all the wrong reasons. I loved the high production values, the beautiful lighting, the shots of ripe agricultural fields in the Deep South. I especially loved the exquisite, tailor-fit, vintage, early 1960s dresses worn by the white actresses. I got a huge kick out of the over-the-top performances. Bryce Dallas Howard, though a living person, is every bit the Walt Disney cartoon villainess. You love hating her. You grimace when she cackles and you cackle as she reaches her inevitable, and utterly unbelievable, nightmare, revenge-dream-fantasy downfall. Howard should have won an academy award. Viola Davis, who radiates soul and depth and can make you cry just by walking into a room, is the deep, rich heart of this otherwise silly film. Octavia Spencer is adorable. She's as big-eyed and woebegone as a DW Griffith Gish sister. I have no idea why Emma Stone is the star. She can't act much and she isn't a drop dead beauty. Maybe she knows someone. "The Help" is about black-white relations in Mississippi in the early 1960s. Jim Crow Mississippi was a terrorist state. That sounds like an extremist statement; it is not. The Mississippi Sovereignty Commission planted spies in every nook and cranny of Mississippi life. It aided at least one assassin, Byron de la Beckwith, who murdered Medgar Evers. This deadly serious, tense, historic era is reduced, in "The Help," to a very pretty soap opera featuring magical Negroes ? a term used to describe black characters in mostly white films who exist only to provide a means for the main, white character to grow. You notice immediately in "The Help" that the white women are all slim, elegantly and flatteringly dressed, and pretty. The black women are plump, older, and plain. But, this is an uplifting film about Civil Rights, so all the black women are noble, giving, selfless, and saintly, while all, except one, of the whites are vicious, vacuous, selfish, and bad mothers. Also, all the whites are filthy rich. Was it really that way, you have to ask? No, it wasn't. Mississippi has one of the highest white poverty rates in the US. And some whites joined the Civil Rights struggle, performing the ultimate sacrifice, and giving their own lives. Still waiting for a feature film about Viola Liuzzo. Maybe it's not such a bad thing that simplistic and overtly exploitative movies like this get made. If they interest any viewers in the Civil Rights movement, that's not a bad thing. Maybe it will inspire some to see a truly worthy film series, "Eyes on the Prize."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film really needs help (in a negative way)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have not read the novel, but whoever directed this film probably intended to make one that was toned down without any complications that would have made this movie too controversial and heavy to watch.Though shallow, simplistic and many times splashing out 'fairy-tale pixie dust' all over, the film still contained enough power to be as heartwarming as it can be. What I also like about it is it not only dealt with the theme of racial tension, it also humorously covered those within people of the same race but with contrasting personalities. I am also impressed that changes meant some things were not meant to end well.However, sadly the potential was not utilized to the utmost and this became disappointing for a film of such calibre and material that I expect it to be. I thought it could have been a lot more, as well as a lot less of the conflict between characters that I don't quite get how they fit into the bigger picture. Some of the characters were too forward-thinking, did not act like a woman of that time, or oblivious to what is happening around. Still, much better than some of the under-serving Oscar nominees to date.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film based on the acclaimed novel and I had mixed opinions and was unsure whether I'd want to see it, but then came the awards season, and I was definitely interested to see if the winner for Best Supporting Actress was deserved. Basically, set in Mississippi in the 1960s, during the time of the Civil Rights movement, middle-aged black maid Aibileen Clark (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Viola Davis) recently lost her son, and she has raised many white children in her life for the families she works for. Another black maid has been fired numerous times because of her outspokenness; Minny Jackson (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Octavia Spencer) does however have fantastic cooking skills. After graduating from the University of Mississippi, young white woman Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) has returned home, and she is surprised her childhood black maid Constantine Jefferson (Cicely Tyson) has quit her job, she questions why she did not write before leaving. All her friends from university have got married and had children, but Skeeter is single and keen to start a career as a writer, she gets her first job for the local paper writing "homemaker hints" columns. Aibleen is the maid of Skeeter's friend Elizabeth Leefolt (Ahna O'Reilly), Skeeter notices that the maids are treated as nothing more than the "help"; she is uncomfortable with the attitudes towards them, especially from Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is racist and sees black people as a disease. As one of the few in the country that sees black maids as equal citizens of society Skeeter decides to write a novel based on their lives and their time taking care of white children. Most maids are uninterested in being interviewed and talking about their live, they are worried they will lose their jobs, but Aibleen is open to share her experiences, after Hilly's harsh comments, and the children she looks after are becoming like their parents. Minny gets fired by Hilly after ignoring the rule to use a separate toilet, and she finds it impossible to find work with her reputation being poisoned, and her daughter ends up becoming a maid as well. Minny initially says no to answering questions for the writing of a book, but she does agree, and Aibleen helps find her job working with Celia Foote (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jessica Chastain) as a maid, Foote is married to socialite Johnny (Mike Vogel), and with a working class background and her husband being Hilly's ex is an outcast, but she treats black maids with respect. A draft of the book is finished by Skeeter, but Harper &amp; Row editor Elain Stein (Mary Steenburgen) in New York City says the book would only get interest with at least a dozen interviews from black maids, with the Civil Rights Movement she should do this soon. It is after the assassination of Medgar Evans and Hilly firing her latest black maid that many more do come forward to talk about themselves, they believe the book will allow them to have their voices heard during the time of all the tension between races. Minny also includes one last story to ensure no-one will reveal where the stories came from, she confesses that she baked a chocolate pie for Hilly, not long after being fired, accused of stealing, and, in front of Missus Walters (Sissy Spacek) as well, after eating two slices the maid reveals to Hilly that she baked her own excrement into the pie. Skeeter also adds her own story about Constantine and being brought up by her, and she finds out from her mother Charlotte (Allison Janney) that she was fired as a maid during a reception, but she felt guilty and sent Skeeter's brother to find her in Chicago living with her daughter Rachel, but Constantine was dead. The book is finished, and after being published the writer and the maids are pleased that it becomes an instant success, all the royalties are shared between the author and those that participated, and Skeeter is pleased to be offered a job in a New York City publishing company, but her boyfriend Stuart Whitworth (Chris Lowell) who does not believe in racial equality breaks up with her. Hilly is hatching a plan to get rid of Aibleen as Elizabeth's "help", getting her accused of stealing silverware, and she is successful in getting her fired, but she agrees to leave, even after giving her opinions of Hilly's vindictiveness and pleading her innocence, Elizabeth's daughter Mae Mobley is so upset, but Aibleen looks to go and find a new and better life for herself. Also starring The Last King of Scotland's David Oyelowo as Preacher Green, Anna Camp as Jolene French, Aunjanue Ellis as Yule Mae Davis and True Blood's Nelsan Ellis as Henry the Waiter. Spencer certainly deserved her Oscar for the great scenes she is in whether serious or funny, the most memorable of course being the pie sequence, Davis could have won as well for her emotional and established lead performance, Stone is a great choice to play the woman writing the novel to hopefully make some change, and many supporting cast members are great too, I'd say particularly Howard as the nasty snobbish ringleader with disrespectful and very racist views. It is a terrific film told from the perspectives of the black women who want to speak out for all black people who are mistreated in the world and the woman hoping to help them speak out for those suffering the torment, and it has all the emotions, good and bad, to make a well-paced and most worthwhile drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Film and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Song for Mary J. Blige's "The Living Proof". Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No Summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two main things about this film. First is the matter of 'radical' politics, leftist politics ? or, just plain, and frequently, as here, obvious truth. Common sense truth. In a crazy context such as our world of the 'masculine' principle dominating in a 'Domination Reality', truth looks funny, if it appears at all. Just attempting to tell the King he is naked puts that argument at several kinds of risks of being misunderstood. The best approach is to create a truthful world elsewhere and not participate in the Domination World except to leave FROM it (and to understand rather than be understood). ----------? From what I've just said, my point can be clearly seen. A secondary criticism of the film is the resemblance it has to classic 'Liberal (/Progressive) presentations; it looks manipulative. It 'looks' this way generally because the status quo Domination has the tilted playing field set as level. With out larger context we say "People are the same everywhere, survival of the fittest" etc. The obvious truths like in this film, as well as all the rest, our World doesn't even recognize. So we cant speak. "I must scream but I have no mouth", paraphrasing.-------?The other thing about "The Help" is the central emphasis on the key concept of domination in general ? to dominate is to be/become dominated. This happens throughout, but is more obvious at extremes; like in this film with parenting forced on slaves who become the real Parent. This is nicely shown and is put central, where it belongs. -------?Btw, southern broads, yes, are generally just like these ditzes ? they're not exaggerated.-----?The two main black women's acting is extremely good. -------- If this film were done in a more realistic and serious style it would be too hard to watch. Impossible to watch ? the world would end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I choose this movie to watch full knowing what the story is about. A good story. A worthwhile story. But i got bored very quickly by the way the movie just does not seem to pick up pace. I've seen movies on this subject before and, well, it's not my cup of tea really. I kept my mind open and was fully ready to see this movie. Based on the ratings, awards, it's got to be a good movie. Without doubt it's well played/acted, but, the story is where it goes sour in my opinion. What I said in the summary, yawn, it simply does not seem to pick up any pace. There seem to be a lot of flash backs or flash forwards, whatever way you look at it, but that does not add to the story at all, it actually makes it complicated, slowing down the actual story. They should have stuck to the theme and kept it chronological. I was so bored I actually stopped watching it, I never made it to the end, and I'll never will. If you really are in to the theme of the movie and you want to see the story and are not phased by possible boredom, go see it, it's well played. If it's not fully your cup of tea but you have an open mind, try it, make up your mind yourself. If you don't really like that type of stories andare not much for patience, don't bother, you won't finish it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rainy day film, a sunny day one and a just overcast one too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help, directed and screenplay written by Tate Taylor, is one of my new-all-time-favorites. It was nominated for the most prestigious Academy Award earlier this year and overall, was nominated for another three, two of which were for an 'Actress in a Supporting Role'.The Help resonated with me and will with most women, because one could identify oneself with either group of society.One sees little truths popping-up everywhere (and without sounding unpatriotic, this film portrays parts of my country so well, it's scary). The Help does not disappoint, humorously or dramatically.Skeeter Phelan (Stone) a newly graduated journalism student returns home to Jackson, Mississippi, during the African-American Civil Rights Movement (a movement aimed at gaining racial equality). Skeeter, having been brought up by her family's maid, Constantine (Tyson) and having had great admiration for her, is determined to reveal how the maids, working in white households, experience their jobs and daily lives. With the help of Aibileen Clark (Davis) working for Elizabeth Leefolt (O'Reilly) and Minny Jackson (Spencer) working for Hilly Holbrook (Howard) and then for Celia Foote (Chastain), the three start writing their book, friendship and new lives, together.This is a tail of how well people from different races can work together to create promising futures, and I believe, while The Help only lightly touched on how exactly it was back then, we can all learn something from this film. Personally, Viola Davis's portrayal of what it was like to be a black woman and maid in the 1960's, overpowered all the others' acting in the film. Emma Stone had the quirky, smart girl persona once again. When she cried during this piece though, it was more heartfelt, unlike when she cried in Easy A, when she sounded kind of, well, um, weird. Even though one becomes aware of Minny's (Spencer) hardships, the attention is drawn to her way of just turning anything into something so unbelievably gut- busting without even breaking a sweat. To my delight, Spencer walked away with the Oscar for the Actress in a Supporting Role. As mentioned before, she plays Celia Foote's (Chastain) maid ? helping Foote accept her reality as a housewife and societal outcast. Chastain being the other actress in this film who was nominated for the above-mentioned award caught me WAY off guard ? sure her character's reality made my heart ache now and then, but other than that I just don't get it (maybe the panel of judges were all fans of Marilyn Monroe and hourglass figures? ? the second reason being seemingly padded, to resemble the figure of the former reason.)I realize that I might just like this film because I'm one of those justice-types, but The Help surely is a rainy day film, a sunny day one and a just overcast day one too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been a lot better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read Kathryn Stockett's novel, The Help, it took me less than three days to read cover to cover. I fell in love with every character and imagined that, as a film, it would be stunning, emotive and compelling. Unfortunately, this adaptation didn't live up to my expectations.While Viola Davis and Jessica Chastain in particular, were both cast perfectly for their roles, I feel that a lot of the characters lacked individuality and spark. Some lovely characters (like Lou Anne) were erased all together, which disappointed me. Other characters, like Elizabeth Leefolt and Elaine Stein were cast incorrectly and did not live up to their full potential, I believe.One commendable thing that The Help does, is that it tries to involve as much of the original story as possible. However, the book itself is so intricately woven with numerous stories, I feel that a lot of the poignant story lines from the book were not portrayed very well and appeared patchy in the film. Skeeter and Stuart's relationship, Celia's ongoing struggle with her change in class, and Mae Mobely's alone time with Aibeleen, for example. Another thing is Skeeter's mother's illness. In the book, her deteriorating health acts as an extended metaphor for the anonymously published book, and the struggles faced through it, but none of this was shown in the film, despite the fact that it could have worked very well.I don't feel that drama is created particularly well, (the whole involvement of Constantine came across as a bit 'naff' unlike the book, where it was incredibly moving). However, comedic scenes are the film's strongest point in my eyes. Minnie's 'Terrible Awful' occurrence and Celia Foote's portrayal in particular, were very funny, and evoked genuine laugh out loud moments.All in all, however, I am sad to say that, despite some brilliant acting, The Help failed to live up to it's potential, appearing mismatched and vague. I feel that it would have developed better had it been created as a TV series. A slightly above average film, but still rather disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally exhausting but beautiful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm currently studying the civil rights movement in my history A level at the moment and specifically, women, and establishing the difference between a leader and an organiser. To me, this film leads the way in highlighting how brave, strong and incredible black women were in this period. First of all, the film is flawless, albeit a little long and maybe sometimes slow. The only main criticism I'll give this film is that it's emotionally exhausting. I've cried at a few films but this one had me balling all the way through. To me, it was so real and because women went through this just tears me apart. Not being able to say anything, to do anything wrong or else you will face torment and fear from white people and in the character of Minny's case, their husbands.The acting is by far my favourite thing in this film. Viola Davis produces an Oscar-worthy performance, she had everything down to perfection: her accent, her mannerisms, she was the character. The character of Minny, though stereotyped, was a brilliant representation of black women in fear and under the thumb of not only their employers but their husbands, something that was so true at the time. Octavia Spencer's portrayal is hilarious and heartbreaking and the arc that was portrayed was magnificent. Jessica Chastain was another actress who shone in this film, her character had my eyes streaming and my heart breaking. The only performance that falls short is Emma Stone's. Although convincing, at times she's awkward and her accent is flawed. Nonetheless, she gave a very satisfying performance. However, to me, there is one scene that is embedded into my mind. The scene in which Yule Mae asks for a loan from Hilly, the performance of Aunjanue Ellis is convincing and truly heartbreaking as you see the hope in her eyes shattered by the cruel employer.The visuals are something else that make the film even more refined. The colours are gorgeous and the quality of the film making was impressive.This film, although fictional, is a true depiction of life for a maid. There are two words that I'm in danger of overusing in describing this film, but the content and substance is on par with the standard of the film making, ultimately making an incredible, heartbreaking film. I am singing this film's praise because there are not many films like this nowadays, films that make you think, make you feel, make you angry. The Help is a gem, that should be shown to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Skeeter (Emma Stone) decides to write a book about the life of maids in the old south in Mississippi in the late 1950s. She knows what she is doing is against the law and has a hard time getting cooperation from the maids, but she does get it. This was just before the Civil Rights Movement. I didn't want to take this movie out because I knew what I would see and hear within. I was not wrong, and I am sure that things were much worse than I imagined and much worse than what is depicted in here. So keep that in mind. This was a very hard time for black maids serving white families especially caring for their daughter babies, who grew up to be like their mothers who instilled prejudice and southern ways in their children. Of course, not all white families treated their maids badly,but this story is not about them. Don't let anyone tell you that this was not a true story. It is that and more. It is inspired by true events and handed-down stories by these maids and what is seen is only a small tip of a large iceberg. You come away with the question: how can people treat people like this? But, this is part of our history such as it was. The acting performances by all the cast deserve Oscars. The way this was directed and performed was like we were eavesdropping into the lives of these maids. Nothing was overdone. Well, the pie incident was and I was shocked that it was included in here. Not good. That was an attempt for cheap laughs in a story that didn't see much humor. The standouts were Minny (Octavia Spencer) and Abileen (Viola Davis) and this was basically their story. You liked them and hoped the best for them especially when things didn't go good and you found yourself reaching for that Kleenex box time and time again. When you looked into their eyes you saw, without question, a sense of hopelessness within their lives. Minny says "we are living in hell, our children too. Trapped." You might need two boxes of Kleenex tissues. This is a powerful story and will, perhaps, turn out to become a classic and as such, it should be required viewing in all high schools throughout the land as most children now have no clue to this part of our history. The story aside, I was impressed with the vivid photography throughout, the colors of the maids' uniforms, numerous 1950s cars, and a lack of hard language usually found in today's movies. (10/10)Violence: You see the results of some violence, not the act of. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No F-bombs, only soft stuff and not much of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Having read the book, this film was disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was disappointed when I watched this film. I had just finished the book, which, to me, is an incredibly enjoyable read, and the same day watched the DVD - a big mistake. I don't think a movie can ever have the richness and emotional complexity as the book it came from because readers create an image in their minds about the characters and setting that are seldom realized in the movie version. The Help was no exception for me. Just a few of the disappointments: The Hilly character in the book was an over-weight, scheming, and domineering woman. The film actress was much too pretty and perfect and was not at all convincing to me. The other actors in the film were likewise one-dimensional and not at all real. Whatever happened to real southern accents? I seldom could get to the point where I did not think they were acting. The Skeeter character was not developed well and much was left out of the film about the effect her actions had on her life. And the most puzzling thing for me at the ending was the scene where Constantine's daughter appears at Skeeter's home. The real impact of this in the book was that the daughter's skin color was that of a white person, and that was considered by some at the time to be quite shameful and embarrassing and reason enough to fire Constantine. I wonder how anyone watching the film could be able to get that impression.I realize that film and literature are different and I'm glad that most viewers enjoyed the film for what it was, but I still was disappointed that the film did not have the richness and drama of the the book. I wonder what a really talented director could have done with the story. Part of the problem for me, I suppose, was in seeing the movie too soon after reading the book. I won't do that again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The embroidery on the wall of the Lefort's living room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently I viewed the magnificent motion picture, The Help. I loved the movie all the way through. But at the end something caught my eye. On the wall in the living room of the Lefort's, when Hilly is reprimanding Abby and accusing her of stealing a few pieces of silver, and the little girl comes to her because her throat hurts, I saw something remarkable on the far wall of the living room. I was watching the film on DVD in my living room so I could freeze the film in an appropriate frame. On the wall of that living room was a picture, a large picture of mallard ducks. The ducks were framed in a brown wooden frame. I was startled because I embroidered a picture just like that one in the late 50's early 60's. I couldn't believe my eyes because my heart told me that this picture on the wall was my embroidery! I would love to ask some questions about the piece. Is it indeed an embroidery? A cross-stitch embroidery? Is there a very obvious mistake in the lower portion of the piece, where the 2 bodies of the ducks in the foreground meet? I would love to know if this is my embroidery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie I liked. Let me explain, It is an easy movie to like. There is nothing extraordinary about it, it is just so easy to identify the bad people and you tend to like hating the bad guys. It is easy to follow the plot and is predictable. It follows stereotyped characters which is disappointing: The white Male does what is expected of him and of course the leading female character is liberated (even in 60s) we can not possibly have any deviation at all there. This type of writing takes humanity out of the movie; that is, the characters are politically correct sanitized and pasteurized for today's activist groups. I yet to see a refreshing movie coming out of the Hollywood franchises in the last few years. Putting this aside the movie is above average considering what comes out of Hollywood. It is not the kind of movie I would go to theater, it is rather a video night movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Untold Story of African-American Maids Raising White Children in the South: The Best Film on the Subject Since "The Long Walk Home"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In American historic culture, we often think of race relations in terms of the civil rights protest marches of the 1960's and the work of Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr. Behind the scenes and for many decades prior to the legislation signed by President Johnson in 1964, African-Americans and Southern Whites interacted within a societal infrastructure which was not often discussed. African-American hired "help" often raised the white children of southern aristocratic society. Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan is a young white woman raised by one of these African-Americans, Constantine Bates, whom she regards as the person who raised her. She decides to document the experiences of the maids when she finds out Constantine was fired by her family without her knowledge.Aibileen Clark, played by Viola Davis in an Academy Award-caliber performance, is the first maid solicited by Skeeter. At first reluctant to share her thoughts and experiences, Clark eventually decides to reveal her story. Others follow, including Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) who was once in the employ of Hilly Holbrook, the most racist and insensitive of the upstart white women. As Skeeter hears their stories, she finds a recurring theme of negative attitudes exhibited by the white women toward the Help, ranging from disrespect and discourtesy to racist contempt. At one point, Hilly tries to have legislation passed to require all households with hired help to have separate bathrooms for African-Americans.Ironically, Celia Foote, the one white woman who was formerly among the "poor white trash" treats her new employee Minnie with respect and decency. But because of her background, Celia is shunned from the women's groups. At one point, she tries to visit the local women's bridge club, but the members hide inside the house, pretending they're not there. Eventually, she learns the hard way that prejudice can cut in either direction. Her employee Minnie becomes more than just the Help but a kind of mentor.Despite its marketing, "the Help" is not a comedy-drama. It really is a rather sobering look at stratified culture in Jackson, Mississippi in the early 1960's during the civil rights protests. The aristocratic mothers have hired African-Americans to care for their children and houses, but show little appreciation toward the people who are part of their lives. In several instances these children know the Help better than their white mothers. In a very poignant scene, a local Ladies Club made up of many of the young mothers has taken up a fund-raiser to help starving children in Africa. But they seem oblivious to the people in their own community who might benefit from their work. Even simply offering a kind word appears to be outside of their modus operandi. I guess the point is that no one in these families believes it's necessary, and so these prejudicial attitudes are passed from generation to generation. Unfortunately, when the white children become adults they don't necessarily have the same affection for those who raised them.No question, one of the best films of 2011, with outstanding performances by all the leads and supporting cast. I believe there will be several Academy Award Nominations. While Emma Stone as Skeeter and Emma Howard as Hilly deserve high marks, Viola Davis and Cicely Tyson steal the show. Both exhibit very different persona's when they are in the midst of whites than when they are at home. This may be the best film of this subject since "the Long Walk Home".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is a subtle film about black and white women. The absence of men is notable. It was also one of the few American films I needed subtitles for, as some of the language was hard to understand.I guess questions of race, class and nationality are hard to describe, especially in a movie. This particular movie got the point across pretty well. It appeals to peoples' sense of fairness quite acutely.The film has its good characters and bad ones, found some shades of grey too. It exhumed the wealth and lifestyle of the upper-class women of Jackson (site of the movie) in the 60s. It also pictures the society as tightly knit together: everybody knowing each other person. The underlying theme would the lacking equality of opportunity. The historical representation is interesting and seems right. The Help is a very emotional movie and it succeeds in every aspect of it. It's very well focused on one or two topics, but doesn't go too narrow. I wouldn't recommend watching 'The Help' with pop corn and family, as it does get too cruel at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie from the point of view of the help a movie that deserves a nod at the Oscars! Title: THE HELP</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Kathryn Stockett struggled with over 60 agents and had her novel rejected repeatedly the 2011 summer release THE HELP is been widely accepted even as you read this. Summer 2011 is not one of the best we have experienced in the lines of cinema. With just a handful of movies that would remain in our minds I consider THE HELP an exhilarating and heartwarming production that contains emotions and laughter from a time not too long ago. I have not clearly lived during the timelines the plot has been set. In fact the Civil rights movements and the efforts to create equality between color, race and religion is something I have just read during history lessons. To see it been brought to life at a time where racism and religious discrimination is frowned upon and where equality is boasted of is quite interesting. Especially to read the uprising debates the movie seems to have caused within some communities. If THE HELP is fact or fiction is irrelevant at this point. However the beauty and the depth the movie is revealed to me should not go unnoticed. There is an aura of near perfection that seems to hover around this title. The screenplay that has been adapted by the novel itself is said to be doing extreme justice to the original text the experts say. I have not read the novel. In fact I have not read the Harry Potter novels. However this does not stop me nor did it stop those who passed judgment on the HP franchise. The magical screenplay and direction that is done by Tate Taylor who is said to be a childhood friend of the author is key ingredient. Taylor's vision and heart is in the right place when he tries to extract the emotional lives of the black women of Jackson Mississippi. I have read many write ups about the racial atrocities that has taken place around the world. In fact I have seen with my own eyes the ethnic conflicts that stir up from some of them. THE HELP is just one of those stories that made it to the light! Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer clearly stood out with one of the best performances I have seen in recent times. They drew tears to my eyes. To be the help at the said time and to be in their situation is something that I am unable to even imagine myself in. Yet Spencer and Davis took me to 1960s Jackson. They showed me the pain and discrimination. They showed how much they gave up just making sure their children could have a better life (Although the outcome was not what they expected). The most important lesson I learnt by being in the year 2011 from the movie is that even with all the imaginable hardships of the world are upon them, they will not give up! Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer you ladies nailed it! There convincing performance was not too far away from Bryce Dallas Howard who places the other extreme end of the racial white house lady. Her ultimate goal of creating equality from within separation, Brilliant performance! Tate Taylor wanted her to come out as being mean insensitive and callous and Bryce Howard did Taylors expectations Justice. Between the help and the lords of the house there is a common ground. This is where Emma Stone comes in. I need to be honest; I was not a believer that Stone could pull through the perfect Skeeter. To my amazement she did. This Performance of Stone holds the Davis-Spencer Vs Howard battle in a balance. Aibileen Clark who has raised 17 white children is a black woman from Jackson Mississippi. She loves the children she raises just as if they were her own. In fact the children love the help more than they love their own mothers. This is only fair since the mothers of the time showed seem to have got their priorities pretty mixed up! Minny Jackson who works for the Holbrook house walks out one day after failing to tolerate the cruelty of the lady of the house. Jackson Journal writer Skeeter returns home after her graduation to find out that her maid Constantine who has raised all her life has been sent away by her mother. Skeeter who does not respond to this very well takes up to write the stories of black women and their emotional struggle for survival. However she is unable to find a volunteer who would share with her. THE HELP is a must watch drama and is indeed one of a kind. Guaranteed to have you balling out by the end of the movie and will make you look harder into yourself. A movie from the point of view of the help a movie that deserves a nod at the Oscars!

		<fullReview>There are many many fine things to say about the film THE HELP, not the least of which is the cast of women gathered by screen writer/director Tate Taylor for this cinematic version of the book by Kathryn Stockett. The setting of the story in the 1960s is well recreated and it is truly tough to see how the folks in Jackson, Mississippi treated African Americans knowing that the group of bigoted WASPs were mirrored across the country. To be reminded of just how atrocious racial relations were in the time of JFK, Martin Luther King, JR et al makes of tough watching. This story, THE HELP, has be told and retold so many times that it lacks freshness and when the story is pulled like hot taffy for over 2 1/2 hours it wears thin.Viola Davis is magnificent as Mother Earth Aibileen but for this viewer her performance is almost matched by Octavia Spencer as her best friend Minny: both are excellent. And it takes a lot of chutzpah for the actresses playing the disgusting wives and members of the Junior League and Bridge Club who treat the help in such a demeaning way - so kudos to the 'worst' of them, Bryce Dallas Howard, Ahna O'Reilly, the smarmy Allison Janney, et al. There is a fine cameo for Cicely Tyson, and major star turn for Jessica Chastain as the only white woman (other than the author Skeeter as played by Emma Stone) for whom we care.It is a story about making a story (book) that changes the life of a small Southern town in the midst of Social Revolution. The acting has been cited and makes the film worth seeing, but as for whether or not it deserves to be considered for Best Picture....probably not. It is a VERY long song! Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a hit for good reasons; fine writing where Kathryn Stockett is concerned, based on reviews and info I read of her Novel, great script adaptation and direction by Tate Taylor, fine cinematography from Stephen Goldblatt and a cast that delivered superb performances from everyone. The main actors Emma Stone, Octavia Spencer, Viola Davis and Bryce Dallas Howard were convincing and I liked their performances; Bryce Dallas Howard in the unflattering role of Hilly Holbrook was as convincing as the other more affable characters that we will all tend to remember of course. The short scenes with Cicely Tyson playing Constantine were the most moving.This film is meant to move and inspire; reviews I've read so fare bear this out as do the ratings from the usual sources I consult. The IMDb full Storyline, for those who have not read that, the book or the official site's account, will suffice as setting the expectations. The characters are very well developed and the concept of the story lends itself especially well for that. One hundred and ninety IMDb users have taken the time to write their opinions, in large part if not totally praising the movie for all the obvious reasons. I felt compelled to do the same. It's the first story of its kind, 'what life was like for African American maids in Mississippi in the early 1960s, from their perspective; they raised white children and were more parent to them then were some of their actual parents. Then these same white children in too many instances, later were their employers and treated them like sh*t. This story needed to be told and now is better late than never. Its originality is what makes it special. I expect there will be many more reviews repeating the message expressed by reviews thus far and I would not be surprised if there wasn't at least several Oscar nominations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The HelpThe Opening :- The help, based on a novel of same name, was a very nice entertainment which will keep you engrossed throughout the movie and at the same time will make you sympathize for the African maids who went through the trauma of racism in America during 1950'sThe Story :- The help tells the story of African maids working for whites in the early 1950. The story revolves around 3 people . Aebileen is one of them working as a house maid for white. She takes care of the baby girl more than her own mother as Aebileen has lost her own son in a tragic accident. Minny , another African maid , is working for one white household but she makes one mistake by using their bathroom and soon is fired for un equality. Skeeter is a young white journalist who gets the opportunity to write a column for the local newspaper. She gets the idea of putting down the struggle and pain of African maids in her story and turns it into a book. She seeks help from Aebileen and soon discovers that there are other maids as well who goes through the same pain and suffering everyday of mistreatment and racism by high class white. She starts writing different stories about racism including hers as she was also raised by a black maid. The review So , overall , I loved the film. It was a women ? oriented flick but I found it to be very interesting. The direction was superb and so were the performances by the star cast. The cinematography was breath taking transforming you into the era of 19th century. The background score was nice. The film could have been trimmed by few minutes. But, the direction and performances compensates for that. The bottom line Amazing .Fantabulous. Very entertaining. You may definitely want to catch it for eve flick. Excellent ? 4 / 5</fullReview>

Although fiction, it succeeds in being luminescent about past times of segregation and racism in the South. Viola Davis gives an Oscar-Worthy performance and leads a veteran cast of actresses. The developing story keeps your interest piqued for the majority of a hefty runtime (137 min) which is testament to the sharpness of the script and the quality of acting. Indeed, Taylor puts together one of the best movies of 2011 filled with the right touches of humor. See it for the acting, story, and drama. Strongly recommended</fullReview>

All in all this movie must be seen, its a movie ticket well spent and you surely wont regret it. For the ones that read the book and go see the movie, i heard ( i didn't read the book) that the only problem is that it's not that much pressure on the effects if the book gets released what is going to happen to all the maids. But in defense of the movie, it has some well written comedy in it and that combined with the rest of story it really felt well not to add that element that we all are, at some point, aware it exists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Screen Adaptation Stays True to Revealing Exposé of the Help</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Debut author Kathryn Stockett's New York Times bestseller was transformed into one of the most talked about screen adaptations at the time of its release. Her period-based novel is a revealing exposé on the treatment of southern black maids in Jackson, Mississippi in the racially divisive culture of the 1960's?an era she grew up in, and like many others, her family employed domestic help. Both poignant and eye-opening, the plot uncovers an aspect of fairly recent history you won't find in any textbook. The screenplay stays true to the book with a young, white liberal-minded protagonist woman writer of an anonymously veiled tell-all about the community's local society-set. This theme-driven drama presents strong depictions by members of the virtually all-female cast, comprised of Academy Award nominated Viola Davis (Aibileen) and Octavia Spencer (Minny) as the first maids to courageously tell their experiences of working for the close-knit womenfolk to Skeeter, played by Emma Stone. A budding journalist, Stone's character is distressed to learn that even though they clean, cook, serve and tend to their children; the maids are not allowed to use the household bathrooms. She initiates a secret writing project in which she compiles personal accounts from their perspectives on the relationships between the hired help and those they may have worked years for. Davis is the tolerant maid, who suffers a heartbreaking loss. Spencer is a standout as the brash and sassy scene-stealer. Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard, gives a brilliant portrayal of unfeeling antagonistic housewife Hilly, whom you'll love to hate. A reflective look into the past highlights the harsh realities of the times when bigotry ruled the Jim Crow South; the Help will make you laugh and cry. Although there is a gross factor alert that some may find distasteful. The inevitable fallout occurs after the book's release.</fullReview>

The acting is pretty wooden and the characterisations stereotypical, but worst of all is the sound quality; much of the dialogue is too low in the mix and not helped by over-Southerning from the players which makes some lines muddy and impenetrable. I suspect most of the reviews here are confusing the subject, which is worthy and a tidy cathartic guilt-trip, with the film quality.

It was a strong, character driven story which is rare in this day and age of CGI and big orange explosions. It was poignant and charming, gritty and funny.I grew up in a beach community in southern California and while I was aware of the civil rights struggle I really had no direct contact with it.

		<shortDescription>A terrific film which does the book justice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie!!! I'm a huge fan of the book that the film is based on, the story is fantastic and one that has never been told in this way before. None of the books charisma and charm is lost with the transfer to the big screen, if anything it is amplified. First things first, cast: I don't think anyone at all is miscast in this film, if I had to say anyone was I would say maybe Emma Stone, but she does a good job in this film so you can forgive whatever qualms you have about her being cast as Skeeter. The rest of the cast is divine, it seems as though Tate Taylor assembled the greatest ensemble cast since the last Christopher Guest film. Octavia Spencer, Viola Davis, Allison Janney, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sissy Spacek and my personal favorite from the film, Jessica Chastain are all excellent, and all of them get to have their big moment, no one is left with nothing to do, all of them leave an impression.The adaptation is missing a few little details from the book, but it's OK, the bulk of the story gets across quite well. I think it will be a crime if Octavia, Viola and Jessica aren't mentioned when awards season rolls around. Miss Chastain being the standout for me, I hope she wins absolutely everything, Her character Celia was my favorite from the book and Miss Chastain is just electric in her portrayal as this wonderful character. I love her, she's just so great.This review is pretty bad but I just can't express in words how much I enjoyed it, just go see it and enjoy it for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what a Tyler Perry movie should be. Funny, insightful, and well acted. All of the characters belonged in this film, the church seen made since and was relevant to the story. I enjoyed it from start to finish.Further things Mr. Perry can learn:1. Not all white are bad or the villains. 2. Not every movie needs a rape scene (or a implied rape scene) 3. Black women do not need a "man" in order to be happy and complete.So please Mr. Perry, if you want to stay in the film business... Watch, take notes and learn from this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Several of the performances make The Help an endearing look at a dark chapter in American history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's bestselling novel, set in Jackson, Mississippi, during the 1960s. The film follows three different women. The first is Skeeter (Emma Stone), a young woman hired to write a column about housecleaning. She's also wondering what happened to her maid Constantine, who helped raise her, but has now disappeared. The second is Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Skeeter asks her for advice with her column. She's a maid for Elizabeth (Ahna O'Reilly) a snobby woman who can barely be bothered looking after her own children. The third woman is Minny (Octavia Spencer) and she finds work as a maid for Celia (Jessica Chastain), who lives out of town. Celia doesn't want her husband to know that she can't cook or clean so Minny has to help secretly. Bring these women together is Skeeter's plan to write about how African American maids are treated by their white employers. She's upset that one of her friends Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) is looking to enforce a rule that will force the 'help' to have separate bathrooms from their white employers. But Skeeter finds the maids reluctant to share their experiences because of the dangerous political climate in Jackson. Tate Taylor's second feature film The Help is an absorbing period drama, regardless of whether you have read Kathryn Stockett's novel. I have read the novel and the essence of the story is retained. It's a moving story that suggests that change is found in people of all ages, generations and races. It believes in the power of literature to inform people and to change the world. And there are ideas of class and the importance of public perception in this time period too. There are no easy divisions in either the novel or the film. Not all the white's are selfish or simply racist. They're willing to alienate their own people too. We see the women's deliberate exclusion of Celia and also learn that Hilly put her own mother (Sissy Spacek) in a nursing home. But nor are all the African American's innocent either. They make poor choices too. An ongoing thread is that after Minny was fired she decided to give Hilly a booby trapped cake, which she later regrets. And off camera it's apparent that Minny is physically abused at home. Though many scenes from the novel have been omitted entirely, it's a very solid adaptation. The film is beautiful in recreating the period, but never glossy. Despite being nearly two and a half hours long the film doesn't linger either. It's well paced and the images resonate with us. One of the most memorable is seeing the 'help' walk out of their homes of a morning, dressed in their uniforms. We see Minny giving instructions to her daughter who is now part of the 'help'. That subtly reminds us that these women weren't just employed for one lifetime. What's missing from the film are the darker elements of the novel. In the novel there's a broader overview of the violent atrocities around Mississippi that's absent here. It is indeed a compromise but more for business reasons rather than a political agenda. This is a mainstream film that has already flourished at the US box office. If the film was uglier less people might have seen it at all. But then it might have been more honest too. It's a great example of the dilemmas faced by the studio system. Instead, the fear and anxiety of the period comes through many of the performances. Almost all of the women in this film are superb. Emma Stone is extremely lively and funny as the oddball Skeeter. But she smartly replaces a lot of her flamboyance and sarcasm from Easy A (2010) with a greater sense of vulnerability. Some of her expressions when revelations about her mother are announced are extremely touching. But Viola Davis is the one almost certain to be nominated for Best Actress early next year. She has the bravest face in the film and yet underneath her internal conflict is so visible and moving. Her performance, particularly when she talks about her son, is painfully genuine. Spencer and Howard are charismatic women too. The latter contrasts the fake smiles of parties and charity dinners with ice-cold looks of suspicion perfectly. The only weak link is, I think, Chastain. I was expecting a quieter performance, closer to her excellent work in The Tree of Life (2011). She's extremely colourful here when her character in the novel is physically deteriorating and spends a lot of time alone in her room. Granted, that would be a lot harder to film on screen. The film might not have the grit of an independent picture like Precious (2009) but several of the performances make The Help an endearing look at a dark chapter in American history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help-I Smell Oscar! Best Film You Should See!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You all need to see the Help. It will be up there in the Oscar Race of 2012. As the whole entire cast needs to be nominated. Great ensemble and a great story. You don't get films like this in Hollywood. Great casting, great story.Viola Davis who plays one of the two protagonists, maid Abileen shows she can also carry a film. Long a supporting player, she moves to the front. As she helps out recent college grade Skeeter(played by up and coming Emma Sonte of "Easy A"), and the second protagonist. Skeeter treats her like family. Unlike her family does.Abileen is the first person to speak out about the treatment she and the maids get. By not being treated as humans. Due to this and other obstacles in the South, other African-American women come forward in her predicament.Not surprisingly, not a lot of people are happy about this. As skeletons from the closet come out. Despite the book coming out with an anonymous author.But Skeeter sees Abileen and the people in the African-American community as family and as equals. It just takes sitting down to and listening to people. Not a lot of people take the time to do that. But Skeeter did and does that.Bryce Dallas Howard isn't just Ron Howard's child, but she is now a full-fledged actress as someone has said on this board. And that expect great things for her to come in the future. As the main antagonist, snooty and prejudice Hilly.Octavia Spencer is the one that stills the show. As the outspoken friend of Abileen. Who has been fired nearly twenty times. Despite making the best pies of the South. I expect her to get nominated as well as more future roles to come.Jessica Chastin as a hoot also as the one that is left out of the "girls club" due to being different and naive. But really she also is a good person at heart. Once you get to know her. And her tragedy.Sadly but truthfully these things did happen. And that though nobody can erase what happened in the South in those days. Which wished that we could. Still, how these women have come a long way. And how that we have come a long way, but have a long way to go in race relations.Hopefully you all will see the Help. As these things DID happen. My parents grew up in those times as well. Because the Help will make you see how race relations have come a long way since then. And how you need to remember the only race that counts...IS THE HUMAN RACE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help: A Pure Triumph, Through and Through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Little known director Tate Taylor was certainly lucky to have such a pal as Kathryn Stockett. As the new girl in town heralding from Jackson, Mississippi, Stockett had a lot of trouble getting her first book published, The Help, based largely on the controversial topic that she was a white writer telling a story from a black woman's perspective. How shocking, how risqué?wait it is 2011, right? Are there such things as artistic boundaries anymore? Maybe for Taylor, whose film version of his friend's runaway hit novel, is stealing the hearts of America right before our eyes. And maybe he played it a bit safe, but it's a rare safeness that is hardly ever done well. Lucky, again, for Mr. Taylor, his result is amazing.The Help is about a woman trying to rev up a career as a writer, but lacks the connections, and frankly, the story to go on. Seeing the horrid mistreatment and racism going on in Jackson, Skeeter (Emma Stone) decides to write something that might help change all that. Her gentle motivation turns into passion and she begins to interview maids of her white- society-snob friends, and really gets onto something. Such a formulaic plot that we've seen before, but The Help does it with such humor and heart that it's spectacular. The filmmaking isn't innovative in any unique way, there is nothing really gritty or challenging about the racist terror that was in fact happening at the time, but I doubt the film would have benefited about that. It is not the story of a civil rights epic, but instead takes us to a more quiet advocacy, one that seems possible, and true, and yet altogether the most inspired. Whoever cast this film should get a raise. Emma Stone turns in a great performance, as usual, though her every-day-girl vibe doesn't allow her to stand out in this film, full of such distinct and memorable characters. Bryce Dallas Howard, as the main white antagonist Hilly Holbrook, is viciously evil and eats up every bit of this film with a force that makes us feel Howard knows the type of bigotry and hates that it still goes on; her character is written very one- sided, but she understands the inauthenticity and thoughtlessness of those women's racism, and plays it without fear. Jessica Chastain, hot off her dazzling understated performance in The Tree of Life, is so damn charming as the naive Celia, who knows about as much about how to treat African Americans in the south as she does to cook a pie, which is to say, not much. She is kind, funny, genuine, and it's hard not to love her. The real scene-stealers here are the undeniably spectacular performances from the two central maid characters: Viola Davis as Aibileen and Octavia Spencer as Minny. Both have strong dramatic moments, especially Davis, and Spencer has you laughing so damn hard you almost forget all the horrible things her character has to go through. It shows strength in the actress, and it shows strength in the character. Davis is a marvel; passive when she needs to be and then in full bloom as this beautiful and inspiring character when Aibileen can truly be herself around Minny or Skeeter. Through such a formulaic story and filmmaking techniques, it could have been a much different, mediocre film. But the incredible cast along with Taylor (with Stockett's help no doubt) make it feel authentic and as warm as a cherry pie from Jackson, Mississippi. And, damn, it tastes so good. A-</fullReview>

There's some funny momens, some more sad but the saddest ones sounds too fakes. But the film worth the watching. It's still a good movie. The book is maybe better the movie, but it's subjective. Watch it and you will like it. It's pretty surprising that the movie doesn't win one Academy Award. But watch it. Watch it and Read it and you will appreciate the film totally.

		<shortDescription>A charming, yet harrowing tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in Mississippi during the 1960s, Skeeter (Emma Stone) is a southern society girl who returns from college determined to become a writer, but turns her friends' lives and a Mississippi town turns upside down when she decides to interview the black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent southern families and showcase their hardships to the world. Aibileen (Viola Davis), Skeeter's best friend's housekeeper, is the first to open up to the dismay of her friends in the tight-knit black community. Despite Skeeter's life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and Aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories and as it turns out, they have a lot to say. Along the way, unlikely friendships are forged and a new sisterhood emerges, but not before everyone in town has a thing or two to say themselves when they become unwittingly and unwillingly caught up in the changing times.This is yet another Hollywood output where the story of the minorities is told through a morally righteous white person, but this time its done really well. Skeeter basically disappears after setting the movie up and only appears here and there when the story requires her and she leaves the floor for the others to shine. Institutional racism is fascinating and disturbing to watch, just like the sexism of the modern world which still exists in most countries. Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), the antagonist in our tale, thinks of herself as a progressive thinker among her peers and yet her actions suggest otherwise. Her club's efforts to save the hungry children of Africa was ridiculously ironic and hilarious.The disparity, hardships and social status of the black people just because of the colour of their skin back then isn't exploited to the maximum. The critiques hurled at this movie for not showing it is simply laughable. This is just a story where none of the women shown on screen got raped or abused, though there are various viewpoints to the term, by their white masters and one should respect the story for it and not judge based on what didn't happen to these characters. At least, this is not a falsification of history like the supposed true story of Argo. Our critics and society are unfairly critical of female-oriented and minority based movies. Nothing is more telling than the hate bashing of the Twilight movies, a simple tale told through the eyes of a girl and her love for a supernatural being.I digress. The Help has a good story at its core, but its the strong performances by all the actors which is a sight to behold. Octavia Spencer won an Oscar for her efforts, though I do feel that her pie thing, though quite funny, was done in a slight distaste unbecoming of the movie, and Viola Davis was overlooked in my opinion. But it was Jessica Chastain, whom I liked in Lawless and Mama, who surprisingly impressed the hell out of me and was nominated for an Oscar for her role here. I was thinking that she'd just be another ditzy, suburban blonde, housewife/bombshell who I'd probably hate, but there was so much more to the woman and she made me empathize with her plight against all odds. She is definitely my new favourite actress. Emma Stone was infectious in her portrayal of Skeeter and the way her character's arc ended was realistic and sad. A charming, yet harrowing tale which doesn't overplay the aspect of racial discrimination to high levels.7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strident and unconvincing film that reinforces rather than dismantles stereotypes. The cinematography is dreary, the period is not persuasively rendered, the young actresses for the most part lack authority and seem to be playing dress up in their mother's clothing. The actors are not an effective ensemble; they seem to be acting in different time periods if not different films. The film's pace and structure as well as it's mixture of comedy and drama are of no help, and the film feels like a Lifetime Movie. Of the large cast only talented Viola Davis suggests a real person, and Octavia Spencer is funny and endearing though she's playing a type. Love Field and The Long Walk Home wore this theme into the ground leaving The Help in the dust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help comes nowhere near the horror that infected Mississippi and the Southeast during the Civil Rights movement in 1960's America. This silly portrayal is filled with cinematic clichés. The film bounces between fluff and nutter with Actors placed in nice lighting. Give me a break. The Help has a cast that is able to carry the story with moments of humor balancing the hardships of being victims of racism. The Evangelical Baptists and Congregations were filled with much oppression and ignorance during this time. Why is this not touched upon with a more accurate eye. 50 years later, Mississippi is ranked the most miserable state. Perhaps, in the sequel, "More Help" we may see such realism. It will scare the hell out of ya. No pun intended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets So Much Right and So Much Wrong....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll give "The Help" 10 stars for the Women. Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Cicely Tyson (playing old, old, old yet again) are thrilling to watch. They have the all out fierceness that makes movies like "The Help" enjoyable and seem to give them "weight". One wishes the film makers trusted these Women more and let them have more screen time. When Emma Stone's Skeeter finally gets Viola Davis' Aibileen to talk to her for a book she's writing about the experiences of black women who serve as housemaids and nannies in assorted white households in Jackson Mississippi circa 1963, Aibileen very tentatively begins by relating a story of the first child she took care of as a 14 year old in 1925. The way Davis speaks it, the story sounds fascinating and I wanted to hear all the details. But the director cuts away the scene to where Aibileen and Skeeter are done with their talk and we never hear all about Aibileen's story. The movie could have done with a lot more of the real stories about these women's lives but we only get bits and pieces. We really don't get to know a whole lot about them and that's a shame. We might think we get more but that is because these actresses are so damn good that we fill in the gaps ourselves.I'll give the "The Help" one star for what is gets wrong and it's not the first to do so. The film once again focuses too much time on the oh-so-helpful-wizened-white person role this time played by Emma Stone as Skeeter. She's one in a long line of actors who've played this part. Coincidentally (or maybe not) Sissy Spacek (a bit horrifying here in an old lady role. She's only 62!) played this role once in a movie called "The Long Walk Home". I assume that the money behind this film felt that in order to get white audiences interested, they had to keep this legacy going. While I think it's OK to have this kind of role, the film makers once again my the role pretty much the central character but they try and circumvent this by having Viola Davis' Aibileen narrate the picture (though this narration seems to be absent throughout long stretches of the film). It's insulting to the main characters in the film ("The Help" of the film's title) and diminishes from some of the meaning the film has. The rest of the white cast ranges from barely adequate/watchable (Spacek) to eye rolling caricature (Bryce Dallas Howard's Hilly Holbrook). The least said about Howard's character the better.I'll recommend "The Help" based solely on the African-American actresses (and Chastain as the only white character with some depth of feeling that seemed genuine). The rest is filler that we've seen before and can do without.</fullReview>

How amazing it is when you sit in the movie theater, expecting to watch a normal movie, well with an amazing cast, not knowing what it is about, and you just spend 2 hours stunned, moved, shocked, amazed, laughing, having every single emotion there is in just one movie. This movie is by far one of the best movies i have ever seen, i can't even describe the quantity of feelings i had watching it, yes, it is almost 2 and a half hours long, but, i didn't want it to end.I found myself moved, it really changed me, it has amazing performances, once aging Viola Davis had an amazing character, with an amazing story, and delivered an out of this world performance, as she always does.Emma Stone, wow. I have no words for this girl, she is stunning in every single meaning of the word. The rest of the cast, deliver amazing performances, every single second of this movie is absolutely well written, absolutely well directed, and absolutely well acted. It is so real.This is a movie, with a really original point of view, i have never ever seen a movie like this. It is a movie about love, about fighting for who you are, about defending your believes. I recommend this movie for EVERYBODY. This is a really true masterpiece, and i really believe everybody should see this, see that the "perfect world" we live in, was or, is, not perfect at all.

Historical films like this do a great job of showing how life may have been back in those days. (I have not checked the accuracy of the film, but it feels very real). To think how much we have changed in the past 50 years is fascinating, no mobile phones (Imagine little old ladies, The Helps texting each other to avoid being caught by police), 'coloured' people segregated in society - however these days there still seems to be a divide in society if not written out as law, at least written out with the distribution of wealth.

		<fullReview>You is kind. You is smart. You is important.So says black maid Abilene to Mae Mobley, the small daughter of her wealthy white employers. As the little girl repeats the words back her one can't help but wonder if Abilene has ever had them said to her. Living in a world where a black man inhabits the White House is difficult to imagine a time when the same man could be arrested for refusing to give up his seat on the bus for a white person.Set in Jacksonville, Mississippi in the 1960s this funny and poignant film, based the book by Kathryn Stockett, depicts a time, not so long ago, when a black maid couldn't use the same bathroom as her white employers, when black women raised white women's children but could not be trusted not to steal the silver and when telling the truth about your life as 'the help' was akin to signing your own death warrant.Into this world of prejudice and secrecy comes Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan a recent college graduate with dreams of becoming a journalist. Skeeter has returned home to find that her beloved maid Constantine, who raised her, has seemingly left to go and live with her family in another state. On top of being devastated and confused by this Skeeter is also trying to pave a career for herself in New York. To do so she must convince the editor that she is a good writer. With this mind she happens upon a radical and potentially dangerous idea; to tell the story of the black maids of Jacksonville, from their point of view, enlisting Abilene, and her best friend Minnie, maid to the cruel Hilly to help her.The three leads are perfectly cast. Viola Davis brings a quite sadness, tenderness and hidden strength to Abilene, Octavia Spencer perfectly portrays Minnie's brashness and loud mouth while also bringing out her caring side and vulnerability and Emma Stone shines as the bright and witty Skeeter, depicting perfectly her determination to change things and her confusion and sadness over the loss of her maid.There are so many outstanding performances among the supporting cast in this film it seems unfair to single anyone out. However credit must be given where it is due and there are three performances' which really stuck with me. Bryce Dallas Howard, who I also thought of as decent but nothing special, really shines in the role of Hilly, the ultimate society queen bee and an out and out racist to boot. You really find yourself disgusted with her actions and attitude. Also a stand-out is Jessica Chastain as Ceila, town out cast and apparent man eater whose Marilyn Monrone-like facade, and pretty rose bushes, hide a tragic secret.And while she has only three or four scenes, Cicely Tyson's scenes as Constantine, Skeeter's, much loved maid, are among the most touching and poignant in the film. Her final scene, in which we learn the true nature of her leaving the Phelan home, would break the hardest of hearts. Honourable mentions to Sissy Spacek as Hilly's slightly mad mother and Allison Janney as Skeeter's mother, a woman struggling with both a serious illness and her actions regarding Constantine.The score and cinematography are amazing but it is the performances that make this film. It is touching and warm, poignant and sad, funny and uplifting. It is also important as a commentary on the dangerous judging people based on physical appearance and deals well with it's serious subject matter, allow the message to come across clearly without being too depressing or hard hitting.All in all this is a must-see movie and one for the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I regret not able to read the bestseller before movie came out. I used to get through the reviews before watching a movie of this genre and mostly wasted my time and money after reading some big-mouths except just a few titles like Hotel Rwanda and American History X. In my personal opinion, I would rate The Help much higher than American History X.Wonderful performances by Octavia Spencer, Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Emma Stone and Cicely Tyson (All female-female as the story centered to). I believe nobody can see it without some cries and laughs simultaneously (especially if you see it alone as we turned cautious in crowd or theaters). Its all about the hard-work in building the characters that you would take it as real as it happens around you, even you are thousand miles away from the community where it happens.This is an important time in our community. Why I would pick this line as summary? Racism issues are every where in this era of Globalisation. What we need, is to tolerate and respect each other or we would be eating each other's ... like Hilly. Humanity is above all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good book, good movie, this movie is going to be a hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the book because the book keeps showing up at the top of recommendation list at Amazon and pops up every time I was there. More than 3000 ratings and counting have been given. The book by itself is already a modern classics. Heartwarming stories and written nicely and partly in the languages of the colored maids. Its narrative is humorous in its own way and never loses the brightness of life even though it took place in one of the bad time for color people in the American history.A strong story makes its way into a strong movie. In contrast to an awful lot of mediocre book-adapting movies seen nowadays, the movie keeps all the essential elements of the book and makes itself a faithful representation. It contains the minor but important events of the book, which to my fear would have been first sacrificed for keeping the film to the normal movie length about 1 to 1.5 hours, especially those historic events are kept to my delight. That makes sure the contemporary pulse can be felt throughout the movie. It shows the fear and the horror to people from different time, countries or races, because they are not likely to image that zeitgeist at that time of madness and racism in USA. Colored people could get shot or have their house burned down just by talking about their situations. Even when their lives were spared from violence, they still had to face all kinds of hatred and discriminations, exemplified by having their separated bathrooms.As to the omitted parts, I feel that they were good cuts: Celia fought off a lunatic and drank those quack cures, Skeeter's invitation to Stuart's house and a few more are in fact not that vital in my opinions. Also, small changes to originals were made and I feel fine about them: Charlotte knew about her daughter's undertaking, Rachael was being dark-colored and more importantly Hilly and Elizabeth's remorse at the end of the movie. The latter was a nice touch even though it dampens a bit Hilly's harshness and her incorrigible attitude to the help, which may not be Mrs Stockett's original idea.All in all, this 2 hours long movie is a must see. I myself had waited since August when I finished reading the book and am glad that it quite lives up to the book and my expectations: and I am a mean critic when it comes to movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful story very well told!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so I am not a regular film critic, but having just seen this beautiful movie and then ten told it had had some negative reviews I decided to have my say.Firstly I will say that I had not read the book.The acting in this film was all very well placed. The story was very well told and the director and the producers all had a very balanced vision for the story to be told.I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the film, and found it to be very humane. If you like films that tell a story giving you perspectives of all the players in the film then this is definitely one to watch.The color and lighting, the staging and the wonderful cars of the early 60's all 'help' to set the scene for this period.It's funny, touching, sad and a little informative.If you like films like The Rosa Parks Story, The Secret Life of Bees, and The Colour Purple then this is a film you will enjoy. Well done to all involved with 'The Help"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Help" manages to not only tell a powerful story but it also has a lightness about the film. This is seen in the unlikely friendship between Skeeter, Aibileen and Minny. Emma Stone steps out of her comfort zone to play the cleanest character yet, she plays the role of Skeeter convincingly and is great to watch. All the cast were top notch and delivered great performances. At times it felt effortless, in the way the narrative played out, to the chemistry and the development of the characters, it all felt natural and enjoyable to watch. This is like the American version of "The King's Speech" (2011) in terms of how the Americans have taken to this film like the Brits did with the Colin Firth led drama. Yet, you don't feel alienated or isolated and instead you watch a tragic yet heart warming story. A watch for all to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engrossing and relevant today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite engrossing from start to finish. It's a long movie but it didn't feel draggy. It's not too stereotypical or over sentimental or preachy. A story like this could easily have had a tendency to make people one dimensionally good or evil but it didn't really happen here. There are good performances esp from Bryce Howard as the "evil" one. Viola Davis is dependably sympathetic as the central domestic help. Emma Stone is an odd choice as she looks a bit non-Southern belle but she is watchable. The older white ladies are good too. Alison Janney maybe a bit too put together. Sissy is quite good. One faults - a bit more story about the men in the movie would have balanced things (both white and black. Good job overall. It's quite sad to note that even today in many places in the world domestic help are being treated many times worse than portrayed in this movie based in the 60s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really inspirational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched The Help. I wasn't particularly interested in the film itself but I managed to see it because of performances that had gotten great reviews.The Help was a very good film. It was much better than I expected. Sure it has flaws, and this is one of those obvious sentimental films that many people will dislike. It isn't a subtle film but t still works a lot, mostly because of he fantastic ensemble cast. Everyone had talked about Viola Davis. Back when I saw her for the first time in Doubt I thought she was incredible. Here, she elevates to an even higher degree because this is her film. She can carry out. But wait, she isn't the only lead. Emma Stone is fantastic as well. In fact, her dramatic scenes here were the stand-outs in her performance, since I have always loved her in comedies. The other incredible performance that I want to single out is Jessica Chastain. She gives so much heart into this role and she brings her scenes alive, just like she did in Tree of Life, yet they are definitely very different roles. Overall, this was a powerful film. It did touch me, and in that it achieved its purpose very much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film I have seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have not seen this movie, RUN RUN RUN DON"t WALK TO YOUR NEAREST MOVIE THEATER TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!! The movie itself is a great story but all the actors in it seemed to give life within the character and you really felt the pain and anguish of what they all felt back then. For someone to have as much courage as it took for "Skeeter" to write it and "Aibilene" and "Minny" and all the others to tell it, was just great. It so reminded me of how crazy and misguided white women were back then, and yes, I am white. I had an "Aibilene" growing up in the 60's and 70's and my parents treated her with nothing but respect. We ALL ate together. This movie evoked so much emotion in me from crying, to laughing, to cheering about "the pie". I loved absolutely every moment of this movie! Awesome cast, fabulous acting, and truly one of the most memorable movies that will be in my DVD collection!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very sincere, hilarious, and emotionally powerful movie lies within The Help.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I took the time recently to see a wonderful ensemble drama called The Help, a film based on the novel by Kathryn Stockett.The film centers around two main story lines in Jackson, Mississippi in the 1960's: First of which are the African-American housemaids working for white families. This includes Aibileen (Played by Viola Davis), a woman whose spent her whole life as a maid, not to mention having lost her only son, but still stays true to her beliefs.The other main narrative is that of Eugenia Phelan, aka. Skeeter (Played by Emma Stone), a woman recently hired by the local Jackson newspaper, who wants to have interviews from the point of view of the housemaids, even though they could face jail time for doing so. Never the less, Aibileen accepts, and Skeeter's project starts to form.Some would probably accuse The Help's screenplay of feeling emotionally forced, but what writer/director Tate Taylor constructs is actually a more honest, emotionally involving project. The themes of racial segregation give the film a dramatic edge, but it's also brimming with irresistible humor. What could have been a sappy melodrama actually feels more sincere.Same goes for the cast, who could have been butchered if not for casting directors Kerry Barden and Paul Schnee just nailing it. It's hard to pick a standout, but it's worth noting the individuals for their work.Jessica Chastain performs with equal hilarity and grace. Viola Davis, the closest thing to a standout, gives off understated, but powerful emotion. Bryce Dallas Howard, normally a very sweet soul, is evil enough to get your nostrils flaring. Allison Janney gives off a sarcastic, but also sympathetic vibe. Sissy Spacek tickles in her small supporting role. Octavia Spencer excels with a no bull crap attitude. And Emma Stone, with her charm and believability, works wonders as Skeeter.I must also make note of the technical crew of the film. Sharen Davis' costume define an extra depth of personality, and Thomas Newman supplies another emotionally potent orchestral score. Oh, and I almost forgot about editor Hughes Winborne. At a little over two hours and fifteen minutes long, the movie just flies by.Forgive me if I overrate, but The Help was too good for me to ignore. I give it ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I go to the movies to be entertained. And I was. Some reviews criticize the lack of depth in this movie - that it only skims the surface. I did not find it so, in fact I was highly satisfied with the story and the brilliant portrayal of the characters.This movie ticked all the boxes for me. It tugged at my heartstrings and made me cry, made me laugh, made me cringe, made me angry and drew me in to the plight of these courageous women so I cared what happened to them. In fact it put me through the wringer and I enjoyed every gamut of emotion wrung from me. I love a good story, a good cry and a satisfactory ending. Tick, tick and tick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help is one Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Help" is One Great Must See Movie By: Jim Fordyce from American entertainment report August 11, 2011 Rating: 4 out of Fordyce (Perfect) I did something I rarely do. I left the studio in the afternoon and took in a matinée of a movie that wasn't being offered as a preview. I also (for the first time this year) uttered the words: "Best Picture" while the credits were rolling."The Help" is a movie none of you want to miss. GO SEE IT! Set in Mississippi in the early 1960s, the film features a southern society girl who returns from college determined to become a writer. She gets a job at the local newspaper writing the household cleaning column, which leads her to interview black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent southern families.That description does not do this movie justice, nor does the trailer, which does not entice you to see it. I almost skipped this movie, and that would have been a mistake."The Help" tells the story of another era in a place where things were very different and attitudes were hard to change.The cast is an amazing collection of actors who are so believable you will feel like you are in their homes. Emma Stone is our heroine ready to write the stories; Octavia Spencer is marvelous, as are Jessica Chastain, Viola Davis, Bryce Dallas Howard, Chris Lowell, and Mike Vogel. One of my favorite actresses plays one mom. That would be Allison Janney. Sissy Spacek is the other mom, and the great Cicely Tyson gives a performance that is worthy of an Oscar.This is a great script that is beautifully produced. It will make you laugh, cry, be horrified, and be in love all within a time span of two hours and 17 minutes. There are no explosions in this movie, nor is there a lot bad language and dazzling special effects; rather, what you get is a collection of some real superheroes in the form of the women we meet.This one gets a perfect 4 out of Fordyce, so go see it. CREDIT CHECK: There is nothing at the end of the credits; "The Help" does it all before it ends, but wait a few moments to notice how the credits roll over a touching scene that is the perfect end to this perfect film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my wife's biggest pet peeves is that I typically become bored with movies because usually, half way thru the movie, I can usually predict much of the content and the ending. Most movies suffer from a lack of originality ! Most share the same conversations and plot, the only difference is the title of the movie and the revolving circuit of actors. "The Help" is so very refreshing because there was a new twist or development around every turn. The cast of actors introduced many people that are not on the actor revolving door list and that was exciting to see their performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Work of Art</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a finely packaged piece of art - maybe it was too good. For me, I always judge a movie by the impression the 'bad guys' leave on me. From Emma Stone to Viola Davis to Sissy 'Carrie' Spacek ? they all did a super job. Even the mother managed to dig herself out from under the 'bad-bus' at the end. These performers all had easy parts since their drums were easy to bang. BUT Bryce Dallas Howard was remarkable. From the beginning to end, her character was an unlikable southern racist. This must have been a very difficult part for this young woman to play. If one plays an evil murderer or a vampire, they get a pass?if one plays a racist ? a very brave move and she did an outstanding job. I do remember these times but not from a southerners' perspective, but from one in the north looking south. As a Yankee, many of us are way too busy painting a racist brush over the southern whites - never taking the time to gaze into our own mirrors. Ah well, that is enough pontificating. The ingredients of this film are so well blended and the story is so masterfully told, that it should result in jarring race relations bring set back twenty years. Like, 'The Holocaust' or 'Bataan Death March', this was a terrible time and should never be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emotionally Helpful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One can't help but cheer for maids everywhere. This wonderfully adapted screenplay is leaving audiences everywhere with a heavy heart and a clean mind, spotless actually. Director and Screenwriter Taylor Tate transfers the reality and accuracy of the book, The Help, exceptionally and also maintains emotional congruency that leaves this movie masterful. The quality of actors and the acting in this picture supersedes every conceivable disappointment. During the somewhat clichéd version of a 1960's setting, that leaves something to be desired, an upper class white woman, Emma Stone, writes a tell all novel of black maids and their point of views of working for white families. Emma Stone as Skeeter Phelan is exactly what every audience needs, a good old fashioned beating heart, underneath a beautiful complexion. The believable love portrayed by Viola Davis, as Aibileen Clark, is remarkable and one can't help but feel for the black maids who dedicate their lives to serving these families. Along with beautifully exercising the relationships surrounding Jackson, Mississippi, The Help provides comical arousal. The "Terrible Awful" is probably one of the funniest practical jokes ever portrayed in a film of this nature. The comedic timing is just like a perfect slice of chocolate pie. It would be impossible to purchase what this movie provides, which is the raw emotional passion that you can only find with "The Help."</fullReview>

Well, if you are expecting to see this, and have not even bothered to watch it, don't you freaking dare to keep thinking the same thought, because I was wrong as soon as I left the theater! From beginning to end, The Help is a jaw-dropping story that encourages us to keep on with life!Great actors are present such as Bryce Dallas Howard's sensation evil role as Hilly and Viola Davis' heart-warming and perfected role as Aibileen. When I left the theater, I was literally paralized because of its complexity and filling with tears, despite the fact I am a man.

		<shortDescription>Amazing female ensemble delivers perfect mixture of humor and drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Late-summer Civil Rights dramas don't come around much. In fact, late-summer dramas don't come around much period, but "The Help" has just the right pinches of humor and bright colors to keep it from becoming a weighty affair more suited for the winter awards contenders. Don't assume, however, that come the turn of seasons that anyone will have forgotten "The Help" come awards time.Tate Taylor adapts and directs Kathryn Stockett's best-selling novel about African-American maids living in Jackson, Miss. in the Jim Crow era. Viola Davis plays Aibileen, a woman who has been raising the children of wealthy Southern white families for decades. When college grad Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan (Emma Stone) returns home with aspirations of becoming a journalist, she tries to convince Aibileen and fellow maid Minnie (Octavia Spencer) to tell their stories in hopes of getting their perspective heard. Although the women fear their identities being discovered, the prejudicial attitudes of Miss Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her initiative to force homes with maids to provide a separate bathroom for The Help provokes them to courageously speak up."The Help" puts out a massive ensemble effort glowing with talent. Never has a female- dominated cast of this size given such strong performances across the board. Aibileen provides the narrative voice, but Skeeter, Minnie and others each get their stories told in full depth and the supporting roles from the likes of Allison Janney as Skeeter's mother and Sissy Spacek as Hilly's mother are priceless.If a standout has to be chosen for Oscar consideration, it has to be Davis. There's that constant look in her eyes suggesting that she's always carrying every single thing her character has ever been through into every scene. She's penetratingly real; she is everyone's mother. She also brings the film's wide range of emotions, though the comedy would be Spencer's forte.Spencer, a long-time small-role character actor, follows Taylor from his first feature-length film "Pretty Ugly People." She makes the film a true delight with a hold-nothing-back attitude. Minnie embodies some racial stereotypes, but the script gives her such incredible depth that we associate those things with who she truly is, not as a vehicle for humor.Perhaps ? oddly enough ? too many characters feel multi-dimensional and "The Help" lacks a true focus for a film running nearly two and a half hours, but the acting is so sharp at all levels that it never feels boring or hollow. The characters and the many situations and problems they deal with feel unmistakably real, namely because those problems break the mold for Southern Civil Rights drama.The film avoids being another example of how terrible things once were and how poorly blacks were treated. It asks us to feel sorry for everyone, not just the African-American characters and scratch our heads at how life was ever like that anywhere in this country. Ultimately, "The Help" tells a story of courage in one of its unlikeliest forms ? telling the truth, making sure all side are heard. It uses such a diverse tool set of characters to get that point across.Taylor's much more concerned about working with these actresses to create compelling portraits of characters and relationships in a place and time full of unique issues than he is with creating gripping drama. Considering the film is no less poignant and maybe all the more likable for it, he made the right choice.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in Jackson, Mississippi, in the early '60s, "Skeeter" (Emma Stone) is a recent college graduate aspiring to be a writer or novelist. Having been raised by a Negro nanny whom she adored, she decides to interview other local Negroes who serve as maids or nannies to white families in the area, and write a book about their experiences. The film shows some of the barriers between whites and blacks; Skeeter's efforts help begin to surmount some of those.I spent a year in Mississippi in the early '60s and, IMO, the film's vision of the (white) Junior League of that era is slightly a caricature--but fairly accurate in flavor. What is quite inaccurate is having a Jr. Leaguer in Skeeter's fact-finding role at that time, or having blacks daring to support Skeeter to the extent they're shown doing. It's equally inaccurate to portray racist whites as hateful; in that era, many white people with otherwise admirable qualities were racists.In a sense, the movie has a fairy tale quality with time traveling mixed in (i.e., as if today's sensibilities travel back to examine the '60s Mississippi scene, inhabit Skeeter and a few blacks, and then begin taking corrective action through them). It's an "ultra light civil rights" version of Mississippi (&amp; similar parts of the South), one that ignores the overlapping memberships of community leaders in White Citizen Councils, police in the Ku Klux Klan, and all those, and many, many others, staunch members in many white churches.But the film's acting was great: Davis, Spencer, Howard, Chastain, &amp; Stone make this fairy tale come alive. It's primarily about relationships between women (and women DO seem to enjoy the movie very much). IMDb's demographic ratings consistently reflect that females, whatever their ages, rate the film about 10% higher than males; it seems much more appealing to women--likewise, for my 2 female companions at the movie, it was a 10 of 10.It's fairly safe to say: if you loved the book, you'll love this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All conquerors make the mistake of leaving the children with "the help". After Strongbow and the Norman-French out of Wales overran Ireland in 1176, the Gaelic-speaking girls raised the children. These children in one generation spoke Gaelic, wore Irish clothing and had Irish attitudes. They became Gaelic lords. The Fitzgeralds of Kerry were an example. "Skeeter" was a result of such upbringing and did not become as obnoxious as her parents and their friends. The little girl featured with Viola Davis's character called her her real mother. At Monticello, a docent spoke with what I can only describe as a Black dialect. Because Blacks were kept away from education, the dialect was almost incomprehensible. My friend from West Virginia said, "It's because they had Black nannies." So I found that part of "The Help" totally believable. It's a novel but novels often reveal the real feel of a situation. Perhaps it was superficial, broad, not intense like Shamaylian or Hitchcock. But Hilly scared the hell out of me. Even in Queens County New York, teenage counsellors at a day camp could urge the Black kids to leave the bus in the afternoon by saying, "Bongo Muchacha, Water Boy Number One, Booga Booga," or the like. In the late 1950's. Maybe that is why so many baby boomers were at this movie. We all experienced the blindness. And the respect for certain loudmouths who could intimidate a kid into silence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one that chronicles intimate relationships between children and maids. These children were raised by maids and developed a sense of right and wrong in a time where these loving replacement mothers were nothing more than servants. It's a story about a young woman raised by such a loving woman who goes against the grain to do what is right in an attempt to change the status quo. It's an act that is dangerous to all involved. There is some historical information as well as lots of laughs and some tears. This movie is deep, complex and has the ability to evoke emotion across the spectrum. We need more uplifting movies like this. I say a hearty THANK YOU to Kathryn Stockette for having the courage to write this book on which the movie was based. Well done!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie of the Year So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you read the book "The Help," you will certainly not be disappointed in the movie. The movie faithfully follows the important parts of the book, and it hardly misses a beat. I'd say that both the book and the movie are equally great, and there are so many outstanding performances in the movie that are Oscarworthy for 2012. Most importantly, you will go through many emotions. You will laugh, cry, and most of all, feel intelligent. That is the basis of feel-good movies - to evoke an emotion in you.Emma Stone is Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, the center heroine of the story who isn't looking for marriage, is dating the son of a politico, but just finished college and is looking to become a journalist. She is rejected at first in New York, but is immediately accepted as the advice giver "Miss Myrna" for a local newspaper in Mississipi. But "Miss Myrna" is not enough. She realizes that she has been raised by a loving black housekeeper named Constantine (beautiful cameo by aging actress Cicely Tyson, and has been a staple in intelligent black acting), and out of all her old college friends, she is the only one who has never taken her housekeeper for granted. All her other friends have turned evil as they hired housekeepers to raise their babies and do all the hard work for them, while they are hedonistically having fun and playing bridge. The meanest of all of them is Hilly Holbrook. Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron Howard's lookalike daughter, viciously chews up her character of Hilly with boundless enthusiasm, and I hope that she gets an Oscar nomination for her portrayal. Emma Stone is quieter in her role as Skeeter, but I think she should get an Oscar nomination as Best Actress because she played her so honestly and faithfully.The housekeepers are marvelously played and the actresses' performances of them are priceless. Viola Davis will touch you deeply as Abileen, the Oprah Winfrey-esque domestic, who is more loving to Katherine Leefolt's (Ahna O'Reilly) neglected daughter, and convinces her that all people are equal, and they are. Octavia Spencer is a hoot who provides comic relief as the overweight, sassy, blurting domestic Minny, who lost so many jobs, is a heck of a cook, and tells everyone what she thinks of them. She is first booted out of Hilly's house, when Hilly discovered she was using the family bathroom, and then told everyone she stole silver as a cover-up, but then she forms a wonderful relationship with the naive but troubled new girl in town, Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain, looking and acting like Marilyn Monroe, and yet bringing intelligence and complexity to the character). Unlike the book, Celia keeps Minny as Minny forms a strong bond with Celia after her miscarriage, and helps her through her intimidation of her husband Johnny's former lover, Hilly. And of course, there's those hilarious and unforgettable Minny's chocolate pie scenes, the comic relief of the movie and book.In addition to the bright young cast, there are wonderful supporting parts by veteran southern-born actresses - Sissy Spacek plays Hilly's equally prejudiced mother who may or may not dig into the pie. Mary Steenburgen as Elaine Stein, the New York-based editor of Harper and Row who at first is reluctant to hire Skeeter, but after Skeeter's book,"The Help," is published, she accepts her. That makes Skeeter have to leave her ill mother, (Allison Janney, in an icy performance) behind. Her mother doesn't tell Skeeter about the entire truth of why Constantine, the housekeeper who raised her, disappeared, so that is where Skeeter uncovers the truth of domestics and their employers."The Help" is a perfect marvel that is faithful as historical fiction. It speaks the truths of the Civil Rights Era and the beliefs of blacks and whites alike. This was author Kathryn Stockett's first novel, and it is a huge blockbuster. Writer-director Tate Taylor follows the book meticulously, but dilutes it for the 2-hour and 15-minute running time for content. He delivers honest and emotional portrayals from everyone, whether the characters are touching, sensitive, funny, or cold-hearted. Hands down the best picture of the summer, and were not even into the fall, but this movie makes for an Oscar Contender, and I hope my prediction will be right. I would like the Academy to remember Emma Stone as Best Actress, Bryce Dallas Howard as Best Supporting Actress, Tate Taylor as Best Director, and "The Help" as Best Picture. I would also like to add Viola Davis for her tender performance as Abileen for an Oscar nomination as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Civil Rights with a Human Heart in an Emotionally Cathartic Film Led by the Incomparable Viola Davis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Tate Taylor in only his second full-length effort, this 2011 period film isn't perfect, but its precarious blend of gravitas, pathos and humor tugs at the heartstrings in a way that makes the story emotionally riveting without veering into the maudlin or being condescending, no small feat considering the ongoing temptations in Tate's fully ripened screenplay. Set in his hometown of Jackson, Mississippi, in 1961 just as the civil rights movement was taking hold of the Deep South, the film benefits immeasurably from its excellent cast, in particular, a gut-wrenching performance from Viola Davis, a brilliant actress who blazed through just eight minutes of screen time in John Patrick Shanley's "Doubt". Showing more nuanced shades of her trademark stoic strength here, she serves as the film's emotional center as Aibileen, a haunted middle-aged maid who has spent most of her life raising white children and just recently lost her only son to racially motivated violence.Based on fellow Jacksonian Kathryn Stockett's popular 2009 novel, this immensely satisfying adaptation faithfully covers most of the book's major plot points and fluidly shifts viewpoints between Aibileen; her sassy best friend Minny, who can't help but show her contempt for her racist employers; and Skeeter Phelan, a young white woman and recent college graduate who after moving back home, discovers that Constantine, the dedicated maid who helped raise her since childhood has mysteriously disappeared. The three women's stories intertwine seamlessly to explain how life in Jackson revolved around the co-existence of blacks and whites in a state of casual yet hostile intimacy. The symbol of institutionalized segregation is the bathroom, a firebrand issue led by Hilly Holbrook, the town's demonic debutante who is pushing to pass an ordinance to support her belief that all homes should have separate bathroom facilities for the "colored" help. This revelation makes Skeeter realize how deep the racial divide is in her town. Ambitious to become a serious writer, Skeeter pitches an idea to the publishing house of Harper &amp; Row to write a book that would show her world from the black maids' perspectives, an idea fraught with danger to all who dare to participate. Spurred on by civil rights activist Medgar Evers' assassination in Jackson, the maids unify in their support of the book (a scene that reduced me to tears), and it becomes a big success but not without certain sacrifices.Beyond Davis' sterling turn, there is an embarrassment of acting riches - Octavia Spencer's tart-tongued turn as Minny threatens to steal the picture entirely, especially in a hilariously vengeful chocolate pie scene that almost belongs in a completely different movie; an extravagantly coiffed and costumed Bryce Dallas Howard, surprisingly effective as Hilly, the most venal and unrepentant of racists; Jessica Chastain in full-blown Marilyn mode as the white-trash wife ostracized by the bridge club set; Sissy Spacek easily stealing her brief comic scenes as Hilly's dotty mother fully aware of her daughter's character shortcomings; Allison Janney as Skeeter's acidic, status-conscious mother who proves it's never too late to change your ways; Cicely Tyson lending unforced dignity and an uncanny Jane Pittman countenance to the flashback scenes of Constantine; and smoky-voiced Emma Stone, who officially graduates from comic supporting roles and truly comes into her own as Skeeter. The whole cast deserves to be remembered during awards season. Not by accident, the men are given short shrift here. A more experienced filmmaker than Taylor could have instilled a greater sense of fearlessness in the movie's approach, although at the same time, few would be as generous with such an outstanding cast. Despite some moments that border on being too broad, the film represents superior entertainment about a period of American history that needs to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes it's a feel good movie for white people and everyone else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a ten because it left such a good feeling with the audience but I have to admit that it wasn't perfect. The Help is your typical movie told by white people about civil rights. It has all of the right characters and ends in the right way. But it is the story of the black women and the performances of the actresses that play them that I will remember most. Viola Davis is wonderful as always. Cissy Spacek has a plum role that she makes the most of. Octavia Spencer is a jewel and I would love to see more from her. Emma Stone was also okay in her role but the character of her mother played by Allison Janney is great. The two things that are ultimately wrong are the portrayal of most of the men, black and white and the story concerning Skeeters' maid which was very weak; though Cicelie Tyson does a wonderful job with the minute role. Yes it is a feel good movie and you feel really good. Just one more note my daughter and I were the only Black people in the theater and it really made me have to think. Are these kind of movies the only ones that white people will come and see? And the audience was majority white women. Why won't they come to see other stories where black people are the center of the story and I don't count Tyler Perry movies. Just something to think about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Powerful, poignant, honest picture of life south of the Mason-Dixon Line prior to passage of the Civil Rights Act and subsequent government sanctioned civil strife/murder in the American south and cities throughout the nation. If you lived it, you will get flashbacks. If you were too young to live it, you will witness a piece of history accurately re-enacted.From hope in JFK and loss of that hope in his assassination, to the murder of Medgar Evers, to the blatant bigotry ingrained in 1963 Mississippi culture, to the heartbreaks and heartaches of African Americans in the South, this film will wrench your gut. And if you compare this movie to today's America, you will be stunned at the similarities. Similarities not necessarily in the racial sense, but certainly in economic policy...be cerebral when viewing this film, it is worth it. Best movie of its genre since Forrest Gump. The lead actors should get Academy Award nominations and this film should be nominated for Best Picture. End of story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure Spielberg, and that's not a bad thing. You couldn't have had better acting, except maybe Bryce Dallas Howard, who overdid it, or was directed to overdo it. I believe she was chosen for her resemblance to Michelle Bachman.It is possible to be the villain without being so obviously a villain with no redeeming behavior, and have virtually every other character in the movie beat you like a pinata. The people of the Southern US in those days didn't think anything was wrong. That is what was so seductive about that culture. Being spiteful and asserting your dominance was bad form, particularly if you were upper crust. Only the white trash abused the blacks (the movie does it the other way around). Blacks and whites simply did things the way they had always been done and got along. Change was imposed from outside, if one remembers the events of the civil rights movement. People came to town and marched and sat where they weren't supposed to and said things polite southerners weren't supposed to say.Our American movies from big studios seem to need to have un-ambiguous conflicts to be marketable. And, as our education system focuses more on marketable skills, we will probably get less subtle and sophisticated and truthful movies than even this one. This is, for example, no "Driving Miss Daisy".The portrayal of Skeeter's mother is probably the closest in the movie to true southern behavior, except I believe it would have been totally unacceptable to throw your longtime maid out onto the street in her senescence.A movie that gets to the heart of Southern society at that time would show how very few people tried to exceed society's expectations. The people who got out, seemed to have the best chance. And that, at the very end, is what the movie portrays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Courage has a price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A man does what he must - in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles and dangers and pressures - and that is the basis of all morality." - - John F. Kennedy Kennedy, of course, was correct. In this film we get to see a rare presentation, full to the brim with women with more than enough courage to impress even President Kennedy. Of course, that is the immediate thing in the back of everyone's mind who watches this film. In fact, there is so much courage to go around it's hard to decide just who is the most important character in the film. I finally had to decide it's a team of courageous women focused on truth and perhaps, ultimately, change.This story is primarily set in the early 1960's in the town of Jackson, Mississippi. It deals with the subject of the truly bad treatment that black servants received from their white employers and is lightly framed by the growing civil rights movement.The two most prominent characters - protagonists - as we near the end of the film have been Emma Stone as Eugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan and Viola Davis as Aibileen Clark. It's those two characters who are the genesis of everything that happens here. The journey they embark on together, from the staid, old fashioned society they came up in toward a brighter future is the stuff of greatness. Their experiences and the resultant emotions carry us easily along through their trials and tribulations as they work through the story.The greatest thing about the film is watching these two women do what they do best: act. Both Davis and Stone are exceptional actresses and have plenty of room here to exercise their craft. There is not a false note from them in the entire film. Davis, who has already garnered a lot of notice from her previous films, is in perfect form as the overworked and much under-appreciated maid. Stone, who has shown great promise as an actress in lighter roles, certainly makes a terrific showing as a great dramatic actress. Both of these women are fascinating to watch; their styles and presentations so different yet so unfailingly on target. The film is more than worth watching for them alone, but we have many more fine performances here.The primary antagonist is wonderfully portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard as Hilly Holbrook. Howard is perfect in this difficult role of the saccharine, insincere, self-important, lying troublemaker who serves as a focal representation of all that was bad in their society. She is just as wonderful to watch work as the others and gives a comic edge to a performance that could have gone over the edge into ridiculousness had it not been handled as well.There is also a wonderful performance from Octavia Spencer as Howard's maid Minny Jackson. Her performance shows surprising depth and is worthy of all the praise that could be heaped upon her.It's hard to give appropriate thanks to all of those in the film that gave so much of themselves to make this film as great as it is. There is Allison Janney as Charlotte Phelan, Stone's mother. She is great in showing a transformation in a character. Then there was a small role played by the great Cicely Tyson as Constantine Jefferson, the maid that raised Stone's character and served as her character's moral compass. Her performance is understated and quite touching. Another small but excellent portrayal was from Sissy Spacek as Missus Walters, who is Howard's mother. All of these actresses ad flesh to the film in wonderfully realistic ways.But perhaps the most unusual and very entertaining part was played by Jessica Chastain as Celia Foote, a very ditzy, white trash blond who marries up and is trying to make inroads into the tight social circles of the city. But her portrayal is also infused with warmth and genuine charm, lightening the story and providing an excellent counterpoint to Howard's character. Her performance, although quite different from the other performers, is every bit as good and you can't help but love her by the end of the film.Considering how entertaining the film was, one must certainly praise those who sculpted this fine film. The director, Tate Taylor, who also scripted from Kathryn Stockett's novel, created some excellent material here and is just as deserving of praise as the actors/actresses. The portrayal of the intricacies and hypocrisy in the world around Stockett is brought to the screen with intelligence and compassion.Underscoring the great performances are the technical aspects of the film; cinematography, score, editing, sets, costuming, lighting, makeup, everything, is wonderfully done and presents an overall visual and aural portrait of the mid-twentieth century south.This is definitely a film worth seeing, and although there are a few light moments, it's just as adamantly a drama. It should not be overlooked at Oscar time. Thank you everyone for giving me a great end to a wearisome week.By Bruce L. Jones http://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viola Davis' Quiet Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading the novel on which this movie is based was one of the most thrilling moments of the year, and seeing its film adaptation is also one of the highlights in a very good movie year. Still, before going into detail, let's be clear about three big questions in the adaptation: "the source of the idea for writing the book?", "the college/jail subplot?", and "Celia's revelation". If you are a purist, you'll be a bit upset by the changes. Just remember both the film and the book have their hearts in the same place, a quest to educate about a period in American history, full of pain, contradiction, confusion, and hate, with the insight provided by the writer and the devastating, moving, and flawless performance by Viola Davis and most of the supporting cast, "The Help" is a truly outstanding film, one that needs no hyperbole in its advertising, manipulation in its marketing, or a radically different way to do "storytelling". Here is a film, with a strong narrative, a handful of moving scenes, and a big, strong, and marvelous heart.Viola Davis plays the main character, a maid who has seen it all and has quietly endured her share of personal and social tragedies. She is a witness who quietly supports her peers and her community, writing prayers, hoping things will eventually turn for the better, and giving plenty of love to even "the enemy". The truth is she is a pure and lovely human being, someone who has raised many children by telling them to be the best, believe in themselves, and providing them with whatever support she can offer. Unfortunately, she runs into several rocky situation that could test even her dedication. In the end, she knows it's time to change things.With the help of Skeeter (Eugenia), beautifully recreated by the very talented and underrated Emma Stone, and a very spirited Minny (Octavia Spencer), a collection of testimonials are put together to tell the world how the help sees the Southern society in America in the 60's. Some of the stories are more detailed in the book. A few are accurately depicted in the film, and bit and pieces of them have a very good cinematic portrayal: a certain pie comes to mind. "The Help" could certainly be a mini series, and it would make a more wonderful experience, but we are give a mini treasure, and with such marvelous actresses like Stone, Howard, Spencer, Davis, and Spacek, there are no wrong moves. Everyone gets her big moment, but the film is truly anchored by Davis, an actress who managed to steal Streep's thunder in "Doubt", and no one comes close to her work here. When she is on screen, there is looking away from her magnetic presence, from those caring and intense eyes who tell her stories with every shading and emotion.There are at least three scenes in the film that will move the audience: reminiscing about her child, her confrontation with Hilly, and having her deal with the assassination of a political figure in the film. The film is bit over two hours, and it goes too fast in spite of its richness, its beauty, and her strong heart. It is a testament to the care shown by the entire crew. The depiction of that world is a work of art, with its sets, costumes, cinematography, and an editing job that would put a few movies to shame."The Help" is not perfect, but it achieves its goal: to teach and entertain, to show what a strong heart can do, and to warn us that it is very tiring to hang on to hate and pain; that we must free ourselves and move so we can have time to love and treasure what is important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first time in my life I have ever liked the movie version better than the book. I finished the book the night before seeing the movie. The book left a lot of unanswered story lines, and it also left Hilly on top, with no one really telling her what a piece of trash she really is. The film does an excellent job of incorporating a majority of the book, while adding two scenes where Hilly finally has someone tell her what an a$$hole she really is. I rank the movie a 9 out of 10 because it really is almost perfect. It has Emma Stone as Skeeter trying to break out as a writer by tackling the hot button topic of segregation from the view point of the help. Both supporting characters-Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer-carry the wisdom and truly make you question how racist morons in the south as high up as the governor were able to reign supreme for so long. Skeeter's mother-Allison Janney-lit up the screen. She is the souther belle that has also been dealt a pretty harsh case of cancer that has left her losing her hair and her speed, but she still pushes for the best for her little girl, and in the end proves to be proud of her daughter for being such a courageous writer and human being. Now we have Hilly Holbrook-Bryce Dallas Howard-the villain of the film. I LOVED her in this role. The very sight of her on screen turned my stomach every time. She is a self proclaimed Christian southern belle, but is in reality an ignorant racist that enjoys controlling all her friends and pretty much everything in her life and everyone else's life. She enjoys treating the help terribly, it appears to genuinely make her happy. This is where the book failed terribly. The book had Hilly come out on top, with no one ever really giving it to her. The movie is redeeming, and I cried numerous times throughout. I see numerous Oscar nominations in its future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great film for 2011, if The Help does not get any nominations by the academy awards, then the Oscars are has blind as a bat.The story takes in 1963 Jacksonfill Mississippi, where a a young Journalist named Skeeter(Emma Stone), eagerly wants to be writer. One day while at a friends, she sees how the African American maid named Aibileen(Viola Davis) is horribly mistreated, so she asks Aibileen is that would like to tell her story, while Skeeter writes it down. First Aibleen says no, but then yes. And her outspoken friend Minny(Octavia Spencer) quickly joins in. But will they make a difference? The real Oscar worthy performances should go to Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer, they really gave it there all, everything about them in the film where real. Emma Stone is also good here, not bad in her first dramatic performance. Bryce Dallas Howard really surprised, I didn't think she had the acting chops to pull off playing a real unlikable character, but she did it so well, that you will feel like clapping when bad things happen to her. The bond between he ladies in the film is very strong, and it makes the film. And it has a great 60's setting. A well bittersweet film for 2011.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling but necessary; Surefire nominations for Viola Davis &amp; Octavia Spencer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help is at once a joy to watch for its absorbing yet haunting story and for the superior acting by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. On the other hand, it is nauseating at times to suffer through the scenes of outright cruelty perpetrated by the white women of the south in the early 1960s. It is one thing to read about Jim Crow in a book or listen to an old person nowadays discussing what it was like, but to see reenactments of just how dehumanizing and vindictive the times were is just unsettling. This is an important story, fictional yes, but representative of a time and a place which reminds the audience just how ashamed we should be at aspects of our past.A few decades ago in the south, it was commonplace for a white family to employ a black maid. Maid is an all encompassing term for house cleaner, cook, nanny, grocery shopper, butler, and every other menial task you could think of. They potty trained the toddlers, read them stories, and pretty much raised the children instead of their mothers who were enjoying that afternoon's bridge party. This particular story takes place in Jackson, MS and focuses on three main characters.'Skeeter' (Emma Stone) has just graduated from Ole Miss, one of her only clique to do so, and returned home to get her foot in the door at the local paper. It appears she went to school for an education rather than to husband hunt which sets her apart from her friends. She wants to be a writer but does not have the experience to get hired on by a true publishing firm. What really separate Skeeter though is that she has a much more enlightened view on race relations. This is odd. Where did this character pick up the notion that perhaps certain things should not just be left alone and separate but equal is anything but? Skeeter's mother (Alison Janney) does not display any sentiment towards her maid and Ole Miss was not widely acknowledged to be a bastion of forward and progressive thinking thought in 1963. It is strange that Skeeter is of such a different mold than the rest, but there would be no plot if she was not.Illicitly, Skeeter starts to interview the black maids of the town. She spends most of her time with Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minnie (Octavia Spencer). These two maids share with Skeeter their horror stories of maltreatment, child neglect, and every other behind the curtain story their employer would not want anyone else to know. Skeeter is combining all of the maids' stories into a book to tell the rest of the country what is going on down south from the maids' perspective this time.I have a hunch that come awards time, there will be a Best Actress nomination for Viola Davis and a supporting nomination for Octavia Spencer. The film is strongest when they are on screen. Viola showed traces of her character in 2008's Doubt and this is Octavia's first true starring role. When the film flips back and focuses on the white women for a time, especially when it shows Skeeter trying to find a boyfriend or argue with her mother, the atmosphere loses its tension and the pacing slows until it gets back on track with the maids. This film is truly unsettling at times, but well worth the audience's discomfort to show them a time and a place not very long ago which was not just immoral, but malicious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Deep South, a police state like Nazi-Germany and the Soviet-Union</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For about two-thirds of the film, the overall atmosphere really reminded me of the stories my grandfather told me about his life in Germany and his fathers life in Russia before that. It feels like the black people lived in a totalitarian state, a police state. And of course it really was like that. This is what it must have been like, in Apartheid South Africa.So, the real value of this film is that you realize that much has has stayed the same and worse, that America is changing back, in a way. Of course it's better now. In the 1960s, blacks couldn't protest, didn't kill whites who killed their fathers, mothers, daughters or sons, because they knew that the retaliation would be against ALL black people, not just the ones who fought back.But given the current political climate, it's not a stretch to say that things aren't improving. Blacks are STILL the bottom of the rung, despite all the ones who 'made it'.This film does indicate that African-Americans in Hollywood STILL aren't fully equal. How many major Hollywood films have you ever seen with a true black female lead? Especially ones where she doesn't play a 'black' character? I guess those movies aren't really there.I first saw Viola Davis in an episode of Law and Order Criminal Intent, where she was the though mastermind bad cop. Ever since, she just played 'black', or 'token black'. Sad.The latter third is a feel good movie. It's understandable why, it's hard to accurately portray the bleakness of those years, especially for a white writer. You can see the denial of harshness of those years right here on these pages and in other reviews. There's complaints that they can't be critical about this, in other words, the film is a race card that's been played. Complaining about the race card is a deceptive and slightly more subtle form of racism, but it's racism nonetheless.This country is not yet ready for a true portrait of slavery, or of Jim Crow times.</fullReview>

I looked at the crowd around me. Women and men, both white and black sat beside each other; many of which could still remember well when President Kennedy was killed.Few movies in my life have made me mad, laugh till I cried, mad again, so sad that tears were running down my cheek and then laughing again. My emotions were on a roller coaster. The story is so well woven and the characters are so believable.This movie contains many scenes that you will be remembering for days, weeks, and even years to come. One scene in particular, I believe, will be shown later as one of the most remembered scenes in movie history. Those who have seen it will know what I am talking about and those who will see it will recognize it immediately. I recommend this movie but it is not a movie to take small children....the story line would bore most of them. There is very little swearing in this movie, but what there is, is true to the characters and particular scenes.It is a movie that I would take my Mother to see. It is not a "chick flick" It is a movie that will enchant you and reel you in for a ride of history and a look into the emotions of both sides of this coin.Now I say, if you are a racist (white or black) or a classicist then maybe you should not see it. But then again, maybe you should. I see it as an eye opener for both sides.</fullReview>

I cried, I laughed, I had a great time just listening to the many stories of the black maids, it was incredible. Emma Stone, Viola Davis, and Octavia Spencer really made this movie fun to watch. Now if you have read the book i'm sure this movie was a lot better. I did not read the book but the person with me had and she said it made it ten times better. Storyline: This movie is about Skeeter an aspiring young writer who wants to write a book from the maids perspective. Of course this is back in a time when maids were black and Martin Luther King Jr was fighting for the racial peace. She talks Aibileen Clark her friends maid to talking to her. Little did she realize the publisher's in New York would need at least 15 maids stories in her book. It takes a long time but she gets that many maids and her book is published. This Movie really gives you a glimpse into the past to see what it was like, believe me it makes you sick to think that people were treated that way.Overall it was a great story that I think you should see. I wouldn't recommend this for younger children. 8 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Left a Bad Taste in my Mouth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help has two outstanding performances: one from Viola Davis and the other from Octavia Spencer. Beyond that, I felt like I was fed a slice of Minny Jackson's pie. When the emotional apex of the film is a young, prosperous and coddled white woman agonizing about whether to leave the racially charged Jackson for a glamorous life in the literary swirl of New York,you know that something has gone very wrong indeed. This film did not need Skeeter and the fact that she became its centre-piece, no matter how "enlightened" she may have been, is a subtle form of racism in its own right. The maids in The Help are more interesting, more compelling and much more deserving of the film's unwavering attention.Structurally, the film bites off more than it can chew, or at least digest. There are too many characters, too many sub-plots, too much distraction from the two most important women in the story. Is it about Skeeter and the relationship with her old nursemaid (as nice as it is to see Cicely Tyson again)? How much ought we to really care about Skeeter's mother (the badly miscast Alison Janney)? Is it worth time and trouble to introduce and follow the Celia Foote character, who would have made for a pretty good lead character but in a different movie? And what are we to make of poor Sissy Spacek in her confounding, embarrassing and largely irrelevant role as the demented Missus Walters? All of these characters may have performed a valuable dramatic function in the novel, but in a two hour movie we just don't need them. The Help demonstrates one of the pitfalls to which inexperienced directors can fall prey in trying to adapt a novel to the screen.All in all, The Help is the kind of film that you keep hoping will redeem itself. For my taste, I'd rather have had something with fewer ingredients and a lot more bite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Goes On - And On - And On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a bad movie. It actually has a lot of good material in it. It's an interesting perspective on the civil rights movement of the 1960's and especially on race relations in the state of Mississippi. It revolves around the writing of a book by Skeeter (Emma Stone) - an aspiring author largely raised by a black maid employed by her family who decides to write about what life is like as a black domestic servant in the City of Jackson. As we watch her write, and as she manages to get more and more of the stories of the various "maids" shared with her, we see the sadness and injustice of the southern lifestyle of the era. The "maids" were only slightly better off than the slaves who had come before them - at the whim of their "employers," poorly paid and useful mainly because they allowed the women they worked for to enjoy a relative life of ease, not even having to take responsibility for the raising of their own children. There may have been a little too much caricature involved in that portrayal (although not having lived in Jackson, Mississippi in the '60's, I can't say for sure) but this certainly gives a taste of the era and the society. This isn't about marches or protests, although the killing of civil rights leader Medgar Evers earns a mention; it's a story about people and the struggles they faced overcoming a legacy of racism.And yet, while it's worthwhile (and even manages to tell a difficult story with a fair bit of humour thrown in) it also came across to me at least as lacking a real edge or focus. It needed something more to really draw me in. The stories offered an interesting vignette of southern life, but there wasn't enough of interest to really keep me glued to the film. In fact, throughout the last 30-45 minutes, I was mostly interested in how this was going to end, and frankly every time a new scene came up the thought that went through my head was "there's more."I appreciated it. It made a point, and of course it had the requisite heart-wrenching ending (which, for this story, was very appropriate and not at all superfluous) but it needed something more; it actually needed a lot more for my tastes (although, on the subject of tastes, the story of Minnie's chocolate pie alone makes this movie definitely worth watching!)

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife had been talking about this great book that she had read called "The Help." Her reading list and mine intersect on so few titles that I automatically assume that any book she reads is not for me. On Wednesday, she told me that she wanted to see the movie being released that day. She also told me that it was over two hours long. I had dreadful memories of the leg cramps I suffered by attending "Wings of the Dove" with her some years ago, so I hoped that our next-door neighbor would want to go with her. No such luck! I prepared for an unpleasant afternoon and more leg cramps. I reluctantly turned off my iPhone as the last preview ended and hoped I wouldn't snore too loudly. As the movie opened, I was immediately completely enthralled. I was college age in the era that the film was set and I had lived for a school year in Tallahassee, a city not unlike Jackson, during that time. I especially remembered the "Colored Only" soda fountain inside of a "five and dime" that refused to let me buy a cold drink on a hot day. This movie captures the time and the place to perfection. In addition, the acting is superb and will lead to some Oscars and Golden Globes for some actresses. I loved the movie and highly recommend it to those other reluctant guys out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The HelpGrowing up with a housekeeper means one of two things: either your family was rich, or you had a stay-at-home mom.And while the women in this drama are homebodies, they insist on domestic help.When an aspiring journalist (Emma Stone) decides to write a book about the Southern tradition of employing African American women to raise the children of white families, she draws the ire of both races.It's not until "the help" (Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer) learn of their anonymity that they air the dirty laundry of all the haughty white women (Bryce Dallas Howard, Jessica Chastain, Anna Camp) in town. By making Caucasians the cause of and solution to the domestic slavery issue, this fictional account attempts to alleviate white guilt through sentimentality and gross-out gags.Besides, who wants to read a book about their help, when they can just watch their every move on the nanny cam?

		<shortDescription>Great Idea, Decently Executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pros: The entire cast does a fantastic job of filling the roles that they were chosen to fill. Specifically, Viola Davis makes the most of her limited opportunity and turns her character into an appropriate central figure, while Octavia Spencer makes a fine effort of stealing every scene she's in. I would think it would take some courage on the part of Bryce Dallas Howard to play the role she was cast in, as most people, upon viewing, might be tempted to see her as the "Godless woman" that she portrays. I always have a little extra respect for those actors all while I'm struggling not to yell at their characters through the screen. The highlight performance to me, however, is Jessica Chastain, who depicts an individual incredibly lovable in her naiveté. She just doesn't realize that black people are supposed to be viewed as second class citizens by their white - and superior (&lt;-- sarcasm) - counterparts, which makes her the most easily likable character in the movie (to me).Cons: I tend to struggle with works like this. On the one hand, it appears to be doing some good by shedding light on the sh*tty circumstances for black people in the deep south during the time of segregation. On the other hand, however, there is room for the argument that it doesn't go far enough, and that it is arguably still detrimental to equality by continuing some stereotypes. I generally end up siding with the idea that any progress is a positive sign, and the only ultimate "cure" for inequality is time, while movies like this (and hopefully real world people like some of the characters in it) can help usher along the process. But I do still have a hard time with dialog as cliché and hard to swallow as, "You is good, you is kind, you is special." I can't say for certain whether this kind of dialog is appropriate to the time, place, and people. I'm aware that African American Vernacular English does exist, but I'm hardly an expert on it, and as such I cannot figure out where my comfort line should be drawn with its use. Parts of the dialog in this movie seemed to make, for instance, the strong central figure of Aibileen still appear weak. Some aspects of the script were actually pretty good and entertaining, with sharp and funny dialog and a plot worth following after the first half hour or so. But then Davis gets saddled with lines like that... It really is pretty impressive that she was able to shine through some of what the author/scriptwriter decided she ought to say.Something that bothered me on a bit more of a superficial level was the fact that Emma Stone's character was supposed to be unattractive. I understand Hollywood likes to cast attractive young actresses as "the ugly girl," but they at least generally try to make her look ugly. This movie didn't even try to do that. Stone just kept walking around, looking her normal cute self, while everyone referred to how visually unappealing she was. Let's have a little more effort there, filmmakers...Overall: A number of scenes were indeed entertaining to watch, but all too much of it just made me uncomfortable. I don't blame the movie, of course, for portraying people and situations that are all too real and have every reason to make me uncomfortable (oh yea, and pretty angry). I encourage you to sit down and watch it, and if you are able to sit through the whole thing without being bothered by the actions of any of the white people in it, tell me so that I can know I have no interest in talking to you ever again. All told, it's a decent movie with good acting, an engaging plot, and a shaky script, and that ultimately doesn't really have anything other than a decent message to make it special. While wanting to give it a higher rating because I believe in the idea behind the story, I ended up giving it a 7 out of 10 just because the movie itself didn't knock my socks off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently the other Dude and I were discussing that not many award worthy movies come out during the summer; then I see The Help. To say it is not a story that I am normally interested in would be an understatement. I wasn't around during the time of segregation to fully appreciate the depth of this story. Additionally, if there was ever a movie that screamed "chick flick" it would be this one. In spite of that, I've heard wonderful things about the book and decided to view the movie. I'm happy to say that I'm glad that I did. Virtually unknown director Tate Taylor put together a cast of relatively unknown actors and actresses that truly made the story go.Taylor, whose last movie was the little seen Pretty Ugly People, grabbed a familiar actress to join him in making The Help, Allison Janney. Other than Janney the only other familiar actresses in the movie are Cicely Tyson and Sissy Spacek. The rather unknown cast has a fresh feeling on the story and there are no preconceived notions based on a past actor or actresses work. That being said Emma Stone (Easy A), and Viola Davis had a true coming out party in The Help. Both women played fantastic parts, which really made the cast mesh nicely together. Bryce Dallas Howard, Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain were all spectacular in supporting roles alongside Stone and Davis.When a movie doesn't have the explosions, crazy action or crude humor that we've become accustomed to seeing in newer movies there has got to be a great story attached in order to maintain your interest; The Help had that great story. There aren't many movies that have you laughing, crying, or getting angry and end up still being fantastic and that is where this one had me. With my common rule of no movie should be over 2 hours unless it is special; this one is very special. I would be surprised if there aren't a number of nominations coming.Children: If they can handle a lot of dialog it is age appropriate for 10+ Award Worthy: YES! Nominations for: Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Screenplay, Picture, Director Entertaining: Yes Summer Movie Grade: A+ Is it Worth the Price of a Movie ticket: Yes Would I watch It Again: Yes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Liked it for its approach.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically this is being a great movie for the approach that it's taking. It's being a drama, that however is being brought in a quite entertaining way. It doesn't make "The Help" the heaviest drama you will ever see, despite of its heavy and serious subject but that doesn't mean that it doesn't let its message come across as anything powerful or effective.Because the movie wasn't trying to be over-sentimental or heavy handed with its subject, it actually became a far more involving movie to watch. It was easy to care for most of the characters because they got portrayed as real humans, you could identify easily yourself with. It also really made the movie pleasant to follow and you won't even notice it's a 146 minutes long movie. It makes it a bit of a shame that the last 20 minutes of the movie felt the need to be still extremely sentimental and sappy. Really, I don't believe this was needed for this movie at all. In my opinion it felt too forced and was like a cheap way to let the audience leave the theaters crying. It's true that the movie due to its approach never goes all out and mostly plays things safe but I don't really hold that against this movie. It's simply a movie made for a broad audience, so it could get its story and message across to as many different people as possible.Actually it's a real accomplishment that the movie works out as well as it did. Because if you strip everything away from it, it's being just like an ordinary made for TV movie. Its story is very typical for that but yet the movie works out as something way more than that. It's really a well made and put together movie by director Tate Taylor, who really wasn't all that experienced yet when he did this movie.Of course things are also getting lift to greater heights by its fantastic cast. Really everyone seemed perfectly cast and gave away a great performance. Of course most of the talk is about Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer but next to Spencer, Bryce Dallas Howard really gave away the best performance in this movie, in my opinion. Sort of a shame she is getting overlooked for her role in this movie, while everyone around her is getting nominated for something, for their part in this movie, including for the big prizes.A great movie, about a not much talked about- but all important subject.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

This is a beautiful, touching and insightful story as well. May not be original, and that's why it's only an 8 for me, but is so well told and so well acted, that really makes the difference. The story of those who did make the difference in times of injustice should always be told, being fiction or real, cause there's values to transmit and lessons to learn. This is what the Help is about, a lesson of how to live and let others live. A beautiful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This feels so real - like it was in the Louisiana in the 50s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think this has a spoiler but be warned, it does mention a couple of plot points in the story. Knowing about them will not ruin it in any way for you but stop reading if you want to see this without any preview.This is the best movie I have seen in quite some time. It will make you cry and it will make you laugh. It goes in my top 100 list. It claims to be set in the early 60s but and, just maybe, Mississippi might have been 5-10 years behind. This is the way it was in the 50s in Louisiana.We were not rich but had an African American maid who was accused of stealing after being with us for some time. I really loved Annie Mae but one day she was gone. I don't know if she stole something or not. I was too young but well remember the devastation of her departure to my young life. Expect that to come up in this movie.The movie is really full. It never lags a bit. You are involved and have to watch to keep all the characters straight. There are shenanigans going on and some are supposed which are not going on and it is a bit confusing if you are on the computer or otherwise diverted from really watching. And for that attention, you get a full story with multiple plot lines going on at the same time but without the choppiness that frequently comes with multiple plots. It is all woven together and feels so natural and flowing that I did not even think about it until I was writing this.This is a must see for those who lived in that time and for those who would like to understand a bit more about how it was and never should have been. It is not over the top in any respect. The abuse leveled on the maids is just the right amount for the story and not overdone, either. They could have gone farther but it would have not been right and would have ruined the story. I am not saying it was right for them to be abused this way, but, sadly, it was accurate for the time of this story. It hit home with me and I highly recommend it. It is a well crafted, full story that will leave you feeling that you have not wasted your time, not even a second in watching it as you watch the evolution of lives on both sides of the "color fence".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>During segregation, some black women protest, by getting help from a white reporter, and writing a book called, "The Help".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was an okay movie. The Help certainly has a point on how bad it was in the time of segregation. However, I think that The Help could have used some changes however. The movie could have used less cuss words. They also showed a little to much cruel treatment against some of the people. Speaking against what I just wrote it was fine. I still think they could have showed less bad stuff. It was good because it showed that we should do what is needed when something is going wrong, and needs to be changed. It also shows us how we should remember how segregation is wrong. In the end of this, The Help has a point. A very good point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific performances, but the movie "wimped out."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cautionary comment: My principal complaint is based on having read the book first, and I'm the first to admit that I hate it when people complain, "but in the book . . . ." HOWEVER, The screenwriters/producers/editors CONSISTENTLY took the edginess out of the book. They consistently deleted powerful scenes from the book that underscored the pervasiveness of the racism of the era. What they deleted illustrated so much more powerfully the quiet courage of the protagonists of this fabulous story. I won't go into detail about what they cut so I won't reveal the plot variations, but the consistency with which they sliced and diced shows a pre- determined decision to make the movie "sweeter" and more upbeat. But this decision made the choices of the characters seem "safer" and their decisions therefore less significant. It's too bad, because the film is beautifully acted and filmed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mississippi Churning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever a Movie/Book has bared the soul of red neck America it is The Help. And the person to thank is Kathryn Stockett author of the book The Help a fictionalised account of life in Jackson,Mississippi seven years before Stockett was born. This marvellous story which could apparently apply to the 1990's or today about attitudes in Jackson had no blacks consulted in the writing of the book according to the author in a recent court case where Abilene Cooper a maid from Jackson who had worked for Stockett's brother failed in a lawsuit for $50,000 to have it recognised as her story. So we know it's fictional and nothing has changed. The story is of an aspiring newspaper reporter come writer returning from New York to Jackson and see's the opportunity to write a book on 'The Help' the black maids who raised the white children of the south but were unable to look after their own or indeed use the toilet facilities within the house. There is no doubt this is a well told story and to not be moved would possibly put you amongst the red necks. Their were some very funny moments and the screenplay by Tate Taylor has picked up the essence of the ongoing attitudes. If there is one thing I would like to see is a redistribution of the wealth of this film/book to the people of this story and a fitting memorial in Jackson for the people to reflect on their attitudes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I very much enjoyed this film. Was it absolutely perfect? Probably not BUT I must disagree with Melissa Harris Perry Professor of political science at Tulane University who, on Rachel Maddow, said how much she loathed it. She gave as her rationale that it was not about the dreary drudged-filled life of a black maid exposing the essence of the black experience in the south. She thought it was all about white women and the aspiring white writer who comes from the white background of privilege but decides she wants to write and publish a story from the perspective of the black maid -- The Help.I disagree with Ms. Perry which surprised me as most often I agree with her well thought out expert analysis. The story was NOT, in my opinion, centrifugally about the white writer but the writer was used as a vehicle to tell the story of the black experience in the south through the black maids among them Viola Davis as Abiline, her friend Minnie and others who made up, I thought, the preponderance of the film. It was about the black/white cultural ethos in the south. The maid performances were nothing short of STELLAR. I LOVED them. Their white taskmasters gave excellent performances too as they showed well the empty meaninglessness and immorality of their lives. Those southern whites who profess Christianity so strongly should reflect on Christ's words: "What profit a man if he gain the whole world but lose his soul?" I felt both sorry for these shallow white women and hated them at the same time.In my opinion, Viola Davis should get best performance of an actress NOT in a supporting role but in a MAIN role. Her role, as I see it, was the central character. I thought the white writer Skeeter (Bryce Dallas Howard) was simply the narrator through which the story could be told and the expositor of the cultural reality of black people and their white supremacist masters in the south during the early 1960's. Their experience with each other was, I believe, one step above slavery since the cultural mandates -- violence and death -- at the hands of the white power brokers enforcing this vile system still survived. The film was heart wrenching and gripping. The danger the black person experienced in the south most especially, perhaps, in one of the worst southern states for its treatment of black people, Mississippi, was bone chilling. Yes, I know, all states have some racism but this type of racism in the early sixties in the south takes that loathsome fact to Olympian heights. What a trapped, awful, difficult and sad life the maids experienced. Even with all the difficulty, though, there was room in their hearts for laughter and humanity about the cruel fate bestowed upon them. I LOVED them.I hated the white women, felt sorry for them and their utter STUPIDITY. As a white woman I felt ashamed that in this country something so heinous, so cruel and so embedded in the culture existed and to some extent still does. There was NO escape. My heart goes out to a people who have known unspeakable suffering in this country. I want a collective apology to entire group of people who still suffer humiliations NO ONE in this country should EVER have to suffer again. Representative John Lewis an African American House member, a cultured and wonderful gentleman, was spat upon on the steps of the Capitol by utter racists whose temperature rose when a black man entered the oval office. The half white part of Barack Obama to them matters not as just one drop of blackness in a person determines the threat of systemic violence heaped upon them.It makes me see how brave the MLK's of the world were, how brave the Ralph Abernathy's were, how brave Representative John Lewis was and so many more heroes too numerous to mention here. Confederate flags, the rancid symbol of this de jure racist segregation, should be taken down from the top of every State House in the south as we live now, hopefully, to erase any vestiges of that ugly system and make a fairer world! I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cus a pretty girl said so!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mom reads a lot of books. So it's not shocking to me that she read The Help more than a year ago. She finished the book and couldn't stop raving about it. She told me, she told her friends, she told family, "you gotta read this book!" I didn't read it. A few months later my great aunt and then my cousin read the book, "you gotta read this book," they said. My aunt handed me the book, but I didn't read it. Some time past and the movie came out. I still hadn't read the book but I was going to. One day a cute girl mentioned to me, "hey I'm reading The Help." My response "oh me too, when I finish it, we should go see the movie." (I finished that book in 1.5 weeks.) (I did however cheat a bit I downloaded the audio book!)The cute girl finished the book and we went to the movies. I'm always afraid to read a book then go see the movie. It seems that the movie can never compare to the book! I think it's because a movie never has time to cover the details that the book does.So I thought the movie was good but not nearly as good as the book.The things I liked: It is super fun to go to a movie with somebody who has read the book. (especially when she's cute.) I loved gossiping back and forth about things the book did better. (yes we were the annoying ones talking in the theater.) I also enjoyed complaining about interesting twists and the creative license that the movie had taken.I liked the directors choice in casting Emma Stone as Skeeter. (The daughter and Reporter) She wasn't as frizzy haired as the book described her, but she was perfect for the role. Jessica Chastain was so perfect as Celia Foote. (the hopeless house wife) She made me laugh so many times! And yes Hilly Hollbrook, played by Bryce Dallas Howard was so horrible and it was fun to hate her! Finally I'm still torn about Allison Janney portrayal of Skeeter's mom. SPOILER ALERT: In the movie she was supportive of her daughter Skeeter I really liked this but it doesn't follow the book! Is that bad?The things I didn't like: Again my statement stands movies are rarely as good as the book! I think the movie touched on a lot of topics. It mentioned almost every major event in the book. However I never felt as worried for Skeeter and The Help as I did in the book. In addition I never once felt any of the weight of the repression of the 60&#x2032;s and the weight of JFK's death and such. They could have done that better.Also this isn't important but I didn't like Chris Lowell as Stuart Whitworth. I always imagined Skeeter's first boyfriend being bigger, stalkier and more of a southern football star.My advice: See the movie but it's totally OK to rent it! (Unless of course a cute girl invites you to go see it in the theater in that case my advice: Definitely see this movie in a theater!)- by Stef Dastard: www.reeldastards.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help is Oscar Oscar Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are talking sweep of Oscars here. Best Movie, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress etc. etc.It is Jackson, Mississippi in early 1960&#x2032;s. A young society girl, Skeeter Phelan (Stone) returns from college with a whole new point of view and outlook on life and the "Colored Women" who raised her and her friends. She takes a small job at a local paper but it only covers for her desire to be a real writer and tell a real story?and boy does she ever. She sees the gross inequities and terrible treatment colored women in her community (referred to as colored, Negro or worse back then) are relegated to even though such wonderful and loving women raised her and her friends. The civil rights movement is about to explode and the deep south just has not come to its senses yet.Skeeter decides to write these women's stories?if she can get them to talk. Many fear for their very lives in this small Mississippi town. Abilene, Skeeter's best friend's housekeeper, decides the time has come. Eventually, Abilene's fellow women spill it all, and they have a great deal of dirt to spill and spread, and Skeeter writes up every word. Skeeter's former friends grow suspicious, but no one really knows until the book is finally published and sh-t literally fills the pies and hits the fans.I do not wish to spoil this movie for anyone. Just go see it. Do not read reviews about it. Everyone in my theater applauded when it ended. Many were in tears. Not tears of hate or resentment though. My theater was much as one fourth Black attendees. I felt a true sense of love and pride that we had a all (well most of us anyway) had all moved on past this terrible time in our past. I really wanted to hug the first Black woman I saw and just tell her how sorry I was for my race. While racism still exists, and I have certainly been enlightened and felt it first hand with my best friend Charles one night in Alabama, it is good that we never forget. But it is better to cherish that most of us have moved on. Better we now celebrate the fact that we have moved on, rather than to exploit the past like the Jesse Jacksons, the Al Sharptons and Rev. Wrights of the world relish doing.I must admit I was turned off a bit at first having to watch a little girl urinate in the first five minutes of the film. Hollywood just loves toilets and urine. If you have read my reviews on the last ten rom-coms, you know TMG is sick and tired of gratuitous urination in films. For better or worse, at least it had some meaning as we find this issue relevant as many Black women were not allowed to use the same indoor toilets as their employers. The sound quality was also poor, so no Oscar for that category. I was a bit skeptical that this movie was going to trash white people as all racists and bigots. It was also a bit hard to believe some women could really be so awful and cruel to Black women?especially those they totally entrusted with the care for their children. And while I believe such was a valid portrayal and not uncommon, it was certainly not the prevalent relationship?even in the deep south. I was happy to see the writer and Director took a keen, but just slightly lopsided imbalance to prove the important, albeit obvious points.The Help was just an incredibly touching and funny film on so many levels. I do it no favor by raving on about there performance by the Black actresses in this film. Their work is better cherished directly in the theater. I would say Cicely Tyson's brief but commanding performance moved me emotionally beyond words.My own mother had Black maids growing up in Kansas City. One, Maddie, still worked for my Grandfather when I was about 5 years old (same year, 1963). Maddie was beloved and cherished by my Mom and her family?possibly underpaid by today's standards, but not for the times. Many women like Maddie, much as the Black women in this film, had worked for some families for decades, even generations. There was a good reason. These were the best jobs they could get and the families loved them and treated them with great respect. They were surrogate Moms. So much that when my Mom became a bit feeble at age of 84, she implored me "Can you find a Black woman to help care for me? I just love Black women. They are so caring and kind." We found Mimi who was just awesome. But in an ironic twist of history, after three years, we could no longer afford her. Understand, Mimi was worth ten times what we could pay her, but the economics had changed with the years.I only hope and pray to this day that Maddie would have had a far different, brighter and more loving story to tell.</fullReview>

Typical white character helps poor helpless black character as they build a bond. I was wrong. The Help is so uniquely crafted and wonderfully written that you pay more attention to the difference in personality of the characters, instead of the difference in race. The movie showcases some of the best veteran and new female talent out there. Emma Stone, who seems to be on her way to super stardom, is perfect in the role of Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan, a unique, intelligent aspiring writer who works up the courage that none of her friends have. That it except for Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis), a middle aged maid who breaks out of her shell to help Skeeter with stories of what it's really like to be a maid. After racial tension rises and the maids are subjected to struggling times, mostly thanks to the villainous Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard in a scary good performance), more and more maids come on board. One of these is the out-spoken, sassy Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer). Davis and Spencer steal pretty much every scene and are so realistic in their portrayals, you would swear you could see their characters in a Jackson, Mississippi grocery store. I would say at least Oscar nominations are much deserved for Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, and Bryce Dallas Howard. But also honorable mention for Jessica Chastain and legends Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson(who brings tears to your eyes in only 2 freakin scenes!)What I love most about The Help is that it truly did portray the life and times of that period through the different characters. Through Skeeter, Aibileen, Minny, Hilly, and even the hilariously pitiful Celia Foote (Jessica Chastain). The Help is one of those rare, touching, old- fashioned feel good movies that will make you LAUGH, CRY, and THINK.-No matter what color or sex you are....GO SEE THE HELP</fullReview>

		<fullReview>to tell the truth i don't like oldies but In fact, as audiences move onto the web for movie downloads, it is likely that more indie, low budget movies will get their fame outside of the box office as distributors find it harder to market them. How did this happen and what does this mean for the future at the box office?There will always be a demand for drama, thriller, comedy genres and so forth, but the way marketing is carried out for these movies could be changing because of the web's influence. Blockbuster films have huge marketing budgets and can practically dominate online as well as traditional advertising placements. When it comes to indie movies, getting an audience buzz around a film tends to start at major film festivals. Big releases like George Clooney's 'The Descendants' and David Cronenberg's 'A Dangerous Mind' are getting plenty of attention, but perhaps audiences are turning to the web for indie movies, and the theatre for blockbusters.Because technology is bringing movies into our homes faster, simpler and cheaper, the concept of the theatre may be changing for audiences. People are more intrigued to see an 'epic', 3D movie or family release rather than an indie shot on a low budget. The web is still fairly new in the film marketing mix, but it seems that indie movies are getting more buzz online because budgets are low, and the free tools available to promote them are plentiful. Does this mean audiences discover indie movies on the web first, and would prefer to download them digitally rather than see them in theatres?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I never heard of the novel the Help written by Kathryn Stockett until I saw the trailer for the movie but help. The story of an aspiring journalist during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. She wants to write a book detailing the lives of African-American maids point of view on the white families they work for and the stuff they go through. Being an African-American man I was not interested in seeing a chick flick about white women and black maids. For the past 4 weeks I noticed that the help was either one or two at the box office. Staying number one for two weeks, so yesterday my sister and I went to see the Help. When we arrived at the theater I was surprised to see how packed the theater was for a movie that has been out for a while. We saw the movie at now I know why the movie theater was packed. I love the movie. The story was well written, the characters were well developed, the acting was first rate. Emma Stone did a really good job as skeeter. And I have one word to describe Viola Davis performance and help. Master class. Octavia Spencer did an amazing job in the movie. Bryce Dallas Howard did an incredible job playing a character that was not likable at all. Jessica Chastain did a really good job as well. Allison Janney, Sissy Spacek, and Cecily Tyson, added the iconic flavor to the movie. I have to admit there were some scenes in the movie that made me choke up, and there are some scenes that made me laugh, but I won't say anymore about that, besides you probably wouldn't believe me anyway. The help is the best movie of the year. This is the type of movie that wins multiple Oscars. And I can tell you the help deserve everyone of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film, but not a great one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help (2011) was written and directed by Tate Taylor. It stars Emma Stone as "Skeeter" Phelan, a young, white college graduate, and Viola Davis as Aibileen Clark, a black maid in a white household in Jackson, Mississippi. The film is set in the deep south in 1963, when the civil rights movement in the U.S. was gathering momentum, but when the outcome of this struggle was far from certain.This movie touches on an important topic, and it is well-meaning and well-acted. It could have been another great film like Schindler's List. However, there are real flaws in the movie that kept me from enjoying and appreciating it as much as I would have liked.First of all, we have to suspend disbelief to accept the beautiful Emma Stone as someone who has been ignored by men because of her unattractive appearance. Then we have to assume that all the white people in Jackson--other than Skeeter--are clueless, brainless bigots. We also have to assume that none of them went to college. Surely some of Skeeter's friends went to the university as well. Ole' Miss was a bastion of white supremacy, but it was also a great university as well as a great place to find a spouse. Skeeter is treated almost as an outcast, because she's been away for four years.Skeeter's boy friend is a brute when the director needs a brute, a sensitive, caring man when that's what's needed, and then a brute when director Taylor again needs a brute. Mary Steenburgen is wasted as a sophisticated NYC publishing executive. The movie portrays her in such a stereotypical fashion that I wanted to cover my eyes every time she appeared on the screen.There are some truly moving parts in this film, such as the scene in which Aibileen Clark, one of "the help," tells Skeeter that she's never before had a white woman sit down in her house. You have to be moved by a film moment like that one. (I was in the "I have a dream" civil rights march, where people of all colors mingled freely. Later, I read a news report that quoted a black woman from the deep south saying that a white person had bumped into her, and said, "Excuse me." She said that no white person had ever apologized to her before.)In summary, "The Help" was a potentially great movie, that could have been one of the most memorable films of the decade. It never fulfilled that potential. However, the movie contains so many important truths that it cannot be ignored, and should be seen. We saw it in a theater. If you read this review when the film is no longer being shown, but is out on DVD, it should do very well on the small screen.</fullReview>

Still the "whites" will discover the stupidity of superiority and the "blacks" will discover the need for courage to live with dignity and honor.Equality through peaceful protest is mentioned lightly with MLK News on TV which is the long term goal we all struggle to achieve.

		<fullReview>I'm trying not to let the fact that this is different from anything we've been reviewing lately get to me. I mean, a real meaty drama set at the tail end of the Summer Blockbuster Season?? Who would have guessed? But it sure is mighty nice to be able to sit in the theatre and enjoy a nice glass of Coca-Cola, fan myself, while I watch a period piece set in the south. The fact that it turns out to be pretty damn good is just a bonus. And not a single person was wearing comic book tights.The Help is a strong character driven movie about the interrelationships between those who work in the middle-class white houses in Mississippi in the late 60&#x2032;s and the ones that have hired them. At least, that's the surface level you'll probably be drawn to first when seeing the film. After all, we start pretty quickly already involving ourselves in the rather troubling dual life of Aibileen Clark played by Viola Davis. She's the maid who does mind the house, but probably more importantly, the children. It's certainly obvious to me it is what keeps her at her work. That and the concept that there really is nothing else for her, save for 'fool's dreams'.But what this movie also ends up being about is the various tiers the white women who dominate the town, and who is on who's level. Hilly Holbrook, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, is the one who holds court. Everyone is subjugated to her, not just the hired help. And it takes quite some time before Skeeter Phelan, played by Emma Stone in her first juicy role, gets enough courage to bring about the change required of the Civil Rights Movement. Skeeter sees the cruelty of Hilly and wants desperately to do something about it, but it takes an army of interviewing maids to set the wheels into motion.And that's pretty much my only dislike of the movie. The drama is great, with characters really fleshed out and are telling you a real story about how things were. (And to some degree still are, only with Hispanics filling the roles rather than Blacks.) There is comedy too. Some of which gets harped on far too much for my taste, when I'm more interested in moving forward. They say that it takes time to change the path of the future, to get past some of the wounds caused by this time period in America. And unfortunately it felt that way in the movie too. Overly long, drawn out, and missing an emphatic climax, The Help essentially whips up a great moving drama and sort of walks off on down the road suggesting its work here is done. I wanted it to do just a little bit better, be a little more tighter, so it could achieve the ambitious goal it set out for itself.Yes, it's asking a lot for a movie. Especially at this time of year. But when you have such amazing roles like Minny Jackson (Octavia Spenser) and Skeeter's mother Charlotte (Allison Janney) and even the villain ? racism embodied almost completely One can't help but want the very best. And while extremely good and worth seeing, it just missed that mark.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viola Davis Thrives in a Decent Plot that Could Have Been Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Help" was not a bad flick, but not a great one either. It may be a disappointment to those who expected to be transported to a cringingly uncomfortable 1960s era when civil rights injustices took place with impunity. On the highest plus side, the film featured the nuanced acting mastery of Viola Davis, who has always been able to deliver the most credible portrayal; in The Help she performs faithfully true to her high standard of acting. Many will be terribly disappointed if she doesn't get at least an Oscar nomination for this screen effort. The movie tells a story that has not been told enough, but failed to do it with enough bite. While it was a big production, it doesn't appear that there was a commitment to put up the requisite big bucks for a more dynamic cast. (save Viola Davis, of course). Sissy Spacek and Cicely Tyson were both nice additions to the film, but both are at the age that their veteran acting services are probably at an elderly bargain price. Octavia Spencer, who played Minny, capably carried a significant portion of plot line weight (but not to the level of major award consideration). It is clear from her acting resume that this one of the top highlights of the television and film career, and she clearly made the most of the opportunity. But as well as she did in portraying Minny, there are other actresses who would have brought more to the role. Just imagine the raw impact Mo'Nique could have made in the role of Minny (a nice casting thought, but her Precious Oscar recognition probably made her cost prohibitive in the budget of this film).As for the other actresses, this truly represented a career stepping stone moment for them as well, and most of them appeared to fare well enough in the movie. But none of their performances overly impressed, and that goes particularly for the other protagonist, Emma Stone as the white author Skeeter. Strongly adequate is the most accurate characterization of Stone's work in this production. I was interested to find out that Bryce Dallas Howard (who played the white racist woman No. 1) is the real-life daughter of director and former child actor Ron Howard (Opie, Andy Griffith's TV son). It was good to see Allison Janney (who played Skeeter's mother) who did her typically good character actor work, like she did as the stepmother in Juno. And after seeing Jessica Chastain's prominent but largely muted performance in the strange Tree of Life with Brad Pitt a few months ago, it was good to see that she could indeed handle a bigger dialogue-demanding role, which she did decently well in this movie. In addition to the lack of acting bite (with the exception of Ms. Davis), the plot fell just short where comeuppances are concerned. There were some such moments in a minor ways, such as the "eating s**t" scene; but that particular deserved indignity simply did not have any satisfactory long-term depth. And given the underlying racial tensions of that day, I would have expected the dialogue and action to be a bit more acerbic in its race relations depictions. Nor did the movie didn't seem to take full advantage of the opportunity to share more of the housekeepers' anecdotes.Some critics have taken issue with the plot line of a white woman coming to the rescue of the downtrodden black maids. This is a recurring theme that has irritated many in other works, and those with that school of thought are not likely to esteem this film. Such sentiments notwithstanding, there were many such writers back in those days who pursued articles and books about the black experience, some of whom who were met with such a lack of interview cooperation (largely for safety and trust reasons) that they were forced to discard their projects. Other tenaciously persisted until they got some black folks to talk to them. With that in mind, I do not find this central plot line far-fetched. And as the ending showed, the movie's subject book was not without its repercussions ? which in the film smacked of realism, not of implausibility. All and all, it was a good story to be told, and it was told well enough. With a stronger overall cast and screenplay, it simply could have been told even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In-depth Extension of the movie, The Long Walk Home</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, The Help is an in-depth extension of the older movie, The Long Walk Home, with Whoopi Goldberg and Sissy Spacek. I think that's why Sissy was included in the cast of The Help. I loved both movies, however, the reason I gave The Help only 9 stars instead of 10 is because I did not find the little white 2-year old baby (the last one that Abilene raised) logical and believable. In other words she was too young to be saying and understanding words like, "You're my real mama, Abby." "Please don't go. Are you going to go take care of another little white girl?" Those lines are meant for a child at least 5 years old. That is the only character in the movie where I feel the writer screwed up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You will hear people critique this film on the basis of race among other things. Let me be the first to tell you, these critiques are without merit. People may say it is too watered down and doesn't convey the violence of the African American experience. This film does NOT depict the experience of all African Americans. It depicts the experiences of a subset of the race as seen through a white woman's eyes. This is how the author related to the story. As the audience, we see it as she sees it. Other people may say it is just another movie depicting black women in subservient roles. They were! Especially these women! While the story itself is false, it closely mirrors the stories of many southern families. Perhaps what these critics should be concerned with certain other films marketing racist images toward a largely black audience! The performances in this film are incredible. The writing is strong. It is sensitive to issues of gender and race alike. Overall a very moving experience at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Courage sometimes skips a Generation," Not so in 'The Help'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Courage sometimes skips a generation," Skeeter's mom tells her in the movie 'The Help.' It's a movie, if you've not seen it; you need to add it to your to-do list now. Go! Add the book to your summer reading list along with 'Murder Behind Closed Doors,' by Jere Myles, a similar story about characters who refuse to be invisible in a society that would be more comfortable if they were. It's a simple story, set in Jackson, Mississippi, during the early 60s. You don't need a history lesson about what's going on, but it's an education for those who've never heard the word colored used to refer to anyone who was not white. I grew up in Tennessee, and it was like a walk home, and when Aibilene tells Skeeter, who wants to write about the help, she'd never had a white person in her house, it was like "I can't either." Ironically, the movie for me was somewhat reminiscent of Whoopi Goldberg's "The Long Walk Home." "The Help" is definitely a movie to go see. Award winning performances exist all around. The quote tells the story, and you are in for a two-hour plus treat where courage is an underpinning theme throughout. The movie might make you a bit angry, but it will make you think. The acting, the story line, I read the book, and the characters have all been masterfully recreated and put on screen for you to see, and I strongly suggest anyone who's not read the book, to read it. And if you've seen the movie, get the book anyway, available on Kindle. This is a movie about a time period today's generation has totally no concept, and the storyline interweaves the historical elements essential to understand why the story about black maids would even be interesting. They raised most of the white people in today's elevated positions of authority. People care for each other in this movie, especially the black women, while other characters only care for themselves, especially the younger 'society' driven white women.There are so many superlatives I could use for this movie, and I suggest even the men take along a couple of Kleenex, if not for you, the date you may choose to take. Provocative, timely and moving. I loved all the characters, especially the matriarchal white women like Sissy Spacek, who ironically was in "The Long Walk Home." Viola Davis restrained role of servitude is on target and Octavia Spencer's Minnie's spicy yet tempered insolence add dimensions to the movie and flavor to the characters. They are excellent, as is Emma Stone as Skeeter, a southern defiance that's so atypical of the southern women of this time and the perfect foil to a rap-artist incantation of Hilly which Bryce Howard inhabits right up to the hairdos she sports. The men in the movie are just dressing, but Skeeter's potential beau gives you something to resent besides the 'queen' bee Hilly, and a knight in armor in a nicely underplayed Johnny Foote by Mike Vogel. There is comedy and definite drama, and presents a time that reminds us of an ugly truth we should not ignore, particularly in today's climate of racial tensions.Alas, I cannot end this review without a comment on the touchingly sensitive handling of Constantine Jefferson by Cicely Tyson. She's not on screen much, but such a talented actress still has that quality that so resonated in "Sounder," and 'The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pitman.' Great movie. Great cast and a great song 'The Living Proof,'at the end by Mary Blige.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovingly and thoughtfully told - a highly enjoyable story with a wry sense of humor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not read the book. That fact did not dull my appreciation for the craftsmanship and thoughtfulness that went into the movies. First of all, this movie basically had co-leads, Viola Davis as Abylene who narrates the beginning and end of the film and whose voice is heard from time to time bridging important moments in the film and Emma Stone (whose 3-for-3 with me thus far in her young but brilliant acting career) as well-meaning and ambitious Eugenia "Skeeter" Davis.This duality of, in essence, having one co-lead as the visual focus and the other as the aural focus, is one that I do not recall having seen before and it works exquisitely effectively here. Ms. Davis' acting was a revelation to me and seemed to come straight from the heart. Abylene's professionalism and perpetual struggle to keep God's love in the forefront and suppress her anger even after she had almost lost her will to live when her son was killed could not have been realized so beautifully and vividly by a lesser actress.The casting seems to deliberately pay homage to earlier films dealing with the segregation subject matter but all in this category were well cast an played their roles to perfection. Sissy Spacek (The Long Walk Home) was a total hoot as the villainess' (Bryce Dallas Howard - Ron Howards' daughter - excellent, chillingly malicious and self-righteous but not over-the-top) mother. Mary Steenbergen (Narrator of same film) was hilarious in a send up of a New York publisher. Cicely Tyson (Autobiography of Miss Jane Pitman) was brilliant as always (How I've missed her) as the maid that raised Skeeter but sent away by her Mom (Allison Janney) why Skeeter was at college. We learn later that she had been sent away by Society President Anna Higgenbotham played by Dana Ivey (who virtually enslaved Oprah Winfrey into being her maid in The Color Purple).The music, cars, and lush cinematography were all perfect from my perspective. A few minor points - the actor playing boyfriend Stuart seemed to lack timing and didn't really fit into the period costume he was wearing. The woman playing Jolene seemed not to understand that she was playing a nasty, not just a vapid, woman. But, these are very minor considerations.Overall, this is not quite a great movie - but is certainly an extremely good one and highly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : THE HELP RATING : See it in the theater, then wait for the instant download.(rating system: "see it in the theater", "wait for the instant download", "don't waste your time")ONE LINE REVIEW : You'll be transported back in time not by the visuals, but by the attitudesEugenia 'Skeeter' Phelan (Emma Stone) is a recent college graduate returning home to 1960's Jackson, Mississippi, eager to start her first job as a columnist for the local paper. Her job is to answer letters homemakers write about how to best clean their homes. She has no first- hand knowledge of this task, having been raised in privilege by her own family maid, Constantine (the venerable Cicely Tyson). She turns to a friend's maid, Aibileen (Viola Clark) for assistance.Skeeter comes to learn about how poorly the maids are treated ? especially when forced to use "separate but equal" bathrooms in the homes. She induces Aibileen and Minny (Octavia Spencer) to share their stories which Skeeter hopes to turn into a book. They do share them, including one "terrible awful" that Minny perpetrated on her employer Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard). But publisher Elain Stein (Mary Steenburgen) requires more servants to be involved before she will consider publishing the book. The women are reticent to help until an injustice is performed on one of their own. Then Skeeter has as much support as she needs.This is a fine film filled with wonderful performances. Emma Stone is lovely and very believable as the southern girl who grew up and came home. There is even a scene where the movie flashes back to Skeeter's high school days when she was clumsy and awkward. And she plays it brilliantly, looking very plain as a youngster. Viola Clark is the heart of this film. Her character is shown giving love and encouragement to the children she raises. And Octavia Spencer's character teaches her new employer Elizabeth Leefolt (Ahna O'Reilly) how to cook and clean house.The movie is set in the 1960's but you wouldn't know it from what's on- screen. Usually in a period film, such as this, there are constant reminders that you're in the past: A television in the background showing an old show; or a TV Guide cover; or a number of external shots of old places of business. But not so with "The Help." While all the women of "The Help" are wearing period garb and hairstyles, what transports one back to this time is attitudes. The attitudes of these wealthy women toward their help. I feel that I am ill-equipped to review "The Help." Most Summertime movies are aimed pretty low ? at the attentions of teenagers and make for pretty easy dissection. "The Help" is a thoughtful, humorous, and touching story about servitude and the attitudes that made it possible. And about the love of servant women for the children ? even the grown children - they served and raised. The most shocking thing about the movie is not the "terrible awful" that Minny perpetrates, but rather the fact that these events took place only 50 years ago.I recommend you "See this movie in the theater" because you'll want to enjoy it with other people. Then I recommend you "Wait for the instant download" because you'll want to see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is a story about how one person can make a difference in society all by being an advocate for change. It is a story about a group of people who think they are better than everyone else. It is mostly about a group of people who are downtrodden and spit upon by the other group of people. It is a timeless story that will make most Americans embarrassed about our past history and it will also ring a familiar bell in regards to the injustices of today.For this film, I have decided to not write my normal review. This movie is a serious Oscar contender for Best Picture and I truly believe that this story should not be summarized by someone with a blog. The story is too amazing to be limited to so few words. I will say that all of the cast performed with excellence. There was feeling and emotion in every character. The only fault that I find with the film is the lack of resolution. The film's villains seem to remain in that vile state rather than experience life change. However, I don't see how anyone who views this film can not have an emotional change within them. So maybe the resolution actually lies within the viewer.10/10</fullReview>

Hilly was a wonderfully hideous character who, sadly, really does exist. Minny was a joy to watch. Her spunk made us want more. Skeeter was the wonderful innocent who is appalled by the reality of what is happening in her life.All the cast did a wonderful job but if Viola doesn't win an Oscar the academy is dumber than I thought. Thank you for time and money well spent. I definitely will see this again and again. The closing song was a beautiful recap of what we needed to take away from this film. This will be a wonderful addition to my film library.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is true to the spirit of the book which is very important to me. Yet the film also brought to life characters and places that I could not clearly envision until I saw the film. This is one of those rare times when I prefer the film over the book. The script captures the danger of what the women are doing. Even though I knew what would happen, I still felt anxiety as I wondered what the fallout would be if they,and their "illegal" activities, were discovered. This is a history lesson without being preachy. A film that reveals the history of women that historians in the 60's did not think were important. As for the acting, many of the other reviewers have mentioned standout performances. Viola Davis and Octavia L. Spencer deserve Oscar nominations for their portrayals as "the help". Cicely Tyson's powerful portrayal of Constantine was truly a standout- she broke my heart. Jessica Chastain's characterization of the "poor white trash" woman who is shunned by the women of the town was luminous. Bryce Dallas Howard does a glorious job of presenting woman driven by ambition to do whatever it takes to hold on to her power and status. Finally, the costumes and setting were really well done. I was transported me to a time and place I had not visited in a long, long time. Kudos to all who had anything to do with the making of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Help" a human nature story of part of our history. It takes place a long time after the end of slavery.It shows us what the lives of rich white people and their black maids was like in the early 60's.It shows us the lack of respect and appreciation for the help who, loved the white children they raised. It is well acted, well presented, well written, well directed etc... I expect some Oscar nominations. I don't remember any one movie I saw that I wanted to see again the next day; this one is.It is terrific, a must see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great entertainment with a serious theme.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw the movie, The Help. It was a pretty good movie, though not a great movie. I think other movies with similar themes were more powerful, such as the Color Purple and Imitation of Life. Having said that, kudos to this movie for a compelling portrait of the lives of "colored maids" in Mississippi in the 1960's and their relations with their white employers. I can remember living through this era as a small boy in Virginia. I remember being puzzled by the signs for "Whites Only" drinking fountains and "Colored Only" water fountains. I was troubled by White Only swimming pools. As I grew up in the civil rights era I was gratified to see the gradual increase in human and civil rights in our society, although I recognize there is still a long way to go to reach a truly color blind society. The Help has some good performances amongst the black and white actors. The exquisite and incomparable Cicely Tyson was wonderful as Constantine Jefferson. Sissy Spacek was hilarious as the matriarch , Missus Walters. Viola Davis and Octavia Spenser gave strong performance in their respective roles as Aibileen and Minny. Bryce Dallas Howard was a chilly Hilly, and Emma Stone was a rock. Great entertainment with a serious theme. I give it seven bells out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help is Worth Your While</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching The Help is an exercise in absorption and immersion. From the first frame I could feel the muggy, sticky summer drip out of the screen. There were scenes where I could taste and smell the chicken, the pies, and the diner milkshakes of Jackson, Mississippi. In short, the set pieces are tremendous, and the cinematography is crisp and warm. Yet, the era is not only depicted by the outfits, classic cars, and antique-stuffed houses, but the tense, near boiling-point relationships that permeate the film.Our first introduction in the film is to the voice of the film's star (who is not the white, auburn-haired Emma Stone as many of the movie posters and promotions might have led many to believe), African-American maid Aibileen Clark. Clark, portrayed subtly yet passionately by Viola Davis, has been a caretaker for several white children for her entire adult life, and simply has to swallow all of the racially-charged realities of mid-20th century America. Davis is nothing short of a dynamo in Help; she becomes Maya Angelou's "caged bird." She emotes an intelligence and dulled anger that have both been stifled by years of "yes, ma'ams" and "of course, ma'ams." Davis' Aibeleen Clark is baffled by, yet forced to graciously accept, the way Jackson's sons and daughters grow up to mistreat and dehumanize the very women who spent their lives raising them. In this world where Clark has given love and kindness, and received only disdain in return, she feels she has no agency. And indeed she alone has none.This is where we need Stone's character, "Skeeter" Phelan, to turn the tide slightly in Clark's favor. An aspiring journalist, with a moronic local paper job, she decides to undertake the writing of a tell-all book from the viewpoint of Jackson's black maids. She is a digital-age woman stuck in a relatively barbaric place and time. Skeeter is all moxie and ambition, while her cancer-ridden mother and high society friends just wish she would shut up, get married, and start churning out babies for the maids in town to take care of. Just naive enough to believe her book can succeed, and having not nearly as much to lose as the maids she asks for stories, Skeeter is the perfect catalyst to provide Aibeleen Clark with the dignity she's resigned to having lost. Stone, who has swiftly ripened as a can't-miss leading lady, plays the part aptly; she has just enough quick-tongued retorts and wide-eyed eagerness to endear the audience to "Skeeter" (who could have just as easily been a grating character).Where the movie truly shimmers is in its meditation on hate and injustice, occurring within the characters aside from the predictable plot structure. Help shows how, contrary to what most film and art shows us, hate is much more simple than love and virtue. As illustrated by the film's venomous Hilly Holbrook, played with maniacal fervor by Bryce Dallas Howard, it sometimes takes only a single person to perpetuate odiousness. Mrs. Holbrook, looking as if her head could explode at any moment, is at the head of Jackson's high society table, and the other white ladies in town absorb her every hostile word. As is true of all of history's great villains, and especially Hilly Holbrook, they gain great followings because it's easier to bend to hate and fear than resist it. Opposing spite requires courage and sacrifice, while abetting it only requires that one steps out of the way. In contrast, none of the heroes in Help can accomplish their goals alone or without sacrifice. Aibeleen can't act alone because no white person in Jackson will listen. She must also put her well being in danger to help Skeeter, who in turn can't write a book without Abileen's words and endurance. Neither of them can succeed without the help of many other maids: Skeeter's book won't be published unless at least a dozen maids give her their stories. As shown by the maids in Help swallowing their pride and showering their future oppressors with affection, love is often courage while hate can simply be acceptance of the world as it is.There are a flew flaws in Help, mostly minor. One moment that stands out as particularly horrific came from maid Minny Jackson, otherwise played with gumption by Octavia Jackson. The line spoken, word-for-word, is "I love me some frieeed chicken." While it's not necessarily racist to portray a Southern black person liking traditionally Southern food, the line as written feels cheap and unnecessary, as if the audience is too stupid to deduce that Minny likes fried chicken from the action of her cooking it enthusiastically. There is also an oddly forced love interest for Skeeter's character. I believe the writers place him there to show what Skeeter would have to sacrifice to reach her goals, yet the character is so small and underdeveloped that the romantic subplot seems expendable in a movie already approaching an 150 minute running length. Yet, despite a few ignorable mishaps, The Help is a welcome break from much of the other inane drivel Hollywood rolls off of the conveyor belt and passes off as drama. The ensemble cast is fantastic, most notably Ahna O'Reilly and Jessica Chastain. O'Reilly plays the emotionally-battered second fiddle to Hilly Holbrook, and steals one of the Help's best moments in the closing sequence. She is the perfect vessel to display Holbrook's parasitic effect on Jackson's white residents. Chastain, portraying the painfully sincere housewife Celia Foote, gives a career-making performance. Celia hires Minny, and they repair each other's lives as outsiders in a world they feel helpless in. Their relationship is probably the most stirring in an exceptionally poignant film. Celia's boundless innocence and Minny's seen-it-all steadfastness combine to give both women the fortitude to withstand all that is 1960's Mississippi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help tells an incredible story that had life breathed into it by a remarkable cast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a perfect cast bringing this film to life, it is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and one of the greatest stories ever told on screen. It really did give a new perspective on the way we view events from our past, all very strongly and realistically adapted from Kathyrn Stockett's novel. The film tackled a very serious issue with respect, telling it how it was, but it was also filled with many hilarious moments to really make it a well-rounded film.Set in Jackson, Mississippi in the 1960s, The Help tells the story of some very courageous women who, in a time when black women were treated with no respect yet were the ones who were always in people's homes raising their children and taking care of the family, form what at the time seemed like a very unlikely friendship when Skeeter (Emma Stone), fresh out of college, decides to write from the point-of-view of the maids; having seen how badly some are treated and how fond she was of her own growing up... the woman was around more than her own mother. The town is turned upside down as they get swept up in the changing times; some people outraged at the voice that is finally being heard, others seeing things from a new perspective for the first time.I wasn't sure how I felt about the film going into it only knowing the basic premise and having seen the trailer (I still haven't gotten around to reading the book), but it didn't take long to really fall in love with it. It was just a remarkable film... a remarkable story to tell.The characters were just so well developed and you really felt for them; connected with them. I don't think director Tate Taylor could have gotten a more incredible cast: Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Jessica Chastain, Allison Janney, Sissy Spacek, Emma Stone, Bryce Dallas Howard and Cicely Tyson... all of whom really breathed life into each of the personalities (my favorites being Minny Jackson and Celia Foote).It is one of those films that I think everyone needs to see. It definitely has great Oscar potential for Best Adapted Screenplay, definitely some Best Performance nods and maybe even a Best Picture... if not any of those (especially performance-wise), the Academy is crazy! It really was a great film, though, one that was funny, touching and just a beautiful story to see unfold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chix Chat on Film review: The hired help in an anonymous revolt.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was anxiously anticipating The Help my interest peaked after having seen the trailer for the first time. I was not at all disappointed. This film held me captivated for the entire running time, and I have to give credit to the amazing ensemble of actors and certainly to the director. The era was to say the least a very difficult period for people of color, but every time the story started to get racially heavy handed there would be a divergence to bring the focus back to the story at hand rather than the cruelties that Black Americans endured during the sixties. Kudos to director/screenplay writer Tate Taylor for bringing this adapted story to the big screen with thoughtfulness, sensitivity and class. Eugenia 'Skeeter' (Emma Stone) Phelan, Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), Aibileen Clark(Viola Davis), and especially Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer) had a synergy that at times had me sitting there with my mouth open, agasp at some of the things that came out of Hilly's mouth and satiated with Minny's actions. I had recently seen Ms. Spencer in the silly Dinner for Schmucks and she had me cracking up at her role as an animal psychic, but I had no idea at that time that she was such a great actress. The other lead females have been showcased in other films so their talent was known, but I must say that this is the first time I have ever seen Ms. Howard in a movie and I was thoroughly convinced that she was an absolute b!tch. Her performance was spot on, as were the performances of them all. The ladies made this film pop, but the story was only made richer with their male counterparts. I sat there watching as Preacher Green (David Oyelowo) spoke his 'Courage' sermon and I kept trying to figure out where I had recently seen him, and then it dawned on me that he was in Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I think the British accent in that film must have thrown me, I'm usually pretty good at recognizing an actor I had just seen barely a week prior. This was a much better look for Nelsan Ellis (Henry the Waiter) than what I see weekly on television, it would have been nice to have a little more insight into his story, after all he was also hired help. I was glad though to never lay eyes on Leroy. My mother lived through many of the injustices of the sixties first hand here in Texas, even though the story was based in Mississippi it was pretty much the same throughout the South. She was neither angry nor embittered at what we watched intently on screen, she was as entertained as I was. Great movie, green light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Help yourself to this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Movies based on books seem to be one of the current popular trends for movies these days. This past Wednesday, The Help released in theaters and quickly has been making headlines left and right as one of the best movies of the summer. My movie posse and I just saw the movie last night and I'm here to give you some info about this good movie.For those who have not read the book or seen the trailer, The Help centers on the lives of black maids working for the elitist class in Jackson, Mississippi. One maid, Aibeleen (Viola Davis), tells her perspective of the life maids' live and their feelings on the jobs they do every day for their employers. However things soon begin to change when aspiring journalist Skeeter (Emma Stone) returns from college and decides to stir up a little trouble for her "friends" while attempting to stand up for the maids by creating a collection of stories from the servants. Once the book is suggested to Aibeleen, the movie portrays the development of the book and the lives and motivational forces that drive the others to participate in the project.So is this movie worth the hype that it has been receiving? In my opinion, yes I think it is worth the hype, but probably not worth a perfect score that some critics have been suggesting. To start off, this movie is an accurate portrayal of life in history that's not too overacted, or loaded with cheesy dialog. Instead the story is brought to life by a great cast of actresses whose characters add their own flavor to the plot of this movie. Emma Stone surprised me with the role she played in this movie, playing the serious, dedicated, and loyal writer instead of some wacky, one liner spewing, teenage airhead role she is famous for. Viola Davis seems a natural as Aibeleen, delivering her dialog with emotional drive without crossing the overacting line too often. Octavia Spencer, who plays Minny, helps bring some sassy, take no crap, humor that had most of the audience, including me, cracking up. Bryce Howard, no longer playing Victoria, plays an evil, arrogant southern witch, who had me seething during the movie as she drove the plot of the movie. Jessica Chastain however, was the southern belle on the opposite spectrum, who was kind and genuinely good as she attempted to do things for herself and those that she loved. The rest of the cast was great as well, but these five really made the movie come to life for me and kept me in to the movie.The acting was not the only thing that kept my interest in this movie though. For one thing the director of this movie found a way to take multiple stories and intertwine them with the main story to provide multiple tales to follow. Throughout these stories the dialog was fantastically written to fit with the scene, often injected with some humor to break the emotional tension building up. Minny's participation in the various tales probably entertained me the most as one instant she was the wisecracking maid and the next at mercy of some other character, a good representation of the two sides to the maid back then. Also laced throughout the movie is background on the main characters, which is slowly revealed over the course of the film instead of all at once. The gradual revelation baits one's attention and keeps you roped into the movie to find out more.Perhaps the biggest strength of this movie though is how everything flows together to capture and bring the emotions of the characters to life. The camera work is beautifully shot from a variety of angles that best capture actions and expressions of the characters. The soundtrack as well was properly selected in this movie, each score/track helping bring the audience into the mood of the scene. Both of these factors, combined with the brilliant acting mentioned early, sends one on an emotional roller coaster ride that may cause one to tear up, as it did to three of my friends. And although I didn't tear up, Taylor and his team managed to really drive the morals and lessons of this story right in my heart, which made me feel good by the end of the tale.There are also some bad aspects to the movie, the biggest for me being the a few dragging parts throughout the movie. Another aspect that is hard for me to enjoy is some of the cruel things that one sees in the film. Yes, I know these scenes are supposed to make you hate, or pity the characters, but too many of these scenes gets me hot under the collar and makes me enjoy the movie less. The ending as well may have been a little bland for me as well and kind of left me hanging and wanting more of a conclusion, despite the strongly delivered monologue.If you get one thing from this review tonight it should be that The Help is one of those movies worth seeing in the movies, particularly with a group. Those looking for great acting will be pleased with the cast and characters of the film. Fans looking for an emotional story and rich character development are also in for a treat with this film. After analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the film, I give this movie a 9.0. However as a final warning, people who tend to cry should bring a box of tissues. Until next time folks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great ensemble cast, great story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this story and looked forward to seeing the movie. Emma Stone is great as Skeeter Phelan, a young twenty-ish woman living in Jackson, Mississippi at the cusp of the civil rights movement. She is a graduate of Ole Miss and wants to be write professionally. She is surrounded by her Junior League friends, who all "work" on Junior League activities. Their days are all spent playing bridge and supervising their maids. The Junior League is run by Hilly Holbrook. Hilly is very conservative and aware of staying within her own race. She speaks with her looks and tells the other friends in her circle how to handle "The Help". Skeeter wants to write a book from the point of view of the various maids, both bad and good in book form. This poses a problem for all of them, considering it is a huge risk. Abilene is the first maid to tell her story, Minny Jackson soon follows. Once events unfold, many other maids join their group and tell all about working in Jackson during the early 1960s. Once the book is published, all women of both races are reading the book. They are trying to see what the fuss is about and identify townspeople within each story. Minny Jackson puts a particular story as an insurance policy, so that Hilly will say it is not Jackson. This story is truly odd, funny and shocking. Skeeter finds her way out of Jackson into a life she feels is best for her. Abilene, Minny and the other maids all deal with the aftermath of what happens in the book's publication. Some small stuff may be in the movie or book but not enough to change the story. Those who know me also know how I follow the differences and have hated stories, when the movie cast is not connecting the same way I pictured it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lighter Fare than the Book, But Still Remarkable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those of you who read the book, you may as I did often compare the differences within the movie. However, I still truly appreciated the performances, the funny moments and certainly the heartfelt moments that elicited some of my tears. The two biggest differences between the book and movie were the tone and lack of character depth, save the characters of Aibeleen and Minny. Although Skeeter was lovable, Celia cute and Stuart, well, he just made a couple of short appearances, none were captured in a way that truly showed the core of who they were nor explained their treatment of others within the story. *SPOILER* In the movie you see Minny showing Celia how to cook fried chicken, however in the book, their cooking lessons took place every day and cemented their bonding and friendship. As well, the side story in the book where Celia literally saves Minny's life is completely left out of the movie. All in all, the movie was a beautiful story filled with laughs and extraordinary performance by the lovely ladies who played Aibeleen, Minny, Hilly and Celia. I would recommend seeing this to anyone with sensitive sensibilities. Although there were a few men in the full theatre I was in, I am hesitant to say that "even your guy" will love it. So, men be warned that this may be your idea of a "chick flick", or perhaps shame on me, this may just be a movie for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Help Me Temper Praise ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew via word of mouth from friends in America and from watching the trailer that I would like this film and probably end up weeping and both came to pass. On the other hand it is well to remember that in any art form - novel, play, film - the writers/directors have three choices, A.B. and C. In A and B they can load the argument in favor of their own stance whilst in C they can offer a more balanced view. Here they have chosen to load the dice in favor of the Black maids in Jackson, Mississippi, so that they emerge as Black Angels harshly oppressed by the White Devil employers. I'm not saying that this is untrue but, for example, there were no BAD Black people to be seen in a large city - though we do get a hint that one black husband is prone to violence, and, of course, we need also remember that it's not exactly courageous or daring to make a film like this in 2011 - the same film made in 1950 would have been something. Having said that and if we are happy to put it to one side we are left with a beautiful film boasting a beautiful performance from Viola Davis. Here again the cynic may observe that Davis may well have been chosen for her expressive face which is a map of all the suffering the Black race has endured in the South of America for three hundred years. You could indeed just photograph Davis' face for two hours and not have her open her mouth and you'd still have a film. As it happens Ms Davis is also a very fine actress indeed, as she showed in films like 'Doubt' and if she doesn't win the Oscar - and other major awards - it will be a travesty of justice. She has fine support all round and I'll certainly see this again and buy the DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't have high hopes going into the theatre and I wasn't really sure what this movie was even about, but I was blown away by the end of it. This movie was incredible. It had so much emotion. One minute you're laughing your face off and the next, you're crying or you're super angry. Emma Stone was brilliant. Her accent was even great. The entire cast was fantastic. The characters were played out very well, especially the character "Minny". She was my favorite. I highly recommend this movie. The moral of the story is touching and it really opens your eyes about what life was like back in the day. Although it's about 2 and a half hours, it's so worth it!

		<fullReview>While there have been many movies made detailing the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, The Help's director and adapter of Kathryn Stockett's novel, Tate Taylor, manages to let the movie be something different than just a movie about the plights of African Americans in the 1960s. The Help is an ensemble story, following the multi-layered cast of some of the finer actresses currently working in the industry and their own brushes with the help of black housemaids in upper class Jackson, Mississippi. Where The Help distances itself away from the pack of similar tales, is that the movie isn't simply preaching a history lesson of tolerance, in fact it's left to our imaginations whether or not the white racist women in this movie will ever change, but the tale succeeds because it wears its heart on its sleeve and is not afraid to be both funny and oozing with sentimental emotion at each turn. The thing is, there is no moment where the white people's hearts are changed, as is seen in stuff like Remember the Titans, but rather The Help just lets the events unfold and speak for themselves. We watch these black housemaids struggle with their own emotions, caring for the white children they are nannies for, but detesting their mothers who talk down to them and wont let them use the indoor toilet on a rainy day. The Help just is, like an old fashioned Hollywood movie, there are not many frills or whistles in the direction, it is straight forward storytelling that does very little manipulation or fantasy creation to try and paint a more beautiful picture, but rather it is beautiful because of the chemistry between the flawless ensemble cast (with particular accolades to Jessica Chastain as Celia Foote). While the movie runs long, it will keep the viewer watching till the end to see where these characters will end up.I give The Help a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish we had more of these! The entire audience was both laughing and crying and often simultaneously. Beautifully shot, great Production Design and the costumes were outstanding, all of which complimented the Oscar level acting. Each character stood out in her own stance and journey in the world. Great Job Guys! Great Writing! Outstanding performances. I hope this sweeps the Oscars! I also commend the author for her persistence in this beautiful story which didn't have the good cop bad cop scenario nor the Driving Miss Daisy veil (great movie but been there done that) or the typical southern man portrayed as the evil, controlling antagonist. Instead there were women; flawed and beautiful, rigid and flowing, mothers and daughters, pure and false friendships. But most importantly a message of giving something to the world, lessons learned from those who suffered the worst of human darkness and having the courage to do so. Kudos to all involved in this beautiful work of art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Thought the Movie was Way Overacted!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie felt so contrived. Emma Stone was okay, but I thought Allison Janney, whom I usually love, overacted. Bryce Howard was awful.Talk about bad overacting! Her character was a cliché joke and of course was the total Southern Jerk so everyone could have someone to really hate! Sissy Spacek was good. I thought it was gross and despicable what the maid did to the pie. So, everyone who has been mistreated should feel entitled do something like that?! Most everyone had horrible, fake Southern accents. I thought Cicley Tyson was her usual terrible actress. I think the whole book and movie are way overrated and Hollywood will likely give it the Oscar because it's right down their alley.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read great reviews (some real 'stinkers', too)! I expected this to be a 'white-bashing', funny movie. It was not, in my opinion. The film seemed to drag on and on; was over &amp; I was still waiting for something to happen (it never did). The ladies who starred in the film were great, but it just didn't 'take off'. There were some sad parts, for sure, but nothing that I'd call 'belly laugh' funny; nothing really 'got 'em by the nuts', either. I bought this movie; missed as it aired in theaters. I thought it would be a 'see-more-than-once' movie. It wasn't. I feel as if I wasted money on the DVD purchase. I would not recommend this as a 'must see' movie - even with the great casting! The ladies were great as the movie just dragged on &amp; on . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Agree</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do not agree with most of this film! If I had a maid that stole a ring and hocked it, I would fire her too. Also when the maids are walking down the isle in the grocery store taking up the whole isle, that is not right. They make it look like it was the white woman's fault. It wasn't!! When Minnie makes the pie, that is totally rubbish, if you did that in real life you would most likely die! get Cohlera, or EColi. I do not think that was funny at all. If someone really did that, it would be disastrous. The big fuss they made about the outside bathroom was over blown too. She should have been glad she had one at all, and not a outhouse. Also when Skeeter gets a job and he only pays her what was it, 5.00 a week? Thats ridiculous! the maids were making more than she was. Cause Viola said she was paid 95cents an hour or something like that. Just figure it out, thats more than five dollars a week. True the actress that played Minnie, did a fantastic job and well deserved the Oscar. I think the whole movie was misleading and false. Doesn't the writer know we can add?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie starts in a beautiful country setting &amp; entire area was beautiful. The performances will likely bring several Oscar's. The movie it's self says "Oscar". However, I was expecting more detail from the help interviewed. I Feel sure they encountered a lot more devastating situations as maids than were brought forth. I Think the rating should have been different due to language. I do not think it was a PG only movie. Plot was absolutely great &amp; kept most all in stitches. Could have been the very best movie ever? Country setting was so very beautiful. Movie Was a little too long but not lacking in exciting events.

Brave women such as these were the backbone of the civil rights movement. This movie acts as a powerful vehicle to show us all how senseless and stupid racism is; look out your ignorance is showing. And I noticed that the men in the audience were just as engrossed in the story as were the women even though the plot revolves mainly around women. Lastly, I was impressed with the baby girl in the movie. Anyone know who she is? She's going to be one h@ll of an actress someday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful portrayal of complicated intercations reflecting the complications of real life situations.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recommend this movie. The story, the production, the casting and the film techniques are wonderful. The story is easy to follow and entertaining and at the same time it presents a portray of real life that is full of complications. A young women writer approaches the difficult task of presenting the lives of the "help" in a southern town from the perspective of "the help." A group of rich ladies who like and dislike each other are presented as real life persons who need to carry out expected roles with aggravation, with respect and with lack of respect in their interactions with the help. You feel like you were there seeing the story develop but at the same time the movie allows you to be critical of the reality of the time. The southern ladies are portrayed in a manner that shows their pros and cons. They are the well dressed, dedicated wives who have to have a perfect home and at the same time they are the daughters and wives of less than perfect family members. The maids are hard working, dedicated, and they love the children they care for but at the same time they feel trapped and it is hard for them to be loyal to their bosses. The movie manages to show several sides of the same story with a nicely flowing rhythm that is captivating and does not allow the viewer a brake. You are in the movie for a whole two hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie SHINES!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the book by Kathryn Stockett, The Help takes place in the deep south (Mississippi) in the early 1960's. A well-educated, White college graduate, Eugenia aka Skeeter, (Emma Stone) comes home from college to find her beloved "maid, or nanny," Constantine is nowhere to be found. She comes home with a new perspective of her other high-class socialite friends and family, and begins to take notice of how "the help" or the African American maids are treated. After getting a job at the local newspaper, Skeeter decides to write an article that is in the point of view of "the help," that becomes a book and turns the whole town into a frenzy. Although Skeeter is technically the "main character," the maids (Led by Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer) are what make this movie magical. Their portrayals are intimate, and emotional. Their stories are touching, beautiful, sorrowful yet so profound. The picture painted of the South is not a pretty one, when integration was a new concept, and the lines drawn between whites and blacks were thick. When ignorance was at its peak, and hatred was hiding behind every corner. Still, somehow, these beautiful African American women had hope for a change &amp; for a better future, and courage enough to make a difference.The best movies, in my opinion, make you laugh, cry, and leave you with a morsel of wisdom or inspiration when the credits begin to roll. The characters are so real, so honest that you sincerely FEEL for them, and your heart aches or jumps for joy at their every sorrow of victory. When you leave the theater, you are left thinking about it long after it is over, and you are enriched.The Help was one of those movies. The film was well organized. I was transfixed within the first scene, and it gripped me to the very end. The characters have so much depth and insight, that you sincerely love them, or in some cases, hate them. There were numerous times that I laughed out loud, and other tender moments that made me shed a tear. The actors did such a wonderful job in making their characters real, that their emotions were dripping from every scene. The wisdom the maids carried with them resonated in my mind, and I am still thinking about it. All in all, this is a wonderful film. I can't think of one thing to criticize about it. It is a movie needed even today, that everyone, regardless of race, deserves love, respect, and equality. Please, do yourself a favor and see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must see film...and very close to the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*May contain a few spoilers* I went to this movie with low expectations. Very rarely does a movie follow the book so closely! Yes, there is some artistic license, but overall I found the subtle changes to be delightful.This movie makes you look deeper than the "white woman and her maid" relationship. The novel "The Help" made people open their eyes and see the maids as (for once) people. Yes, some people got angry and lashed out, but that happens when they are forced to face unpleasant facts.By telling their stories the maids had an outlet. Their own voices rose above the sirens and mayhem to say; "look at me! here I am! I am no longer 'just the help.' I have feelings and dreams." And when Minnie is told she has a job for the rest of her life, it isn't pity that drives the couple, but compassion and a feeling of friendship. There weren't many job opportunities for women --let alone women who weren't white-- so those that she had no way out of being a maid really need to keep that in perspective.As for Skeeter: She moved on to NY both to pursue a dream AND because she had no choice. To stay in Jackson would have been fruitless... perhaps even dangerous. If Hilly had as much influence as she seemed to, the latter is more likely! THE HELP is both inspiring and thought provoking. And may I add... I LOVED the scene where Hilly gets hers! If you read the book, you know what I mean! If you don't know, read the book and/or watch the movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to see a fantastic movie go see "The Help" . Best movie I've seen in a long long time!!!! Lot of humor and heartbreak, great cast depicting racial relations in the 1960s especially in the heartland of those times, Mississippi. Emma Stone was excellent but the entire Afro-American female cast made the movie. They pulled me into their world, their perspective. Makes me glad someone took the initiative to get "The Help"'s viewpoint. It vividly reminds me of how ashamed I am of my white ancestors and hopefully will never ever happen again in the USA. This movie has a lot of Oscar candidates. This is the first movie in a long time that I just might go see again and I will definitely buy the DVD when it releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Emma Stone takes the Town's maids to the cleaners. in" THE HELP.".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>EMMA STONE TAKES TOWN'S MAIDS TO THE CLEANERS in "THE HELP"A night at LA's newly renovated Kodak theater hosting the Cirque du Soleil for my daughter and I would have set me back a couple hundred dollars...When in Rome do as the Romans do...See a movie, that's what we do best here in Los Angeles, and a friend happened to have tickets for a film which a had just been released. "The Help" didn't conjure up any real expectations, and movies I tend to like the most have always been surprises. So, Tommy Taylor had the tickets for the Century City AMC, and the seats were great. I mention this because I was curious about the type of people that would pay money to watch a film that was bound to inflict injury to the historical naive. I thought maybe fewer people would see the film here, but the seats were filled, mostly by couples and smartly dressed women between twenty and forty something. Maybe that's just the age range that most women here can afford to maintain. I don't know, it's just that poor people look so much older...I'm not sure if the film's Sunset Boulevard billboard depiction of two beautiful black women in fitted, stylish, and modern maid's uniforms whispering silliness to each other in front of two unaware, well dressed, white women created the film's homogonous stampede, but after viewing the film, I will say that the billboard illustration was a complete and accurate rendering of the entire film, except maybe the feces pie, which ironically, turned out to be the catalyst for the entire story. A catalyst is the element in a mixture that causes all the other elements caught up in the mix to destruct, fall apart, or lose it's form while the catalyst remains unscathed, unaffected, and untouched... Maybe the rich white girl, just home from journalism school was the catalyst after all..."The help," had no more depth, nor relevance than the current television prime time mindless "House Wives," franchise. However, the American public for all it's racist accusations gets point's for getting off their couches and going to the theater (at twenty million dollars at the box office for the first week-end) to support a film about it's sometimes uncomfortable past, a past from which it cannot seem to get past, but a past it wants to understand. The story is too simple; Employer dictates where feces happens. Employee can't take this feces. Employer fires employee over feces. Employee feces in pie. Employer eats feces in pie. Employee tells everyone just who ate her feces.Since this story involved a white employer, a black employee, a domestic situation, and most importantly takes place at a time none of us today can fully understand, layers and layers of racial "feces" are injected to exacerbate an already vulnerable situation in which only one perspective is fully exposed. The employees, "the maids," are glorified, as hard working, child loving, friendly, much closer to god,and morally strong, while the employers are"Weak minded," and cast as uneducated, selfish, lazy, klanish, entitled, malicious, unwilling to care for their parents, or even their own children.With a cast like this I'm surprised the feces made it into a pie shell.The film takes us through the daily life of a black maid in the sixties, and the most dreadful experiences conceivable. The tension reaches such a pitch for the maid that, like Rosa Parks where the maid sits (and does her "business") is the last straw. She's fired, and shortly thereafter the maid secretly feces in a pie and feeds it to her one time employer. At this point the movie is over for me. All creative writing credibility is lost with the very idea of anyone feeding someone else their feces, much less eating it. In creative writing class this would've earned the writer a big fat F, because it lacked any thought, or creativity. I hoped maybe she'll just let her employer think that she ate the maid's feces, and that would've been cool, but that opportunity was lost as well. Equally disturbing, is the pretty, white, "home again," college girl, journalist who has never managed a relationship in her life, including with her mother, yet some how manages to convince every black maid in town to turn their white employer's closets, inside out for the world to read....in her book....right before she leaves town... forever...to begin her writing career... with Ms. Stein...in New York City. Every maid in town gave up their profession...for what? Talk about being owned... If the filmmaker wasn't on a feces based, racial binge, she wouldn't have created this little rich white girl who single-handedly cheated many black maids out of their jobs and probably their livelihoods. She would've included examples of some of the employer's that did pay their maids well, that did give their maid rides to the bus stop, that did send food and clothing home with the maids, that did provide adequate bathrooms, that did let the maid bring her kids to work when they were too sick to attend school, and did help fund their children's education. She would've created at least one smart maid character that would've called the sketchy rich white "journalist" on her scheme. There was a copy of "To kill a mocking bird," strategically placed in one of the scenes...a more relevant book for this scene would've been..."The devil went down to Georgia." This piece of feces is just another literary masterpiece out of New York City at the expense of the "fly over," ie...the "restofUS."If your story requires that one of your characters eat a feces pie...chances are your story is weak, and SH*T ain't' gonna fix it.Does America really deserve another feces pie ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help is a very good movie about institutional racism in the deep south in the early 1960's (in Jackson, Mississippi around the time that Medgar Evers was murdered). If you read the earlier reviews you will already know that the help are the black housemaids that handled white folks' housekeeping and child care. There are many fine performances all the way around. The actresses who play the help are excellent. Two of them deserve consideration when award season comes around again. The actresses who play the seething, detestable, racist oppressors of the help are portrayed as one-dimensional cartoonish characters. One exception is a ditsy, white- trash-blonde-sexpot with a heart of gold who married up. It turns out that she is also on the receiving end the wrath of the southern belles. To conjure an image of the belles, imagine a race-baiting June Cleaver, pearls and all, with a deep-south accent and nasty disposition added to her sweet side. For the ditsy blond, gather up and image of Ellie May Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies. The only multi-dimensional white woman in the film is the southern girl who is hell-bent on breaking the mold. She returns from college and decides to write an expose of the help; with the help of the help. She enlists the maids to be her confederates in her clandestine operation.Although somewhat predictable, the film is engaging, moving, sad, enraging, funny and well staged and performed by all of the actors. I enjoyed The Help and I think you will too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Steel Magnolias" without the syrup? It's better than that, but it looks like that. Too many pretty people, too many scenes with heavy-handed and romanticized art direction, a bit sugary at times, but how can you complain when the acting is terrific and the story is so compelling? For the first time in a major film, the focus is on how white women treated black women during the era of Jim Crow. Rather than another harrowing portrayal of the horrors of racism involving white men treating black men badly, very badly, we see something that is every bit as disturbing. White women, many of them, degrading and demeaning black women, many of them, in so many small and cruel ways that it makes you ashamed. Much of it is painful to watch, and it's mostly done with soul-killing looks and words, very ugly words. All of the insults, dirty looks, callous remarks...it's a shocking reminder about the banality of evil. Amazing performances. Hope it's shown in every high school in America.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This, of course, is an emotional and strong subject which is felt greatly in this film. But The Help has some amazing acting, great writing, and an overall perfect portrayal of the struggles faced by many during this time period.This movie was serious and emotional, but it was also hilarious!!! I have not been to many movies where an entire audience bursts into laughter multiple times during one film. The "sassy" oneliners from a couple of prominent characters and the karma that comes back to bite some asses creates so many funny moments!! This is one of its strongest characteristics. We can only take so much intensity. The break-up of comedy gives this movie a great dynamic.The acting was excellent! Emma Stone, who plays the young journalist, once again is kind of broadening her repertoire. She portrays this strong-will girl who doesn't quite measure up to the usual beauty queens of the south. She has the look, the acting ability, and the subtle comedy to support the other great actors in this film. I was really impressed with Octavia Spencer, who plays one of the maids. She had an amazing character written for her, but she could not have acted better! Her character was the source of the majority of the humor and she executed it all perfectly! Throughout the movie I was continually impressed by her performance. The rest of the cast was great. They set the scene and created the characters wonderfully, but I was most impressed with Spencer and Stone.The biggest pull of a film like this is it gives us a peek into the past. This was such a volatile time in history and has been represented in a variety of medias. But The Help shows a more personal perspective. It puts you in the homes and lives of people living during this time and people trying to challenge the current system. Emma Stone's character's mother at one point says, "Courage sometimes skips a generation." This referred to her feelings about her daughter trying to challenge these negatives systems in society when she was unable to. I just wondered how many parents at this time felt the same way. The idea that my great- grandparents or others living during this time could have thought that way makes the depth of the film intensify.Overall, this was a moving, emotional, and funny movie. It shows a great picture of the struggles of inequality during the 1960s, but it's not just about a societal issue or history. It is so much more than that. Plus it was really fun to watch. You feel connected to the characters, because you watch their emotion and struggles play out. The majority of the audience tonight was women and older couples. I think it will resonate most with this audience most, but I would recommend this film to everyone!SEE IT!!</fullReview>

However, it is the villain, racism, which gives the film it's power. The characters are given depth by the evil they must overcome and the desire is clear in each portrayal. The best reason to see this film is that it will effect you emotionally.

This felt like second rate TV movie throughout, poorly directed and cast. It was very difficult to feel any empathy with Emma Stone's portrayal of Skeeter, her performance lacked any of the depth and complexity of the written equivalent. Bryce Dallas Howard also overplayed Hilly Holbrook in what could have become one of the great on screen villains. The cinematography was also very bland and poor. Having recently seen the likes of Drive, and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy at the cinema 'The Help' appears as if it was shot by a 12 year old with his first camera in comparison. Normally I find IMDb ratings an accurate basis of a film's quality. How this Sunday afternoon schmaltz has got 8 stars is beyond me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went and saw the movie because I'd read the book and really liked it. I'd also heard that it roughly paralleled a similar story and one I'm all to familiar with?that of vaccine injured, and the injustices they've faced.Oh boy was it ever a slap in the faced to see the words 'Participant Productions' in the opening credits.Participant Productions bills themselves as a 'socially relevant' film company. That being said, I find the hypocrisy breathtaking, given what they've done with the movie rights to Evidence of Harm. It's a bit like that man in the soap opera who went upstairs and never came back down because the writers forgot about him. Looking on the internet, one might get the impression that the story never was in development although it was at one time. Would you like an explanation as to why it was taken out of development? You won't find one on the internet. You might try writing them, but others have?you'd be wasting your time. The socially relevant film company doesn't feel it's a socially beneficial thing to do to respond to people who've had their rights stripped from them via Bruesewitz versus Wyeth. They don't feel any need to respond to people who've been treated arguably more horrifically than most black maids of the fifties and sixties.I liked the movie a lot.

		<fullReview>Based on a popular book, The Help are Black maids working for white women. It's a period piece that takes place in Mississippi in the early sixties.Excellent performances all around. Viola Davis and others will be remembered during award season.It's the kind of drama Douglas Sirk did so well in the fifties. Think "Imitation of Life"."The Help" suffers from the written and directed by syndrome. It's too long. Tate Taylor is not Douglas Sirk. Much of the exposition is through dialogue rather then shown. The maids stories are often told rather then shown. Late in the movie we're told, "We sent your brother to Chicago?" and we didn't have a clue the character had a brother, but we needed the information the brother found.The flash backs were awkward and contrived. The character has to look at the bench or drive by the porch before we go back there. It seemed as though no one at the bridge parties knew how to play bridge.The film looks appropriate for the time period. There are plenty of classic cars. The use of period music was effective.It's a good movie that feels like it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that is just as good as the book, finally. All of the characters come alive in some of the best performances by actors that I have seen in a long while. The MacGuffin here is Skeeter's (Emma Stone) desire to become a writer and achieve the self-worth she feels she has been denied all her life. The vehicle then is to interview Jackson, Mississippi maids so they can tell their stories. The setting of the South in the 60's is perfectly captured. Some may find the story a bit too preachy but its overall themes of love, self-worth, and individual courage carry this film. Viola Davis (Aibileen Clark , Allison Janney (Charlotte Phelan) , Sissy Spacek (Mrs. Walters), and Octavia Spenser (Minny Jackson) are wonderful in their roles; but, Bryce Davis Howard (Hilly Holbrook) who plays the snobbish and racist power in the town and Jessica Chastain (Celia Foote), as the woman who Hilly believes stole her boyfriend and then married him, turn in two performances that are amazing. You really dislike Hilly and feel for the innocent and kind Celia. My best guess is at the Academy Awards show the entire cast will be nominated and all should receive the Oscar for performances that demonstrate what real actors can do with a genuine story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth seeing, especially if you have not read the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had I not just read the book, I would have loved this movie. It made me both laugh and cry. Octavia Spencer was the perfect choice for Minnie and Viola Davis nailed it as Abileen. Emma Stone, although very short to be playing Skeeter pulled it off so well I forgot how short she was except when next to her mother. The story line is such a good one that even with the changes they made it stood up well.As far as the changes. They were disappointing and really not necessary. What it ended up doing was sugar coating things that did not need to be sugar coated. We all know that in the South in the early 1960's not only was it illegal for anyone white or black to tell the truth of how unjustly blacks were treated, it was also very, very dangerous. By sugar coating that fact it takes away the impact of what a book such as The Help would have truly been.Having grown up in the South and being of the last generation of white children raised by wonderful black women I wish they would have left in more of what a real risk any person of color took going against the "rules". The people in real life that took part in bringing about a change were all heroes that do not get enough recognition for what they did for all of us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comedy, drama and characters who walk Hollywood's high rope.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the 1960s in Mississippi, and the uppity, high-class, rich white girls have returned from university with husbands in tow and babies in their bellies, and now they get to hire maids of their own. The maids of course are poor black women from the other side of the tracks (literally). Skeeter (Emma Stone), on the other hand, has returned home from university with a degree in hand, rather than a husband, and after a stop-off in New York City in a failed attempt to get a job as a writer.The other girls are 1960s Barbie dolls in their party dresses and perfectly coiffed hair. While Skeeter misses the maid who raised her and finds herself drawn to the world of the help as she struggles with her first job. She first gets the advice of two experienced maids working for her Barbie doll friends ? Aibileen (Viola Davis) and Minny (Octavia Spencer) ? for a cleaning column, but she wants to start pushing the boundaries of the law and tell a story from their point of view.At its worst, "The Help" is a melodramatic but poignant, long drawn-out affair where a white woman happily solves racism in America and the whole world can hold hands and skip in perfect harmony. However, at its best, it's a well-crafted film that subtly holds together multiple genres as it balances that tight rope between drama and comedy. Lean too far in either direction, and you fall (which it comes close to multiple times but never actually crashes).A hidden story in this movie, is one of a girl, Skeeter, who has triumphantly navigated university, but is at a stand-still in trying to get a job and live independently, so for now, she's at home and working for the local newspaper as she forges her way in the real world. Sounds typical, doesn't it? Except there's a good chance you won't even notice this story because it is hidden beneath all the class-divides, racial-divides and friendship-divides.There's even a character in here who will surprise you: Celia Foote played by Jessica Chastain. Although I generally know better than to listen to plastic, talking Barbies who described Celia as white trash, I still believed them. The layers of her cluelessness and my surprise were delightful and entertaining to unravel.It's dramatic because this is a story of inequality. The help get treated is if they are "less than" while the southern belles act as if they are "more than." As said before Skeeter wants this to be about the maids' point of view, and as you can guess, they are mostly sad stories. Except for Minny's because she likes being bold. Octavia Spencer and Sissy Spacek as the mother of a mean-spirited Barbie doll are responsible for most of the comedic relief. And relief it is because they are funny.There were references to Martin Luther King, Jr., John F. Kennedy, "Gone with the Wind" and Margaret Mitchell. Because this is Hollywood and the excessive run time, I'm afraid they have already placed this movie in that esteemed group. It's good, it's fun and meaningful, but let's not get too carried away.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from an advanced screening of this movie. It is truly a great movie. I've been anxious to see this movie for a while simply because Emma Stone is in it and I have been a huge fan of hers for a long time. I knew she would do great things and this movie proves it. I was not only impressed by her, but by the entire cast. I'll admit I have not read the book but the movie was so good that I can assume it does it justice. Although this film deals with a tough subject it manages to find humor amidst the struggles. There is so much depth to each of these characters that you truly begin to care about what happens to them. A lot of movies lack that. I love this film. I love this cast. Can we say Oscars? ....yes.

The most important film since...well since Gone With The Wind. O.K. at least since Steel Magnolias. All the ingredients of what comes together is near perfect. Obviously the Book was a treasure trove of what makes for a classic film. The closest film today to show the plight of people of color since Color Purple. How good was it?

		<fullReview>It seems the cultural Marxists never tire of fanning the dying embers of the "Civil Rights" movement because it can always be relied upon to burst into flame, warming the hearts of a credulous American public. Whenever the Left encounters massive public skepticism regarding the benefits of whatever the liberal cause du jour may be, they can always depend on striking a sympathetic chord with mainstream conservatives and leftists alike by dusting off yet another reminiscence about the bad old days of segregation to remind us of how righteous liberals are.Unpleasant memories like the Bolshevik Revolution, Mao's Cultural Revolution, Pol Pot's Cambodia, the Vendee, and the gulags fade into nothingness when those evergreen images of police dogs and fire hoses flicker on the screen. The civil rights movement is the radical egalitarian movement too good to be forsaken. Its memory must be kept front and center, and on life support forever.The Help is the movie industry's latest contribution to this endless enterprise. It gives moviegoers a heaping helping of all of the bromides and stereotypes we've come to expect from a Hollywood production depicting the benighted South before the triumph of liberalism ? stoic, long-suffering Blacks imbued with both homespun wisdom and impeccable moral rectitude. They never lose their tempers or lapse into profanity. They are the match to any and all circumstances they encounter, especially all impediments clumsily or maliciously thrown in their path by racist whites.White Americans have now incorporated self-hatred, induced by the entertainment industry to such an extent that they can be predictably relied upon to cheer at depictions of their own downfall and degradation. The most realistic portrayal of the film is the non-WASP, blue state 'progressive' who rewards an ambitious Southerner for publicly selling out her own kind. Skeeter can now take her rightful place in the pantheon of civil rights movement heroes by moving to New York City to pursue her feminist dream career as a writer, and shaking the simpleton dust of flyover country off her shoes once and for all. All of this is woven into a background pastiche of civil rights movements events like the Medgar Evers murder to show us just how brave and heroic both Skeeter and her coterie of Black maids are, and to remind us about why Hollywood bothered to make this movie in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing two extremely disappointing movies recently, I had given up all hope that Hollywood could produce a good film these days. However, when I saw the commercials for 'The Help', I saw a glimmer of hope for the film industry. I decided to give it a try, as I also know people who have read the book and loved it.It's one of those movies where you will find yourself laughing, crying, and everything in between. Not only was the storyline great, but the phenomenal acting brought it all together. It was incredible how much emotion was brought to all of the roles, making each character so real. It's an inspiring story that you won't forget. It is definitely a must see.The only downfall of this movie was that it seemed to drag on a little too long. I found myself wanting to get up because my rear end was hurting. At a certain point I found myself thinking: "Ok this is a great movie, but it's time for it to end." But all in all it was a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Help</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Oscar season", as it's typically referred to, is a period of time, usually beginning in late November, and ending in late January. This year, it starts early, with The Help."The Help" is based on the well-known novel by Kathryn Stockett, someone who I had never heard of before discovering this film and book. For the most part, when I hear about a film that I want to see, I try to read the book prior to viewing the movie, to enhance the whole experience. Usually I get bored, or stop mid-way through one of these said books, before I end up watching the movie.But "The Help" grabbed me. Stockett kept me on a leash, dying to know what happened next, and I ended up finishing its 530 pages in a few sittings. And, I'm glad it did, because "The Help" is not only the best movie I've seen this summer, but it very well could be the best one I see all year.The film centers on Aibileen, Skeeter and Minny (Davis, Stone and Spencer, respectively) three very different women in Mississippi, in the year 1962. Skeeter is returning from graduating college with a journalism degree, whose beloved childhood black maid Constantine has disappeared, and no one will tell her where she has gone. Aibileen is a maid who has raised 17 white children in her life. Her outspoken friend Minny has never been able to keep quiet, or, because of this, hold onto a job very long. Skeeter decides to write a tell-all book of interviews from the maids of Jackson, Mississippi, which, as you could imagine, was a very taboo thing in that time and place.One of the reasons that this film succeeds is that not a single character is miscast. In the book, Stockett paints a vivid picture of each character, and the actors clearly got lost in the characters they were playing. Emma Stone is becoming a very important actress. I haven't seen her in a role that I didn't love her in. After getting her first notable role in 2009's Zombieland, and then livening and carrying the otherwise bland teen comedy Easy A, this is her first dramatic role, as Skeeter, one of the lead characters. While she sometimes blends into the background in this movie, she shines beautifully with the rest of the cast. She's definitely one to watch.While Stone is great, this movie belongs to Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer. Davis's Aibileen is perfect. She has a silent sadness about her, a lot of pride, and a great sense of anger, while never raising her voice the whole film. She handles emotional scenes beautifully, reducing the audience to tears in more than one scene. She's a early in the year front-runner for Best Actress this Oscar season.Spencer also does a beautiful job as Minny. Octavia Spencer was the original inspiration for the character of Minny, who voiced the character's section in the audio-book. She was clearly made to play this role. She does a lot more for this movie, than just adding comic relief, but she plays the comedic side the best. The "terrible awful" that her character does in the book, is made into the funniest thing in the whole movie. The supporting cast is dead-on too. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter) plays the town's snobby ringleader, Hilly. She's absolutely chilling, nailing the evil character. Her mother, played by Sissy Spacek is a hoot. The town's secretive lush, and Minny's boss, Celia, is played by newcomer Jessica Chastain, who wowed earlier this year in "The Tree of Life". She was completely like I envisioned her character in the book. There's not enough typing space in this review to describe how much I loved the rest of the supporting cast. Everyone was dead-on.I was under the assumption that this would be yet another disappointing film of a book loved by many. The reason for this was the director and writer. I had never heard of this Tate Taylor, and because of that, I wasn't sure that I trusted him. He had a large part in making this movie all that it was. One of the big reasons that "The Help" works as a movie is because it feels authentic. It was filmed in Mississippi, where it's based, it is set in the 1960's, and every feeling about the movie hits the right note. I later discovered that Taylor was a childhood friend of the book's author. Not some Hollywood hack. I forget the many disappointing film adaptations of books I loved that were made by the Hollywood elite. "The Da Vinci Code" by Ron Howard, "Memoirs of a Geisha" by Rob Marshall, "Eat, Pray, Love" by Ryan Murphy. Enough said. After seeing this film, I couldn't imagine anyone better-suited to making the film. What is special about this film is that it is not what a lot of people will probably write it off as. It is not a film to make white audiences feel less white guilt. It avoids this sentimentality, I don't know how, but it succeeds in that, like I thought it wouldn't.While some changes are (intelligently) made from the book, it's almost a scene-for-scene adaptation of the book. Some things are different, because they need to be, and things are a little more concise, yet it's almost like watching an abridged version of the book, on screen. I can't say enough good things about this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The acting all around is also refreshing (the highlight being Bryce Dallas Howard), along with the novel-within-a-novel screenplay.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Help wishes to be an emotional roller-coaster and eye-opening exposé, but succeeds instead as just an uplifting, feel-good movie. Heavy-handed manipulation and expected outcomes mix in for an entertaining history and ethics lesson, but thanks to an overlong runtime, the positive energy isn't permanent. The acting all around is also refreshing (the highlight being Bryce Dallas Howard), along with the novel-within-a-novel screenplay - the generous amounts of humor through dialogue alleviate the weightier subject matter for an enjoyable revisit to a dark chapter on the road to social equality in a land of unwilling participants.Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan (Emma Stone) is a southern society girl in the '60s who never really fit in, back from college and interested in becoming a writer. She starts her career by landing a job at the Jackson Journal in Mississippi, picking up a housecleaning column entitled "Miss Myrna." To stay consistent with the tips and tricks previously detailed in the newspaper spot, she speaks with Elizabeth Leefolt's (Ahna O'Reilly) maid, Aibileen (Viola Davis), a poor, third generation black servant for wealthy white families. What Skeeter is really interested in, however, is Aibileen's point of view of taking care of other people's children, working for less than minimum wage, "separate but equal" segregation in buildings and in bathrooms, and the general mistreatment, animosity and feelings of inequality she routinely experiences. Skeeter hopes to collect the stories and compile them into a book.Aibileen is reluctant at first, especially since her job (and even her life) could be at stake if she speaks ill of her employer, but eventually spills her thoughts on the multitudes of unfairness and racism exhibited by nearly everyone in the town. Joining her in the liberating disclosure is the food-loving, outspoken Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer), who works for the particularly prejudiced Hilly Holbrook (Bryce Dallas Howard), a mean-spirited socialite who assigns herself the task of upholding segregation and educating others on the inferiority of "the help." Aided by a confident publisher (Mary Steenburgen) and several more maids stepping forward to reveal the ugly truths at the heart of their prominent white employers, Skeeter is set to publish a highly controversial, jolting and remarkable piece.The young, rich, na?ve, annoying whites with their premature babies, constant coddling, general pampering, carefree, work-free lives and lavish homes are no match for the worldly, sensible, abused black maids. Stupid, smiling racists make great antagonists, and therefore nearly every character in The Help is a stereotype, save for Emma Stone, who is the lone forward-thinking woman looking for change in a disinclined community. And yet the focus on her unnecessary love life, which sparks mild comedy, and the awareness of the adverse effects of her actions, stretches out details that slow the progression of the major points. Fortunately, the themes of courage and hard-earned equality make the film a pleasant, moving picture of important thematic material.- Mike Massie (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Help depicts a brutally honest time in American history where whites were superior and the blacks were inferior. Right around the Jim Crow era where the typical white family lived in a sizable house, with kids, and some of the richer families had a black maid to look after the kid(s). The black maid was forced to drop everything in her home life to cater to the, sometimes cruel, white family. They were expected to be fast, friendly, and honest. They were the help.The film is based on the novel by Kathryn Stockett, who was raised by a black woman because her mother was working a lot of the time. The Help shows how some maids became the mother of the child, and at some point, they were even called "mom." Reminds me of a Hank Williams song My Son Called Another Man Daddy. Only difference is the mothers in this didn't seem to mind the maid being called the mother. They were too busy to notice.The story is about two African American maids named Aibileen (Davis), a middle-aged woman who has been taking care of white kids for nearly her entire life and just lost her son. And Minny (Spencer), the mouth of the two with an abusive husband, but a great sense of humor. She provides much of the comic relief to this story.Jackson, Mississippi, the town of the film, bribes blacks of their freedom of speech and their rights. They literally have no say in anything. A woman was beaten for going down to vote, and some have even been killed. Brave aspiring-journalist Eugenia "Skeeter" Phelan (Stone) has just been hired by the Jackson Journal newspaper, and is set to write an article, which turns into a novel, with the help serving as the voice of the book. Skeeter wants people to know that these humans have their own lives, but spend their time taking care of other children, being forced to work under whatever circumstances and limitations they have, while being the subject to verbal abuse by their employers and racial segregation in the household.To the whites, the blacks might as well be mannequins that can do work. The don't care about their feelings or their opinions just as long as they work efficiently and clean up after themselves. The characters, on the other hand, are introduced at hyper-speed, but the story cleans up after itself and takes time to introduce them one by one, giving proper and worthy character development to each.Emma Stone is charismatic, while the maids are hilarious in portions of the film as well. Even in the films darkest hour, it manages to keep a sunny disposition and not get bogged down by painful scenes and a depressing feel. Sure the end credits to leave room for some tears, but scattered scenes across the movie brought the audience I was accompanied with to cheers, screams, laughter, clapping, and sadness, it's all realistic and honest.To wrap up the summer, The Help is a gem. A break from all the comedy, romance, and talking animals. It's sure to be overlooked by a younger audience, when it shouldn't. This is an important film, that needs to be seen by many. It's good things like this come out, reminding the public of the past. Those who don't know history are likely to repeat it, and we need films like The Help to prevent that. No one likes repetition. Especially in reality.Starring: Emma Stone, Bryce Dallas Howard, Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Mike Vogel, Allison Janney, and Chris Lowell. Directed by: Tate Taylor.</fullReview>

I looked forward to the release of this film. I will say that at times, the movie can be slow paced, but overall...it was a very well put together film. The female cast was awesome. I cried and I laughed throughout the film. It really tugs at your heart and you can't help but get involved with the characters. There is a young toddler in this film that you can't help but fall in love with! She is so freaking cute. This is a film that I recommend that everyone goes to see. Even if you don't go watch it on the big screen, the little screen at home will do just fine when it is released on DVD. I am definitely going to look into reading the book.

		<fullReview>This film actually starts off well, and it has some powerful moments in its runtime, but, holy crap, does it take an awful turn near its end. And it's too bad, too, because the actors give it their best. It's really hard to believe the original novel was so popular, and that anyone with half a brain would sign on to such a ridiculous script. But what do I know? It was a huge hit and it'll be nominated for a bunch of Oscars. Emma Stone stars as a Southern woman in the '60s who has far more sympathy for the African Americans around her than her friends or family. She herself loved her own maid and caretaker, and she wants to write a book about how the help feels about their employers. This is a very dangerous project. Whites have no desire to know what their servants think about them. In fact, as far as they're concerned, they have no right to express those feelings. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer play the two maids who are brave enough to work with Stone. Davis has been quite celebrated for this role, and, it's true, she's tremendous in the film. No doubt she'll win an Oscar for it, and it'll be deserved. The plot point that ruins the film, though, well, spoilers follow, but you'll want to hear this if you plan on seeing it, to prepare yourself: Spencer, at one point, gets so mad at her employer (a deliciously evil Bryce Dallas Howard) that she bakes her a chocolate pie - made out of her own feces. Howard somehow chows down two pieces of this pie and doesn't notice it, and later Stone uses this fact to blackmail Howard into denying that the book is based on the maids of Jackson, Mississippi. The concept of a poo pie is so disgusting that it completely derails the film. It made me completely change sympathies. The put-upon maid now felt like the villain and the virulently racist Howard became the victim. In real life, Spencer would have been lynched, like instantly. And I almost want to say that she'd deserve it. It-girl Jessica Chastain has a nice role as a white trash girl who wants to be friends with Howard. Really, there's way too much plot about the white chicks in the movie (the film runs way too long anyway).</fullReview>

After purchasing the book - while working on the set - I became more familiar with what was being done on a day to day basis and I often wondered how would they manage to bring the characters of the book to the big screen. My questions were answered after viewing this film. It's an almost flawless adaptation of the book.I decided to give the movie a vote of 9 because it was so good that before I knew it, it was over. It seemed as if the characters pulled you into the movie and you never wanted to let go.

First of all it is disgusting to see black women being typecast in servitude once again, it has been a few years since that has been in the media. The behavior of the black maid should not be cheered on, but she should have been sent to an insane asylum for even thinking of something so degrading. I did not like this movie at all.

		<shortDescription>Definitely Oscar Material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can only echo the other reviews already written about this outstanding movie. The performances are incredible, especially Viola Davis, who shines in her role.Credit also goes to Tate Taylor, who wrote the screenplay and directed this wonderful film.The story is poignant, but also funny, and describes the racism that took place in the South during the Sixties. I can only highly recommend THE HELP. DO NOT miss this movie. It's one of the best of 2011, if not THE best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just What We Need: Another Movie Where Blacks are Victims</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not like the movie at all. We live in a time when the President is half black and we have affirmative action which places minorities ahead of whites in hiring and college admissions, and yet we are still plagued with the politically correct re-write of history: that of the blacks as victims. They are not victims in this culture: they are empowered human beings who are just as capable as whites of anything. Banal movies and books that still portray them as victims are racist in that they are always saying they must be saved by some white person (in this case, the main character who writes the book). I found it boring. I found it trite. I found the movie banal. White people, and in particular white women, are not bad enslavers. In fact, this movie was also sexist in how it dealt with women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racist Brain Washing Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shame on all the people who made this film.The relationship between all people of color and whites is like a never ending horror movie - especially for Africans and Native Indians and their descendants.This movie tries to downplay all the thousands of atrocities that blacks suffered under white 'owners' (by owners, i mean worthless scum)If you want to know more about the REAL black and white ethnic relations history then I suggest you search on youtube for the following two sets of videos1. "crushing white supremacy"2. "Admitted Racist Confesses System Of White Supremacy"If you think that those bad days are behind us then you've been successfully brainwashed. Here's small sample of CURRENT atrocities against blacks:1. gangster rappers that worship pimping, bling, and INTRA black race (that is, black violence against other blacks). Remember, someone has to fund this....want to guess who it is?2. dumping USA consumer waste onto African soil3. denying career opportunities to blacks4. excessive prison sentences to blacks for minor offenses5. in Hollywood, the black man is usually a sidekick role, dies first, or has a 'muscle' head role. They're rarely clever, educated, or well off.6. they're given no justice against white oppressors by the court system. A white police officer kills an unarmed black and he gets an award from the police department.....The only difference is that oppression against blacks is more covert than before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Picture of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I LOVED this movie. This is cinema. Real cinema. The casting was spot on perfect. The chemistry between the cast was amazing. The dialogue was quick and funny and witty. Everything just seemed to gel for this movie. And not only is it a great story filled with heart, and heartbreak, and history... but it'll actually make you laugh at parts too. This movie deserves to Best Picture of the Year, easily. And Viola Davis deserves Best Actress. Hands down. No contest. See it! I've seen it twice and intend to see it again before it leaves my theater. Stop typing, right now. Log off, grab your car keys and go to the movie theater to see this movie. Now. Why are you still sitting there reading this? Scoot! Git! Go!</fullReview>
