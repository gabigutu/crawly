		<shortDescription>Best one I've seen all year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this at the London Film Festival and thought it was the best film I'd seen all year, or in quite a few years, for that matter, though I've yet to see Social Network. I'm partial to small, low-key movies where you have to kind of fill in the blanks for yourself. This is one of those movies, and I like its honest approach, refusing to ingratiate itself with potential audiences that like their dramas "gut-wrenching" and "captivating" (translation: over-acted and on the nose).The cast is great, Will Ferrell is just spot-on, as good as I've ever seen him, including Stranger Than Fiction (well, maybe he'll never top Ron Burgundy, which is pure genius, but this is a whole different thing, obviously): funny, moving, serious... And yet he does very little, and the rest of the cast follow his lead: they just inhabit these characters and let the writing do its job. There are no big, Oscar-bait turns in this film, despite its boasting an "award-friendly" theme, so to speak. There are just these small, honest gestures that speak volumes for themselves. There's no need to amp them up over the top with a sappy score, huge fights, people falling apart, crying and screaming... The film successfully takes it down a notch, and I for one appreciate that.To sum up, it was fresh, honest, funny, moving. I think its humanity will connect with people who are willing to seek this out, and I think they'll be pleasantly surprised if they do.Trivia side note: In the print that was screened at the London Film Festival, Will Ferrell's character was called Nick Porter in the end credits. That was the character's original name, but apparently they couldn't clear it because there was a Nick Porter living in the area, where they were literally about to start shooting that day, or the next. So they had to consider a long list of names before Halsey was finally approved, but they didn't have time to change it in the credits in time for the festival release. This according to writer/director Dan Rush, who was there for a Q&amp;A.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a movie for the masses. Will Ferrell fans who liked Melinda and Melinda and Stranger Than Fiction will not be surprised by his performance as Nick Halsey in this movie. He does comedy so well, many of his devoted fans may not realize that he is a good dramatic actor as well. Ferrell's supporting actors, especially Christopher Jordan Wallace, are also very good. The story moves at a slow and deliberate pace which will bore all but serious moviegoers. However, the acting is excellent along the way, and in the end, the movie has synergy and leaves you with a positive feeling about Nick's future.If you like deliberately paced independent films, go see this movie. It won't be around long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything Must Go is a well-made movie, but heavier than I was seeking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed Stranger than Fiction and, since I had heard Will Ferrell's performance in that movie compared favorably to the one in Everything Must Go, was excited to see EMG. I walked away after seeing EMG a little unsure of whether I truly enjoyed the movie or just merely appreciated the quality of the director's vision and execution. Everything Must Go is the story of Nick Halsey (Ferrell), a struggling alcoholic who, in the first 10 minutes of the movie, has been laid of from his job and kicked out of his house by his wife, all within the same day. The rest of the movie looks at Halsey's attempt to manage the tension between wanting what he once had and trying to pursue a life that he desires, even though he isn't entirely sure of what that looks like. I will start by saying I thought the acting of everyone involved, especially Will Ferrell and Christopher Jordan Wallace, was superb and a highlight of the movie. I thought the music and visuals added significantly to the feel of the movie, especially how so much of the movie occurred in the front yard with the records of his father occasionally playing in the background. Now I knew to expect a story that was not a happy-go-lucky comedy (is there one about an alcoholic struggling with sobriety), but was hoping for some more lightheartedness. I did particularly enjoy watching the relationship between Nick Halsey and Wallace's "Kenny Loftus", and thought that the filmmakers did a good job pairing the two actors up. A couple of things with which I walked away: first, I found it interesting how the director decided to show Halsey's eventual growth in the way that he let go of certain things, and to whom he left them. Afterwards, a friend of mine and I discussed how difficult these acts would have been, but thought it appropriate for someone trying to move beyond such a serious issue as alcoholism. I also found it interesting that such a pivotal character, like Halsey's wife, has no screen time at all, save for her voice in one scene. It is as if the filmmakers want us to see how much damage one person has managed to do by simply stepping out of another's life. Overall, I do believe that the movie was well made, with an interesting story and fantastic acting, but the mood of the film was a little heavier than what I was looking for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything Must Go is probably Will Ferrell's first truly well done film in years. The Other Guys was pretty good, Step Brothers was funny in parts, but this one totally takes the cake for being a great drama, and schools anyone who thinks Will Ferrell can't do anything but comedy. Though I doubt fans of Old School will think highly of this.The plot isn't too much, but it sustains a film. Will Ferrell is Nick Halsey, an alcoholic who has had one too many alcohol-related episodes and has finally lost his job. He returns home to find out his wife has changed all the locks on the house, and has moved all of his belongings to the front yard. Frustrated and hopeless, he decides to life on his front lawn, and make the best out of a horrible situation.He spends his day sucking down Blue Ribbons beers, until he is met by a chubby adolescent named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace, the son of the late rapper Notorious B.I.G.). Kenny's mom takes care of an elderly woman, leaving him free to roam the streets on his bike. Kenny and Nick strike up an odd, but warm relationship with each other and when Nick is informed by his AA sponsor (Pena) that he must move all his stuff off his lawn in three days, he works with Kenny to help them hold a big yard sale.A sub-plot involves Nick getting acquainted with the woman across the street who has just moved to the neighborhood and is awaiting her husband's arrival. The relationship isn't as strong or as well-crafted as the relationship between Nick and Kenny, but it is still a solid one.It's also noteworthy that we never see Nick's wife or the woman's husband anywhere in the film. We don't need to, though. The plot works fine without them, and I believe that if we saw Nick's wife in the film we'd get too many arguments between the two which may result in (a) believability being low and (b) a possibility for Ferrell's comedy side to sneak in. We don't need comedy here. We get it, but in tiny, miniscule doses. There is almost nothing funny about this situation.Once again, this proves that Will Ferrell is a great character actor, and doesn't have to get drunk, shout his lines, or get in goofy fights to be successful. Unfortunately, Everything Must Go's overall performance wasn't impressive, and it may be a long time before Ferrell does something like this ever again.Not everything here is perfect. The worst flaw is the ending because there is no emotional payoff, and nothing to make our experience anymore than just enjoyable. I wanted more than enjoyable. I haven't read the short story "Why Don't You Dance?" by Raymond Carver, so I'm not sure of any similarities both this and the story share. Everything Must Go is a good film in general, but a great film in terms of Ferrell, who is essentially putting on a one-man-show for more than half the film.Starring: Will Ferrell, Christopher Jordan Wallace, Laura Dern, and Michael Pena. Directed by: Dan Rush.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell has more range than Derek Jeter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Ferrell plays Nick Halsey, who arrives home from being fired from his job to find all his belongings on his front lawn. Nick finds a note on his door from his wife letting him know that she has decided to leave him.Rapt with despair Nick, who is a recovering alcoholic, starts drinking heavily and camps out on his front with all his possessions. Eventually, Nick befriends one of the kids in his neighborhood, and together they hold a yard sale on his front lawn to sell off everything that he owns.This is really a story about hitting rock bottom and figuring out a way to start over again. Nick selling off all his belongings becomes cathartic for him as he lets go of his past.Will Ferrell shows some excellent depth in this film. This was huge departure from his normal roles. He may not have nailed it but I admire the fact that he took so much risk with this role. The movie could worth checking out for that alone.I really enjoyed Rebecca Hall as the next door neighbor that helps Nick on his path to redemption. She impressed me in Vicky Christina Barcelona and The Town and she does an excellent job on this film as well. I look forward to seeing some of the movies she has coming out next year.This movie is far from perfect, The pacing is pretty slow, the ending is too abrupt and it lacked some of the emotional punch that it seemed to be striving for. It was an interesting watch however and its worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different role for Will Ferrell. A very good performance in a very good movie. Well worth watching. I say A</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Good without the bad ain't no good at all." After Nick (Ferrell) gets fired from his job of 16 years he comes home to find his wife has changed the locks on his doors and all of his stuff is on the lawn. Thinking the best way to fix things is to stay at home Nick begins his new life, living outside. This is a very very good movie and a very different role for Will Ferrell. While not quite as good as Adam Sandler in "Reign Over Me", Ferrell still shows he has what it takes to be a good dramatic actor. There are a few funny parts in this but this is not a comedy. It's a drama with a lot of heart and while the movie is depressing at times it is a joy to watch. Ferrell does have some funny scenes with his own style of humor that adds to the character and watching him with the actor that plays Kenny is a treat. This is not a typical Will Ferrell movie, but being a huge fan I loved it and look forward to more roles like this from him. I highly recommend this. Overall, if you like Ferrell you will like this, if you don't give this a shot still. You may like the change. I give it an A.Would I watch again? - I think I would.*Also try - Barney's Version</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everything Must Go is an art movie. Maybe that wasn't the director's intention but that's how I'll classify it.I give it 3 stars out of 4.Just a very simple, and ultimately touching, story about a man who's life is falling apart and it is purely his own fault.It is nice to see Will Ferrell ACT and not play his normal over the top persona in comedies.This is a QUIET movie. Just a mellow ride with some humor, some drama, a pleasant setting, good cinematography and production values and interesting characters. One of the better films I've seen this year! I might even be tempted to give it 3 and 1/2 stars! It is like hanging out in a museum for the day or a quiet afternoon enjoying a good bottle of wine. Not something you'd want to do everyday but for an afternoon it is a nice diversion from the mad, mad, crazy world we live in.And no, it is NOT a guilty pleasure. It is a good film but not for everyone. Somehow I think this might have worked better as a UK or French film.I love a slam bang movie like Kick-Ass or Inglourious Basterds or Oldboy as much as the next cat. But this isn't that movie.Like I said, it is a quiet art movie. Like The Music of Chance starring James Spader from back in the 90s.Writer-director Dan Rush did a very good job. Especially since this is his FIRST film and first Internet Movie Database credit! It is almost like something Hal Hartley might have done but less quirky.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'EVERYTHING MUST GO': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Will Ferrell tries his hand at more serious comedy-drama again (after the likes of 2006's 'STRANGER THAN FICTION') with this tale of a relapsed alcoholic who loses his job and wife on the same day and resorts to living on his front lawn. It's based on the short story 'Why Don't You Dance' by Raymond Carver and is written and directed by first time filmmaker Dan Rush. It co-stars Rebecca Hall, Michael Pena, Stephen Root, Laura Dern and Christopher Jordan Wallace (the son of Faith Evans and the late rapper 'The Notorious B.I.G.') in his second film. The movie is funny as well as depressing and emotional. It's a nice step in Ferrell's career, for exploring broader range.Ferrell plays Nick Halsey, an alcoholic who's recently fell off the wagon. As the film opens he's fired from his job for apparently having an affair with a new employee and then left by his wife for the same reason. He's also locked out of his home (after his wife changes the locks), with all of his belongings left on the front lawn. His credit cards have all been canceled as well and his company car is repossessed by his former employers. With no money and no place to go he decides to camp out on his front lawn with all his stuff. His neighbors complain of him being a public nuisance though and he's reported to the police. Thanks to city law his cop buddy Frank (Pena) is able to give him five days to hold a yard sale before he has to kick him off the property. While trying to sell his stuff Nick befriends a new neighbor across the street (Hall) and a local neighborhood kid (Wallace).Like I said the movie is surprisingly dramatic for a Will Ferrell movie and he pulls off his performance impressively. The material isn't too much of a stretch for him given that it's still pretty comedic but it's definitely honest and set in reality (unlike the majority of his films, which are mostly slapstick) and there's some pretty hard hitting drama at times as well, especially towards the end. The movie still has a sizable amount of laughs though so traditional Ferrell fans shouldn't be disappointed. That's why the movie is the perfect step for Ferrell (to test out his range). A gigantic leap in to serious drama would be to sudden and the film works perfectly as is. A smart move for Ferrell and a decent film results because of it.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEq_X_axUaU</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When All That's Left Is You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dan Rush's modestly paced 'Everything Must Go' pretty much takes a look at the worst day of Nick Halsey's life and the days that follow where he's left stranded in his lawn. The theme is quite refreshing but even though the movie is tagged a comedy, the humour here is very dry (it does draw a few chuckles) and it felt more like an intense human drama than a comedy. Halsey's situation is depressing and it really makes the viewer want to hate Catherine, even though, the writer tries to make the point that she was justified in treating him that way. But anyway, this is Halsey's story and perhaps to balance the intensity, Rush could have added more quirks. The pacing is quite slow at times but there was never a boring moment. I liked how the director and Ferrell depict Halsey's struggle with alcoholism. However, I felt that the story and characters (especially the supporting ones) could have been further developed. Will Ferrell is excellently restrained which makes Halsey all the more human and easier to relate to. Rebecca Hall is brilliant. Laura Dern has about one scene and she shows the viewer how one scene alone can make an actor stand out. Overall, I wouldn't recommend 'Everything Must Go' to those looking for a comedy. It is an intense humour drama about a man who once had everything and is now forced out of his house and how he struggles and attempts to deal with his problems one step at a time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Example of Ferrell's Acting Ability</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Everything Must Go" is a wonderful film. Taken from a short story by Raymond Carver, it is a simple idea, but richly textured so the viewer must look under the layers of simplicity for the story to open up. The short story is only a few pages long and it is very simple on the surface. The writing is sparse, but it still makes you think and this idea goes into the film as well.Will Ferrell plays Nick Halsey, the ex-Vice President of a Regional Sales Office. We catch him on his last day of work, downing a flask and reminiscing on the meeting where he was recently terminated after falling off the wagon one too many times. After getting beer, Nick arrives home to see all of his stuff in his front yard and the locks changed. His credit cards and bank account are frozen and he's left with the money on his wallet and the stuff on his lawn.Ferrell gives a very wonderfully subtle performance. Carver would be proud. It seems to me that the main complaint that people have voiced with this film was that there was no big payoff. I disagree. I think there was a big payoff, just not in the sense that there was this huge change in the character. The change is subtle, but it is there. Ferrell goes back to his dramatic abilities to show us the story of a man in crisis, struggling to get out and he does it well. My fear is that this movie will be misunderstood by fans of Ferrell's comedy.It is a depressing movie, but it is a simple story of finding hope as well with comedy sprinkled throughout. My advice would be to give it a chance and be rewarded by seeing Ferrell's abilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell like you've never seen him before: Not kicking or screaming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Do you know what the rate of success is for marriage when one person sobers up, but the other one doesn't?¨Will Ferrell stars in this fantastic comedy slash drama, but this isn't the typical Ferrell comedy where we see him screaming all over the screen. This time he plays a quiet and sad alcoholic, and it's perhaps one of his best performances to date. Everything Must Go was a really pleasant surprise for me; it reminded me a lot of 2008's film The Visitor starring Richard Jenkins. Will Ferrell gives a very similar and quiet performance. Nothing really happens in the movie, but it's the relationship between the characters that carries the film to a higher ground. This is Dan Rush's first film as a director, and he really hits a home run with his debut film. He also adapted the screenplay from Raymond Carver's short story ¨Why Don't You Dance.¨ The dialogue in this movie is just great, and it really feels authentic. The actors also do a great job with the pauses; everything about this movie makes it fresh. The film is rather slow paced and focuses more on the drama and interactions between characters who end up bonding in unexpected ways. It also has very funny moments; although not the laugh out loud kind of humor, but more of a put a grind on your face kind of comedy. I didn't know Ferrell had it in him to give a performance of this caliber without relying on his usual loud mouth role. This is the sort of guy we can identify with, and whose life seems to be unraveling right in front of us. So much potential gone down the drain due to a small mistake. Will Ferrell plays a Sales Executive named Nick Halsey who at the beginning of the film is being fired from his job due to his problems with alcohol. He was a great worker, and seemed to be recovering from his drinking problem, but recently had a relapse when he traveled to Denver and decided to have a few drinks to celebrate an important sale. Word got out to the office in Arizona and they decided it was time to let Nick go. Without a job, now Nick arrives home only to discover that all his things are laying in the front yard of his house and his wife has changed the locks of the doors. Apparently in Denver he also slept with another woman and now his wife has kicked him out of the house. Nick decides to stay in his front yard sitting on his reclining chair and has no intention of moving out. Someone makes a complain and the police come to arrest him for disturbing the peace in the neighborhood, but his friend, Detective Frank Garcia (Michael Pe?a), gets him a permit to stay in his front lawn for five days with the excuse that he is having a garage sale. During these days he befriends a young boy named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) who practically spends all day on his own. Nick hires him to help out with the sale and during that time they become friends. Nick teaches Kenny a thing or two about baseball. A new neighbor also has recently moved in the house in front of Nick's; she introduces herself as Samantha (Rebecca Hall) and says she's expecting a baby girl in a couple of months. Nick opens up to her about his problems and they being an interesting friendship. Everything Must Go is a really interesting small film that will surely put a smile on your face as we see these authentic interactions between characters that probably under normal circumstances never would've befriended each other. The thing I enjoyed the most about this film was the realistic way in which each of these characters was portrayed; and the way the actors played them. Will Ferrell, Christopher Wallace, and Rebecca Hall (who I first came to love in Ben Affleck's flick The Town) all give great performances and the success of the film relies entirely on them. The movie isn't deep, it doesn't try to be preachy either; it just focuses on these small relationships and lets us now that it's never too late to start again. Will Ferrell should continue to accept interesting projects like this so he can prove that he is more than a one dimensional actor. I love his comedies, like Talladega Nights and Ron Burgundy, but it is great to see him in different roles as well proving he can be a serious actor as well. Director, Dan Rush took a huge risk by giving him the lead role, but the gamble paid off because he fit the role perfectly. This is a different kind of film, but I absolutely recommend it. I loved it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent performance by Will Ferrel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't disagree more with the idea that this is a contrived movie with a pointless main character. Will Ferrel plays a man that is flawed, cynical, and coping with alcoholism-- in my opinion, somebody incredibly human. To the previous reviewer who says things like: "There are a few chuckles, but how is this guy not smart enough to be sleeping in his front yard and forget that he has sprinklers in the front yard. .... not once, but twice." ... The man is drunk for somewhere near 100% of the time he is on his lawn. If you pass out drunk, you're not making plans to deal with sprinklers in the morning.Anyway, Will Ferrel is excellent. The humor in the this movie is all Ferrel's timing and countenance as he copes with everything that has happened so suddenly in his life. He shines during the characters most vulnerable moments, like when he wakes in a cold sweat in complete panic because he is out of alcohol, and his desperation in trying to get beer on credit from the liquor store. His reaction to and ability to cope with constant traumatic discovers makes this movie an interesting/engaging experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Seeing this film back-to-back with Mel Gibson's "The Beaver" was a mistake. Following up manic depression with severe alcoholism and mild depression is just a bit too much weight in such a short time. But I guess that's the point of this one. Will Ferrell stars as Nick who loses his job, punctures his boss' tire, and finds out his wife not only left him, but also locked him out of the house with all his belongings in the front yard. That's in the first 8 minutes of the film.Ferrell proceeds to get drunk ... while sitting in his Lazy Boy in the front yard. He clearly has hit bottom and shows no signs of recovering. At least not until he partners with a lonely, young, bike riding boy named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace, son of Notorious B.I.G.). This partnership consists of Kenny doing most of the work for the yard sale while Ferrell sleeps and drinks.Rebecca Hall plays a pregnant woman who is moving in across the street. "What kind of man makes his wife move across country alone?". That's the question Ferrell asks Hall ... and along with the viewer, these two characters understand the answer would be a man just like Ferrell.What I like about the film is that there are numerous signs of real human emotion throughout, yet none of the main characters overplays their part. If you are unaccustomed to seeing Mr. Ferrell in anything but slapstick comedies, I encourage you to see "Stranger Than Fiction". He really does have dramatic acting skills on top of his amazing comedic talent.The film comes from first time director Dan Rush and short story writer-extraordinaire Raymond Carver. The script does capture much of the emotion that goes with feeling rejected and searching for numbness in a bottle ... or in this case, a Pabst beer can. Supporting work from Stephen Root, Laura Dern and Michael Pena are solid, but the best scenes are between Ferrell, Wallace and Hall. Don't show up expecting to laugh much. This is a serio-drama that makes you think ... there but for the grace of God ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>EVERYTHING MUST GO (2011) *** Will Ferrell, Rebecca Hall, Michael Pena, Laura Dern, Stephen Root, Christopher Jordan Wallace. Ferrell stars as a downward spiraling drunk who has his worst day yet: after being unceremoniously fired from his corporate job he finds his wife has thrown all his worldly possessions out onto their front lawn and locked him out of their home ? forcing him to sober up in more ways than one. Based loosely on Raymond Carver's short story "Why Don't You Dance?" newbie filmmaker Dan Rush fleshes out the bare bones storyline by incorporating new characters to interface with Ferrell and the fine cast lends able support to his better-than-expected dramatic turn (shrewdly low-key but humorous as well) that works for what it's worth as a decent dramedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very interesting movie. It shows how life can really put you down. I am glad that nothing positive happened at the end, like he get his job back and find new woman and etc etc, real life story that could happen to everyone. Its maybe little depressing to watch, at one point I even thought when will be the end, but eventually you somehow connect with main character and you want to see what will happened. I think that any person who has experienced difficulties in life will like this movie. In my opinion, this movie is worth watching, it definitely would not be a waste of time. At least you can enjoy watching Will Ferrell acting outside of comedy movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the day he's fired from his job in Phoenix, for falling off the wagon and waking up in the hotel room of an associate who files a suit for harassment, Nicholas Halsey comes home to find his stuff on the front lawn, the locks changed, and a farewell note from his wife.With his bank account frozen, his credit cards and phone cancelled, and his company car gone, he takes up residence on the lawn.A cop who's his AA sponsor tells him he can sit there for five days as if it's a garage sale, then he'll face arrest.With help from a chubby kid on a bicycle, a pregnant neighbour, and an old high school acquaintance, Nick goes on a beer-soaked odyssey, from his front-yard easy chair...Not since stranger than fiction, has Ferrell been this brilliant. This proves that the man can act, without acting stupid, but one does hope he doesn't go all Jim Carrey, because I like the other Will, I really do.His character is really hard to root for though, as he has all this coming to him, and no matter what he does in the film, it still nags in the ack of his head 'you really have no one else to blame'.The film doesn't really focus on alcoholism, but the connotations are rife throughout. He drinks through the majority of the film, and plotwise, drinking has destroyed him, but the narrative doesn't really focus on that, it focuses on him and his thoughts.It's beautifully made though, one of those lovely films that comes around once in a while from out of nowhere and really grabs you.the performances are first rate and the locations beautiful.But just as you think that things are going his way a little, they just get worse, and he hits another wall. This man gets no reprieve throughout the film, and at times it does make you feel a little down, but makes you thankful for what you have got.An easy film to watch, with a lovely message.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An OK comedy with a serious theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedies with a serious theme are rare and even more rarely good. This one is a "good enough" comedy about alcoholism. It's not taking any risks, other than Will Ferrell not playing another "big guy making strange faces", but a somewhat real person. That's why its emotional impact, for which I think it was driving for, doesn't go deep. You do feel some level of sympathy for the main character (and some supporting ones), but not much.The humor is OK, not too many gags, but not very funny either.The story does seem to take too long to come to that particular end, which could have been an interesting experiment had the whole "guy living at his front lawn" been taken a level higher, but, like we noticed before, the movie is not taking real risks.All things considered, it's worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was looking for an easy comedy to help me sleep...what I discovered was invaluable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so, no this movie did not help me sleep. It kept me staring at the ceiling for an hour after the credits started rolling, then compelled me to wake up and write this, my second ever review on IMDb. To those of you who have or have ever had trouble sleeping...you know when your brain just won't shut the hell up &amp; everything is running through your mind a mile a second? Well, I figured I needed something light and funny to soothe me to sleep...instantly I thought of Will Ferrel. I wanted to watch a film of his I hadn't seen before, and then came Everything Must Go.Remember Adam Sandler in Reign Over Me? Get ready to be wowed by another comedy actor turning to a more serious role. Ferrel plays Nick Halsey, a middle-aged professional working in a senior position for a top corporation who also struggles with alcohol. What happens to set the stage for the film is every mans worst nightmare. All in one day, he loses his job, his wife &amp; his home and has all his possessions tossed onto his front yard with no access back into his house. With no car, no money and no where to go, he takes up residence on his front lawn. With the help of a neighbourhood kid, a new neighbour &amp; an old high school acquaintance, Nick embarks on a journey to discover how his choices got him exactly where he is today. Because although the writers fool you into having sympathy for our main protagonist at the beginning of the film, the dots slowly connect and you discover that maybe Nick himself is largely to blame for his current circumstances.What spoke to me is Nicks addiction. The first thing he does on his front lawn when everything has gone to hell is crack open a beer. Which sad to say, is what I would've done, although alcohol is not my poison. At first, his drinking just seems like a reaction to his bad situation, but it turns out it has been a major influence on his life for a long time. Each character plays a specific role in his self-discoveries. The neighbourhood kid gives him a purpose, someone to teach about sales and helps him reflect on his relationship with his parents. The new neighbour is a representation of how Nick and his wife started out and the "compromises" that had to be made (and I say this in the least creepy way possible, she was the most beautiful pregnant woman I've ever seen (even though she obviously isn't really pregnant)). While the old high school acquaintance (again, I heavily related to this) was someone from another time in Nicks life who saw him as this larger than life character with a big heart, who was sure to be destined for great things. And Nick is desperate to be reassured that he is still that guy. The thing I noticed is...Nicks encounters with these 3 characters is always one on one (except at the end when there is a walking scene but no dialogue), and I tell you, each encounter with each character will have you hooked to your screen. I can't explain it, it was nearly like the adrenaline rush you get with an action movie but a lot more subtle. You never knew if the exchange was going to be positive or negative.The theme of the movie can be summed up like this: "how did my choices in life lead me to now?". I relate to Nick in almost every way...except for the choices he made. Because it was my lack of making choices that led me to a similar place that he finds himself in. It was freaky how in almost every scene I would have reacted the same as he did, and I kid you not, right before he says to the cop "There's a law that says I can't drink a f#$%ing beer on my lawn?", I thought in my head "there's a law in the US that says you can't drink a f#$%ing beer on your own front lawn?" I can't really recommend this film enough based on entertainment value alone, but if you're looking for a movie that is sure to trigger some self-reflection also, then you have really stumbled onto a winner with Everything Must Go. The humour is scarce but you get 2 to 3 laugh out loud moments, the rest will either make you smile or chuckle (depending on how sensitive your funny bone is).I don't get all the hater reviews on here. A lot of them are complaining that they were "duped" because they went to see a funny Will Ferrel comedy but got this instead...Awwwww, poor baby, need me to kiss the boo boo better? Grow up! If you were dumb enough to not look into the movie you were going to see (regardless of the lead actor) then you brought it on yourself. Even I read the short bio on this website before I watched it, after I read the part about him struggling with alcohol I knew it wasn't going to be all moon beams and my little ponies. And you didn't like that the movie was 'depressing' did you? You one of those warm fuzzy types that always has to have their head up with the fairies? Life can be depressing, life can be hard...this isn't news. And for a movie to bring these truths to light in such an artistic, engaging and REAL fashion...inspired. And you didn't like it? I'm sure if I ever met you I'd punch you in your 1 dimensional head.To all lovers of movies with substance that stimulate your brain, stop reading this review already and watch this movie. A movie that leaves you with a feeling of "new starts are hard, and they may not work out, but the only other option is to sink".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell Deserves an Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, maybe not an Oscar, but definitely some kind of recognition for the performance he gave in this movie. I'll be honest, when I chose this off my streaming service, I was a little hesitant. After all, Ferrell is known for his raucous humor (which I enjoy), but having seen previous reviews for this film - I knew it wasn't "Anchor Man" material. I was more than pleasantly surprised. Depth, great acting (by most, if not all of the cast), impeccably well placed music - and a story that most everyone can relate to.This is well worth the 90 mins or so if you have it. Proving once again that comedians can, and do, provide some of the most incredible dramatic performances on film (e.g. Robin Williams, "Good Will Hunting").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyman must hit rock bottom to break addiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't initially relishing watching this movie, I like Will Ferrell but was dubious as to whether he could pull off a straight role. However, I warmed immediately to Nick Halsey, how could he be sacked and on the same day be chucked out of his own home? So he takes the unusual step of camping out in his front yard (luckily he doesn't live in the UK) with all of his lifelong belongings.It's a coming of age movie in some ways, albeit at 40+ years of age. Will Ferrell nails the helplessness of his situation, he drinks and along the way through relationships with a young kid, his pregnant neighbour and an old school flame he realises that he's a good man, that he has something to offer the world, that perhaps he doesn't need the booze after all. The direction is solid however its slow paced allowing the viewer snapshots as to why Nick turned out this way. I also liked the fact that you never meet the wife or the husband across the street, you don't need to. Its very uncomplicated, perfectly paced.I loved this movie and the whole cast performance if anything its uplifting and ultimately a positive message via an unfortunate back story. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Gone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people make bleak comedies about alcoholics it tends to be labelled as a tragedy.Everything Must Go starts out with Nick Halsey (Will Ferrell) getting fired in his job as a salesman and then when he gets home he finds his belongings on the lawn, his wife has changed the locks, taken his savings and kicked him out.We find out that Halsey is an alcoholic, has temper issues and decides to live on the lawn with his belongings. His sponsor a police officer has bought him some time so he can have a garage sale. He gets a local black kid to help him out and a newly arrived neighbour (Rebecca Hall) is the only other person who gives him some time. We never do get to see his wife throughout the film.The film is a slow burn as Halsey tries to deal with his situation At first he is angry, frustrated, confused and drunk. We sympathise with his predicament as his wife has left him homeless and penniless.Over time we get to know a little about Halsey and his demons, maybe we can understand the chaotic life he led and the repercussions that caused. Maybe that is the reason why his neighbours could not care less about him.Will Ferrell is restrained as Halsey but maybe too restrained unless when he gets angry because he wants booze. Maybe Rebecca Hall and the kid are symbolisms showing Halsey as a kid or Halsey's wife (as Hall's character is also married to a salesman who is yet to join her.)We know Halsey was once a nice decent guy when he meets up with Laura Dern an high school friend he has not seen for years. Over time he realises he needs to deal with his problems, his alcoholism. He bonds with the kid, he gets rid of all his things in the yard sale and he finds out that he could had got his job back if he had not burst his superior's tyre after he got fired. He even gathers that his sponsor has not been honest with him.As a comedy it does not work, its not funny and too bleak. The title of the movie implies it is making statement of consumerism but it is not even that. Its about a breakdown of one man's life and the few days after in suburban America where the American dreams hit the skids.The film has flaws, no one cares much for him, we are unsure where he goes for his toilet break as he cannot get in the house. I am unclear unless he gets blind drunk how he manages to sleep so well at night. In some ways the film does not go anywhere at all. No optimistic resolutions here it just kinds of peters out. Ferrell is OK, less of his silliness in this but I think he is not stretched as an actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell Shows Some Versatility, But The Story Has No Real Point Or Conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing to know about this movie is that it's not your typical Will Ferrell comedy. It's not outrageously funny; it's not ridiculously silly. Truthfully, in spite of the comedy/drama label, it's not really a comedy at all. This probably just could have been called a drama. This is downcast, sombre and even sad almost from the first moment. It makes the point that Ferrell can offer an effective performance without having to be outrageous (much as "Reign On Me" made that point for Adam Sandler.) And he was effective in this.His character is Nick Halsey. Nick is a regional vice president of sales for a major corporation of some sort, but he has lots of problems - especially the fact that he's an alcoholic; a problem that's been with him for a long time. As the movie opens, it finally comes to an end for Nick. The company is tired of him. It's not that he's unsuccessful at what he does - they're just tired of him and his antics, and he gets fired. Then, when he arrives home, he discovers his wife is gone, she's changed the locks on the house, and thrown all of his possessions on the front lawn. With nothing else to do and nowhere else to go, Nick takes up residence in the front yard, finally organizing a giant lawn sale just to get rid of everything. Basically that's the story, and the story is the biggest weakness of the movie. This doesn't really go anywhere, it never leads to anything, there's absolutely no closure in how it ends. It basically revolves around the relationships Nick develops with a new neighbour (Samantha, played by Rebecca Hall) who's having some problems of her own and seems to find in Nick a sort of kindred spirit, and with Kenny (Christopher C.J. Wallace) - a local overweight teenager who doesn't really fit in and who helps Nick with the yard sale. The development of those relationships moves the story forward ever so slowly, but as I said it moves slowly forward to no real destination. And by the time this ends you even wonder about those relationships. Did they mean very much? Will they be lasting? And I was lost by the need to involve Laura Dern as one of Nick's former high school classmates. That whole interplay really offered little, except noting that Nick has a big heart. That surely could have been done without the need to introduce a totally extraneous character into the mix.I liked Ferrell in this. He's not the one dimensional actor he sometimes appears to be. The fact that this offered him a vehicle to show that in a low-key and sombre role makes it worthwhile, I suppose, but it doesn't overcome the terribly heavy and ultimately unresolved plot.

		<shortDescription>Some Good and Some Bad Things. Mediocre Overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First the good things: Will Ferrell did a respectable job portraying a man at his wits end descending into full blown alcoholism as he lives on his front lawn after losing his job. His relationship to "Kenny", his African-American neighbor teen was very well done. His awkward searching out and finding his high-school crush played by Laura Dern was moving.Now the bad things: The pacing was slow and languid. The comedy that was implied in the trailer was minimal, giving the film a mostly depressing feel that made its 1:37 minutes seem longer. The plot lines never seemed to go very far or deep, probably to reflect his own depression. Finally, the ending, while hopeful, might have benefited with going just a bit further, or perhaps in a different direction with Laura Dern's character.Conclusion: Unlike some reviewers who raved, I think the box office tells you whether it was really a "masterpiece" or worth a 10 rating. But while others called it a disaster, I doubt most viewers would feel that negative, as its problem was that interesting plot lines, while plenty, were just not explored or developed enough, making the overall feeling slow and somewhat depressing, rather than enjoyable, as even the most serious movie should aim to be. Hence: Not good but not bad. So-so, thus a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How much for your stuff?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Until I started reading these reviews of my work, praising me, I never felt the people I was writing about were so bad off...the waitress, the bus driver, the mechanic. God, the country is filled with these people. They're good people." - Raymond Carver "The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation." - Henry Thoreau In Raymond Carver's short story "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love" a group of adults sit around a table and talk about love. Eventually it becomes apparent that each character has a different definition of "love", and that none of the characters can really express what "love is". Ultimately they agree to disagree. This tale encapsulates the overriding thrust of Carver's work. Though he is renowned for revitalising the short story format, one point of your typical Carver short-story is that each particular tale is but part of a larger compilation, the world made up of a seemingly infinite number of clashing and differing subjective perspectives. Director Robert Altman recognised this with "Short Cuts". Rather than adapt a single Carver story he adapted at least nine (including some of Carver's poems), and then loosely tied them all together. Carver's collections function in the same way, dipping in and out of wildly differing windows, households, families and lives."Everything Must Go", directed by Dan Rush, is an adaptation of a single Carver story, "Why Don't You Dance?". While it lacks the state-wide scope of "Short Cuts" - it focuses on just one man, one little suburban square ? it nevertheless captures Carver's voice, style and interest in simple, seemingly slight, domestic drama. There's a touch of Hemingway here too. While some of Carver's early work parodied Hemingway, he eventually grew into one of the writer's successors (though Carter's prose dispenses with the romantic egoism of Hemingway), with his blunt minimalism, distinct cadence (a result of word-stingy editor Gordon Lish), idyllic wildernesses, themes of depression and alienation, and his knack for first sentence hooks. In the case of "Everything Must Go", the hook is that alcoholic Nick Halsey, played here by comedian Will Ferrell, has suddenly been fired from his job. To make matters worse, Nick returns home to learn that his wife has left him, locked him out of their house, moved to a different state and scattered all his belongings out on their home's front lawn. Flabbergasted, Nick camps outside his home, surrounded by his furniture and various other objects, clothes, possessions and trinkets.The film captures well Carver's particular brand of symbolism. Nick's failed marriage is mirrored to a newlywed couple across the street, and Nick's front lawn becomes a wasteland of discarded memories; a wreckage strewn past. Nick is also literally caught in a kind of stasis, stuck between a failed job and home-life, and we see how alcohol, art (music/cameras etc) and consumer trinkets serve only to assuage or cover up deep regrets, disappointment and unhappiness. "You need to put up some curtains," Nick tells neighbour Samantha. "Why? So I don't have some drunk staring at me all day?" she asks. "No," he replies, "so you don't have to look at your future." The banality of post 1960s, red, white and blue collar America was a Carver obsession, but here these things are treated very literally. "You're all as screwed up as me," Nick yells from his front lawn, "but you get to hide in your houses while I'm out here!" Nick functions as a symbol for every man caught in late-capitalism's ceaseless double helix.Carver's characters typically seem tired and world weary, spending all their time on the sofa watching TV or hauling their bodies to and from offices. Nick's found himself temporarily dislocated from this treadmill. He tries to turn his back on yesterday's baggage, bonding with a woman across the street and hooking up with an old college class mate (Laura Dern in a cute little role), but is ultimately left without solutions. The film then ends with a cover of Dylan's "I Shall Be Released", a song which perhaps belies Nick's true future.The film is unconventionally relaxed, lazy and unhurried ? like sitting on a rocking chair in the middle of a cool breeze - and is quite different from Carver's six page short, which was nevertheless also about being liberated, perhaps to the point of insanity, from objects, duty, even marital responsibilities. Rush's film is better, but he's still too small an artists to recognise the radical connotations of this tale's title. Everything Must Go, but there are no wrecking balls here. Nick recruits a young black kid as a salesman, makes a buck selling his stuff, and thanks the heavens that his alcoholism was movie-alcoholism. You know, the kind that leads to redemption, wisdom and Zen-calm. The film's ending, while not necessarily "happy", is wrong to force closure upon an ongoing historical process.Ironically, Joseph Urgo once identified the short story itself as a "capitalist art-form of a particular sort", in that it "is managerial, must be completed within certain spatial confines and mirrors an imperative of its cultural context". The short story is "like a well-managed operation," Urgo said, "one that functions like clockwork, without a hitch, the genre's demands for efficiency of form, cohesiveness, and economy of scale parallelling the demands of managerial capitalism." If a tightly written short enacts the very same sense of what is good and what is valuable as does the efficiently run textile mill or factory, how much do the confines of movie formula prevent Nick's climax from going more interesting places?8.5/10 ? Great mood, let down by occasional Hollywood schmaltz and several cartoonish stereotypes. Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell doesn't act like Will Ferrell, that's what makes it work.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before you get all up in arms about this being a Will Ferrell movie, just stop right there. This is more along the lines of Stranger Than Fiction than Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby or Step Brothers. It's not zany, wacky or crazy in any way. It's a more subdued, lighthearted drama with some elements of comedy sprinkled throughout. It's highly enjoyable, funny and sad -- all at the same time.The movie opens with Nick Halsey (Ferrell) losing his job. Apparently, he got drunk at one of the companies outings and may have done some inappropriate stuff with a female co-worker. So, he does what any other red-blooded American man would do: he goes to a convenient store, buys himself some beer and drives home. To make matters worse, when he arrives home, he sees that all of his possessions are strewn across the front yard of the house, which he shares with his wife. There's a note pinned to the front door, his house key will no longer work in the lock and the spare that's hidden in the flower pot is no longer present. After unsuccessfully trying to break in, he calls his wife even though her note specifically tells him not to and leaves her message after message on her voicemail. With nothing left to lose, Nick proceeds to get drunker and drunker straight into the night. His neighbor, Elliott (Root) doesn't offer much help and Nick winds up sleeping in his lounge chair on the front lawn. In the morning, he is awakened by the lawn sprinklers and realizes that he is out of beer. After helping the new neighbor, Samantha (Hall) move in across the street, he hires the local neighborhood kid, Kenny (Wallace) to watch his stuff while he goes to the store to get some more beer. Long story short, just when you thought it couldn't possibly get any worse for Nick -- it does -- all of his credit cards are being declined, his cell gets shut off and his company takes back the company car, along with more of his belongings inside. With practically nothing but the items on the lawn and the clothes on his back -- it's here where Nick starts to completely lose himself, so bad in fact that the neighbors call the police and he begs for them to call Frank Garcia (Pe?a), his sponsor and luckily enough, detective on the local police force. His buddy Frank tries to help Nick by informing him that under state law, he can only have the stuff on the front lawn for 5 days as long as he's having a yard sale, so that buys him 3 days to pick himself up, dust himself off and figure out just what he's going to do next.Everything Must Go is a very good film. It's not overly dramatic and when the mood does turn somber, it has the sense to let go and make us smile or have a nice chuckle. It doesn't choke us with Nick's alcoholism -- we get it, he is an alcoholic and certainly does have a dependency for it, but it doesn't take it to the next level where we feel like we're watching a documentary on the evils of drinking. It also doesn't glorify it or make it look cool either. It's a very touchy subject for the film that I think gets handled very well.The movie gets by on the characters, the actors portraying them and the dialog. The story itself isn't all that great, it's quite simple, actually -- but the dialog the characters share is more than enough to keep the film going and keep you interested in how exactly Frank is going to get himself out of this mess. Frank makes two friends while out on the front lawn -- the pregnant woman across the street and the young boy who eventually winds up helping him with the yard sale. The friendships felt real, the conversations felt real, it's easily one of the best things about the film. No one will be getting any nominations from the Academy Award people, but they still do a great job nonetheless. I would have liked to seen more of Stephen Root and Michael Pe?a, though. I don't think their characters were utilized all that well, but I'm not overly upset about it either.More reviews at www.soveryterry.com Final Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A return to more serious fare for Will Ferrell.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm an unabashed fan of manic, childish, loud, comedic Will Ferrell, but I also tend to be fond of his infrequent more serious roles. In Everything Must Go, he delves back into the realm of dramedy (with the focus on the drama) as Nicholas, a man with a history of alcoholism that causes him to lose his job as the movie opens. Arriving home defeated with beer in tow, he finds his belongings strewn across the lawn, the locks changed, and his wife gone - as she's discovered some of his recent alcohol-fueled indiscretions. Events continue spiraling downward with the loss of his credit cards, car, and phone.&nbsp;With no real place to go, he settles down on his lawn for a "yard sale" (in which he initially plans to sell very little), which allows him to remain on the premises for a few more days. A new neighbor (an underused Rebecca Hall) with problems of her own may help Nicholas start over and begin rebuilding his life.&nbsp;This isn't a "feel good" movie by any means, despite the occasional quirky attempts at lightheartedness that are involved with the yard sale and the kid who helps him with it. Nicholas' relapse and problems are portrayed pretty realistically and bleakly. He's a flawed man and life kicks him around for the majority of the movie, but ultimately, it's his own fault.&nbsp;I usually eat this kind of thing up, but for some reason, Everything Must Go just didn't work for me. Ferrell's mostly understated, somber portrayal of Nicholas was fine, but I never felt any connection with him or any of the other characters. There just seemed to be something missing, and as the story went on, I couldn't muster more than a passing interest in it.&nbsp;Everything Must Go is by no means a bad movie, but I can already feel it fading from my mind. See it if you're interested, but I'd recommend Greenberg instead as a somewhat similar (and much better) recent indie-style movie about a man with problems that greatly effect his life and potential happiness.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie and Will Ferrell's persona and it was a 180 from his usual comedy's. This movie is a completely different take on his skills and performances and I am very, very impressed. The ambiance of this movie kind of reminds me of Bill Murray in the movie, "Lost In Translation" and Adam Sandler's movie, "Reign Over Me". All three actor's did a good job at something different and I like it when actor's do this and especially when it works well. The director's in all these movies are very good and is in my opinion half of the success of any movie. One of my favorite director's these days is Sofia Coppola who I think does a great job at instilling a deep sense of real-life into her movies. She deserves more recognition in her directing and this is not because of her last name, but her true skills in directing. Director Dan Rush did an excellent job with Ferrell's movie also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great blend of humor and drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a firm believer that comedic actors can pull off some of the most convincing dramatic roles, but they're rarely ever given the chance. Adam Sandler with "Punch Drunk Love", Jim Carrey with "The Truman Show", Robin Williams with "Good Will Hunting", and most recently with Will Ferrell in "Stranger Than Fiction". I'm glad to see that he's getting another go about it, because he has certainly earned it with me.Does something really dramatic happen in your life, something that changes your entire path, and then a couple of days later you see a movie that seems to capture everything you've been thinking about. Well for me, it's this movie. Given my current situation, this movie really struck a cord with me. Now i know i shouldn't be partial to a movie just because of my current status, so i did take a step back and observed the movie for what it really was, and yet i still found a pretty damn good picture.The storyline sets itself inside your head with great ease, and i think that's because you can identify with the main character really well. And i'm not just saying that because of my own personal account, but because Will Ferrell IS a comedic actor, and we have all laughed at him in the past. So seeing him in such dire straights kind of makes us feel for him, which in turn, makes the plot that much brighter.Now i know most people may walk into this thing expecting to see a laugh out loud comedy. You may find that, but it's more on the serious side with some deep and dark humor. Somewhat similar to what he already did in "Stranger Than Fiction", and once again, he does a great job of selling the character. But this movie does have the perfect dose of both the humor and drama, and it never gets caught up trying to do both at the same time.However, the one minor problem i did have with the film was the ending. It wasn't bad, but i was looking for a more epic finale'. I know i can't get that all the time, but this movie was pushing forward with such great momentum, and you just wanted this overwhelming sense of atonement by the end. Sure i got some of that, but i could have used a bit more.Bottom Line, i liked this movie a lot. If offers something different, yet something so very simple at the same time. It's both funny and dramatic, and for me, it gave me somewhat of a catharsis. Will Ferrell really has served up another one. I know it's early in the year, but so far, this is one of the best films i have seen in 2011.</fullReview>

It not that bad but I find it utterly pointless movie.Story of a man having a bad days, first he got fired from his job, then got thrown out of his house, his wife deactivate his bank account. All he has left is his old belonging that was thrown out into the front lawn. So like the name of the movie have already imply - it is about letting go of everything and start a new lifeThe story is nothing new, in fact it is so old it was too predictable. The sad part was it doesn't really get any better than what you had already seen. What I hate about it was it also very depressing and a very (too) typical Hollywood low budget Black Comedy Drama.I didn't quite enjoy the movie at all. The casting of Will might be the best move the director for this movie. Without Will this would have been straight to VDO store and maybe left there totally untouched.The good thing about this movie is ? I will likely don't remember I have even watched it in a week time. There really is nothing to hold on to this movie, no scene to think of, and no gimmick. It was flat from the start to the very end.Recommendation: I can't really recommend this to anyone. It was just flat.Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely absurd from the word go.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that Will Ferrell is one of those actors that can do a pretty solid job of mixing comedy with drama, and I like when he plays human characters. Unfortunately here he is stuck in a movie that pretends to be this grounded character drama about a broken man who's lost everything, while it's actually just an absurd story that doesn't fit into any real context and meanders along until it thankfully comes to it's disastrous end. The film has a setup that I just couldn't get into at all. Based on a short story by Raymond Carver, Ferrell's Nick Halsey gets fired in the opening scene and then goes home to find out that his wife put all of his things on the lawn and changed the locks on the door. Halsey constantly makes a point of mentioning that he owns the house, so why doesn't he just call the police and have them let him in? Seems pretty simple. Even more simple given that his wife just isn't there anymore; why would she bother changing the locks and throwing his things on the lawn if she was just leaving? So right off the bat I wasn't on good terms with this one.However, I can get past a rocky setup. Earlier this year, Hesher had a pitch that I didn't buy whatsoever, but it still managed to impress me with a strong character study and excellent performances. Everything Must Go, on the other hand, offers no redeeming qualities. After the ridiculous setup, we're loaded with scene after scene of painfully contrived moments that would just never happen. Rebecca Hall plays the clichéd stranger that randomly decides to become friends with the man who is living on his lawn drinking all day. Yeah, every pregnant woman does that. Christopher Jordan Wallace comes along as the young kid who needs a mentor and finds it in the creepy adult with no friends, one of the most idiotic clichés in film. There's a whole ten minute scene with Laura Dern's character that is of no consequence to the rest of the film, adds nothing to the character and is clearly there as filler to get the movie to a decent running time. It's just scene after scene of absurd moves that no one with half a brain could watch with any sense of genuine believability all led by a performance from Ferrell that couldn't have been more lazy and lifeless if he tried. A dreadful picture with absolutely nothing going for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A drama with moments of comedy, not a comedy with moments of drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One major problem with this film is that it was a drama that was heavily promoted and advertised as a comedy, especially by the exaggerating trailer. I think some people were disappointed when the film did not turn out to be like "Old School" or "Step Brothers", including myself, although I did generally enjoy this film. The genre for this film is primarily drama and it actually gets quite emotionally intense at times. One of the main components of this film is the alcoholism of Ferrell's character and the detrimental effects it has had on his life, costing him his job, marriage and home. The plot is kept quite basic but remains effective as the film simply depicts Ferrell living on his lawn trying to sell his stuff and struggling to get a grip of his life again, but with his drinking continuing to cause him greater difficulties. The film focuses on the developing relations between Ferrell and a few individuals who live close by, mainly bonding with a female living across the street, who he obviously had never bothered with formally. It also presses upon his disintegrated relationship with his wife and "friends" and former colleagues who seem to have rejected him.Therefore, it is a mixture of tragedy, soul-searching and feel-good events. There was some good acting in this film, which proved to be essential in a flick with such emotionally charged scenes, so the cast was a wise choice. Ferrell in particular, surprisingly shows his skills in performing dramatic scenes, with anger, sadness, desperation, etc which were actually quite impressive for a man so deeply associated with comical roles. The film flows well and with a well written script it works as a satisfying drama to watch and it was a good debut effort by the director. It's definitely worth watching, but personally it's the type of film I enjoy watching only once, and maybe again years/decades later as I'm not a big fan of dramas 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Serious Side of Will</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll readily admit, this is not my favorite genre. This movie was incredibly somber, which was especially depressing considering I was expecting a comedy. One of the quotes on the movie jacket said, "Sharply funny." Not that there were NO funny moments but not nearly enough to classify the entire movie as funny.Will Ferrell was good in this bleak film. I hadn't seen something quite like this since the 80's movie "Less Than Zero" with Robert Downey Jr. Ferrell played Nicholas, a lush that just lost his job and his wife due to his habit. The movie plays out on his front lawn with all of his belongings as his wife moved all his stuff outside and had all the locks changed."Everything Must Go" dives in to the dark and pitiful world of alcoholics. Even though this movie is about an alcoholic it could just as easily be about any addiction. There is not much by way of action or anything really. The movie follows the listless Nicholas as he forges some new bonds and tries to restore old ones all while in his front lawn. It's a slow moving sobering movie that is done quite well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Everything Must Go' will never be a commercial success. At best, it's going to be one of those films that will find its market several years from when it was first released.For a start, it has Will Ferrell as the leading man - an actor constantly linked with madcap, silly throwaway comedies. Secondly, and if you've seen the trailer you'll know what I mean, it's sold as a 'comedy.' It's not. It's a melodrama. And, possibly worse still, it's very sad.Will Ferrell plays Nick Halsey - an alcoholic who, on the same day, gets fired and finds out his wife is leaving him by returning home to find she has thrown all his possessions out onto the front lawn. And that's that really. There's not much of a plot/story to it. Another thing you should know is that the film doesn't really move from there - the whole ninety minutes is spent on Ferrell's front/rear lawn (and a lot of people seem to have critisised it for this).What little story there is, centres on themes rather than moving the script along. It deals with loss and hope. If you've ever been made redundant, you may well empathise with Ferrell who has to endure the feeling of being thrown on the scrapheap just when you really didn't need it. He accurately portrays a real sense of emptiness, confused hostility to people who, under normal circumstances, he wouldn't treat like that. Plus the hope that his wife may come back. He doesn't know what's what and is in the dark.If you're looking for a deeper (laugh-free!) movie, you may get something out of this. However, if you're expecting some sort of 'Anchorman II' laugh-a-minute flick, you may feel slightly cheated.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is categorized under "comedy" That made me think it would be a typical Will Ferrel movie, full of gags and overacted (I find him fun though) performances and bizarre characters. Instead, I found a very enjoyable drama. Nothing amazing, nor a hardcore drama but, it goes through nicely. With few but well portrayed characters including Ferrel doing a great job and the support cast was pretty good too even in their simple parts. Music was nice, mellow acoustic melodies that accompanies nicely shoot photography. Not too much going on, to be honest, just a man in trouble times and how he gets over it with the help of the people he meets in the way..Good acting, OK story, photography and writing. Worths the watch, but definitely not the comedy you'd expect from Ferrel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is primacy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made me think about the primacy of things that we deem so important, and relations that we often take for granted.Are we merely living to generate assets and maintain relations? Do we have the liberty to point at someone and say, "He is not normal!"? Are we living with compassion or do we get frustrated over little things? Do we have enough patience to listen to our loved ones? When everything is lost and we are left with nothing, is it really the end of it?Watch this movie and you may be able to answer these for yourself."Making friends is not always easy, but the ones that you have, make sure that you can trust them with your heart." "Maintaining relations requires revisions; so make the things straight as many times as it is required." "Understand the difference between giving up and letting go!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything Must Go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the DVD for this film when it was released, the leading actor made it obvious it was a film to made for laughter, and the title suggested to me a particular premise, but I didn't know anything about the plot, from the pretty positive reviews I read I was definitely going to watch it. Basically alcoholic Nick Halsey (Will Ferrell) had an unspecified drinking related incident happen in Denver, and due to this he is fired from his job as a salesman after sixteen years, after returning home he finds that the locks have been changed and his wife has left him, with a letter telling him not to contact her, and all his belongings are spread across the lawn. He spends the night on the lawn, he leaves to get some beer and food, and when he gets back his company car is being taken away, his credit cards have been cancelled, he is blocked from accessing the account he shares with his wife, and he has no phone service, police want him to vacate the premises, but his AA sponsor Detective Frank Garcia (Michael Pe?a) gets him a permit to have a yard sale. Nick has three days to sell as much of his stuff as possible before he must move, neighbourhood boy Kenny Loftus (Christopher Jordan Wallace, the son of The Notorious B.I.G. aka Biggie Smalls) offers to help him, and they make a deal where he will teach the boy to play baseball, but the first day is unsuccessful as Nick cannot bring himself to sell and let go of any of his personal items. He meets new neighbour Samantha (Rebecca Hall) and they become friends, and during their conversation he explains that he was sober for six months, but in Denver he attended a conference where he got drunk and blacked out while in the company of a female coworker, he has no memory of the night before after waking, but he knows he was fired as a complaint was lodged against him. With hardly any progress on the yard sale and feeling lonely Nick decides to seek what could have been his love interest from school, he finds his yearbook and notices a personal message from classmate Delilah (Laura Dern), he manages to track her down for a visit, but their reunion is awkward, before Nick leaves she hugs him and tells him deep down he is a good person. Broken and without alcohol he withdraws himself, Samantha offers him some support but in a low mood he responds with rude comments about her husband who also drinks, which makes her storm off angry and hurt, the next morning things look up a little however when Kenny has finished arranging his belongings with price tags, and that evening many things get sold, Nick and Samantha reconcile, she admits he was right about her husband. During a dinner Nick's supervisor visits and explains that the female employee he spent time has tried blackmailing other employees, he also says he could have given his job back if Nick hadn't slashed his car tyres, he is left a bottle of beer but does not give into temptation, Frank also visits and tells Nick his wife has been staying with him since she left him, also she is a recovering alcoholic. Frank and Nick have a fight, after Frank explains that his wife deserves to be with someone sober to have a better life, and he hands Nick the divorce papers his wife wants him to sign, and also some money and the key to the house, on the way home Nick wants to be dropped off, he walks past a convenience store selling beer, but he keeps walking, and in the end it is the following day, Nick gives away the rest of the items he did not sell, and shares a hug with Samantha. Also starring Rosalie Michaels as Kitty, Stephen Root as Elliot and Glenn Howerton as Gary. I can see the connection critics make to Leaving Las Vegas, with a man down on his luck drinking himself stupid, obviously this film is not as dramatic, Ferrell certainly isn't completely convincing as the hopeless drunk he is supposed to be, he is likable at least, the friendship between the man and the young man is interesting, the relationship between him and the neighbour is nice as well, there are definitely interesting scenes of vulnerability and human frailty, and yes it does make you laugh as well, a watchable comedy drama.

		<fullReview>There is Will Ferrell acting with utter conviction and there is a very common predicament facing us all. The question is how we would deal with this credible situation - one that is always in our shadow. Simply put, he loses his job and finds himself locked out of his own house all in one day and somehow has to find a way of recovering from this. This film is sad, poignant and life affirming and does it with a state of modern grace.Ferrell is superb, a euphoric revelation that makes you wonder where his true talent lies. Rebecca Hall also delivers a character with a fragile complexity that keeps you guessing. A really good film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the film reached it's conclusion I realized why people didn't generally like it... it's because people nowadays can't handle a tragedy. And because it features Will Ferrell in a serious role.The film isn't built to satisfy the average audience that craves action and one-dimmensionality... it's subtle and deep. It tells a meaningful story in a beautiful way, and always leaves you wondering as to what will happen next (the ultimate sign of good writing).I love this film. While it will never beat Stranger than Fiction (another serious Ferrell movie, as well as my second favorite movie of all time after Slumdog Millionaire), it's definitely a spectacle. If you're into deep subtle films where much doesn't happen physically, this film will interest you.8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything Must Go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel very blessed to have been on this lucky streak of good movies, and if Bridesmaids turns out to be as good as everyone is saying, then that will make six excellent movies in a row. Everything Must Go rounds out the fifth spot on the excellent movie streak, but it is in the number one spot of the best movies so far this year. Nick Halsey (Will Ferrell) was fired from his job due to his alcoholic tendencies. When Nick arrives home, he finds all of his possessions scattered amongst the front yard, all the locks on the doors changed, and a note from his wife who has left him. Now Nick must sell all his belongings and try to start a new life while living on his front lawn.Will Ferrell is one of the funniest men on the planet, and to see him break from that comic form and possess the soul of a man who is tired of his life is a very special thing. In the first half of the film you never see Ferrell's character without a beer in hand. If he is out he goes and buys some more. Nick is the type of man who works hard, and supports his wife, he is also a recovering alcoholic, but just can't make it through the day without being drunk. You root for the guy, you want him to do well, but he just doesn't have that motivation any more. Thats where Rebecca Hall and Christopher Jordan Wallace come in. Rebecca Hall plays Samantha, a pregnant women who has given up her dream of being a professional photographer to be a teacher, cause her husband got relocated for his job to Arizona. Except one thing, she moved before her husband, who stayed back in New York for some reason. The whole film you never see her husband or for that fact Nick's wife either. But you don't need to because that's not what drives the story. Ferrell and Hall have magical on screen chemistry, they don't play romantic interests, just neighbors who really need something special in their life's. Christopher Jordan Wallace, son of rapper The Notorious B.I.G. plays Kenny a smart, charismatic kid who befriends Nick in his time of need, and helps him pawn of all of his belongings. Wallace does a great job for a kid actor, he is very calm and worked well alongside Ferrell. Christopher Wallace also portrayed the younger version of his father in the film "Notorious". This is Dan Rush's first time writing and directing, but he does one hell of job. He tells a story that could easily have fallen flat. There was a moment when I thought the film was about to go in a cheesy direction, but with Ferrell's acting it made the scene truly emotional. This film is an hour and a half and its paced very slowly, but it is so worth your time. I give Everything Must Go a 9.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything Must Go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Raymond Carver did not write happy stories. Typically, his characters, usually middle-aged men, are beaten men and locked in a desperate melancholy as they wrestle with the existential questions: Where did I come from, how did I get here, and where am I going. The answer they find is that there is no answer. Bleak stuff. But that's not to say it is without humor?Carver will make you laugh out loud with the maudlin accuracy and randomness of his character's observations, and observe is mostly what they do, as they passively watch their world and relationships slowly and inevitably whither. It's a slow death?not much happens outside the interior worlds of the characters?and not the sort of thing that lends itself to cinema."Everything Must Go" is a retelling of the Carver story "Why Don't You Dance?" It's a small movie that takes a big risk?the risk that it will be able to tell such a quiet story without being dull and inconsequential. It's the story of Nicholas Halsey (Will Ferre, after receiving the bad news at work, to find the locks on the house changed and all "his" stuff tossed into the front yard of his upper middle-class suburban home. Apparently, Nick did his job well enough, but wasn't so good at staying sober. And that's how he ended up living in his front yard?with plenty of time on his hands to drink beer and confront the thing his life has become. But it's not legal to live on your front lawn, at least not in Acadia, Arizona, and, naturally, a nosy neighbor rats him out. Nick gets somewhat of a reprieve from a friend at the police department in the form of a five-day permit for a yard sale. He's not at all enthused about getting rid of all his stuff, but he really has no choice and is faced with a forced self-inventory of his life.Adapted for the screen and directed by newcomer Dan Rush, "Everything Must Go" finds the thin line between situational absurdity and realism (an essential element in almost all of Carver's work.), and treads it well. Seriously, living in your front yard? Borrowing a neighbor kid's bike to get around because you don't have a car? Blackmailing your neighbor into allowing you to run an extension cord to your front yard to power a cooler full of beer and a toaster oven? This stuff is absurd. This sounds a lot like a Will Ferrell movie. To say that Ferrell has more depth and is more capable of serious acting than he has been given credit for would be too easy. Yes, it's true, but it's so obviously true here that it would be little more than observing that it's raining hard when it's raining hard. What impresses most about Ferrell's performance is that, in spite of the fact the story is tailor made for the Will Ferrell that we know too well, he manages to find the line between comedy and pathos and maintains it consistently throughout. He plays Halsey as having an ironically wry wit and only half serious in much that he says?and knowing it. We aren't laughing at this Will Ferrell, we are quietly, and sympathetically, chuckling along with him. Until Ferrell does more roles like this it will be hard to watch him without waiting for him, at any moment, to wax Ron Burgundy. That is a bit of a distraction throughout the movie, but it's not Ferrell's fault?he's just so good at his other self that it's hard to take him at face value in this type of roll. Hmm, Will Ferrell playing a Raymond Carver character? who'd have thought it?Rush keeps his camera passive throughout with a lot of long takes and not many close-ups. It holds the audience away from the characters and allows them to exist in their own context?we don't identify with Nick so much as we empathize with him. In one particularly poignant scene Nick sets up a projector in the yard and watches home movies, drinking beer and staring at his father, who gestures rudely and waves the camera away while himself drinking beer?incidentally, the same brand Nick drinks. He does not stare passively. To Ferrell's credit, all but the shadow of an internal self-flagellation drains from Nick's face as he realizes that his father is in him. It, and the scene immediately following, are perhaps the essential scenes in the film and played so subtly as to be almost unnoticeable.Rebecca Hall puts in a nice turn as Samantha, Nick's just-moved-in across the street neighbor, whose life and marriage are in an uncertain transitional period, as well, and becomes a sympathetic shoulder for Nick. And it's always a treat to see Laura Dern, here playing a high school class mate of Nick's, pop up in the small and unassuming roles that she does so well. But the real stand-out supporting actor is Christopher Jordan Wallace. Most child actors, no matter how "good" they are hailed to be, aren't really very good. Wallace is an exception and we can expect to see a lot more of him. This is only his second role (His first was as an adolescent The Notorious B.I.G., his real life father.) and he is as comfortable and unhurried in front of the camera as if he had been doing this his whole life, easing into his lines so as to come off as an observant and thoughtful kid, without the precociousness that it seems all child roles must be imbued with. "Everything Must Go" is a good and film and speaks the truth, but it's not a happy movie. It doesn't even promise much chance of redemption. The best you can get out of Carver is a hint at the possibility of rebirth, the possibility that casting out everything is actually the first step toward something new.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had expected this to be yet another of those mass-produced comedies that Will Ferrell tends to spew out. However, I was more than pleasantly surprised when I sat down to watch "Everything Must Go" (aka "Neighbor For Sale").Why? Well, because it wasn't your average run-of-the-mill comedies that Will Ferrell usually put outs. This movie really put his acting talents to the test, and Will Ferrell rose to the occasion and delivered a great performance and made this movie turn out rather nice.The story is about Nick Halsey (played by Will Ferrell) who gets fired from his job, after a series of unfortunate events which mostly included alcohol, only to come home to find that his wife has thrown him out, put his stuff out on the front lawn, and changed all the locks to their home. Unable to come to terms with these events, Nick settles down in the front lawn, making the best of a bad situation. But as reality sinks in, Nick comes to realize that things must change, and he strikes up a partnership with a young boy in the neighborhood to look after his stuff while Nick tidies up loose ends in his life.Actually, the story told in this movie was rather interesting and quite captivating. What makes it work so nicely is the acting performances put on by the various actors and actresses throughout the movie, along with the colorful characters and good dialogue."Everything Must Go" is not an average comedy, as there isn't all that many laughs to be had in the movie, but this is more the likes of a comedy that sinks in and sticks with you, especially given the absurd storyline and the realism there is to it.I highly recommend that you watch "Everything Must Go", because Will Ferrell is nothing short of spectacular in this movie. And the story is entertaining and enjoyable.Thumbs way up for this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two terrific performances carry this everyman story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a touching, and beautiful character study on real people, with real problems. You can go anywhere - and you'll find someone who's faced an alcoholic - and the effects it has on their personality, their relationships, and ultimately their life. Now, ask three people about divorce - statistics show that over 50% of couples end in separation. Since you've covered two dramatic issues, go take a look at the unemployment rate - or even worse, about the people who've been laid off from their job because of the recession. Finally, imagine facing all three devastating predicaments, in one day. "Everything Must Go", is loosely adapted from the Raymond Carver story "Why Don't You Dance?"--a portrait of a man in collapse. After Nick (Will Farrell) is fired from his sales job, mostly because of his alcoholism, he comes home and finds that his wife has kicked him --and all of his stuff out of the house and onto the front lawn. She's also canceled their co-owned credit cards and pretty much set him adrift with nowhere, literally, to go. So he pulls up his La-Z-Boy, He cracks a perpetual 12-pack, and drops out of normal life entirely. Ferrell's work is impressive; there are comic moments scattered throughout the film, but he downplays them until they become moments of desperation. He slowly starts making friends with a neighborhood kid Kenny (Christopher Walace), who also does a fine job, who needs something to do. Two women enter Nick's new anti-life: a new neighbor pregnant Samantha (Rebecca Hall), awaiting the arrival of an absent husband, and an old high school classmate Delilah, played by Laura Dern. Eventually, Nick then finds himself eventually--ready to move on--and selling all his possessions to do so. This is all accomplished by first time writer/director Dan Rush. He shows us a simplistic story, harnesses it into his own, and produces a deeply moving motion picture. It never feels clichéd or forced--Rush lets his film transcend nicely by not creating plot points for sentiment or lines of dialect for pity. Sure, there's a transformation in Nick's character - but all of it is done with nuance and genuine compassion. "Everything Must Go" isn't a comedy, but it's not entirely a tragedy, either, It straddles this line with a deeply nuanced confidence. Unconventional, but heart-felt and nonetheless satisfying. "Everything Must Go" leaves on a somewhat melancholy note. We see Nick finally paying his dues,--respecting and giving back to those who've helped him through this dark time. The Band's "I Shall Be Released" starts playing in the background-- and the film morphs from engaging to moving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fantastic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this film was going to be another stupid , fantasy comedy created by the actor Will Ferrell who has been in such movies as Anchorman and Step-Brothers. And while they are humorous , there is no point to the movie and it is all very stupid. However this movie is so powerful and moving i was surprised that Will Ferrell could play in such an acting position. But Will Ferrell plays his part extremely well. With humorous moments this has to be one of my favourite films of the year. It is not stupid at all and is based on what could easily happen in real life. You get really involved in the film and it has everything you need , comedy , sadness, happiness, and person of any age can relate to it. All the other characters fit in so perfectly it feels like the movie could be real life . Simply fantastic</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first let me state that i never cared for will ferrell and his screw-ball style comedy. never found him funny! then i found this movie.it is listed as a comedy but it isn't! i think labeling this film a comedy does it a serious injustice. not that there is no humor in it, no, there are funny situations our lead actor finds himself in. but it's real nor made up. he is a man broken by his own self indulgence and fails to see it until his world collapses around him. but he will persevere! and in that perseverance is the character and charm of this movie.i gave it a chance even though ferrell is the lead actor! after reading other peoples reviews i had to see for myself and i am mighty glad i did. will ferrell shines in his performance and brings life and brilliance to this story.tragic - yes. hopeless - no. even though the story just stops (as there is no real ending) we know the story continues and the sorrows and pleasures of life will continue for him. he has crossed a barrier (yard sale) and he sees everything continues, he isn't lost. down but not out.watch this movie. then think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must watch by all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I came across this movie one day on IMDb and I thought about watching it. I must be honest about one thing from the start, that sometimes the movies that Will Ferrell does are just absolutely crazy and I understand that a lot of people enjoy that kind of humor, but sometimes its just too much for me. That's why at first when I started to watch this movie I was a little bit skeptical. I was totally mistaken...This is am awesome movie to watch. It is one of his better acts, I mean even better than Stranger Than Fiction (which was simply an movie movie, where the plot and the level of acting were both phenomenal). The movie starts off very well, and starts to something that could really have to most working professionals in their careers. This is the aspect that really interested me in the movie. Next once Ferrell's character when he gets home and what has happened is what really kick starts the movie.The movie has all the aspects such as comedy, drama, seriousness and many more such things. It is a must watch and I promise a person would walk away very happy from this movie. It is a MUST watch! I gave the movie an 8 since it still lacks a lot of parts that require a higher rating...but in the world of movies for an average watcher it should be 9.5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Its getting harder and harder to find good movies based on IMDb ratings, after seeing blockbusters. Perhaps searching for comedies/drama having around 6.5 is good strategy.This film is great in its story and simplicity. It might not say lot to a teenager, that sees life with optimism of not experiencing it, and it might seems boring for actions seekers. For me it was rather realistic and optimistic at same time, combination hard to find in movies, and what makes them great. Life is change, so live it and change, and if you stick with your comfort zone change will come all over you. But in the end, you are alive.Directing is good to excellent, especially by being able to convey same message to all actors and crew. Therefore acting is good also, even if Farel is not best actor.Overall enjoyable and to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing is for sure. This will not please anyone expecting the usual Will Ferrell vehicle. This is not your typical movie he normally stars in and plays sort of a fool. While I wouldn't call him super intelligent (his character that is), this is far off from the laugh out loud comedies his other characters are in.Actually this is a very good performance by Will Ferrell, that shows his acting abilities. Not that people will suddenly want to see him in more serious roles, but he could do it. So just be warned, before you watch it and you might be fine watching it. The central relationship (Ferrels character and kid) is what will draw you to the movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell in a slightly darker role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After years on "Saturday Night Live" and numerous comedic roles, Will Ferrell takes a more serious, almost dark role as a man who loses his wife and job, and then finds himself locked out of his house with his credit cards canceled, and so he simply decides to live on his lawn. This experience gives him sort of new start to his life.I've liked that Ferrell has taken on these different kinds of roles. He's shown himself to be a very competent actor, and "Everything Must Go" affirms that, as his character seeks to come up with a new role for himself in a world that has seemingly turned against him. I recommend it. Also starring Rebecca Hall, Michael Pe?a and Laura Dern.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A touching film that connects with some, but not all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel like this film gets some undeserved disdain from many viewers. Perhaps people just figured, hey, Will Ferrell is in it, so it will be hilarious. Perhaps others who knew more about the film before seeing it felt that since it was Will Ferrell in a serious roll, it needs to be a stunning drama to make them take notice. And perhaps others felt that it simply didn't entertain them as a film should. Thankfully, I saw this pop up on my Netflix and hadn't heard much about it outside of a friend saying that it was an OK film, and after the first few minutes, I was taken for a wonderful cathartic journey.I don't want to discuss the plot, as I think this film is best seen if you don't have any preconceived notions of what it is, or what the trailer is trying to express it as. Also, this is not a popcorn flick. It's a film best watched when you're in the mood for something quiet and relaxing like reading a book. I know, sounds lame right? But to me, it was brilliant. It doesn't push the boundaries of film, but rather, it's just a great ride.This is a film that doesn't try to push any boundaries or do something you haven't seen before. Instead, it just tells a story, and does so in a way that sets a wonderful and consistent mood. The humor isn't slapstick, but rather situational, and the character interactions are all so much more realistic than what you see in film today. There are no poignant lines, iconic scenes, or larger than life characters that we look up to. Instead, it's a story that could be told about all of us. How we all have weaknesses, but also how we shouldn't let those weaknesses define who we really are.I know this review is so vague that you're probably thinking, "Wow, this sounds like a Lifetime drama...", but just give it a chance. Watch the first 10 minutes without any expectations (if you can) and then if you don't like it, turn it off. That said, I'll bet a lot of you stay until the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Farrel &amp; Christopher Wallace makes a treat to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything must Go ? CATCH IT (B) Everything Must Go is very interesting story about a alcoholic man who has lost everything from his wife, job and life. He is standing on verge of destruction. His wife kicks him out and leaves all his things out in open loan. Now he has five days to turn his life around. Will Farrell is great as alcoholic man, trying to figure out the aftermaths of his actions. Christopher Wallace, the sweet black kid is superb. Will Farrell and his moments are most interesting ones in the movie. Rebecca Hall is refreshing, though I still don't see her ever be a star. She is always there but never memorable. Laura Dern is nice. On the whole, it's a good movie but ending is disappointing because it doesn't give any pathway for him. In the end you realize it stood on the same level and ended without giving any solution for his life. But anyway still I had good time watching it, it's a feel good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferrell proves his complexity again in this sincere, amusing story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If more folks could see "Everything Must Go," there'd be a different perception of Will Ferrell. That's not to say he gives a powerhouse performance as an alcoholic on the down and out, but he's believable, sympathetic and he's not trying too hard to be funny. Dan Rush's film doesn't try too hard either despite Ferrell's presence. The humor is muted and subtle. Rush prefers to focus on capturing what it's like when a troubled person's life can't get any worse.Despite being excellent at his job, Nick Halsey gets laid off in good part due to past drinking problems. When he returns to his Arizona home, he finds his things strewn all over the lawn and that his wife has changed the locks and codes on him. That'll drive anyone to the sauce, let alone a recovering alcoholic. Nick stockpiles Pabst Blue Ribbon and goes to live amongst his things on his front lawn.Nick gets attached to his stuff, refusing to sell it even though the only way he can remain on his lawn for six days is to have an official yard sale. His setup attracts the attention of a young boy named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) whose mom is taking care of a sick person down the street as well as his new neighbor, Samantha (Rebecca Hall), whose pregnant with a husband who constantly travels.The script gives us no real sense of Nick's wife, job or any of his previous attachments, so we don't really empathize with him being caught between the things he has loved in the recent past and the opportunities appearing before him for a better future. We're ready for him to move on too quickly, so it's left to Ferrell to convince us of this predicament.Ferrell's performance appropriately matches the tone Rush has given the film: laid back, reflective and subtly amusing. Nick is kind of a lazy drunk, not a belligerent one, the kind of guy who simply craves a beer at all times. The Hollywood treatment for alcoholics would've felt unnatural, yet you almost crave it so that you feel more strongly about his problem. All the intensity is saved for one pivotal scene that serves to deliver the film's message. It's effective, but things spiral a bit from there.Once Nick finally starts to sell things, the script throws a final test at his character to see if he's learned anything, and that's where a few big reveals come in and twist the tone of the film. It goes from pleasant, upfront and truthful to oddly manipulative and it ruins the sense of resolution. Ferrell remains the constant through that final act storm and he deserves that recognition.If you've read this far you know this isn't a typical Will Ferrell part, but it highlights the strengths that anyone who didn't see "Strange Than Fiction" never knew he had. Nick is not the easiest character to love or understand, but Ferrell cues us in to what's going on in his mind the best he can.Even with some mistakes, "Everything Must Go" tells an honest story about personal tragedy and how we cope with the moments that bring our dignity to an all-time low.~Steven CThanks for reading!

		<fullReview>If you ever wanted to see Will Ferrell reprise his role as Mugato then this is the movie for you! ...Nah, just kidding. This is the most straight role I've seen WF in, but it was still funny, kind of in the same way as those short youtube videos he did with the little girl playing the landlord, except way more dry. My only complaint is that it would have been fun to see more Glenn Howerton, who had a couple great scenes, and for all the artistic merit the anticlimactic ending may have had it would have been way more satisfying- -from an entertainment perspective--to see an ultimate redemption; I'm a closet escapist and yes I know it's what makes movies soulless but it also makes them rewatchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything was not great, but some things were, most notably Ferrell's excellent performance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I embark to write my film review on the Will Ferrell starring drama (yes, drama) "Everything Must Go", I am hopeful that you will tolerate it after reading it, and not think that "everything must go". But I do warn you that most everything must show puns for me, so you have been warned. Anyways, "Everything Must Go" is an intended drama with a few comedic moments starring Ferrell as Nick Halsey, an Arizonian alcoholic who lives in front of his lawn with all his personal belongings; due to the fact that his exasperated wife cannot tolerate the Nick no more so she placed all his belongings on the lawn and also changed all the locks to their home. Nick is not too happy upon seeing all his belongings on his lawn, so in his best Clint Eastwood impression with a shotgun, he angrily says "get off my lawn" to his stuff. OK, that didn't happen. And also, back to reality. To add fuel to the fire, Nick also gets the ax in his employment where he served as vice president. He then gets in alcoholic slacker mode and sits in a reclining chair on his lawn making Dennis Hopper's villainous character in "Blue Velvet" proud by having a plethora of Pabst Blue Ribbon beers on a daily basis. Nick's detective friend Frank Garcia informs Nick that he must vacate the lawn premises immediately unless his lawn experience is for the intention of a yard sale. That is when Kenny, an African-American boy, gets in the picture. Nick befriends Kenny and the young boy starts to work for Nick by helping to sell some of Nick's stuff in the yard sale. At first Nick is hesitant that "everything must go" but then? well I don't want to give it away because I don't want you to think that I am revealing everything that must go for you to know what happens in the movie. Nick also befriends a pretty female pregnant neighbor called Samantha, that makes a big impact on Nick's life and visa-versa; even though they have an "on and off" friendly relationship. First time Writer-Director Dan Rush was maybe in a bit of a rush to direct the picture by not revealing more information on the characters of the picture. I wanted more on their past (especially Nick) to see what led them to their present situations. And I also felt that there should have been more of an emphasis on Nick's alcoholic rehab process; alcoholics don't instantly get sober from one moment to another. Now I must commend Rush for an authentic screenplay, and I loved the fact that Nick's wife was never seen in the movie. Ferrell was fantastic as Nick; once again proving that he has acting chops in the dramatic landscape as in the comedic one. Like a good neighbor, Rebecca Hall was there with a fine performance as Samantha. And Notorious B.I.G. son's Christopher Jordan Wallace turned out a non-showy but effectively subtle performance as young Kenny. There were a few things of "Everything Must Go" that could have been better and caused a lawn I mean a yawn from time to time; but mostly due to Ferrell's strong work, I say that you should (not must) go see this movie. *** Average</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid and quite interesting drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess that many people will feel confused or disappointed after watching Everything Must Go, because the mere presence of Will Ferrell in the leading role suggests the fact that the film is a comedy. That is incorrect. In fact, Everything Must Go is a serious drama, and those who can put up with that, will find a precisely written and very interesting film.The tone from Everything Must Go is increasingly somber as the film goes by, so I wasn't sure during the second half if the film was going to compensate us with a happy ending. But anyway...the ending is not very important in these independent dramas, but the texture of the narrative, the performances and the realism of the emotions. And I think that the film succeeds in those three elements. The complaints I have against Everything Must Go is that some details feel forced, while a few moments feel a bit dull.And, what about Ferrell? Was his incursion into a dramatic material good? It can be said that he had already gotten close to this territory in the films Melinda and Melinda and Stranger Than Fiction, but Everything Must Go represents his first leading serious role, and I think he did a pretty good job. Besides, he is well endorsed by the solid performances from Rebecca Hall, Laura Dern, Christopher Jordan Wallace and the great Michael Pe?a. So, in conclusion, I liked Everything Must Go pretty much despite not being an excellent film, and I think I can recommend it because of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything Must Go is a very good directorial debut and an OH-MY-GOD good performance from Will Ferrell here he is not just going his usual (though usually fun) man-child-adolescent shtick. Like Stranger Than Fiction, here's a full flesh-and-blood character, and in fact I may prefer this in performance and film to STF. This is an intense drama that has one or two moments of comedy - one of which with Stephen Root kinda comes out of nowhere and, while funny, is just bizarre and a little out of place - and it fits in very well with this year's better independent cinema. It's low-key, tragic, and lead by an actor who shows he's perhaps *more* fearless in drama than he is in comedy. Only major downside in the story is that it all of a sudden goes from no real sales going on on that lawn to a whole boom in one day, so it rushes an arc that didn't need to be rushed like that, especially as it comes after a particularly intense scene. But it really goes to some unexpected places for what the protagonist goes through, and the filmmaker doesn't shy away from taking him where he needs to go (also inspired by Raymond Carver's short story, which, as one might remember from 'Short Cuts', is the kind of writer that gives generously to stories of people in eccentric disarray). If you're expecting something goofy from the trailer, you've been fooled once again. If you go in taking in that image as being as catastrophic as it might seem - clothes all across the road, a man looking lost, almost in his own self-made apocalypse - then you'll get something rewarding. Certainly for those who want to see Ferrell stretch his arms it's one of the pleasantries of the year; maybe not 'Oscar' worthy, but certainly for one of those Independent Spirit Awards for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartfelt and feel good film about one's discovery of life, friendship, and finding emotions when losing it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Ferrell who's one of the best funny men working in the business today takes a role that's offbeat and uncommon here, yet his choice turns out for a good entertaining and emotional film of discovery. It proves one can relate and find themselves thru emotions and bond with love and friendship from others. True laughs are found during this picture still it's more of an emotional discovery that most viewers will enjoy.Certainly it will relate with the current times of the economic recession and downturn of society. It finds Will Ferrell as Nick a company corporate salesman who's just lost it all aside from his wife leaving, he is then slapped in the face with being cut from his job a layoff in the job market recession I guess. Also Nick has his own personal demons of alcoholism as when returning to his Arizona home his lawn is littered already with his scattered belongings, the only medicine that he can use to deal with living permanent on his front yard is to buy beer.This gives Nick time to reflect and remember the old times from listening to old records and looking at old classic Playboy magazines. Aside from being with old material things he obtains the time of a boy from the community as they do baseball throw and catch and touching is his meeting of a new neighbor a pregnant lady named Samantha(Rebecca Hall). And to pass time before his money making yard sale, Nick makes a journey to see an old classmate(Laura Dern)who remembers that Nick was a good guy.During his time to reflect it touches Nick to see himself as a good guy as others have shown him, proving time with others brings out emotions of joy and love. Proving that material things don't make one happy as starting over and from scratch one becomes more loved and a happier person. Really a good film of reflection proving that when life falls apart if emotions are shared and new friendships made a new life can start for one. True it's not typical Ferrell yet the film's shared bonding emotional touch makes it a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than what I expected; very pleasantly surprised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read the storyline I laughed aloud at the great concept and couldn't wait to watch what I thought would be a funny, and perhaps serious/ dark comedy. What I received instead was a very realistic portrayal of a functional alcoholics life. Divorce and termination from employment are two of the most devastating losses a person could ever experience. The movie begins in reflection of the downward spiral that ultimately causes Nick, the main character, to lose both his wife and his job simultaneously. What I love about this movie is how neighbors, for whom Nick has never met, befriend him and come to his rescue. It also helps that an old friend reminds him of his good nature and good heart. All this helps Nick regain his confidence and self respect. The movie does a great job of demonstrating how important it is that a person who suffers from addiction continues to communicate and open up with people rather than shut everyone out and hide. This is an addiction flick that starts on a negative, gives you a few real good laughs throughout and ends very upbeat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironic Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Ferrell has a very cozy place within the suburban middle-class. His characters are born into it so they know the ropes. In Everything Must Go this place is challenged with megaton brutality when in the same day he is fired from his job (due to irresponsible drinking), and simultaneously his ex-wife has won possession of the house, removing his possessions to the lawn and leaving for a holiday. What he knows enough to avoid is going with the flow of events--which would carry him to transient housing and on into obscurity. Instead, what he does is coincident with a simpler practicality. He stands guard over his material possessions which are now out in public. In this way he begins living on the lawn while conducting a lawn sale 24/7. This serves not only to sell his goods but perhaps more important an excuse for the police to tolerate his continued presence in the neighborhood. As a taxpayer and former neighbor, he prevails with the police to give him temporary reprieve to conduct his yard sale. None of the neighbors object. He has made himself into a Happening in the neighborhood.On the business side of his new life, he has made a street deal with a young boy who happens to be interested in everyone else's business, to supervise the sale. This frees him up to become involved with his neighbors.Crucial to the outcome is Ferrell's certain knowledge that it is not what you know but who you marry. Whether as a brother, a husband or just a neighbor he has instant acceptability. His casual suburban attitude carries him along to new love and the answer to his financial woes. All without leaving his lawn. This is a low-key type of humor dealing with a potentially unfunny subject. The message is not to validate calamity. Maintains humor and entertainment value throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a comedy, but lots of funny moments in a serious Will Ferrell role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Everything Must Go". We know from the movie's trailer that the main character ends up with all his possessions on the lawn of his home. The title has a meaning in one respect, once he decides to get rid of things in a "yard sale." But it has another, more insightful, meaning. He is stuck in a bad rut in life, and his only hope to get out of it is to shed all personal baggage, all those bad old habits have to go.I will admit I am not a big Will Ferrell fan, I find much of his humor to be unfunny. But here I like him, as marketing VP Nick Halsey. But Nick has a very bad day to start the movie. He is called in to be informed that he is being fired, and when he gets home he finds his wife has put all his stuff on the front lawn, has frozen their accounts, has changed the locks, and won't answer the door. In fact, she may not even be home.Nick has a basically good heart, but he is an alcoholic. His has been involved with AA, but occasionally falls off the wagon, very hard. He doesn't even remember what happened that night one of the female employees accused him of something bad.Nick forms an unlikely friendship with a young boy riding around the neighborhood. Teaches him the art of selling and customer satisfaction and he and Nick eventually sell all his stuff.Not what I expected, but a pretty good movie. Not great, but pretty good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a flop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I went into this movie blindly expecting comedy, of course because of Will Ferrell. Luckily it was a cheap buy, with no case. So I assumed the best.In the beginning of the movie you see Nick (Ferrell), in his car, lamenting, staring at a gold gift box. We find out quickly that Ferrell's character is an alcoholic, who just lost his job. He arrives home after buying a large quantity of beer, to find all of his belongings in the front yard of his house. With his wife gone, and him locked out of the house he proceeds to try to sort out his belongings and eventually is living on his front yard. When the neighbor kid Kenny agrees to watch Nick's belongings, he comes back to find his car being repossessed, after just a day, when he was told he could use it for a month.All of this happens in the span of 15 minutes into the movie. Afterwards, it simply crawls along, inserting desperate scenes to keep your attention. In the end, all of the belongings are sold, and you only ever here Nick's wife's voice in two lines. You don't even see the spouse. The movie ends with Nick getting a key two his house, everything sold, and no idea what the wife is up to.Whats wrong here, is you don't even get a build up to the main plot. You don't see the happenings in Nick's job that gets him fired. You never see the wife throwing out his belongings, or the rocky relationship that was... Heck, you never even see "her"! Not to mention, 80% of the movie is in the front yard. And in the end, there's no happy ending, no moving on for Nick, just him and an empty house. And you left hanging. Boring, &amp; low budget. Wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will Ferrel plays a dramatic part; he's not trying to be funny. After watching this, perhaps it wasn't such a good idea. He plays Nick, an alcoholic that just got fired and returned home to find out his wife left him the same day. How much bad luck can one guy have? So, he spends the rest of the movie sitting in a chair in his front yard. You see, his wife threw all his things on the front lawn before locking him out and disappearing. A neighborhood kid, Kenny, helps him with a yard sale and basically be his friend. Nick also makes acquaintance with the new neighbor, whose husband still has not moved. Then Nick gets more bad news from his AA sponsor, which really, really sucks, plus he learns he could have sued his employer for wrongful termination, but he screwed that up too.FINAL VERDICT: A movie about a depressing guy, not worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great performance, I just wish that saved the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams and Jim Carrey are two perfect examples of actors with variety. Actors who are willing to try something new. Williams did it with Dead Poets society, and Carrey did it with The Truman Show, two excellent films. There are other examples, but recently Will Ferrell has gone into that territory, and done very well.Ferrell has had good times(Anchorman) and bad(Land of the Lost), but people under estimate him as an actor. A lot of people probably didn't see Stranger than Fiction. Well, I did, and it was awesome, and until Ferrell's latest, Everything must go, it was his best performance.Ferrell plays a guy who is having the worst three days of his life. He's recently been let go from his job, his wife left him, threw all of his stuff out, changed the locks, his car has been taken back, with items in it, and he has to live outside of his house. But he has to move everything off of the property, including himself, in three days, otherwise he goes to jail.Ferrell's performance is absolutely terrific, and I would say that he should get an Oscar nod. But one great performance can't support a movie, especially one that is so down in the dumps you don't know whether to kill yourself or just turn it off.I don't leave or stop watching movies. I just don't. And Everything must go isn't that bad that you have to turn it off. It's just so depressing. From start to finish, and it never really redeems itself either. It just sits there, depressing you for an hour and a half.Even the moments that are supposed to be happy end up turning out, well, not very well. And the whole time you feel depressed, until the twist, which makes the film pointless. I just found the film to be a big disappointment in the conclusion.So, in short, I didn't like the film. But Ferrell deserves all of the credit. Without him, Everything must go could've been a disaster. I know a lot of critics liked it and that everybody will disagree with me, but its my opinion and i'm sticking by it. Overall: Great performance, bad movie.C+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie was depressing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when critics call this movie a comedy there being more than generous, they're flat out lying. this movie was terrible, my aunt and i rented this expecting a comedy but it was far from it. Even the previews give you a different feel, i assumed it would be a guy trying to get back on his feet in the hilarious awkward way will ferrel does things, but he mostly sat around and got wasted. Also the whole movie is depressing and you expect it to get better somewhat near the end...nope it just continually got worse and worse until they decided to roll the credits. in my opinion movies are supposed to take you away from reality not show you the very worst side of it. anyways i don't suggest seeing this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Everything Must Go" is a comedy - drama movie which shows us a man who after being fired from his job due to his alcoholic relapses and losing his wife, trying to start over. A new neighbor looks like the key to help him go on with his life.I believe that Will Ferrell makes one of his best not to tell the best interpretation of his life. I really liked it because makes it truly understandable for everyone how he feels about all of these, his agony and depression.Finally I have to say that "Everything Must Go" is a really worth seeing movie and I strongly recommend it because as I said before it combines drama with comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Will Ferrell solid actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Halsey (Will Ferrell) loses his job of 16 years for drunkenness. His wife has locked him out and thrown all his stuff onto the front lawn. He befriends his new pregnant neighbor Samantha (Rebecca Hall). His cop friend Frank Garcia (Michael Pe?a) tells him to at least pretend to have a yard sale. There is the kid Kenny Loftus who Nick starts paying to watch his stuff.This is a small indie from newcomer writer/director Dan Rush. All in all, this is simply about Will Ferrell and whether he can pull off this quieter darker character. He's not yelling at everything and he does a good job. He is compelling and drives this movie all the way. It is a little bit jarring to see Will playing against type at first. Once I adjusted, he shows his solid acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had never heard or seen this. Just started watching the movie and so far I cannot see why many put this film down. I am finding the storyline relative to so many married couples and understanding. I appreciate the characters and actors involved. Michael Pena, Rebecca Hall and Christopher Wallace - to name a few - offer a sensible balance. I do adore Will Ferrell. Seeing him in this, I have no doubt about Will's acting abilities. Well done. Just cannot believe this film passed me by when it came out. I encourage the negative reviewers to not expect Ferrell to burst into a SNL skit and see it for what the film is about. Watching Will Ferrell camping out on his lawn after his wife up and kicks him out, sitting in his man chair, feasting on Chinese take-out, drinking Pabst New Ribbon, going to get jerky from the mini-mart is just all so priceless to see. Anyone who has been uprooted from their everyday life can sympathize in processing the shake up. To know how much of Ferrell's character is troubled is truly sad. He had a job, a wife, ...a life and it all came to a halt, even his bank account. Having the desire to sell what he can is truly recognizable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Will Ferrell so much in STRANGER THAN FICTION, which had one of the most interesting screenplays ever AND a very sweet and convincing love story at its core, so I thought I'd give this one a try. I also like Rebecca Hall, having "discovered" her in STARTER FOR 10. This movie was only so-so, but the performances were all good. The yard sale stuff was fun for anyone who likes antique malls and garage sales as was his tutelage of the young boy who helps him price and sell things. My question is about the ending--I didn't understand what Hall's character gave Ferrell and what the significance was. Can anyone enlighten me?

		<fullReview>With out a doubt one of the hardest movies to watch. I fell asleep watching it last night and had to watch it again today. I was missing something, there was like the movie was stuck in 1st gear. It was slow, predictable and the director wanted the viewer to come up with his or her own conclusion on life and what it is suppose to mean for the every day person. That can work but it needs something to help it along and sorry to say this movie did not have this. The kid played a great part but Will Farrell was the wrong choice for the lead. He did a good job but just did not fit. I think Bill Murray would have been perfect. Don't get me wrong Will was OK but unfortunately he has stereotyped himself for me when you think of step brothers and anchorman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ferrell Makes a Great Dramatic Actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything Must Go (2010) *** (out of 4) Will Ferrell turns in the best performance of his career as Nick Halsey, an alcoholic who is fired from his job only to then come home and realize that his wife has left him and changed the locks to the door. Not only that but she's also placed all of his belongings out on the lawn, which is where Nick ends up staying for the next couple days. In those days he strikes up a friendship with a neighborhood kid (Christopher Jordan Wallace) and the pregnant woman (Rebecca Hall) who lives across the street. EVERYTHING MUST GO is a rather strange film that was sold as some sort of comedy and while there are some funny moments there's no doubt that this is a pretty serious drama that takes a look at alcoholism. The good portion of the running time has Ferrell sitting in a chair on his lawn constantly kicking back beers and trying to determine what has gone wrong with his life. I think the screenplay by Dan Rush, who also directed, does a great job at telling us everything we need to know about Nick in just the first few minutes of the picture. I think anyone who has ever been in a desperate situation even if it didn't involve alcohol will be able to connect with Nick because we've all been on hard times and reached a point in our life where we must try to determine the best place to go. I thought the screenplay was very smart that it didn't rush into anything conventional and even better was the fact that the story never gets sappy nor does it try to preach. Of course, it doesn't hurt that we get such memorable characters and performances. Ferrell will always be loved for his comedies but it's just more proof that some comic actors out there make much better dramatic ones. I've always been rather hit and miss on Ferrell but there's no question that he has a talent for drama and I really hope this movie opens up more pictures for him going forward. He was incredibly convincing in his part and you could just feel his desperation simply by looking into his eyes. I thought the laid back nature in the performance was a major plus and I liked how he didn't go for laugh out loud humor and instead just let the comedy come natural. It also doesn't hurt that he works perfectly well with the supporting cast and especially Hall. The two actors are so good together that you almost wish they had more time together. Hall's character isn't given a great deal to do but she's certainly very memorable in the role. The same is true for Laura Dern who appears in a quick bit but she too leaves an impact. Even Michael Pena is memorable in his role. Christopher Jordan Wallace works very well with Ferrell as the two have a nice chemistry that carries their scenes. At times the movie lags a bit but these moments are few and far between. EVERYTHING MUST GO certainly isn't going to appeal to everyone but it shows that Ferrell has a great talent for drama and hopefully we'll see more of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was totally baffling. And, it's very, very hard to rate this film or even review it. Oddly, I liked it...and I am not even sure why. Yes, it's THAT unusual a film! But it's one you just need to see for yourself.The film begins with Will Ferrell losing his job. It seems he got drunk and made a total jerk out of himself. When he goes home, he finds all his possessions out on the lawn and new locks on the doors. His wife has left him and frozen his bank accounts. And, since he's an alcoholic, he just sits out on his lawn and begins drinking....and where it all goes from there is just plain weird.This is NOT a comedy. Ferrell delivers a strange deadpan performance that just needs to be seen to be believed. He is assisted by some nice supporting performances (particularly by a neighborhood kid who befriends him). I liked it...kind of...but I am warning you right now, if you need a film with a clear narrative or direction, then look further. This film is performance art...very, very strange performance art. Most, I think will just think "...I paid a lot of money to see THAT!!!???". Yes, it's that odd.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nick Halsey (Ferrell) loses his job because of his alcoholism. His wife has left him and had the locks to the house changed so he can't get in, and then she threw his belongings out on the front lawn. There is only one thing to do: hold a yard sale and reluctantly he does just that. I must have my head examined to be actually contemplating another Will Ferrell movie (Ah, but you did like him in Stranger Than Fiction, right?) Yes, yes I did, but in nothing else. The man isn't funny. He just has good PR and one heck of a support-in-crowd. Stranger Than Fiction was NOT his usual goofy comedic attempt at comedy. It was more of a lite-drama. Very good. Okay, Show Time: Hey, this is a very good story, not a comedy although some may find some stuff not intended to be funny to be funny as there is no accounting for peoples' taste in comedy. Everything is well acted, no goofiness or over-the-top slap-stick (well done like in Stranger than Fiction, right?) Yes, like that. I think Robin Williams must have gotten to Ferrell and told him to do some drama as it will extend his playing time. Whatever the case, it worked. Will Ferrell is a good dramatic actor and I'm thinking we will see more of this side of him. Of course, he will continue to do the goofy, silly and stupid movies, but don't watch them. This is slow moving, but you find yourself caring for Nick and he seems to be handling things pretty good???..so far??? but, we are wary that he might go off the deep end in time. You know, the calm before the storm kind of thing. So we watch with our fingers crossed. Hey, we have questions: Will Nick be okay? Will the wife come back? Will he sell everything on the lawn? Will he be hit with divorce papers? Will he ever get into the house? Will we ever see the wife? There is a slight twist in here and it explains many things. The supporting cast was simply great and a good reason everything worked so well. Looking back on everything, I'd say it was pretty good. Violence: No. Sex: Yes, when Nick looks into the neighbor's window. Nudity: No. Language: Yes,</fullReview>

They should have called this 'Alcoholic has Garage Sale and Camps Out'.And please, when an alchie runs out of booze, your telling me he's NOT going to break into his house, a house that is half his? And when your now ex-wife forges your signature and locks you out of 45k in your bank account, your not going to go BALLISTIC and show them right then and there his signature was forged?This movie is cringe-worthy, horrible.

		<shortDescription>A mediocre film lacking the key ingredients to make it memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always considered Will Ferrell's work to be somewhat of a guilty pleasure. Complaints of his comedy being stupid, childish and ridiculously over the top are completely justified, but most of it has still been relatively entertaining. His cameos are usually a bit stronger since they're right to the point and aren't force-fed to you like some of his leading roles, but films like Old School and Anchorman will always hold a special place in my heart for the kid in me that loves that nonsensical form of comedy. The few times Ferrell has ventured off into more serious territory have been pleasantly surprising. Stranger Than Fiction is probably the best example. While Ferrell's performance in the Marc Forster directed comedic drama was one of his best and the film had moments of brilliance, but it wasn't quite able to push itself into exceptionally memorable territory. Unfortunately, Everything Must Go is along the same lines.Nick Halsey (Ferrell) is having the worst day anyone could possibly have. He loses his well-paying job of 16 years and falls off the wagon after being sober for six months. Upon returning home, he finds all of the locks and gate codes changed, a letter from his wife telling him that it's over, and all of his belongings sitting on the front lawn. If that wasn't bad enough, Nick's credit cards no longer work and he's blocked from using his joint bank account. He becomes overly possessive of, "his stuff," and has no plans of ever leaving his front lawn. Detective Frank Garcia (Michael Pe?a), who is also Nick's AA sponsor, eventually steps in and informs Nick that a yard sale could buy him a few days before he'd eventually have to take Nick to jail. With the help of a neighborhood kid named Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace) whose mom is never around and a pregnant woman who just moved across the street named Samantha (Rebecca Hall), Nick eventually learns the meaning of letting go and moving on with his life.There's a good film lying within the inner depths of Everything Must Go, but all of the decent aspects of the film feel underdeveloped and don't really have the chance to really blossom into strong characteristics or qualities to make the film great. The humor in the film is incredibly dry. Everything Must Go has a slight Lars and the Real Girl kind of feel to it without the awkwardness or strong performances to make it memorable. There are brief moments that attempt to tug at your heart strings, but it's like it all lacks follow-through. All the right elements are there, but just aren't utilized to their full potential. Most of the performances feel kind of bland. Both Will Ferrell and Rebecca Hall show shades of actually being able to portray some emotion, but just when something starts feeling like it's building to a memorable scene they fall back into ho-hum territory.Everything Must Go isn't a happy film in the least. Nick Halsey literally has the worst week anyone could possibly imagine and just when things start to look up, he gets hit with something else. I guess the film is trying to tell you to take everything in stride, one step at a time, just deal with what life throws at you the best you can, ends lead to new beginnings, but it kind of felt like there wasn't the proper balance of hope as well. There are a few notions made that seem to hint at Nick making it through this and being a better person in the long run, but the journey in the meantime will probably leave you feeling pretty depressed.Everything Must Go is a decent comedic drama that offers mediocrity from all sides. The most interesting aspect of the film is its premise, which the film is never fully able to capitalize on. The humor provided is more of the chuckling lightly variety instead of actually laughing out loud and everyone in the film seems to pretty much be playing the same character that's incapable of showing the actual spectrum of emotions. Everything Must Go is fairly disappointing at the end of the day, but not necessarily overly good or bad in the long run.</fullReview>

Accompanying his junk is a Dear John letter from his wife.With no where else to go, Nick takes up residence on his lawn, where his days are comprised of heavy drinking and soul searching.A depressing story of self-destruction, adorned with delicate moments of humanity, Everything Must Go is a poignant film.And while someone's stuff on their front lawn usually signifies a yard sale, it can also denote a tornado.

		<shortDescription>Still Waiting for a Will Ferrell Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Impossible Spoilers Ahead:It is impossible to write a spoiler for this film, because it is exactly like every other Will Ferrell project: Improvised, not acted, without a particular plot or structure that is relevant to the premise.This film should have been titled "Waiting for a Film", because that is exactly what happens: Mr. Ferrell sits in a lawn chair. For the whole film. He is sitting in the lawn chair, because he has nowhere else to go. His drinking has gotten him fired, and his wife has locked him out of the house. I can hear the director now: "Ok, that's your setup, Will! Roll film! ACTION!!! Keep rolling for two hours!"Will Ferrell, like many performers who have grown up with comedy improv, apparently made the decision long ago that building a character, creating a role, etc., are all too much work (and time-consuming) when you can take the suggestion of a time, place, and character, and do the same job in seconds. We saw this in Step-Brothers, and particularly the out-takes of dozens of scenes that were never used, in which he improvised all of the scenes, and used the ones that worked. The problem with this is that if you invest seconds in your acting, that is the quality of your result.Imagine if My Fair Lady, Citizen Kane, et al had been made this way. When you see improv comedy in the theater, it's fun, but you don't remember it an hour later. Certainly not years later. Everyone can quote lines from their favorite classic film, because of the care, direction, writing, and not least, acting preparation that went into them. I can't call Everything Must Go a film in that sense; it's a collection of static, disconnected scenes, as Ferrell improvs his way through a variety of the same scenario, and the result is instantly forgettable, and we have no connection or interest in this character.Unfortunately, other movies are following suit (Bridesmaids comes to mind), in which very funny actors and actresses are wasted in improvising scenes, instead of acting scripted ones.A friend of mine dragged me to this film, which felt like slow torture in a lawn chair. If Mr. Ferrell ever decides to act in an actual scripted movie, I'll watch it, just to see if he can build a character and create a role; in other words, act.</fullReview>

I went to my local DVD outlet and saw Farrell on the cover and thought that I'd would laugh my guts out but instead was sadly waiting for it to end. Having said this I do enjoy Farrell movies and accept that this may well have been a low point in his life and am hopeful that his manager ensures that a minimum production quality is guaranteed before anything is released to DVD, having said that it was a straight to DVD release after all. In future I will be careful what 'new releases' I pick but then again I should have been known better and used the 'you can't judge a book by its' cover' approach particularly if a big star movie goes straight to DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been So Much More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having told friends over the past couple of years that I wouldn't be caught dead paying to see a Will Ferrell movie, I was surprised to find myself buying a ticket to "Everything Must Go". But I have frequently been impressed in the past by comics who attempt serious roles -- including Jerry Lewis, Robin Williams and Jim Carrey -- so after hearing a positive review from a local critic, I thought I would give Ferrell a chance to show me something.I regret to say that I am still waiting. This was a movie that simply begged for character development -- most of all from the main character, Nick Halsey, but also from the visitors to the yard sale which is the setting for nearly the entire movie. But the opportunity was squandered in scene after scene, and with the exception of the typical outstanding work of Rebecca Hall as Halsey's neighbor, I was left wondering "Who were those people?" Most disappointing of all, Will Ferrell's performance as a very-non-recovering alcoholic left his character as wooden, uninteresting and - most importantly -- unappealing. I know, alcoholism is not pretty. But then, why do I want to watch it?I have often heard that many of the top comics suffer from an insecurity that perhaps helps them play serious roles. I got the feeling after seeing "Everything Must Go" that Will Ferrell does not suffer from such insecurities and that his self-assurance as a comic may make if more difficult from him to excel in a serious role. Perhaps its like a rich guy trying to sing the Blues; there's just something lacking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I have very poor and unhappy brains for drinking." Shakespeare, OthelloWatching a drunk for 2 hours is not my idea of cinematic benevolence, but Will Ferrell as recovering now lapsed alcoholic Nick Halsey makes the experience barely bearable. While Nick has just lost his high-powered job because of his intemperance, he faces on the same day a wife who has left him, changed the locks, and spread all his belongings in the yard.Because he then lives in his front yard for a while, the setup allows various characters to slip in and out of the narrative as they visit his yard sale. Although not one of these characters is arresting or even memorable, Kenny (Christopher Jordan Wallace), a boy who helps him administer the sale, does a credible job almost imitating Nick's low-key mien, endearing him, and yet fostering the very weakness of the film: There is no fire, just resignation to a bad situation. Like Bill Murray morphing into serious actor from charming clown, Ferrell is believable as a lapsed alcoholic who needs to work on his social skills. (Both Murray and Ferrell are superior to Robin Williams' forays into the serious, which can end up maudlin and didactic.)Samantha (Rebecca Hall) next door provides a sweet counterpoint to Nick's absent wife as Sam talks with him about his problems and he about hers, both the better for the interaction. Not enough is seen of the impressive Laura Dern as Delilah, a former high school chum whose brief encounter with Nick now begs for more on screen during the subdued drama.Yes, "subdued,"for, like a non-comedic Seinfeld, nothing happens. I appreciate the attempt by first-time helmer Dan Rush to emulate low-key European dramas, but the minimalism on this side of the pond doesn't have the same impact. Ironically the most charged scene is at the beginning when Nick is being let go. However, even when he finds out later what his wife has been up to, no sparks fly, no voice gets raised much, and the confrontation is muted.If for nothing else, Everything Must Go makes an effective study of the dangers in excessive drinking, and certainly no one watching could be seduced into binging on Pabst Blue Ribbon. Like the beer, the film is flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just got back from this movie 6pm at the Aquarius theater in Palo Alto.My first thought was that given the history of this man ... the character Will Ferrell plays, he would not be so nice and sympathetic as Will Ferrell.In real life we would not want to watch this idiot loser for more than about 30 seconds unless he was doing something extremely self-destructive. But since this is a movie and the main character is a movie star we wait and take in all the contrived idiocy that this movie dishes out.There is a reason his wife leaves him most likely, and with animosity, but since its a movie and the main character is a movie star, we side with him. Something about this movie kept me thinking about this the whole way through ... what is the point of this I kept asking, it is not believable, and there is no real statement or hero, or character arc.Also the wife locks him out of his own house, and takes all his money. What would drive someone to do that? Turns out he probably deserves it and got it back in spades ... but that actually might be a good story if they did a movie about something like that. Here they do not explore any story, just a bunch of stupid gags they can think of to NOT really have a movie but just a big skit. I just wonder why make a movie and then deliberately avoid saying anything or really making a movie? Is it so the remake in 20 years has something to do?The whole movie is just a fake pointless setup to draw sympathy for a pointless character who has no heroic aspects to his being or his story.There are a few chuckles, but how is this guy not smart enough to be sleeping in his front yard and forget that he has sprinklers in the front yard. .... not once, but twice.That is how insulting this movie is to the audience.Horrible things happen to him, but because there is no real thread to the story that goes nowhere other than what can we tweak the audience with next that will make them feel something, but not actually say or do anything to upset anyone or make a real statement about a real person in reality?There are a few nice movie moments, but way too much stupidity and what is really understated slapstick comedy.If you see this movie you will not get much, and if you miss this movie you will not miss much ... so probably makes more sense to miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can surely tell 'Everything Must Go' has been passed through Dan Rush's editing bay one too many times. Hollowness over substance is the norm as the whole film looks like what someone might vomit up after partially digesting Natarajan Subramanian's digitized footage. Eldridge Rodrigues' insistently fussy and grandiose production design mistakes extra-crisp textures, brilliant colors and high contrast backdrops for story atmosphere and style. Yes it's boring as hell, but liquor-fueled methods do not compensate for distinct lack of substance. Will Ferrell's action all but forces its bulky, twitching mass down your throat until you realize you haven't been entertained but assaulted.'Everything Must Go' is certainly a front runner for one of the worst mainstream Hollywood releases of the year. It will try your patience and give you a throbbing headache - about all it does with any success.</fullReview>
