		<shortDescription>Mike Leigh turns the trivial into the truly tragic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leigh's latest film Another Year follows the story of a happily married couple approaching their retirement years. Their warm relationship offers them security as the the film progresses. Their friends and family, by contrast, all struggle to some extent with unhappiness, and a sense that their best years may be behind them.The film is a story of ageing; the small events that can make life either comforting or unbearable; and the refuge that companionship can offer.Rut Sheen's role as Gerri is superb. Her open, welcoming face invites her friend and colleague Mary (played by Lesley Manville) to open up to her about her drunken fears of where her life is leading. Jim Broadbent's Tom is charming and self-effacing, confident in his own happiness yet nonplussed at the failure of his friend Ken ? Peter Wight ? to come to terms with growing old.The film dwells on the small, predominantly non-verbal signals that reveal emotional and social insecurity. Leigh's direction reminds us that the sharpest insights into character lie in moments where we think we at our most concealed. Faces betray what we wish were kept private ? at moments where verbal communication fails, physical expression lights up hidden fears, passions, failings and desires.Leigh treats all his characters with a certain dignity ? whilst there are moments where we are encouraged to laugh at their social inadequacies, for the most part we suffer along with them, knowing that their experiences are all too near reality to take lightly. We encourage Tom and Gerri to keep supporting their despairing friends, yet knowing at the same time that their married happiness can only serve to mock their friends' lonely lives further. The four strictly partitioned seasons of the film point towards a growing anxiety that it may in fact be too late for these lost characters. The cyclical nature of the structure suggests that there is no real remedy for those left unloved and lonely at the film's conclusion.From the opening scene, where a woman silently struggles to recollect the happiest moment in her life, to the point when the dialogue slowly fades away to leave Mary isolated and forlorn, we cannot help but be both enchanted and dismayed by the emotional honesty of Mike Leigh's characters. This is what sets out the director as a truly gifted artist ? his ability to heighten the routine into the dramatic; and to make the trivial, truly tragic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another existentialist classic by Mike Leigh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom and Gerri (Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen), the couple at the centre of Mike Leigh's latest existential piece, couldn't be more unlike the cartoon characters who share their names. Together for several decades, their love for each other has only grown. I wouldn't complain if my marriage looked like theirs when I'm in my 50s.When he isn't working as a geologist and she isn't counselling people, they spend their time providing solace to those who need it ? Ken (Peter Wight), a straight-talking, John Smiths-drinking Yorkshireman; Ronnie (David Bradley), Tom's laconic brother whose wife has just died; and most of all Mary (Lesley Manville), a jittery colleague of Gerri's in the middle of a mid-life crisis. It is Mary who dominates the film and who most elicits our empathy. She is without love and possibly even without the hope of love. It is genuinely painful to see her disintegrate scene by scene. As another year in Tom and Gerri's life unfolds, we see nothing particularly fascinating happen. They tend to their allotment, they invite people to their house for food and company, and they reminisce about their experiences. Nothing could be more trivial, right? Wrong. This film is about growing old and making the right choices as one gets to old age. Above all it's about recognising that happiness is less a right than an aspiration.The word 'integrity' comes to mind when I think of Mike Leigh. Who else could convince actors to sign up to films where there was no script to begin with? Throughout his career he has eschewed the Hollywood system and has done things his own way ('Given the choice of Hollywood or poking steel pins in my eyes, I'd prefer steel pins'). An audience member expostulated at the end, 'That wasn't very uplifting'. She's correct, but Leigh doesn't offer folly or fantasy. He's a truth-seeking social observer and commentator. What's also appealing about Leigh is that he doesn't spoon-feed his audience. His films compel the watcher to debate what they have seen and draw their own conclusions. Why should films give us answers? I was moved by this film like no other in recent memory. One moment I was laughing uncontrollably, the next I was holding back tears. The film emphasises a sad fact: for some people, things don't always go according to plan. Sometimes we're just plain unlucky. And that's life.www.scottishreview.net</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big theme movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a big movie tackling big themes, and may, like Happy-Go-Lucky (Mike Leigh's previous film) prove extremely Marmitish. The latter comment may prove hard to understand if you're not British, and that's just like the film (Marmite is a British spread made from yeast extract with a love-it-or-hate-it umami/savoury/salty flavour). Another Year deals with a particularly British form of social breakdown and emotional constipation.In Britain, from the 40s to the 70s there was widespread use of an exam system called the 11+. Up until the age of 11-12 students were schooled together, after that point, students considered to have more potential by the standards of the 11+ examinations were streamed separately in Grammar Schools, prepared for success, whilst those below the boundary line were sent to Secondary Modern Schools where the focus was much more on practical education (bricklaying, "home economics", woodwork, etc). The legacy of this system has been huge social resentment. There is a feeling in Another Year that the system is back, in the form of university education. With the UK attempting to educate 50% of the secondary school student population to university level, a socially engineered bifurcation to haves and have-nots is being created once again.All of the characters in the film are from working class backgrounds and yet the fortunes that life has graced them with are distinctly uneven, they have gone in different directions, absent any idea of a shared experience that may have been the rock of previous generations of Britons. Graduates Tom and Gerri (pun intended) have fulfilling careers, heartfelt love for one another, high incomes, and have had the opportunity to travel widely. Tom's brother and Gerri's friend Mary are aging and alone, undereducated, lacking in the kind of accomplishments that are social currency, living with hurt, and in Mary's case, desperation. The message is not all one way, old friend of the family Ken is also a graduate and yet has not managed to find a place in life either.Scenes in the movie almost exclusively concern Tom and Gerri's catering to this group of friends and family. They deal with the misfortunes of this circle with a mixture of humour, irony, good cooking and alcohol, but mostly conceal their compassion and are helpless onlookers.The mating game is key here, the unwedded 40+s exist in a state of unsalved distress, futureless, scrapped. Even 30-year-old Joe, functional, graduate, well-employed and witty has struggled to find someone to be with. A notable absence in the movie is a sense of solidarity, community, public events, shared lives and shared values. There's an illiquidity in the relationships marketplace, a lack of feeling and connection, all leading to a general anomie and social constipation.However painful the lives of Ken and Mary are, the film gives occasional glimpses of far more infernal lives, lower circles of hell where dissatisfaction has paralysed characters with rage or utter resignation. Anything more than a glimpse would have made the film unwatchable.Gone are the days when WWII veterans would whimper their way through night-times of post-traumatic hallucination for forty years without mentioning it to a soul, however the British "stiff upper lip" still remains as a guiding principle in this movie. There is still very much the assumption that one should keep one's private hell to oneself, or else outsource emotion to a therapist.What may be controversial in the film is the way you look at how Tom and Gerri treat Mary. A German lady in the audience voiced her opinion to Mike Leigh that the way they treated her was to look down on her, and that she felt this was inappropriate. Mike Leigh responded that the lady felt like this because she was a German and Germans did not understand irony. Maybe I suffer from the same problem because I for one felt that Mary was treated as little more than a baby, and with a certain hauteur, arms-length love. I think people who are lonely need to feel useful. Mary for example was never allowed to help with anything, though this does not excuse her, at times, appalling behaviour (depression makes people selfish, however I feel it necessary to point out as well that someone who is drowning in a river and calling for a life ring, is also being "selfish" in the same way, and I think metaphorically the position is very similar).Dour joyless watching, maybe one for the Cabinet to watch, after the example of the film La Haine, which concentrated on French malaise and was screened in front of the French cabinet at the instigation of Prime Minister Alain Juppé.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep, intense and compassionate slice out of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Mike Leigh's new slice of life, Another Year, a married couple who have managed to remain blissfully happy into their crumbling autumn days are surrounded over the course of the four seasons of one seemingly average year by friends, colleagues, and family, many of whom appear to suffer some degree of unhappiness or at least confusion. The film is nicely segmented into chapters, following the seasons. All of life is there - from birth, to a funeral. Strangely, or conveniently, given the apparently troubled lives all round, She works as a psychotherapist, while He builds things, but both spend their spare time together growing vegetables in their allotment. Mary, the secretary in her clinic, takes over the centre of the story as she gradually moves into more of everyone's lives. Or perhaps it's just that the film gradually opens up the relationship that was already there. Just as it is with all the extra characters. As it's a Mike Leigh film, all the actors will all have been living "in character" for maybe six months before breezing through, stirring up the plot with their back story and emotional infrastructure.Lesley Manville, as Mary, the lonely and unstable girl of a certain age - 40, going on 17, really steals this in the final part, which gets even more intense than the rest of it. One thing I noticed right away was that adding to the intensity of the Mike Leigh close-ups, it's all shot in high-definition digital. But in the end it's the total effect that works. The apparent non-acting. The marvellous thing about Leigh is the way he shows really ordinary people doing really ordinary things and makes them really important. He is so compassionate towards everyone in his stories. You just can't help caring, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Actor Academy Award due</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lesley Manville as Mary truly deserves the Best Actor Oscar for her perfectly nuanced, scary and convincing portrayal of a woman on the brink of personal desperation due to her many life mistakes and to her extremely fragile emotional nature that served to spiral her further and further down toward mental illness with every romantic disappointment and life mistake she made. Honestly, I do not think Meryl Streep could have played this role as well. Lesley was that great in it. An astounding performance, and so touching, as you felt every pain Mary felt due to Lesley's spot-on interpretation of her character's neediness and weaknesses and what they cost her.This film tells a story(by the 4 seasons)of a year in the lives of a UK couple and their friends. Mary is a secretarial co-worker and friend of Gerri, a professional counselor and the sweet wife of her well-rumpled and very likable engineer/geologist husband, Tom(yes, Tom and Gerri). Mary is the woman we all know at some time or another in our lives.... a woman too attractive to always be alone but always is alone after every failed attempt at a relationship, always suffering badly from each failure to find what she wants so badly.Not much of an intricate plot here, as in all Mike Leigh films, but the story was such an absorbing and typical Mike Leigh take on the day-to-day happenings in the ordinary and everyday lives of a normal UK couple and some at-risk friends. Tom and Gerri were the couple with these friends in various states of decline, and they always tried hard through their gentle patience, understanding and humor to help them and always be there for them. Ruth Sheen and the great Tom Broadbent played the wife/husband roles to perfection, and were so loving, likable and comfortable with each other and with friends that you wished you had them for your own friends. Wonderful portrayals, both.See this film for engaging personal interaction and for the best acting performance of 2010, but be prepared for your own uncomfortable and awkward feelings throughout due to Mary's many sufferings and how her endless tales of them affected her(long-suffering)friends. It was a truly human story, sometimes warm and funny, sometimes pathetic and difficult to watch, but at the end you knew you had seen acting greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Seasons and a Funeral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strange and sad little film beautifully acted by its ensemble cast. Lesley Manville's agonised performance as Mary, aching with envy at the solidity and comfort of her best friend's solid marriage, must be a shoo-in for awards next year, but Ruth Sheen is also 100% believable as the endlessly patient, almost 'saintly' Gerri. Jim Broadbent's Tom teeters on the verge of hamminess, allowing Peter Wight to steal the male acting honours as Ken, another lonely and alcoholic divorcée.After a sad Spring and a prickly Summer, Autumn brings romance to Tom and Gerri's bachelor son and Winter brings a funeral (not the one we've been dreading). Anchored by the couple's devotion to their allotment, Mike Leigh gives us a film about the seasons in our lives as well as in our vegetable patches. In life, as in the garden, some things flourish and blossom while others wither and decay.Often humorous but mostly achingly sad, this is a very fine film about the Ordinary Lives of Ordinary People. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. How DARE he? Mike Leigh is such a non-compliant filmmaker. He just refuses to follow the rules ... and film goers are the benefactors of his daring. Mind you, his daring is not in the regards of special effects, stunt work or trick photography. No sir. His daring is with the subject, theme, tone and characters. He is ... GASP ... unafraid of real people! If you have seen Mr. Leigh's work in "Happy-Go-Lucky" or "Vera Drake", you understand that his films can be simplistic on the surface, while carrying multiple layers of commentary and observations. He also has the classic British sense of humor in that very few "punchlines" exist. Instead the humor comes in allowing the viewer to recognize the characters as someone they know, or God forbid, even their own self! Mr. Leigh has a history of making films without a script ... only broad based outlines for the characters. The actors then work to fill in the details of the individuals, which in turn, forms a story. This explains why the story does not follow the traditional arc. In fact, the story has no real beginning or ending. What we see are the interactions of people who are friends, relatives, co-workers, acquaintances and strangers. The foundation of the film, as well as the foundation for most of the other characters in the film, is the happily married couple of Tom and Gerri, played by the terrific Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen. This is a couple who not only love and respect each other, but also enjoy being together. Their friends and family come in and out of their lives, but their bond is strong.Key amongst this group is their friend, and Gerri's co-worker, Mary (Lesley Manville). Mary is someone we all recognize. She is single, not getting any younger, desperately trying to avoid loneliness (too often with a bottle), masking her fear through fake excitement, and latched onto the security blanket offered by Tom and Gerri's friendship.When family friend Ken (Peter Wight) makes a move on Mary, she shuns him because of his lack of perfection. She always thinks she can do better. When she begins fixating on Tom and Gerri's son Joe (Oliver Maltman), we really feel her pain but just want to slap some sense into her. The relationships all take a hit when Mary shows up for dinner and is introduced to Joe's new girlfriend ... a wonderfully charming and talented Katie (Karina Fernandez). Mary acts the selfish fool and it drives a wedge between she and Gerri. There is even a line of dialogue earlier on ... never come between a mother and her son! Another character we are witness to includes the great Imelda Staunton as a depressed middle-aged woman who comes to Gerri for professional guidance. We also meet David Bradley as Tom's older brother, Ronnie, whose wife has recently passed.All of these situations and personalities are balanced by Tom and Gerri as they provide a stable environment ... it's as if they are a fountain of sanity from which everyone wishes to drink. As an added touch, none of the characters are Hollywood beauties. Broadbent and Ms. Sheen would never be mistaken for Brad and Angelina. Rather they are more likely to look like someone you know ... and better yet, their characters live like people you WANT to know. So again I ask ... How dare he?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A journey into the heart of Britain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie touches upon current sociological and psychological conditions that result to alienation and loneliness. The theme repeats itself on the problematic characters of a group of friends in their 50s, namely Ken and Mary as well as Tom's brother. They all resort to alcohol but that is the side effect of their problem, not the root cause. There is an unfortunate equation between single people and despair. This bias is expressed also in the story of the couple's son, who seems to worry during the time he is single and who 'has it made' once he finds a girl who assumes his parents' acceptance and friendship, admits she is starving to people she just met (no manners) and licks her fingers (no manners). Meanwhile Tom and Gerry are the voice of reason and somehow, I felt they were also Mike Leigh's voice. Of course, as others here have mentioned, their portrayal may not be seen as virtuous as I have perceived it. There is a certain coldness within their kindness about them just as cold as the way the priest received the late-coming son of the deceased woman at the funeral. Mary who is at the centre of the film, is a pile of trouble. She is turned down by Tom and Gerry's ugly son and Tom's socially handicapped brother, only to get attention from fat and alcoholic Ken. In a desperate move to celebrate her independent life rather than mourn for her loneliness, she buys a car but that only becomes a source of more trouble. As if Leigh wants to tell us that no car can give her the happy life of a married couple who live in harmony cultivating their veggies. The question that floats in the air can be whether her unbalanced character has caused her loneliness or vice versa. What keeps this film together are the masterful indoor scenes, the convincing dialogues and the top notch acting. Careful considerations have been made in how people act in their everyday lives and that has been extraordinarily engaging.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A happily married couple is followed over the changing seasons. The portray is that of harmony, love and togetherness. This is as perfect as it gets. Then we get introduced to their friends who are frequently invited for dinner and drinks. They all have something in common : Broken marriages, alcoholism and self denial. The contrast couldn't be more surreal. Especially Mary, who is longing for love and friendship. Her emotional hurt is tangible.This movie is not about the couple or anything else, it is about Mary and her shambolic life, the pain that she derives from loneliness and her utter failure to get her life back together. Brilliantly and stunningly directed by Leigh, this is a masterpiece of portraying a character that will be, strikingly and tragically, all too familiar with most of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Year is the kind of film an actor wishes they had been in and any director wishes they had made. Mike Leigh's skillful directing is at its peak. Long, lingering shots of the characters angst (which normally frustrate the audience) are achieved in an effortless way. The acting is so flawless that it is difficult to find fault. The story is simple and meandering...but it works, and works incredibly well. Another Year will not be to the taste of the young kick-cutting action packed generation. It requires a mature audience or an audience that have at least pondered about what their life would be like after their forties.This will gain nominations and should win Oscars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Happy-go-lucky?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leighs wonderfully ironic yet sweet look at life takes a little twist in this super ensemble movie which centers around Tom and Gerri and shows us these characters mainly as reflected by their friends and kin. What makes the twist is something written in a different review and which is apparently a Continental European viewpoint if I must believe Mr. Leigh. The minor flaw of this film is that Tom and Gerri hardly develop and if they do, it really is downwards as - when you leave the theatre - you are left with some questions as to whether they really are as warm and supportive as they appear prima facie. Why are all their friends alcoholic losers? And why are they so supportive, yet so aloof? We found a few scenes that show how Tom and Gerri feel about Mary (a shoe-in for any award because of the slightly over-the-top, nail biter performance by Lesley Manville). Their friends really make them feel better about themselves. Whatever may be of this Continental take, it is a tremendously enjoyable movie, as always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>File under "Too painful to watch twice"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface this is a movie about the day to day life of an elderly, happily married couple (Tom and Gerri), their son and friends, among them Mary and Ken. All seems well in suburban London until that very last shot of the film, a most disturbing scene, the climax of the movie.We see Mary at the kitchen table of her friends and as the conversation passes her by she realizes she doesn't matter to them any more. Worse, we see it dawning on her that she may never have mattered to them at all in their relationship of 20 years. The comparison with her car is inevitable, a vehicle that should have brought her a sense of freedom, but turned out to be a lemon if ever there was one. As another commenter wrote, it is a scene of exceptional cruelty. (Can I nominate Ms Manville for an Oscar, please ?) How could this insincerity, this not-so-mild form of wickedness persist over such a long time ? Perhaps it has something to do with the British fondness of manners, but I think it has to do with work, more specifically in Tom and Gerri's case with having a profession, being a professional.A professional is someone who is applying a set of rules, an algorithm to a standard input to produce a standard output. (What distinguishes a professional from a craftsman is that the input, rules and output are so complex that they defy supervision.) Tom and Gerri are professionals and what they are doing is extending their professional attitude to their personal lives. Their relationship with Mary is professional. Their marriage is dealt with professionally. Their marital bliss is ultimately based on their contentment with the standardized output it produces. Tomatoes anyone ?Contrast this with Ken and Mary. Ken is an alcoholic in bad physical shape. He was once handsome however and has a good heart. His problem is that he questions the meaning of his job, which in his case seems to amount to questioning the meaning of his life. And then there is Mary. Her goal in life is Love, not work, thereby committing the ultimate sin (not making work your life goal that is).Two scenes illustrate the stranglehold work has on our lives (and the importance of it for the movie's theme, I think). In the first an Asian couple is visiting Joe, an old man threatened with eviction and a young woman acting as his interpreter, her ability to help the old man, however, limited to the duration of her lunch break. In the second Carl arrives too late for his mother's funeral, having been stuck in a traffic jam. The funeral couldn't be postponed however, another one was already waiting.So are Tom and Gerri right ? At the dinner table Tom is telling of how he and Gerri met, by chance on their first day in university. This detail hints at the internal inconsistency of their way of life. And of course right at the beginning of the movie there is this session of Gerri with the sleepless patient, an Everywoman. It shows her utterly failing in her role of counselor, her very profession.Mary is indeed looking for love in all the wrong places. At the end of the film you realize that, despite all appearances Tom &amp; Gerri's was such a place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please just strangle that smug couple before I throw something at the screen .. is this the reaction you hoped to evoke Mike Leigh? Or are Tom and Gerri your idea of a "healthy" couple? Are you likewise vapid and sanctimonious? Of course your nebulous framework leaves us only to wonder ...what WAS the message here? yes it made me think, forced me to draw my own conclusions and for that you have again triumphed. These characters stirred up lots of emotion in me. I felt disdain for the heroes (note son's cajoling girlfriend) and genuine empathy/fondness for the tragic ones (all of them).. but then again which were the real tragedies ? Geri and her like are the reason I avoid therapy. Having never struggled herself she is hardly sympathetic. The sanctity of her boring life shelters her from developing real relationships with the fascinating people surrounding her. Ditto Tom. Their shared comfort is wrought with complacency and co-dependence. Neither feels a need to truly relate with other people as they consistently crawl back into each others arms for a nightly sh*t talk about their less fortunate friends. There is nothing wrong with a symbiotic relationship but this one is so lofty and banal I'd rather be single and have a ..well.. personality. that leads us to Mary. poor desperate Mary. She took chances in life that earned her a colorful personality, but scarcely more. She did not settle into monotony yet she found only heartache. She is horribly lonely. Mary's emptiness leads her to vices like alcohol, little red cars and fake friends. Still she is more genuine than the other star players here as she is honest with her misery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>superficial movie or superficial characters?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot and character details are outlined elsewhere. This film is a superficial view of deeply unhappy/superficial people whose reasons for deep unhappiness are unexplored and unresolved. Since we learn almost nothing about these people (and they certainly seem to learn nothing about themselves), it is, worst sin of all, boring.The emotional center/hole of this film is Gerri, the counselor, whose inadequacy/ ineffectiveness is highlighted by an early scene with a potential patient, the actress Emelda Staunton, a working class person who presents with depression. After an introductory session, it seems highly unlikely that Staunton will ever return since Gerri makes no connection to her, which is the theme of the entire movie. (Notably for a real therapist, the first order of business besides making a connection is to determine Staunton's suicide risk, which seems considerable (she is asking for sleeping pills and suggesting that "sleep" is the answer for her problems. Avoiding the real larger problems is also a theme of this movie.) We then see Gerri as the enabler for the alcoholic Mary, a secretary at her work, who she has known for 20 years. They go out to drink after work occasionally where Mary's drinking is not subtle. It becomes apparent that Mary has had a series of spectacularly inappropriate failed romantic relationships (including one with a married man) and during the movie, an attempt at relationships with Gerri's son, 20 or so years her junior, and Tom's brother whose wife has just died. No effort is made in the movie to understand where this behavior comes from. Remarkably, Gerri only suggests therapy for these destructive behaviors after Mary's behavior threatens Gerri in her family. Other developments show Tom and Gerri don't really care for Mary at all and probably never have. It is the ultimate irony that it is Gerri who tells Mary she needs to take "responsibility for her actions" when it is Gerri who needs to take responsibility for her own actions.Tom and Gerri's relationship is quite solid if smug (and is apparently the main draw for the movie as a whole) but in many ways is a cliché of male female roles, Tom being the technical sort and Gerri being in the helper professions. Tom gets away with being emotionally clueless. When asked by Gerri what to do with Mary, his reply is that if Gerri doesn't know, how could he. Tom's two brothers seem to be the logical extension of his clueless-ness. Ronnie is essentially catatonic and totally estranged from his only son, while another brother (who we only see briefly) is called a jerk even by Tom. There is no explanation for any of this.Joe, the "perfect son" works as a lawyer for the poor where his condescension to his clients is equally striking. Joe and his new girlfriend Katie's relationship seems designed to parody his parents relationship. While there seems to be the implication of a close relationship of Joe with his parents, in fact, he kept the existence of his girlfriend from them for three months, suggesting a substantial distance (the girl friend had no problem telling her parents). His introduction of her to them is bizarre, having her literally jump out at them from behind a doorway, more or less the physical equivalent of springing her on them after three months. The parents take this entirely in stride and seem to think nothing of this, trivializing what they have been waiting for for who knows how long. We see no discussion among Tom and Gerri what this might mean for them as a family or how this makes them feel. This serves to emphasize the distance the film has from the actual characters.Over and over again, Tom or Gerri ask "how are you" when it is completely obvious that the person to whom this is addressed is collapsing.All in all, a series of poorly connected people with no insights or resolution. If that is what you want, here it is.</fullReview>

Thank God for films which refuse to pander to us while we munch expectantly on our popcorn.This film does NOT offer an uplifting story (or even a plot), or special effects, or a happy ending. Follow the signs to Men In Black instead. Another Year is slow, it's sad (even depressing), and it reeks of personal desperation. But I think it is a hugely underrated gem of a film... if you're prepared to put in the work. It is simultaneously a celebration of fine acting craft and a test of the audience's interpretative skill.It's difficult to think of a more astonishing performance than Lesley Manville as Mary: hers is a slow &amp; excruciating descent from na?veté &amp; painful insecurity to abject, exhausted desolation, from which we don't expect her to return, no matter how much we hope that she will. Her final scene is as haunting and heartbreaking as any which you're likely to see. We know that her hell is probably of her own doing, but it doesn't prevent our pity of her.The central characters Tom &amp; Gerri are generally considered happy, and towards whom unfulfilled family and friends gravitate as if Tom &amp; Gerri's union was life's ideal for happiness. However, this 'ideal' is shown up by the absence of any obvious elation, joy or excitement in Tom &amp; Gerri 's lives, and we are similarly responsive to their characters: we neither like nor dislike them, because their happiness seems attractive to others only as a foil to risky failure, not as something to genuinely aspire to. I think Mike Leigh presents us with several questions and human hypocrisies: Mary's disgust at fellow lost soul Ken is surely a subconscious terror of her own similar failures, and Gerri's general benevolence towards longtime friend Mary is exposed as mockery and patronisation when she's in private. Had Mary's &amp; Ken's situations been rescued by the arrival of their respective loves on white horses we may well have been celebrating the exhilaration of love discovered after life's tumultuous roller-coaster. Then the colourless contentment &amp; smugness which Tom &amp; Gerri offer up as life's nirvana would've been relegated to last-resort mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real People with Real Problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying to catch up with the Oscar nominees has been a disappointment. I can't see anything substantial about the 'great movies' of 2010. So a little movie like Another Year is a rare blessing.British filmmaker Mike Leigh and his ensemble of veteran actors ? Jim Broadbent, Ruth Sheen, Lesley Manville, Peter Wight, David Bradley, Imelda Staunton, Philip Davis ? get together for one of Leigh's improvised screenplays, full of naturalistic dialogue, and the result is a powerful drama, sprinkled with a healthy dose of humour, about loneliness, alienation, sadness, the emptiness of modern life and that hard to explain feeling of being trapped in a room without doors every day of your life.Another Year is a triumph of acting and writing. All the actors, perfect in their roles, deliver mesmerising performances. This is the ensemble movie of the year ? forget The Social Network or The King's Speech. Whether it be Martin Savage, who bursts into the movie with the power of a tsunami and electrifies the screen with a performance burning with anger and aggression for a handful of minutes, or Lesley Manville, who's the centre of the movie, draining herself out of energy like a power battery little by little as her character's life becomes progressively worse and she gets more desperate, the movie never fails to personify the excellence of acting.The story, divided by the seasons, takes place over the course of a whole year, and concerns the middle class couple of Tom and Gerri and the dysfunctional, depressed people who orbit around them ? co-workers, old friends, relatives. Well-adjusted, well-off, happy, they're like a rock of stability and counsellors to others. They organise barbecues in the garden, cook for friends, listen to their problems. Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen slip effortlessly into their roles, radiating joy, serenity and patience.The movie, however, would be dull if it were just about happy people. The underside of all this happiness is that it attracts the misery of others. Many people, always in trouble, slip in and out of their lives: the old friend Ken (Peter Wight) who can't accept aging and the new generation supplanting his; their distant son, Jerry (Oliver Maltman); Tom's brother Ronnie (David Bradley), whose loss of his wife has left him sort of numbed. And then there's Mary (Lesley Manville), the emotionally-draining friend whose craving for attention and nurture leads to some of the tensest and most embarrassing moments in the history of recent dramas.At the start of the movie Imelda Staunton, in a short but amazing performance, plays an unhappy woman talking to a counsellor; on a happiness scale of one to ten she doesn't hesitate to give it one; she can't explain why, she only knows that nothing changes and she can't remember any happy memory in her life. Without stating it, this is the direction Mary is heading for.I think cinema in 2010 has created few characters as fascinating and complex as Mary. When she first enters the screen she looks like she's plugged to a nuclear power station ? she just goes on and on and on and on, without running out of energy, a chatterbox to end them all. But this is all illusion. She talks because she fears silence, the emptiness. She doesn't have much of a life: she only knows Tom and Gerri, she prowls bars looking for men, she drinks a lot and she's decided to buy a car (possibly because, like drinking, it fills her life with a semblance of substance). Her wearied face, with its sunken eyes, has sadness and fear carved deep to the bones. I've never seen Lesley Manville in a movie before, I just know that for two hours I believed there was a miserable woman called Mary in London probably contemplating suicide. This is the beauty of the movie: it makes the viewer imagine things that aren't there. Manville impersonates her character so well, she gives it so many ticks and mannerisms, the life of her character extends outside the screen; I can still imagine her living now that the movie is over. The character is fascinating but Leigh also made an excellent decision to give it to Manville.The dialogue also serves this movie very well. Possibly the best scene in the movie is the awkward scene when Mary meets Joe's new girlfriend. In a previous scene Mary had made very obvious advances to him. When she meets Katie (Karina Fernandez), all her resentment spills out in the form of double entendres incomprehensible to Katie but obvious to Joe and his family. The tension just keeps rising and rising, becoming unbearable, but there's no respite for the viewer, it keeps going, and it's funny and brutally sad at the same time.Mike Leigh received a well-deserved Oscar nomination for the screenplay. He won't win, of course, but his loss won't feel as unfair as the snub Lesley Manville got. In a year when an overrated Natalie Portman is set out to win an Oscar for a mediocre performance that ticks off all the boxes on a long list of clichés about tormented geniuses coping with madness, it's a delight to watch Manville truly embodying loneliness and unsurpassable despair. Perhaps it was too raw, too realistic, for audiences to digest. The caricatural Nina of Black Swan is definitely easier to cope with (and we can even get aroused by her). Movies like Another Year easily get lost in the confusion of vapid press releases, viral marketing and controversy. I'm not so deluded to think that time will restore it to its proper place in film history. I just hope that, amidst all the noise generated by hype, the people who can enjoy a movie like this discover it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another year in an ordinary life of some ordinary people....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don't know Mike Leigh then you haven't been watching too many British films. If there is a British filmmaker that you have a knackering to see, then I suggest you watch Mike Leigh. His Secrets &amp; Lies made a splash at the Oscars? more than a decade ago when it was nominated for five Academy Awards.I was just a mere lad when Secrets &amp; Lies debuted and I didn't quite grasp the concept of it....so, I wrote it off. What a stupid kid I was back then. Mike Leigh has to be the absolute master of everyday human functionality. He is just so perfect with words that I would look like an inarticulate gutter baby next to him.Another Year takes place over four seasons within the course of a year -- we get to follow an extreme happily married couple with very unfortunate names, Tom &amp; Gerri (Broadbent &amp; Sheen, respectively). Gerri has a friend from work named Mary (Manville, who should have been nominated last year, hands down) who is, to say the least, envies the women from TV's Desperate Housewives. Tom and Gerri have a son, Joe (Maltman), who coyly rejects the advances of said desperate housewife while also trying to be the utmost proper gentlemen he can be. It's not like Mary is devoid of men of any kind -- she very rudely denies the advances of Tom &amp; Gerri's friend, Ken (Wight), who would probably treat her like a princess.I know that it may seem long at 124 minutes (5 minutes is credits) but I wanted more. I wanted to see how everything turned out.... but.... I understand the film and why it ended where it did. So often do we get a picture that shows us the life of regular, ordinary people. That's what this film is all about. It's one year out of the life of normal, regular people. There are no superpowers, no villains, no evil corporation or pirates to defeat. No hidden pregnancies, deceit and who slept with whom nonsense. This is real life. Please keep in mind, that this is not a mystery picture or brain-teasing thriller... this is a character study/piece that will engage you with it's characters, make you chuckle a bit with the often subtle humor that is life and maybe even put you in a 'what if that happened to me...' sort of mentality.

		<shortDescription>Shows the reality of "Depressing Britain"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was one of the most depressing films I've ever seen and I can relate to it after living 2 years in sad England. Contrary to what many people around the world think - British society is highly dysfunctional, depressed, lonely, lacking in emotions, cold, insensitive and angry. This film depicts all of that. There is an old English couple who are together after years of being Married but they are awfully Boring people.... they have a son who looks like a "potato" and has no personality... and all the other characters in the movie are faaaar toooo depressing to even mention. Sadly - this is very true about modern British society - and I really feel that Britain is the most depressed ugly nation in the world. Compared to France - Britain is socially backward, inept and full of loneliness and this movie successfully shows all that on the Big screen. Moreover Britain is UGLY - and the people are ugly - their ugliness stems not from their race but rather from their diet and depression caused by loneliness.It's funny but I compare this film to another recently released french movie - My afternoons with Margueritte - which was full of emotions, warmth, drama and beauty... and that is France for you. Even the poor in France are more human than any British - who have all become very cold insensitive people with no connections with their families, society or friends (if they even have any). There is no sense of "community" left in Britain - and it's become like this greedy money obsessed nation where people don't care for each other or for normal human relations. Another Year also shows the reality of family relations in the UK - a son is late for his mother's funeral and doesn't really give a damn anyway - his father lost his wife but seems lost himself...the day she dies he wants to drink beer instead of tea....these are all real situations in everyday life within British society. The little bit of multi-cultural-ism in UK has made it somewhat colourful and interesting - and if it hadn't been for that I would have killed myself in this depressing country after a month of living here. The movie should have been named - "Another Sad Year in Britain".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought Provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many, many years ago, as a young single woman, I saw a counselor, who helped me, and who I thought of as a friend. When I married my husband, I invited her to the wedding. She declined, telling me our relationship was professional only. So when, at the end of this movie, the therapist Gerri tells the disturbed Mary, who thought she was a friend of 20 years duration, to see a therapist, I had a different reaction to this movie than many others.This movie, about the happy middle-class couple Tom and Gerri, is more a cautionary tale that "friends" are not the same as family, and that therapy and friendship evidently cannot mix. The therapist Gerri's "friend" Mary is a middle-aged, lonely, depressed co-worker who has been a frequent visitor to Tom and Gerri's home for 20 years. There are jokes that she was an "auntie" to the 30-year-old son, who, in an excruciating episode, she drunkenly hits on. When she encounters the truth that the son has a girlfriend, Mary is "inappropriate" and rude. Even worse, she is revealed as of a lower professional caste from the girlfriend, who rather irritatingly fits in beautifully with the middle-class professions of Tom and Gerri.So Mary is a family "auntie" no longer and we learn in the final segment that she has not seen Gerri for some time outside work since the episode with the girlfriend. When she shows up at the house uninvited, Gerri and Tom are surprised to see her. We see them staring at her through the sitting room door, and I thought the expressions on their faces was so cold and even chilling. These were not the faces of friends who would normally be concerned for a friend who has come to them because of some trouble. This is when I first realized that the friendship of Tom and Gerri for Mary was only an illusion; that to them, Mary was just a person who had drifted into their orbit but who was welcome only when invited. Gerri tells Mary that Mary has "let her down" and that Gerri has had to put family first. She tells Mary that Mary should seek professional therapy for her problems. This speech is delivered in a professional voice. Gerri, who is supposed to be warm and nurturing, is cold to Mary, as cold as she was in her counseling session with Imelda Staunton which starts the movie.At the same time, Tom's brother, Ronnie, who has been widowed, has not been seen at all during the prior year and has not even been mentioned. But he was invited to stay; he is family. In the end, at the final dinner, the camera works its way slowly around the table. The talk among Tom, Gerry, their son Joe and his girlfriend Katie is jovial and cheerful, and, I would think, unbearable for someone who has just days earlier lost his spouse. The camera hits Ronnie, who is still nearly catatonic. And finally the camera focuses on Mary. You see on her face that she has realized that she is not part of the family, she is not the "auntie" nor even really welcome.This movie, I think, is remarkable for eliciting so many responses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Life?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, a confession: I don't enjoy watching Mike Leigh films. For me, they're a bit of an ordeal, rather than a pleasant night out. 'Another Year' was no exception; but it certainly made me think...Imagine you're looking at a picture, one in which there's a wealth of painstakingly drawn detail. For the sake of argument, let's call it 'The gulf between tolerance and understanding': A family is gathered around a table in a large suburban kitchen. They're clearly happy and comfortable, all are laughing and chatting together; a man and woman, nearing retirement, and a younger couple, holding hands lovingly. From the clothes they wear and the surroundings, you'd struggle to place the date; it could be any time in the last forty years.In their midst are two others. A man, gaunt and unkempt, his grey moustache and fingers tinged yellow with tobacco; and a middle-aged woman, one hand clasped around an empty wine glass, as she fumbles for a nearby bottle with the other. Both stare from the picture, unsmiling and trance-like; clearly apart from the family scene playing out around them.What thoughts and emotions would the artist of the picture be trying to convey? Well, work that out and you may be on your way to understanding this film, of which this is the closing shot.The film begins in a similar vein, with a woman that hasn't slept properly for a year, her look also vacant and haunted. She doesn't drink, has seemingly no means of escape from what's troubling her; and can't remember when she was last happy. A doctor asks her questions, trying to find out why she can't sleep? and the story begins. It's a scene that needs to be watched very carefully; without it, the point of the film may be lost.Another Year closer to the grave? Or '?what have we done? Another Year over?' (Lennon) My feelings are that the latter is pretty close: the central characters have grown comfortably numb in their middle class lives, pottering in their vegetable patch and commuting to work. They both seem blissfully in control, self-sufficient, free from stress and unhappiness; or perhaps they've always managed to skilfully avoid it? During the course of the film, though, we also see the sad lives of others: their friends, family and associates, people who could do with their advice and involvement. Is it given? I refer you back to the picture. You guess.As the closing credits roll, perhaps we should all know what's keeping the woman awake?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The very worst of Mike Leigh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear god this film tried my patience. The alleged amazing performance from Leslie Manville as the terminally stupid Mary was lost on me. She made Brenda Blethyn in the vastly over-rated 'Secrets and Lies' seem subtle. I don't necessarily need a strong plot to be able to enjoy/respond to a film but I do need a point, and this film lacked any reason at all to exist. Some people in late middle-age are happy and others are completely miserable? What insight!I put this film squarely in the Mike Leigh dustbin along with 'All or Nothing' and 'Secrets and Lies'. It does not belong up there with 'Naked', 'Life is Sweet' or 'Happy-go-Lucky' - all masterful, multi-layered films with an excess of emotional resonance. Watch those instead, not this exercise in pointlessness.</fullReview>

How this can be nominated for an Oscar is beyond me. Yes we all know that award ceremonies these days are politically motivated, but what is the motivation behind this? 'Don't complain about life, it could be like this'.Judging by the nominations for awards, that this has film has received, it only serves to prove that, 'it's not what you know, it's who you know'.This should carry a warning that 'viewing will damage your health', avoid watching at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They are quite rare, the movies in which no shot is fired, no crime is solved and no car is chased. Another year is such a movie. It is a movie without spectacular twists or beautiful locations, but with people and events that could be real. It's about friendship, desperation, love, disappointment, hope. That's why I really enjoyed this movie.Mike Leigh is a specialist of such slice-of-life movies. In this film, he shows us the day-to-day life of a happy loving couple and their not so happy friends and family. The acting is absolutely outstanding, with Lesley Manville in the role of her life. If anyone deserves an Oscar, she does.But then again, you could call this a boring movie. My movie-going companion did. His point is: if he wants to see real life, he can look around him all day. That's not what he's going to the cinema for.In a way, he is right. Cinema is about seeing things you don't see in real life. Famous stars, suspense stories that make you wonder whodunit, comedy which makes you laugh, intelligent plots and sudden twists, or even a new insight in a historic event. Wasn't it Hitchcock who said that he left everything ordinary out of the film?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It gets a 3 but only because of the actress who played Mary and for Imelda Staunton's cameo. Where to begin. This script would not pass Screen writing 101 at a third rate community college. There is no unity of theme. Whatever story there is exists with the secondary characters. It rambles and is out of focus. Oscar Wilde would call it the boring in pursuit of the mundane. The actress who plays Mary is exceptionally good and it is the only reason to see it. When I saw it many people walked out and I would have been with them except I was with a friend and I also fell asleep a couple of times. Questions. What is the point? What is it about? If it's about Mary then make it about Mary. And finally, where is the insight? It's fine if you have your characters talk about dishwashing liquid for ten minutes if something is going on in the subtext but why do I have to spend all this time with dull people talking about dishwashing liquid unless there is some insight I'm going to be given or some satisfying story or some emotional payoff. Not here. Skip it. Spend a couple of hours with a boring neighbour and save yourself the admission fee.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching the trailer for this film I really expected something quirky and thought provoking. However at the end I was left unamused that I'd lost 2 hours with nothing to show for it....apart from the fact that I was itching to see what other people thought about it. To see if I am the only person in this world that thinks Another Year is nothing more than a bad attempt at dramatic progression. And I am! I cannot disagree more with ever review that I've read thus far.The story starts off promising, with a depressed lady (played by Imelda Staunton) in a doctors office. Which was the best thing in the film....for me, anyway. Imelda Staunton is fantastic! But you only see her twice, each for a very short time. Then we see Lesley Manville's character. Another depressant which in my opinion is completely over acted by Manville. We're further introduced to other depressing characters whose roles in the film lead to absolutely nothing. The story leads to nothing, the acting is terrible and the direction offers no inspiring thoughts.It's obvious that the story is about how lucky we are and the paths we choose in life can lead upwards or downwards. But surely all that can be conveyed in such a much more entertaining way. Because after all, that's why we watch films right? To be entertained and left thinking afterwards. Not to be bored to death by mindless &amp; random story telling.My thinking is that all positive comments come from Mike Leigh's reputation. What a load of dribble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What dreadful people</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Mike Leigh trying to be Ingmar Bergman? Always the same actors, the same sorts of intimate human dramas. In this particular case we have a really smug, settled, very English couple (Tom and Geri) who work as a team, exchanging glances, out to spot any potentially unsettling situation and level it off (usually with yet another cup of tea). The woman of the couple (Geri) is a psychotherapist but completely unable to handle the desperation of her co-worker Mary, a stereotyped "desperate woman" (hopelessly over-acted by Lesley Manville) who is going mad simply because she can't find the right man. Surely this is a very dubious way to portray a woman who has difficulties with men? Tom and Geri are completely unable to deal with her and end up just shutting her out of their lives.I don't know if it's intentional or not but this film depicts all the horror of middle- class English life: cold and uncommunicative people who only seem nice but are really nasty to one another underneath, horrified at the slightest manifestation of emotion (be it love or anger), always wanting to dilute every experience and take the sting out of every situation.The idea of the "year" is supposed to be conveyed by the four seasons, depicted as the four seasons in the allottment tended by Tom and Geri. Another Bergman-ish touch.There's a brilliant cameo piece right at the beginning, in which the great Imelda Staunton plays one of Geri's patients, desperate to get some Valium from the doctor, very tense and loaded with problems she doesn't want to admit to. Staunton's ability to play this role, very close-up to the camera where you can see every nuance of her facial muscles, her frightened, suspicious eyes, her tight mouth. The immense abilities of this great actress only make Lesley Manville's portrayal of the "Anne" seem all the more hopelessly inadequate.The film has a number of discontinuities: since Anne and Geri work closely together every day, what happens at work when Geri decides to "unfriend" Anne? We're not told.Some of the really interesting characters (Tom and Geris' son Joe, played by the excellent Oliver Maltman, whose totally laid-back attitude is a foil to the absurdly keyed-up Anne; Tom's angry nephew Carl, played by Martin Savage - perhaps the only real hope in the film) never really develop.Disappointing. It's clear that Mike Leigh had something interesting he wanted to say with the film - something critical about English society- but he slips into making it a soft-focus poem about the happy, basically stupid life of Tom and Geri with their allottment and their cups of tea. Very disappointing and quite difficult to watch.</fullReview>

This film touches me so much more than King's Speech, which apply a rather standard feel good recipe wrapped in royalty touch. Another year, on the other hand haunts me. I agree with reviewer DiddlyDee from the UK, that this is a sociological HORROR film, not a drama. Some people just have bad luck and don't have a happy ending.It is said that this film is about a happy couple with unhappy friends around them. I would say that this film is about unhappy people clinging at a happy couple. I especially think that this film is about Mary. She desperately looks for love but fails time and time again. She is immature mentally, like a kid. This makes her difficult dealing with real life. The happy couple act as surrogate parents for her, but they are NOT, meaning that they just pity her. When it comes to choosing between the happiness of their son and Mary, the choice is made. Yes, Mary is jealous of love going around her. She was jealous when the happy couple showed affection to each other. Or when the son brought a brand new girlfriend. Isn't jealousy a lack of something that one does not have? And what if that thing is something fundamental, like love?This film is about Mary. This film asks for compassion and understanding. Because you never know what life gives you beforehand.</fullReview>

Her new, old car gave her freedom and independence. When her car failed, her life declined. Sexual harassment might have been a theme to develop, but it wasn't; she the victim of unwelcome attention, and she the perpetrator, seeking attention from the son of her best friends. Friendship over! We had to figure out why it was over. Gerri (Ruth Sheen) was very angry with Mary, but never told her why. How would you like to have Gerri as your social worker/counselor? That was in fact her job, and Mary was her support staff.Ronnie (David Bradley), what a gloomy character! I recognized him right away as Filch in the Harry Potter Series.

		<shortDescription>Masterful in it's ability to portray it's characters. One of the best films of 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard a lot o buzz surrounding Another Year, and it is one of the last Oscar-nominated films I had yet to see. So I had a chance to watch it today, not knowing what type of film it would be since I have not seen other Mike Leigh films. It engaged me from it's opening scene to the last.This is a masterful film, dwelling with it's characters in truly humane and intriguing ways. This is an ensemble cast, and as a whole they were all great. Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen are at the center of the film, and the film takes us on a portrayal of their relationship with others. It is to note that the film is contrasting just how different these two main characters' approach life than the people they are surrounded by. The most notable to these other characters is Mary, played by Lesley Manville. I have to say that she gives one of the best performances of 2010, becoming her character. She is vulnerable and at the same time delusional as to her fantasies in life. It's hard to label her performance as leading or supporting. She has a large amount of screen time, but at the same time she serves only as a window looking in to both Sheen and Broadbent's life. She has definitely created one of the most memorable characters in recent memory, and thats largely because of amazing direction and perhaps the best original screenplay of 2010.Even when Manville is placed in supporting, it is a shame that the Academy went for a more popular actress (Melissa Leo) when Manville and Weaver (Animal Kingdom) both are amazingly much more effective and either deserved to take home that Oscar (what blasphemy that Manville wasn't even nominated). However, this is a rich film, and certainly one of the best of 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best film I've seen all year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amazing character portrayal, beautiful cinematography. A pure example of art imitating life- we were able to empathize with all of these people, who seemed so real. This movie may not be a big-budget blockbuster, but I think it's the best film I've seen in 2010. We were totally puzzled by some of the other reviewers who felt that Britain (and its people) are shown as cold, unfeeling, or even inhuman. Without wanting to color a review too much with personal experience, I haven't experienced all or even most British people to be this way at all, in real life or in the film. If it's relevant, I have been living in the UK for just over a year, originally from New York City. Just like anywhere in the world, there are folks in the UK who are more compassionate, friendly, and empathic, and others who are not. The characters in this film really resonated with me, which I presume was the whole point. While there is an element of disharmony or desperation, there are also so many instances of kindnesses both great and small. This is a movie about real life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The loneliness of the long-suffering singleton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Happy-Go-Lucky, Mike Leigh's 10th film from 2008, was a surprising shift in tone for the now 67-year-old Salford-born director. Rather than bleakly dwelling on life's waifs, strays and ne'er-do-wells, it featured a group of well-adjusted and attractive young women cheerily getting on with living and working in north London. In many ways, it was the anti- Mike Leigh, Mike Leigh film, but it still polarised opinion, as most of his films tend to do.Many women found Happy-Go-Lucky's lead character, Pauline 'Poppy' Cross (Sally Hawkins), teeth-gratingly chirpy and thought she gave an unflattering portrayal of a modern, 30-year-old woman. Men, on other hand, tended to be charmed by her wit and warmth. And, let's be honest, many guys fell for Hawkins' watermelon grin and tractor-beam charisma. After the international success of Happy-Go-Lucky (Hawkins received a Golden Globe) and the glowing notices for Mike Leigh's 2004 film, Vera Drake, anticipations are high ahead of this Friday's UK premiere of Leigh's latest offering, Another Year. Although it didn't win the Palme d'Or, Another Year was still one of the most talked about movies at this year's Cannes film festival.Anyone expecting the light (though hardly lightweight) touch of Happy- Go-Lucky could be a tad disappointed. Another Year returns to familiar Leigh territory: gut-wrenching sorrow, frustrated lives, claustrophobic social tensions and excruciating embarrassments. It's all highly watchable rather than unbearable thanks to the compassion Leigh generates for his dysfunctional protagonists, as well as the regular flashes of brilliant, caustic wit. In fact, Another Year features some of Leigh's funniest and most memorable lines since Mean Time or Career Girls.Tom's life-long pal Ken, though, is an altogether lost soul. He makes half-hearted attempts to chat up Mary at Tom and Gerri's summer barbecue, but isn't quite deluded enough to think he stands a chance. A heavy drinker, smoker and eater, any traces of handsomeness have been erased along with his personal hygiene or any pretence to a decent wardrobe. He bemoans how rubbish pubs have become in his native Hull, all redesigned to 'exclude old people like me', and his social networks have closed down one-by-one through friends emigrating or dying. He carries on working for the local council when he could easily retire because he doesn't have anything else to occupy his time. Isolation and loneliness have often hit people late in life, but Leigh is showing how the collapse of any public life in the provinces is making this unfortunate situation more likely for more people.It would be easy, and wrong, to see Tom and Gerri ? yes, this awful gag is deliberately played upon from time to time ? as a smug couple lording it over their unfortunate friends. Yes, they're allotment-loving greens who fret about climate change, but in lots of ways they don't conform to an easy liberal-leftie stereotype. The couple, like the hapless Ken, benefited from grammar schools and universities worth their name in the late Sixties. They're the first of their respective families to go to university and, as we see from Tom's wider family in Hull, are from unremarkable backgrounds. As Gerri remarks to Tom early in the film, 'we're lucky really', and it's this grounded awareness that informs their compassion, patience and loyalty to their sometimes-trying friends.So would Mary be happier if she found a decent man? It would no doubt help, but it seems her real discontent is rooted in doing a badly paid and unfulfilling clerical job, unable to afford a decent flat or go on holiday. In a fantastic dig at environmentalists, Mary rationalises her poverty through the prism of green thinking: 'I'm the most environmentally friendly person here', she says. 'I don't drive, I don't consume much, I live in a small flat and I don't fly abroad.'In an earlier scene, too, one of Gerri's patients, Janet (Imelda Staunton), responds to the question 'what would make you happy?' with 'how about a new life?' and rightly can't see what a weekly therapy session would do to change that. Nonetheless, Janet is deprived of sleeping pills from a medical doctor until she agrees to weekly psychological probings by Gerri. Gerri's psychobabble also works against her better instincts, as when she falls out with Mary and, rather than work through the squabble as long-time friends should, she coldly advises Mary to 'seek independent professional advice'. Leigh's disdain for the 'happiness agenda', quack therapy and environmentalism is a sly delight throughout the film.At the question-and-answer session that followed the preview screening I attended, Leigh unashamedly said how much he enjoys film-making at the moment. Certainly, his output over the past decade has seen him grow as a director with each new release. Another Year is a beautifully shot, deeply humane and ? even by Leigh's standards ? minutely observed portrait of the dynamics of life-long friendships. What gives this snapshot an absorbing quality are the unexplained back stories and unspoken hostilities that are palpable amongst the main protagonists. It's a film that keeps you searching for answers long after the credits have rolled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of Mike Leigh's and believe SECRETS AND LIES to be one of the best films of the last fifty years. ANOTHER YEAR is, once again, Leigh at his best. A seemingly simple tale of a year in a number of people's lives, the film plumbs the inner soul of all the characters, especially that of Mary played by the astonishing Leslie Manville. (What is even more astonishing is that Manville was not even nominated for an Academy Award. Her performance as the tragically depressed Mary will stay with you for days and will easily erase the memory of the over the top dying swan of this years Best Actress winner.) As with all Mike Leigh films, Another year is not for everyone, but if you are a serious lover of film you must not miss this wonderful production. Mesmerizing and totally brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all would like to say that i really enjoyed the film. However it became really striking to me as to the profession of Gerri and at the same time with her complete carelessness for friends and family in her real life. I am talking about the double face. This is also clear in the end scenes when Mary, who she doesn't reject as a friend, and acts as politically polite to, tells her all she needs is a true friend, and she refers her to get professional help where people don't really care unless you pay money for their services. It just took me to really respect the psychologist profession even less, as unless you pay me i don't care, how fake. No wonder i never wanted to really go as can't stand people pretending to care for 1 hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for the easily depressed, but Mike Leigh's latest movie is an honest, brilliantly acted, and superbly scripted jewel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the films I wanted to see before I drew 2010 to a proper close was Another Year, and see it I did. Did I love it? Since it's one of the absolute best movies of 2010, the answer is a sweet and swift "YES!" The film spans over the course of one year in the life of a happy, and healthy elderly couple, Tom and Gerri. The two of them have a son named Joe, and over the time frame of the film, try to spread their own cheer to their less than cheery friends, such as the distraught Ken, Tom's under spoken and passive brother Ronnie, and their alcoholic, and also quite conflicted friend Mary.First praise goes to the cast, featuring a huge group of characters, and none of them feel wasted. Each and every one of the film's actors and actresses give fleshed out, and fully dimensional performances. Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen, who are the closest things to leading in this film, give a convincing portrayal of gleeful romance. Other cast members who do a convincing job include David Bradley, Peter Wight, and the miracle that is Lesley Manville, who steals every scene she's in, gripping us with her enigmatic exterior, until delivering a punch to the gut in the film's final 20 minutes that broke yours truly down to a teary mess.But the real star of Another Year is Mike Leigh. He not only extracts excellent performances from his cast as a director, but his screenplay is brilliant. It still features his same signature brand of humor, but it's toned down this time around, giving the themes of love, life, and what it means to live and love an intimate sense of exploration, even if we the audience are afraid of the outcome. One of the year's VERY best screenplays as far as I'm concerned.However, as enthusiastic as I am, I wouldn't recommend the movie to EVERYONE, because the simple fact is: the movie is depressing. Said themes mentioned earlier grow more saddening and grim over time, moments of genuine joy are few and far between, and the "Winter" segment of the film is the most emotionally devastating piece of cinema I've seen in years.Still, if you do decide to see Another Year, which I give **** out of **** by the way, I think you'll find a lot to admire about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The happiest moment quote comes early in the film and I'm sure a lot of people will ponder that question whilst watching the film. The one thing that can be guaranteed is that very few people will include watch "Another Year" in the short-list! Another Year is the sort of film which I particularly enjoy as it is a character driven narrative. The film takes place over a year although that is pretty incidental. The film is focused around the happily married couple Tom and Gerri played by Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen. It seems somewhat curious that such a happily married couple should have such a miserable set of friends. The other main lead is Mary played by Lesley Manville who is obviously yearning after her lost youth.I enjoyed the film, but can't say that I felt too much empathy with many of the characters. The film is nicely played by all the actors and the film is almost black and white in feel in the way it is shot. This certainly isn't for the adrenalin junkies, but if you like a character driven film then you'll probably enjoy it as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful insight of suburban England</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classic Leigh. He never fails. Mike Leigh delivers again with a charming little suburban London tale with a mix of joy, humour and sadness as only he knows how. Great cast as usual. It all starts with the amazing Imeldar Staunten being counseled by the equally amazing Ruth Sheen. There's reminiscence of Brenda Blethyn in Secrets and Lies. There's plenty of intriguing characters displaying a great observation of working class Londoners. Funny, charming and tragically sad. They're all there and covering the whole spectrum of oddballs and lovable folk of quirky England! A happy middle aged couple and their lonely, mixed-up friend who's got a crush on her work-mate's son, only to find he's met a great girl, not unlike the character 'Poppy' in the film 'Happy go Lucky'. Mary (Gerry's colleague), gets invited and invites herself to Tom and Gerry's social and family events. Tom and Gerry (Ha), are blissfully enjoying their life and their spare time on their allotment but Mary (who apparently has a bit of a drink problem), tags on to Tom and Gerry, possibly a bit too often for comfort. She battles between the apparent comfort of a glass of wine and the independence of her little red car which it appears she should best leave at home.. Very lonely, she watches as her liking for Joe (Gerry and Tom's son), gets more cemented with his new girlfriend, Katie. Tragic but brutally funny!If you're a fan of big budget, big effects Hollywood, you might not like or even 'get' this film. Thankfully, without even seeing the film 'Vampires Suck' I think I can categorically say, it's nothing like it!!You'll leave the cinema not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Who'd go and see a film called 'Vampires Suck' anyway???!!Can't wait for his next masterpiece!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw it a few hours ago. What a gripping film. For a film with mostly people just sitting talking to each other, with very little action, it was amazing. Some people might find it bleak, well it was, but the performances were brilliant. All the cast were excellent, but Lesley Manville stole the show. Surely an Oscar nomination? Right from her first scene, she superbly displayed Mary's vulnerability, emotion and desperation. When she finds out that Joe has a girlfriend, her shock and misery is heartbreaking, and can also be admired as a great performance. Forget going to the cinema all the time for "escapism", a lot of people will give this a miss because it sounds depressing, but I urge everyone to see this. Life-affirming, I still can't believe that a story with so many depressing and sad moments, can still be such a wonderful film. I am already thinking that this is my favourite film of 2010.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Year is a 2010 movie, written and directed by Mike Leigh. It stars Lesley Manville as Mary and Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen as Tom and Gerri, a relatively old married couple.To be honest, I didn't find any theme in this movie, and it lacked a plot. It follows Tom and Gerri's family and friends' lives throughout a year, without being even remotely interesting.To like this movie, you have to be into long and slow movies without much action, and it appeals more to old people than teenagers.This movie wasn't my cup of tea at all. Frankly, it was dead boring. While watching it, I kept searching for a plot, but couldn't find it. It'd be worse if the movie were American, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was happy to see one of the supposedly best film from Mike Leigh for a long time. I've found actors with a good potential but acting badly and not in tune with their role (badly directed)?. Mary the main character is OK but she's too simple and her behavior is not natural enough to be realistic. Tom &amp; Gerri are making the perfect family but are just annoying because to perfect. They look artificial, Gerri is a counselor but she fails in psychology; she seems not being able to accept Mary with her flaws. We'd like the director to dig a bit in her character to understand what's below.Characters with a secondary role are good (the nephew and the brother for instance) but that it. It's not enough to make a (good) film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really well made with some tremendous performances; I loved the down-to- earth tone of the piece. Mike Leigh does make some great dramas and he really gets great performances from his actors. In this one I loved both Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen, but the star of the show was definitely Lesley Manville. She had to go through the whole gamut of emotions and did it quite brilliantly (IMO). It's not a film that will be to everyone's taste; the explosion count is zero; car chases get a similar score and as for deaths, well, there is one, but we only find out about that one when they have to go to the funeral. But I digress; I found it a really engaging film with some real characters that are both believable and well rounded. It's nice to see British people portrayed as they are for a change, instead of some stereotypical 'vision' of what everyone thinks they are. On the down side, I did find it went on just a tad too long at the end, but I'm not going to hold that against it. It's well worth a look if you get the chance.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 8.2/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of British Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>138 people have written reviews before me on 'Another Year'. I won't reiterate its story, how Mike Leigh handles the narrative, the terrific performances...well, maybe a bit about the performances. Once you've had your brain cells desensitized by enough of the Hollywood movie formula, its so easy to forget that a remarkable film can consist of life's ordinary moments and small events. Another Year is that film. It's also the art of film making every budding film student should aim to conquer - knowing how to sustain simple types to effect inalienable truths. Another Year resonates quietly but profoundly for its whole 129 minutes. It treats us to our own experience of love and folly, long suffering, yearning, acceptance and rejection, by first engaging us to examine and judge those aspects of the screen characters. Another Year then seizes us, but only to gently remind that in our humanity we're all made of this same stuff. The judgements we pass on the character's behaviour and values unerringly reflect our own struggle for identity and acceptance. And it's achieved without manipulating sentiment or dramatic sensation. At one level, the performances are straight forward, appearing simple. At another level, they reveal all, including the awkward and at times frightening complexity behind human relationships which we take for granted, or often ignore. Quite a heroic effort by each member of a first rate cast, and director Mike Leigh, well what can I say? If you can't see it as part of an audience, see it with someone you love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfectly enjoyable year in the life of Brits Tom and Gerri.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom and Gerri are middle aged, perhaps a bit past it, and have a very nice, calm life that both of them enjoy. They love their life and each other, not in a demonstrative way but in the calm way that doesn't require outward proof. They each have their own careers, he an engineer she a therapist, and they enjoy gardening together and cooking meals for their friends.Jim Broadbent is Tom and Ruth Sheen is Gerri. They have a 30-yr-old single son, Oliver Maltman as Joe, who is a lawyer. Joe wonders if he will ever meet the right mate and give his parents grandchildren, but there doesn't seem to be any urgency. Tom and Gerri refer to him as a "darkhorse" regarding becoming the husband of a nice lady.Most of the stress and excitement of this story is generated by Lesley Manville as Mary, a 40-something single woman who has known and worked in the same office as Gerri. Mary is needy, drinks too much, talks too much, and has a knack for saying the wrong thing. Somewhat delusional, she somehow believes she might be the woman for Joe. But no one really likes Mary, they befriend her because she needs friends.The best thing about this movie is the sense of realism, that we are seeing a real couple and their life through spring, summer, fall, and winter. And the things that come and go in their lives. Mary cannot be fixed, the best they can hope for is that she learns a better behavior. Joe and his new wife will be happy together, and years to follow with have Tom and Gerrie enjoying their daughter-in-law and grandchildren.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Framed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening and closing shots of Mike Leigh's bittersweet film frame the faces of two different women. We first see Imelda Staunton's Janet, a deeply alienated older working class woman who seems beyond the help of either her medical doctor or Gerri, the therapist. The film's last frame focuses on Lesley Manville's Mary, caught like some helpless insect in the web of Britain's university-based class system and the apparently eternal constraints of gender and age. Within this frame, Leigh demonstrates the good and bad fortune of his characters. But his theme is not merely what the luck of the draw brings, nor does he allow his audience to blame the victims. The happy couple of the film--Tom and Gerri--are happy because they are lucky and also because, in the context of their professional lives and privileges, their attempts at being sympathetic and understanding are undercut by a quite natural need to absolve themselves of any duty to others that requires deep self scrutiny. This is not to say the characters are insensitive or unlikeable, quite the contrary. However, when questions arise about Mary's work, she is characterized as a "secretary" by Tom and Gerri's son's new (and very professional) girlfriend. This emphasizes the difference in education (and thus class) of Mary and the others, and is not questioned by the family. When Mary half-seriously questions the ethos of Tom's job--analyzing earth samples in order to facilitate more urban sprawl--he readily agrees, and gets on with his evening. When Gerri closes the door on an unsettling and failed session with Janet, she can only breathe a sigh of relief. Both members of this highly successful marriage with highly successful careers are willing to acknowledge the limits of what they can actually do to change their world for the better--but not so much that they feel compelled to act on a larger stage than the one their life provides. Within the larger frame of the film, four smaller frames--seasonal depictions of the communal garden in which Gerri and Tom work and from which they take home harvests--add to this portrait of a world that is both communal and limited--it is the community of the lucky, the successful,and the generous. But it is not a community that can really be asked to heal the much larger wounds that its existence entails.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scenes from the four seasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leigh's latest BAFTA and Oscar-nominated slice of suburban London life feels like a cast reunion from previous movies: Jim Broadbent, Ruth Sheen, Lesley Manville, Peter Wright, Imelda Staunton, Phil Davis. I've been watching his films since the early 1990s and this follows the usual pattern - there's no storyline as such, just incidents from characters' lives.Another title for the movie could be Scenes from the Four Seasons (spring, summer, autumn, winter), as it eavesdrops on the cosy London home life of Tom (Broadbent) and Geri (Sheen), a professional middle class couple approaching retirement age whose home is always open to various friends. Chief amongst these is boozy divorcée Mary (scene stealing Manville).There's a warmth and good nature about these characters. Leigh's films are always about people not plot. Take a scene right at the beginning of the film in which a depressed and downtrodden London housewife (Staunton) sees her GP because she's suffering from insomnia. A whole back story and other movie is hinted at in this person - yet she's not seen again. That's what makes Leigh's film so appealing - every character, no matter how minor, has a lived in life.The film works best during the winter sequence which involves a trip to Tom's sister-in-law's funeral where we meet the deadpan brother (David Bradley) and his sociopath son Carl (Martin Savage). I loved the details of the funeral: the poor attendance, Carl arriving later, the family row. It's a film which always feels real in character and emotion, something true of very few other contemporary filmmakers.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Leigh explores the ordinary, the common and the universal in a subtle, gentle way. Dealing with complex but familiar themes of growing old, happiness and, of course, the dynamics of human relationships in the heart of the machine of life, but doing so in such a way as to neither treat them superficially nor blatantly, nor too reservedly, we are carried through the film like a leaf on the wind, with no particular direction but with a movement and purpose all of its own.Neither the directing style, the script, nor the acting pander to what might be called the contemporary Hollywood-style film expectations. Long scenes with simple dialogue delivered in a relaxed, natural 'armchair' way, a viewer expecting clichés of action or plot would be disappointed. A visit to the world as it is seen by Mike Leigh is at once familiar but also a little disconcerting. Sometimes we go to the movies to escape into a fantasy world, to get lost in the illusions of theatre, but with Mike Leigh this is not so easy: one leaves with the sense of having not having stepped out of the world but into it, just as it is. We almost do not wish to see that the life we see on the screen is close, perhaps too close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My immediate reaction at the end of this film was that I wouldn't trouble myself by watching this again, but the more I thought about it the more impressed I became. Nevertheless, this is not a film that anyone will walk from the cinema feeling an inner warm glow.Another Year, ostensibly, is about the happy marriage of Tom and Gerry (is this supposed to be a joke?) However, the underlying story is actually about Mary and her continued self-destruction. Through Tom and Gerry's kitchen pass a series of friends and family, each carrying their own burden of unhappiness.The story is divided into four sections ? each taking place in successive seasons. For the first quarter of an hour or so nothing seems to be happening and it isn't until the end that the plot ? such as it is ? can be assembled by the viewer.As an ensemble piece this film is superb. The cast, including the magnificent Jim Broadbent, provide a masterclass in acting. As is Mike Leigh's practice, the action on the screen emerges from prolonged sessions of improvisation and attention to detail.This film may not be comfortable to watch but it is rewarding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, when Mike Leigh's name is on a film, you see it. I've been a fan since his wacky comedy, Life Is Sweet. Here, he has another big hit. If you prefer deep emotional drama that will touch you to your very soul to car chases and shootouts, this one should not be missed. I would call Another Year a docudrama, because I have no doubt that there are real lives playing out just like those in the film. I am a male nearing 60 and just about as alone as Mary. My heart ached for her throughout the movie. If Mary lived in my neighborhood, she wouldn't be alone for long. This is a very impressive effort from one of today's great film makers. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Let's have a drink, shall we?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I have to say that this is not a movie to watch on a sunny day. Or if you're under the age of 40. Why? Well, this might ruin your day and leave you sitting there with a feeling of fear. And not to mention, depression! Let me explain myself, because this was just the case.The film is all about growing old, and consists many tragical, and not at least, creepy moments. It has a social-worker called Gerri, married with Tom, so that will be "Tom &amp; Gerri", the PERFECT couple, with the PERFECT life where everything's in its element. And then we have this wanna-be-young lady, Mary, ( I would guess at the age of 55?) trying desperately to find a man (young or old, hot or not) to live with. She is a colleague of Gerri and often comes to their house and joins dinner parties. Tom and Gerri are surrounded by depressed people, envying them. Their house becomes the center of happiness and it seems that everyone tries to catch a glimpse of their perfect life. But of course, they all fail. The most tragical incidence of them all is Mary. In order to puzzle her life back together she flirts obviously with both Tom and Joe, their 30 year old son. The way she does that, makes you want to slap her in the face and ask her to get a life. Also we've got Ken, a fat, old, sweaty man with the most massive tummy you'll ever see. He's nasty behavior makes the whole "happy vs. depressive"- theme even more apparent. Enough about that, the reason why I thought this was a strong, yet tragic, movie is basically because it makes you feel that life is unfair and for some people the luck just doesn't change. For me ( I am 16), I started to get this fear of growing up, because I just do'not want to end up in the same situation and be as unhappy as Mary. So I believe that for mature folks this might give you a revelation of life. But for the younger generations, I fear that you might get to disturbed afterwards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film about life... (but a little bit artificial)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are familiar with Mike Leigh's body of works, you'll be familiar with the themes and the setting of this film. In fact, for the first few minutes you might even be thinking "Oh dear... Another Year, another Mike's Leigh's movie". Then slowly this becomes something that somehow stays with you, especially, I suppose, if you are a slightly older person than I am. This is not only a film about relationships, but it's a film about growing old and what relationship mean to a person who's growing old. You've got the old happy perfect couple on one side of the spectrum, the old man who starts his day and ends his day by drinking a can of beer (and obviously has many of them in between), the ageing 40 something woman, who suffers form depression and her to drinks herself to the point of embarrassing herself all the time, you've got the recently widowed man whose life seems to have stop making sense since the death of the wife. Anyway, in other words, this isn't a happy depiction of life: it is after all a Mike's Leigh's film. It's a film about real life, about little moments, silences, gestures, little things. There are so big resolutions, no big twists, not a lot of character development, because after all in life we don't really change much and the biggest twist one may have in his life over the course of one year, is that his or her car might have broken down.A lot has been made about how Mike Leigh like to shoot his films (rehearsing for 6 months with the actors, letting them improvise and basically writing down the script as he goes along). In this one he ended up dividing his film into 4 season and he gave each of them a different look and feel. Well, to be honest, there's absolutely nothing new or original in that: summer looks shining and warm, winter is obviously grey, foggy and with muted colours, perfectly in keeping with the last chapter which is mainly about death.The film is pretty slow and yet quite mesmerising. The wonderful performances have a lot to do with the success of this film and I wouldn't be surprise if I ended up seeing some of those names getting some sort of nomination at the Oscars next year (and of course the BAFTA... You know those Brits, are so patriotic).However I did find some of the dialogue a bit fake and forced (especially the scenes at the dinner table with the new girlfriend). Everybody is always waiting for somebody else to finish their sentence before speaking again during the busiest dialogue scenes. On the other hand, during the slower and more quiet scenes silences and awkward moments are stretched a bit too far. It didn't quite feel right to me.At the end of the day I couldn't really help feeling that the film is a bit too indulgent in a few places and some of those scenes could have been trimmed a lot more in the editing (I suppose, that's the danger of filming sequences in one very long take: there's probably not a lot of coverage to shorten things with).Critics have loved it, of course, and I can see why. This is the kind of film that stays with you... But really, in a few years time will we go back to "Another Year" and watch it again? I don't think so.From Moviegeekblog (http://wp.me/p19wJ2-2L)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The insular couple of London</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leigh is a good filmmaker, no doubt. The film has a very nice look, changing subtly for the seasons, winter being rather blue, as is what the film has made many viewers. Acting is superb and the script/unscript is fine, though in its worst moments I thought of Handke whom I dislike quite a bit. Since everybody here knows the story line I think all I can appropriately add is my disdain for the "happy" couple and their 30 year old boy. As an earlier poster and a German lady in an audience where Leigh took questions thought, this couple had no business having any kind of relationship with the poor victim of life and their noblesse oblige. They were in control and they should have been responsible for drawing boundaries. Instead they treated her with barely disguised disdain. The relationship was a contrivance that allowed Leigh to get even with all those irksome aunts he disliked as a child. The number of disapproving eyebrow and glance movements among mom, pop, and junior became tiresome, as well. A nasty side of Leigh I did not previously observe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An absolute terrible film and a complete waste of my time. There is not a single positive to take from this film as it only wastes 129 minutes of my life which I am never to see again. This film bases itself on the four seasons of a married couple who help out their friends and family around them while their lives are in jeopardy. It is clearly meant to be an emotional film at times with some very 'dramatic' scenes with seeing an overweight man cry about his life. However, the poor acting does not at all help with the plot of this film. Having had 2 friends fall asleep whilst I watched it with them (one of which has never before fallen asleep in a film) proves my point at how excruciating this film is to watch. Never to be watched again, Thanks (!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the film I felt like I was subjected to a narrow depressed and trapped view of life with absolutely no redeeming concepts whatsoever. It is a decent film for the young to watch so they can maybe appreciate their youth more but for a middle aged single woman to watch its irritating, not because it exposes truths, but because it denies other truths. It confirms negative stereo types in a way that seems absolute. Not one happy single character? Only companionship can bring happiness? Groundbreaking stuff this..Although I appreciate subtlety I felt like a distinction needed to be made between alcohol consumption and loneliness. As it were its such a convincing film that being single and middle aged is a sentence to eternal misery that I would not be surprised if a couple of people off themselves after seeing this entirely negative film towards people who age alone. What is entirely annoying is that Another Year is no more than a skilled (rather than talented) portrayal of stereo types - holistically boring if it were not so excruciatingly painful due to its lack of imagination, based on well worn truths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brave but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should say that i'm not a great fan of Mike Leigh so perhaps a Mike Leigh film was never going to be for me! And before anyone tells me that I can't handle 'gritty reality', or that I am a Devilish Hollywood-worshipper I can tell you that neither of those things is true. In fact the supposition that Mike Leigh's films are 'reality' any more than any of Disney's offerings is reality quite gets my goat (i'll rant about that a bit more in a minute).However I had reasonably high hopes for this film from the reviews and trailers. In the end though I felt very disappointed.I have read other reviewers saying how wonerfully 'real' the characters are, how this is a true reflection of 'reality' and 'real' life. Well I hate to say this but it's not real, it's a film, and if you look a little closer it actually isn't even good at being a film about 'reality'. Far from being 'real' the characters are *incredibly* one-dimensional, and no character illustrates this more than the supposedly 'beautifully crafted' (to nick another reviewers words) character of Mary. 'Beautifully crafted'? No, no, no! Could someone please tell me a little more about Mary, other than that she is a sad drunk teetering on the edge of life? At what point in the film are we shown an inkling of the human inside/behind the awful blanket that is smothering this character? If Mary was at all 'crafted' it was done by a man with a big hammer and chisel who was in a rush to get out of the workshop.I have known many people with *real* life-threatening problems, but they all have a person inside, we never meet Mary, not really. Instead Mary is just a sharp stick, a stereotype to please our expectations, the only reaction we can possibly have as we shuffle through the aisles with our half-eaten bags of m&amp;m's is 'oh how tragic', 'oh wasn't Mary a terribly tragic person?' &amp; 'oh it was so 'real', we should be nice to people who have problems'. I'm sorry, I don't buy it. Anyone who thinks that is 'real' is living in a different world to me, and I am glad I am not there.What are we left with if it isn't 'gritty reality', well i'm afraid we are left with 'grim reality', the reality is that this film is a cheap trick, what we are spoon-fed is what we (sadly) think reality is all about. If you aren't willing to buy into this then you'll probably find yourself checking your watch as the minutes drag. Does the fact that this film doesn't offer up anything 'real' matter? Do I even *want* to watch reality? Probably not in all honesty, so I am glad that there are film-makers out there to offer up meditations on life, i'm just sad that Mike Leigh's offering is so 2 dimensional. So that's all the negative stuff out of the way. There were some positives. The film started well and to be fair I actually quite enjoyed the first half. I felt the actors put in some good performances and I wasn't too bothered by the slow pace of the 'action'. However by the second half I needed to believe in these characters, but with so little to believe in I was left feeling sadly empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted, but only partially successful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leigh, in my experience, always produces films for grown ups. Thoughtful, brave and interesting. His actors are also excellent. He has built his reputation on realism. The acting in this film was as good as ever. But I was left wondering why I felt so dissatisfied. I reflected and concluded that the film is very sentimental in its portrayal of marriage. The married couple here are, apparently, blissfully happy. They clearly share interests, so far so good. But there were several points in the film where it seemed to me that there bliss was founded on neither of them actually challenging the other's opinions or behaviour. Is this really what Leigh intends us to see as the recipe for a happy marriage? The moment there is the whiff of conflict, shutting up? The issue of their son was also hinted at but never explored. Even more curiously this happily married couple appear to socialise solely with singleton social mis-fits. The single people in this film are unremittingly portrayed as lonely, drunk, sad, incompetent or aggressive. How realistic is this? It seemed that we were being treated to a piece of propaganda in favour of marriage. Finally, what happened to the opening character, played by Imelda Staunton? Either this section was irrelevant and should have been cut, or it had a relevance and was left hanging. Untidy and lacking in form.</fullReview>

Yes, good performances, a well-observed snapshot of how a certain section of complacent middle class people in London live (these are what bring it up to a four), but why all the plaudits? By the end of the film the over-riding emotion is 'so what?'. Four loosely connected vignettes which may have been fun putting together but really don't constitute entertainment.

Their son Joe (Oliver Maltman) is single and a lawyer for poor tenants. Mary keeps flirting with Joe. Tom's school friend Ken (Peter Wight) drops by for a visit. Joe brings over girlfriend Katie and Mary is bitter. The family attends the funeral for the wife of Tom's brother Ronnie (David Bradley). Ronnie gets into a fight with his estranged son Carl. Tom and Gerri have a simple happy life but people around them seem to have problems.Mike Leigh produces a not-very-dramatic relationship at the center of this movie. He surrounds them with a quirky dysfunctional cast of characters. Mary is hilariously sad. The Hepples are so reserved that she provides most of the energetic dramatic drive. Their calm demeanor keeps the tension from rising. The performances are very human. It may be better to have Mary as the main character although that would be a different movie. This is a very subdue family considering the drama around them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a low-key but strong drama. We follow four seasons in the lives of the middle-aged married couple Tom and Gerri (Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen), their 30-year-old bachelor son Joe and Gerri single colleague Mary (Lesley Manville). A collection meetings and small events showing Leigh's ability to transform the everyday life into something meaningful. The film's strength is in my opinion the strong person characters and the dialogues between the characters. The interpersonal stands in the center, and the film is about the important things in life such as friendship, happiness and having a meaningful life. This film was both touching and engaging. The story allows us to follows a handful of people and their lives through one year. We get to know the main characters, and can take part in their lives, for better or worse. A great movie experience of everyday life and every day people. This film is a winner!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One year. In your life? In anybody's life?

She hasn't seen a doctor in a year and she wants some pills to put her out. The best of us portraying the worst of us asking god to anesthetize us. But god won't hear of it. She recommends we get some counseling instead - from her servant and representative in this world, Gerri - whose better half Tom also reaches out benevolently to those less fortunate, caricatures full of ticks and jerks and obsessive behavior and mournful looks. And so we experience a year ? four seasons in the life of these people who are also angels as they toil in the garden. We're unaccustomed to their presence, their goodness. We wonder why they don't have problems. It's because their friends and family do. Though benevolent and sublime, Tom and Gerri can only offer so much help. And when Gerri feels the line has been crossed that threatens her family, the stern parent emerges. Not angry, but devastatingly disappointed. That straightens Mary right up. And in the end Mary seems to accept that she won't be lifted up. She'll be lucky to not be left behind. But that's better, even if you can't understand what anyone around you is saying.

		<shortDescription>Hey, docs? Haven't you ever heard of "Menopause?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not giving this a 10 rating for a couple of reasons. With all due respect, I love Mike Leigh's work and Another Year is a great flick, without a doubt. Realistic, about lonely, desperate, hurting people and on the other side of the spectrum, it's about a well-educated, seemingly happy, financially-sound couple who entertain a lot and never lacked for WINE and BEER in their household.I have a few gripes to mention and then I'll get off my soap box and go on with my life! Imelda Staunton's character met with her female doctor and outright told her she was not sleeping well. Now this female doctor obviously asked the usual questions, are you depressed, how is 'husband', etc., any changes in your life! Yea, there are changes in my life, doc! I'm going through the change! Then the doc proceeds to tell this poor woman she needed to see a counselor, knowing that Janet was in her menopause! Say what? Give me a break! Does the word Menopause mean anything to these dense doctors! Sleep was good before my menopause but as soon as it hit me, I had trouble sleeping as well and told my doctor thus and she in turn told me that I may need counseling and that it could all be in my head. Needless to say, I dropped her like a hotcake, and found another doctor who said it was just that, menopause/hormonal. But here is poor Janet pleading to this doctor, "I can't sleep. I need you to give me something for that, doc!" Nothing can be more annoying or depressing then to be told that it's all in your head! Then it's time to find another doctor! Needless to say, Ms. Staunton portrayed that character extremely well! And her counseling session with Gerri, sad as it may have been, was rather comical in a way as well.Then we have Ruth Sheen's character--Gerri, who is seemingly kind and loving and caring and invites Mary to her home for dinner or BBQ each season to tell her, long story short, that she needs independent professional help. Yes, Mary, a woman most likely in her 40's, single who is annoying at times, a dreamer, desperate, lonely, depressed but the last thing she wanted to hear is that she is accountable for her own actions. How self-righteous can one be! Have another glass of wine, Mary! Plus Gerri often rolled her eyes to others when Mary was around. Why bother inviting the poor woman if you feel that way? I just felt Gerri just tolerated Mary. However, Mary was indeed extremely needy and clung to her like a leech. I didn't like the fact that toward the end Mary took liberties in Tom and Gerri's household by assuming that they would not notice the cigarette smell in their home. And, too, dropping by their home soon after the funeral without letting them know in advance that she was coming. Tom and Gerri have one son, Joe, who is what they called, a dark horse--single, in his 30's but does finally get a girlfriend, who is a 'happy-go-lucky', pun intended, friendly chick and a vegan at that! LOL!Gerri had invited Mary to dinner one day and once there they offered her some wine, which was no lack thereof in that household, I can tell you that! Mary was encouraged by her to spend the night as she drank herself into a stupor and was not fit to travel home. Very wise on Gerri's part.Ken, a middle-aged, single man who is Tom and Gerri's close friend, is another lonely, desperate, depressed soul who is invited I believe for the weekend this time--food and lots of drink once again! I swear they drank so much wine at one sitting, more than I ever drink in a year's time! But food and drink was plentiful. I did love the ambiance and coziness of their home; and the fact that they had an allotment garden that they tended until harvest time. Then you have Tom's deadbeat brother, Ronnie, who I found to be a cold fish and a selfish man. I gathered that he really didn't love his wife, who had just passed on. He had a son, Carl, who hardly visited him,(and who always wore black even as a kid); a bitter, rebellious, aggressive, discontented man who did not get along with his father, and tried to avoid him as much as possible.I was quite impressed with the characters and how they were portrayed by these exceptional actors. The camera shots were exceptional. Mr. Leigh is well-known for capturing an actor's every expression to perfection.The ending was rather a sad one. I shudder to think, though, that Mary and Ronnie could ever be a twosome!There you have it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Leigh's 'Another Year' at first feels like a very smug movie: a likable, affluent couple pass their time together over the course of a year, often in the company of variously inadequate friends who alternately entertain them and require their support. Eventually, a drama emerges from the growing stresses of one of these relationships; but it's a very well-signalled development. What makes the film a success is the sheer skill with which director and cast pull off the individual encounters: Leigh famously prepares for writing the final drafts of his scripts through improvisation, and this film in particular feels like an assembly of scenes emerging from a workshop, but there's no denying they're beautifully done, drawing you into the misery of the characters even where you knew exactly what was coming. And gradually, the film's perspective shifts from that of the insiders (whose compassion is increasing revealed as finite) to that of the outsiders. The abrupt ending offers no promises of happiness to those who didn't have it already when the movie began.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Leigh is among the best filmmakers working today, and he's crafted a little hide out of actors and audiences who continuously return to his work knowing that whatever it is that he's making will be top dog. Another Year stands along with his best films, if they could even be quantified - he's made so many great pictures that you lose count going over his filmography. In a way he reminds me of a British version of Robert Altman (though perhaps more dour); he has a wonderful way with words, and allows actors the freedom to explore their character's internal corners. Best of all, his films reflect life as it is - without judgment, without criticism; he wants us to feel them, and makes us empathize with even his most vile characters almost unconditionally. Another Year is among his most tranquil films, a reflection of life passing, and Tom and Gerri are among his most understanding, quiet characters - they listen, understand, and make peace when things are turbulent. Don't we all wish we had friends like that?</fullReview>

However, when the movie subject and scenario is such a textbook example, the story development process flows in a very simple deductive logic, which lets you figure out what'd be going on easily next, and it gets boring in the middle.

		<fullReview>"Mike Leigh miserabilism" is definitely a thing?my fearless, insomniac wife warned me about "All or Nothing," the one with Timothy Spall as a bummed-out cabdriver?but "Another Year" is a different story. True, three of the main characters appear to be clinically depressed, one virtually catatonic after the death of his wife, but the film is really about Tom and Gerri, a well-matched, well-adjusted couple in their 60s trying to deal with their friends' (or in Tom's case, brother's?the catatonic one's) impending collapse. The Leigh technique of guided improvisation and many, many runthroughs really makes the big ensemble scenes work; Leslie Manville as self-absorbed, self-medicating Mary is the standout here, though I was grateful for a less fraught scene in which T and G's son turns up with a talkative new girlfriend (she was the fiery flamenco teacher in "Happy-Go-Lucky") and the four of them just have a lively conversation. Interesting that the sane, happy characters all have fulfilling public-sector jobs?psychiatric social worker, physical therapist, legal aid lawyer; Tom's helping to redesign the London sewer system. Jim Broadbent, who plays him, is delightful as always (unless you count "Cloud Atlas"), and though this one may not have the intensity of Leigh's best work, it really connects on an emotional level.

		<shortDescription>The culmination of Leigh's insightful cinematic style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leigh's cinema is certainly not for everyone, especially those unwilling to look deep within the human emotion pool and see their own reflection. In his most recent work, he brings together practically all of his directing powers, culminating in a very serious, and sometimes charming, story focusing on a loving couple and the various sorts they have remained friends with over the years.Like so many of the greatest directors, Leigh has established a strong rapport with a small collection of actors, resulting in very strong performances every time out. Here, frequent collaborators Jim Broadbent, Ruth Sheen and Lesley Manville shine in their respective roles, particularly Manville as an alcoholic, depressed, middle-aged woman clinging to the one relationship in her life that has any meaning or happiness. As the film progresses, albeit without any sort of manufactured "plot," we witness life as it really is: strange, funny, at times exhausting and stressful, yet having the possibility of being rewarding and worthwhile. Though this may not be Leigh's absolute best work (my initial response to that would be All or Nothing), it does ring true as a definite Mike Leigh film. It explores the entire spectrum of human feeling and behavior, yet it doesn't do this in a cynical or manipulative manner. Rather, it seems to unfold naturally and coherently. It views us all as similar in the sense that we are subjected to this world and its cruelty, yet it is possible to attempt to rise above it through reaching out in love and compassion. Not sentimental, just hopeful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>British director Mike Leigh invites us on a journey through life itself through his film Another Year (2010), winner of the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury-Special Mention at Cannes.Narrated in a linear fashion, the film tells what happens during a year in the life of a happy couple living in north London, as well as what happens with some of his relatives and friends. The story is divided into four chapters, each represented by one season.It is a tender and simple plot, which deals with the inevitable cycle of years, how life happens and we sailed through it.Throughout history we see the characters face loneliness, compassion, and the pursuit of love and happiness in daily life. The situations they face are merely ordinary and they have nothing out of the ordinary, which helps to generate empathy with the audience, because the audience can easily identify with what they see on screen, and the anguish of the characters before which they live.It's a film that becomes a mirror of everyday life, but offers different views and ways of seeing things, because each character is different. Presents comedy situations, but never loses the seriousness of what counts.It's a good script, developed from the characters (well played) which is common in the style of Leigh, and works because it gives that naturalness, fluidity and richness to the story, which make them unique to each of his films.Mike Leigh tells us what happens for a year in the life of the characters, and is a year where we see the characters change (for better or worse) and is a year that does not end all that happens. It's a film that touches deep issues and leaves the viewer thinking about everything that can happen in just one year of his life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This a quite worth film to watch, but please: do not watch it if you are in the mood for a comedy. This is just plain drama: human's emotional misery &amp; dysfunctional family &amp; friendship relationships. REALITY really is shown here. It's actors give an amazing, heart-felt performance, every &amp; each of them, capable of long &amp; close shots, showing the transformation in themselves.If you watch this film &amp; you liked it, you might want to watch - Muriel's wedding - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110598/ - Young adult - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1625346/ - Greenberg - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1234654/ - Me and You and Everyone We Know - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415978/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesley Manville as Mary, Where is her Oscar?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Year ? CATCH IT (A-) Another Year is a look inside the sixty years old married happy couple and their friends and family for next four seasons. This is not a movie but a couple's life which rolls in front of you and you just sit back and watch how they spend their lives through different seasons. Another Year is unlike any other thing I have ever seen. There are many few movies around which stand alone on strong characterization. The characterization of especially the married couple Tom, Gerri and Gerri's friend Mary is so powerful that in few seconds you forget that it's a movie as it seems like a camera on someone life. The performance by Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen are simply awesome and seems so effortless. But it's Lesley Manville as Mary who steels the frame as the lonesome, drunken woman trying desperate to find some peace in her life. Her performances is one of the strongest performances I have ever seen, it just pierce through your heart. There is this melancholy pain in her eyes and voice that just indescribable. I really don't know how Academy Awards ignore her performance. She truly deserved an Oscar for her remarkable performance. Oliver Maltman as Joe and Karina Fernandez as Katie are effortlessly good. The other supporting cast also did a fine job. In the end, I do like the whole movie but except Mary, Joe and Katie other character's story isn't that exciting and I also feel that we don't see a happy ending for Mary but still it's a powerful movie which leaves a strong impression. Highly Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First things first - the DVD categorically states that this is director Mike Leigh's 'best film to date'. It isn't and possibly could never be.That's because this is an 'Autumn' film - as is Leigh's career and the age of its chief actors. It glows rather than scowls, which Leigh's best and provocative material did, such as in Secrets and Lies.There's a certain sure-footed predictability about this one and it's best for those who've grown up with and alongside Leigh and his regular gang of improviso actors. I'd also say it's more Radio 4 than 2 with a cheery middle-class turn from a wonderfully rounded (&amp; naturally bearded) Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen. He, as civil engineer, who can mock his own unimportance and she as counsellor attached to a large GP surgery. They're sort of like chalk and cheese but often a chalky cheese and their natural chemistry and dialogue is both comfortable and rewarding.Lesley Manville supplies the humour - as scatty, tippling medical secretary at the Surgery and who decides to buy a car. "What sort?" Tom (Broadbent) asks, "Small - and red" she replies. She admires but can't always respect her friend's rock-solid marriage and underneath, she is lonely, needy and insecure.As always with a Mike Leigh, a small band of lesser characters bolster and add flavour to the mix - depressive insomniac Imelda Staunton who is sent to Gerri (Sheen) for treatment, along with various friends and family, with such notables as Phil Davies providing solid performances.So, over the course of a year, we gently (not TOO gently!) see a death in the family and a birth. As is usual in Leigh's character-led comedy- dramas, it comes to an agreeable end, without fanfare nor finality and we are left subtly satisfied, rather than on a high, or low.I have to admit that I put off buying this film as a DVD until now as it appeared to be too cosy and perhaps taking a direction away from where I prefer Mike Leigh to be. But, the central couple become rather like Aunty and Uncle, totally believable, very human and with some foibles that have to be endured, rather than enjoyed. For any lover of Leigh, it's a must, though that sedate pace and lack of Hollywood (or indeed the typical Brit comedy formula, as in Made in Dagenham, Tamara Drewe or The Full Monty) will put some off.I watched it twice in two days and like a familiar jumper, could ravel myself up in it again, actually quite soon!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leigh's films have been constantly sterling all these years, I have only watched three so far NAKED (1993, a 6/10), VERA DRAKE (2004, a 9/10) and SECRETS &amp; LIES (1996, a 8/10), in ANOTHER YEAR, Leigh conspires a more conventional route rotates around a cozily married old couple, Tom &amp; Gerri, and their 4-seasoned episodes with the closest people to their life. There are no sensational or hyped headliners in the plot as illegal abortion in VERA DRAKE or a deserted black daughter looking for her birth mother in SECRETS &amp; LIES. The film patiently adjusts its object on a more everyday entanglement of personal liaisons, it is a strong suit for Leigh's long-time collaborated old hands with an incredible dexterity. Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen are plainly fitting as the day-to-day bustling couple (mainly in their little kaleyard), meanwhile Lesley Manville has a more showy role as their friend and Sheen's co-worker, which has created a thorny case of category ambiguity, I put her in supporting category (and my current winner in 2010) against the fact that her screen time is bountiful enough to match with Sheen, she is magnetic in playing a desperately lonely outsider of the family but enthusiastically partakes her involvement which subsequently sabotages the friendship with the family and more significantly exacerbates her own world of misery, Manville's performance is poignantly reminiscent of the Oscar-nominated Brenda Blethyn in SECRETS &amp; LIES, her Oscar-snub is a rueful crime.Leigh is an incisive observer, and he knows exactly how to put the mundane inspirations of trivial happeningsinto a well-finessed storyline and potently interpreted by his swell cast. Plus, the film never retreats to a compromised stance to whitewash the authenticity of its various characters, all the emotions, confrontations and evocations are tangible, in his unique way, Leigh constructs a vividly pitched comedy-drama, an intrepid internal journey to sense and assimilate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>British screenwriter and director Mike Leigh's eleventh feature film which he wrote, is a British production which was produced by British television producer Georgina Lowe. It was shot in Derby and on various locations in London, England and premiered In competition at the 63rd Cannes Film Festival in 2010. It tells the story about Tom and Gerri Hepple, a middle-aged married couple who lives in London where Tom works as geologist and Gerri as a receptionist at a health center. Tom and Gerri has a good life and are often visited by their successful thirty-year-old son Joe, but they also have a close friend named Mary who is not at all content with her single life.Acutely and precisely directed by English filmmaker Mike Leigh, this finely paced and dialog-driven character piece portrays an involving and intimate story about interpersonal relations, family relations, coming-of-age, loneliness, friendship, marriage and love during four seasons in London, England. While notable for it's naturalistic urban milieu depictions, ardent production design by Simon Beresford, cinematography by British cinematographer Dick Pope, his seventh collaboration with Mike Leigh, and a subtle score by English composer Gary Yershon, this existentialistic, humane and poignantly atmospheric slice of life conveys a charmingly humorous and unsentimental tale.This incisively written independent film which depicts several studies of character, is impelled and reinforced by it's stringent narrative structure, the heartfelt, understated and remarkable acting performances by English actor Jim Broadbent, English actress Ruth Sheen, English actress Lesley Manville and some fine acting performances from a great supporting cast. A profoundly moving and thoughtful drama which gained, among other awards, the ALFS Award for British Actress of the Year Lesley Manville at the 31st London Film Critics Circle Awards in 2010, the NBR Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 82nd National Board of Review Awards in 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film didn't have the intense emotional/psychological impact on me that NAKED and SECRETS AND LIES did, it's now my favorite of Leigh's post-90's work. I think it's oversimplifying things to say that the film promotes a "married good, single bad" sensibility but I can also see how someone would walk away with that impression. Tom and Gerri appear to have an ideal relationship, loving and supportive, while all their single friends and relatives are walking disasters of varying degrees. But it's not really about the institution of marriage so much as having someone to lean on. I also wondered if the light-hearted jabs and quips between Tom and Gerri were signs of a sort of long-developed defense mechanism, or perhaps more accurately a mask for the lack of real communication. Maybe I'm just looking for things that aren't there.Regardless, Leigh gets the usual outstanding performances from his cast. Lesley Manville's shabby, almost cruel desperation is heartbreaking, and Jim Broadbent is big and warm. But the true revelation here is Ruth Sheen. She has an astonishing presence, you just want her to be on the screen at every moment. Her face shows hints of what's being buried, both concern and exasperation. I looked at her other credits, and it's almost entirely bit parts and television appearances. Her only other major roles in feature films are THE YOUNG POISONER'S HANDBOOK and Leigh's earlier HIGH HOPES -- both of which I've added to my list.There are beautiful moments in this film, and it moves surprisingly fast. It's hard not to get wrapped up in the lives of these characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Year comes closer than any kind of fiction I've come across to depicting my parents hanging out with their friends. That sounds like faint praise, and to some extent it is (realism is so 1800s). But to the film's credit it's really easy to step into its world, mundane and beautiful, with all the comfort and humour and vague worry for others that comes with the cozy upper middle-class lifestyle. It represents a period of life, so rarely captured, where the years start to blur together and the time for new adventures is thoroughly over. It feels not just real but genuine.The crux of the film is Mary, the kind of quasi-disastrous friend that everyone can identify with, the one you keep around for the crazy stories but who always seems like a bit of a chore to deal with. She's the type of person for whom the passage of time is not comfort but horror, as all of her failures get less cute and more tragic, just as they do as the night wears on and she gets drunker. She's a tragic character in the midst of happy people, and that's enough to make any viewer thoroughly uncomfortable.And then there's the last segment of the film, where all the warmth and comfort goes out the window, and the sad reality that's been underlying everything this whole time emerges. And there are things only gestured to that lie outside the sliver of time the film gives us access to.Another Year is a slight film in some ways, with its only seeming goal being to capture a way of life at this peculiar moment in time. It's almost perfect in this, although some might not be interested in a perfect depiction of a mundane life. For those who think realism still has something to offer us, Another Year is a great film to reaffirm that belief.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A year in life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would call this my favorite of Mike Leigh's films. I found it really exceptional. It's one of those works of art you'd like to send into deep space in the hopes that aliens found it so you could present it to them with the message: "This is what it was to be human." The film is striking in that it's a profoundly sad work that focuses on two profoundly happy- and decent- people. An aging London couple, successful and still truly in love after decades of marriage, have over friends from various times in their lives, all of whom envy them almost incomprehensibly. Happiness is possible in Leigh's world, but it is also a miracle, almost a freak-accident. "Another Year" is powerfully novelistic. Indeed, it reminded me not so much of any film I can name as much as "Anna Karinina"- a study of a multitude of personalities over the course of time- one year for Leigh vs. Tolstoy's decades, but the effect is the same. We all move closer to death- some with grace and wisdom, most with cowardice and unfulfilled longing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another solid effort from Leigh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer-Director Mike Leigh has always had the knack to script up intriguing British characters, year after year. And as another year passes, he has done it again in the verbally entertaining "Another Year". The movie did earn a deserving Best Original Screenplay nomination. I believe that Leigh is now in the pre-production stage of his next film which focuses on the life of Mel Gibson, it's called "Another Beer". OK, enough. "Another Year" is set during an entire year and its seasons. Its central characters is a happily married British couple in their 50's named Tom &amp; Gerri; they are not too cartoonish in their personalities but they live their lives in appreciation of what they have. Gerri's work colleague Mary is the chattiest character in the movie. She is also in her 50's, single and dealing with a past filled with heartbreaks. She constantly lands in the Tom &amp; Gerri habitat (invited and uninvited) to aid her loneliness and to fill their wine glasses with an abundance of vino. Mary presents herself as a Proud Mary even though she knows she can better herself, and is constantly looking for a revival in her life in the form of a younger lover. One of the targets that Mary seeks or stalks is Joe, Tom &amp; Gerri's polite son who is 20 years her minor. Obviously, with a Leigh flick, one knows that it is not limited to a very small circle of characters. There are a few more eccentric characters that make you chuckle including Ken (played with right stuff by Peter Wright), Tom &amp; Gerri's long-time boozy buddy who also has loneliness &amp; alcohol-dependence issues of his own. Leigh orchestrates and scripts "Another Year" in a simplistic mode which actually develops the narrative as a very authentic product. Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen were first rate in their performances as the dependable Tom &amp; Gerri. But this was the thespian show of Lesley Manville with her outstanding performance as Mary. Man o man, why on earth did Manville get snubbed of a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination! Manville's execution of displaying a wide array of complex emotions was a treat to watch; even in those few seconds that she was silent, there was still a lot to say of her character within her facial gestures. It will not take too many "another years" until Manville finally starts bringing home the acting trophies. Some might find "Another Year" boring because it is not another movie that high drama has to happen constantly throughout the narrative, but because of its simplicity and authenticity (and of course Manville's grand performance), it is why I think that you should not wait another day to view "Another Year". **** Good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>mature, vibrant film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom and Gerri met on their first day in college, have loved each other ever since, and now many years later put gentle pressure on their 30-year-old son Joe to provide grandchildren. In the intervening years, they have accumulated, like us all, their coterie of waifs and strays, friends whose lives haven't turned out just as idyllic as Tom and Gerri's. They turn up, some of them too often, using Tom and Gerri's place as their bolt-hole from reality. Tom and Gerri do more than put up with them. They are happy to see them.The film opens with a portrayal of depression and anxiety from Imelda Staunton that is so powerful, it is a shock to realise that she drops away from the narrative once her path crosses Gerri. She sets the tone in terms of brittleness for a life lived off screen, and sets the pace for her acting colleagues to follow. They do not disappoint. Lesley Manville as Mary is all self-centered chat, needy and insensitive, but with a charm that makes you think she could be someone you would like to spend time with if she would just put down the glass, and listen. This is clinically observed, a nuanced presentation of life's grand disappointments and ephemeral compensations. Every time some new character appeared, you will find yourself thinking "That's like Miss X" or "He just like uncle Y". Empathetic, naturalistic, amusing and heart-wrenching. Masterful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In addition to social commentary, this movie is about many things: friendship, aging, haves and have nots, personal responsibility, fate. The story centers around a year in the lives of Tom (a geological engineer) and Gerri (a psychotherapist) and their relatives and friends. Tom and Gerri are in late middle age and are comfortably ensconced in their upper middle class life in London. They seem to have mastered living the good life--their relationship is loving, they get along well with their adult son, they tend to their vegetable garden, they enjoy a good wine (but not to excess), they have successful careers, they are apparently healthy, they have a sense of humor. Tom and Gerri have friends, and this is where things get interesting. Most of their friends have problems, predominately alcoholism in response to the lack in their lives of the very things that Tom and Gerri have. The two primary friends we meet are Mary and Ken, both single and alcoholics. It seems that Tom and Gerri do not associate, as expected, with couples who are equal in achievement and general well being. I can see why Ken and Mary seek the company of Tom and Gerri, but why do the latter two continue the relationships? Is it because they recognize their charmed existence and feel some obligation to share with others who are not so blessed? The relationship with Mary is the most problematic. Mary has been a secretary to Gerri for many years and we tune in here after they have known each other for many years. I never sensed that Tom and Gerri ever truly enjoyed being with Mary. In bed, after a difficult evening with Mary, Tom comments to Gerri, "It's sad." It would be good to know how their personal relationship with Mary evolved. Mary has a knack of drinking too much and creating some very awkward social situations. She is so needy that you feel for her; on the other hand, if she were in my life, it would be hard to put up with her. Mary gives testament to the rule that it is best to bargain from strength--it is easier to get a new job if you are currently successfully employed, and it is easier to make new friends if you already have such. Playing Mary, Lesley Manville creates one of the saddest characters I have seen on screen. As presented, her personality will dictate that she will become more and more isolated and depressed as time goes on. The curious thing is why, as a therapist, Gerri has not guided Mary into getting professional help, since after twenty years Gerri sees the problem. Is it because Gerri really does not have any true bond with Mary? Is it because you cannot expect a person who is warm to understand a person who is cold? Is it because Gerri sees Mary as hopeless?In the big picture I had to ask why Tom and Gerri wound up in their positions versus how Ken and Mary wound up in theirs? I imagine that Tom and Gerri had a head start, like reasonably successful parents (the pest predictor of financial success is the success of your parents) and some natural intellectual talents. So, is this movie trying to make the point that our fate is determined by our initial conditions and our place in society? How much control do we have over our success in life? Has Gerri been a help or hindrance to Mary?Later in the movie we meet Tom's taciturn brother Ronnie and his angry son Carl. It's clear that Tom's relation with Ronnie and Carl has been strained to non-existent, but with the death of his wife, Ronnie is invited to stay with Tom and Gerri. Is there hope for any relationship there? This movie left me with a lot of unanswered questions, many of which caused me to reflect on my own life. I think this movie may be best appreciated by older folks, but the questions it raises would be valuable for younger people to think about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a real person!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leigh presents to us a film about the everyday life, the small and big events, of an old couple, Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerry (Ruth Sheen), their friend Mary (Lesley Manville) and their family. Tom and Gerry have managed to stay happy, and in love even in their old age. They provide a sharp contrast to everyone around them. All their friends and family seems to be suffering from some sort of unhappiness. The film is about growing up and taking responsibility for yourself. It also points a finger to how dependent humans are on each other for happiness. I think this film is interesting, but it has a very flat narrative. The actions are not presented as dramatic; the atmosphere is calm and sometimes worried. The lack of exaggeration creates a more realistic feeling than what is usually found in films today. And this is what I think makes the film special. That it creates feelings the audience is able to relate to, without being left with the feeling of not being good enough. By using actors that are not all known as stars worldwide Mike Leigh strengthens the impression of telling a story about real people and real life. And this is where I realize that the flat narrative isn't flat. Because when things happen to real people they suddenly mean much more. The film is a little bit hard to swallow for an inexperienced audience, and is certainly not meant for children. It probably suits better an audience from about 18 ? 20 years and older.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost as good as ANOTHER YEAR are the Comments left by the British viewers of the film. I never would otherwise have comprehended any significance in Tom and Gerri's superior education, which may have been the maker's intent to point out. If not, ANOTHER YEAR still functions as an uncompromising piece of social drama. I say uncompromising because beneath the cheerfulness and encouragements of our happy couple lie some icy truths that are neither resolved nor soothed. Indeed, there are happy contented people like Tom, Gerri, Joe and Kate who may be so through no effort of their own. Then there are unhappy people like Mary, Ken, Ronnie and Carl who may be so through no fault of their own. That the two groups so recognize each other is apparent. That, appearances and good intentions aside, the former group cannot truly help the other appears a bitter truth. There are the blessed and there are the overlooked.

		<shortDescription>Why Is Happiness Something Some People Can Never Have?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another typically somber film from Mike Leigh about a happily married couple whose stability and contentment is a magnet for every dysfunctional and desperately unhappy person in their lives.Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen are the married couple, and both, but Sheen especially, give wonderful performances. Sheen is a therapist, and an unhinged woman (Lesley Manville) who works in her office attaches herself to her like a leech, popping over for dinner, making desperate plays for her grown son and pretty much refusing to acknowledge when she's overstayed her welcome. If the movie is "about" any single character in Leigh's ensemble, it's about her, but really, like Leigh's last outing, "Happy-Go-Lucky," the film is more about the elusive specter of happiness and the mystery of why some people seem able to attain it while others can't. If you know Leigh, you know he's more fond of posing questions than answering them, so don't expect there to be resolution. The reality is that most happy people achieve their happiness through a tremendous amount of effort, while most unhappy people stay unhappy because they don't have whatever it is -- the energy, the will, the knowledge -- to change their lives for the better. "Another Year" doesn't refute that claim, and it's not exactly a cheery movie, but there's the same thrill there is in every Mike Leigh movie of watching a clutch of wonderful actors do their thing.Featuring a marvelous cameo by Imelda Staunton that starts the film and perfectly establishes its tone.Grade: A-</fullReview>

It starts very slow and then reels you in scene by scene by the sheer magnificence of the acting and the script.We tried to watch this as a family, but our kids didn't appreciate it, so we switched off. But I put an evening aside and gave it another chance. I'm so glad I did.The theme is the pleasure of strong relationships, loyal friendships, acceptance of other people, 'warts and all', and generally coming to terms with yourself in the autumn years.This is definitely one of Mike Leigh's more optimistic films, so don't think it is Vera Drake part 2 just because he cast Imelda Staunton again.</fullReview>

The power of this film lies in the character's perfect description and in the superb acting, but the narrative as well is deeply involving and intelligent. The director created a compassionate drama showing how, under the surface, no one's really happy in spite of the appearances. In the end a rewarding result reached with Leigh's repertory cast and with probably a low budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Great Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'ANOTHER YEAR': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) One of the most critically acclaimed movies of last year, as well as an Oscar nominee for best screenplay, comes from writer / director Mike Leigh (who also brought us the equally acclaimed 'HAPPY-GO-LUCKY', 'SECRETS &amp; LIES' and 'VERA DRAKE'). The film is a British comedy / drama that revolves around a happily married couple who are visited throughout the year by their family and friends who are not so happy, for the most part. It stars Jim Broadbent, Lesley Manville, Ruth Sheen, Oliver Maltman, Peter Wright and David Bradley. Although Leigh did receive an Oscar nomination for original screenplay he's admitted (as with all his movies) the actors improvised for sometime (getting into character with each other) prior to filming which grew into the final script.Broadbent plays Tom and Sheen plays Gerri, a married couple who's been together for quite some time. They have a thirty year old son Joe (Maltman) who visits from time to time. Gerri has a co-worker friend named Mary (Manville) who has been a regular house guest for the twenty years they've known her. She's an alcoholic still depressed at having her heart broken many years earlier by a married man. She's always looking for the perfect 'Mr. Right' but ignores the advances of Tom's long time good friend Ken (Wright), another regular house guest who's also an alcoholic and unhappily single. She instead gears her attention towards Joe who she's known since a boy and this makes things messy.The film is a character driven actor's movie full of lush dialogue. Scenes sometimes go on for a very long time and the movie moves at a pretty slow pace. Nothing big or eventful really happens but the drama of just every day life and our fascination with these characters is enough to involve us. Some will of course find the film slow and dull and hard to like and I'll admit at the beginning of the film I found it a bit of a struggle to become involved with but once it got going I was hooked. The characters are so relatable and likable, despite their flaws, that I was really interested and captivated in what was happening at all times, as ordinary as it might be. At 2 hours and 9 minutes I actually found it to move at a faster and faster pace as it went along. This is probably greatly due to Leigh's directing, which he probably deserves more credit for than his writing. The acting is the most amazing thing about the film though, especially Manville as Mary (she really steals the show). If you're not into deliberately slow paced character driven movies than this probably isn't for you but if you like that sort of thing you'll probably love this.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOOi1HDSXyA</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Leigh Winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Thus with the year Seasons return; but not to me returns Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn, Or sight of vernal bloom or summer's rose, Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine . . . ." John Milton, Paradise LostMy four favorite Mike Leigh films: Secrets and Lies, Vera Drake, Happy-Go-Lucky, and recently Another Year, have female characters as their center, around whom controversy swirls in either waves or ripples. Their other characteristic is that they are manic or depressive, happy or sad, rarely in between. Another Year's alcoholic Mary (Leslie Manville), though not the protagonist, is the last character shot in the film and the one throughout for whom I felt the most dread. Leigh's genius is to make me care not just about her but also for the other characters such as the happy couple Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Jerri (Ruth Sheen), against whom all others must be compared and found lacking in happiness of that unusual order. Tom and Jerri's patch of public garden is tended with a care that binds them together and serves as a motif of growth and harvest, just as Leigh segments his film into the four seasons. Like the inexorable shift of those seasons, the couple occupies a sweet center of quiet love that draws the other needy characters, like Mary, to them. In that sense, they are mature offspring of Sally Hawkins' Poppy ( in Happy-go-Lucky), who is a dangerous optimist, effervescent and reckless with her joy. The disaster-waiting-to-happen Mary is the opposite of Poppy with Mary's doomsday mien and uncontrolled emotions.Because Leigh usually works out the script with his actors, I suspect he has done the same here. I find few films where every actor is perfectly in sync with the character; such is usually the case with Leigh, whose organic dialogue building gives the film a benign naturalism. The exception in Another Year is Ken (Peter Wight): obese and appetitive, he can't stop eating and drinking and complaining about his loneliness. The character is overdrawn, almost a caricature of the self-indulgent underachiever.However, the brilliant Leigh himself recoils if you call him a realist, as he once complained at a Q and A at the Toronto Film Fest. He pointed out a scene with expressionistic, symbolic properties as characteristic of his ability to intercut, so to speak, the figurative with the realistic. His title, Another Year, synchronizes figuratively and realistically with the inevitable seasonal changes and the similar consistency of happy and sad human nature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptionally well written and acted....but also unpleasant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a hard film to heartily recommend--even though I really respect the folks who made it because it is a high quality film. That's because despite the great acting and writing, the film has many unpleasant moments and some incredibly cringe-inducing characters. So, if you can watch such a film you'll be amply rewarded...but most regular folks would never sit still for such a movie.The film centers on a happily married couple who are nearing their twilight years. Despite their contented lives, several of their close friends are desperately unhappy. One is a lost, overweight alcoholic man and the other is a lost alcoholic woman who is desperately trying to hold on to her youth. Both (particularly the lady) are well-crafted characters and your heart really breaks for them--even if they sometimes do much to make their problems worse. It really is hard viewing, as you care about them--and as the film progresses over the course of a year, you see the problems mount.So is this film worth seeing? Sure. But it might easily hit too close to home and it's a film that you might like--but you sure can't hate as it all seems so real and well constructed.</fullReview>

Certainly a toss up between this and The King's Speech.All the actors are brilliant; even the bit parts. But Lesley Manville has to be singled out and praised - thoroughly deserving of her several Awards.As much as I hated Inception - a silly waste of time that thought it probed the soul whilst simply updating the effects of various early James Bond sequences - I adored this examination of our species.When you go all the way back to Abigail's Party - cut to Secrets and Lies - then Vera Drake - and take a look at this masterpiece and you have to admire his sheer variety and ability to observe the minutiae of the human spirit.

I smiled and cried with her - she blew me away. What pathos, you could just feel for her - every emotion showed instantly - happiness, sadness, heartbreak, she deserves an Oscar! I laughed with her, I cried with her, I have been there and want to help her! This performance was the best I have seen for a very long time.

		<shortDescription>a film about real and often flawed characters and realistic situations that will resonate powerfully with audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The painful lives of others? The new film from Mike Leigh is a low key affair that explores twelve months in the life of comfortably married couple Tom and Gerri (Leigh veterans Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen). They have well-developed careers - he is a geologist, and she is a counsellor at a local clinic- a comfortable life and a warm loving home they are happy to share. They are a happy couple, content with their lot in life, and still share a deep affection for one another after four decades of marriage. But as we see through a series of gatherings throughout the year their friends and relatives are not so happy. A constant presence at these gatherings is Mary (Lesley Manville), a work colleague of Gerri's, who is something of an insecure and erratic lost soul full of self-loathing and regrets for the mistakes of her past. She likes to drink and flirt and often acts inappropriately. But she is lonely, and as the film progresses, she becomes increasingly bitter and desperate. We also meet Tom's old college friend Ken (Peter Wight), who is a painfully sad and lonely widower who has not yet found his place in life. And on one occasion their thirtysomething lawyer son Joe (Oliver Maltman) brings home his new girl friend, which somehow disturbs Mary. The film is broken into four distinctive episodes, each one capturing the bleak desperation of their friends and family. Fittingly, the winter segment is the bleakest, dealing as it does with death, loss and grief. This segment has been appropriately filmed using darker colours and greys and dull lighting by regular cinematographer Dick Pope. His lensing matches the sombre mood and captures that awkwardness of a funeral. Another Year is another gem of a film that follows many of Leigh's usual themes and preoccupations. It showcases Leigh's strengths as a filmmaker, with its wonderful and natural sounding dialogue, its unforced observational style, penetrating view into the humdrum lives of its characters, and precise attention to detail. He is superb at creating awkward comedy based around embarrassing social encounters, but the situations he creates reek of authenticity. He directs his material with such compassion and insight, and remains non-judgemental about his characters despite their obvious flaws and fatalistic acceptance of their sad lives. Leigh also draws wonderful performances from his small but effective ensemble cast. Broadbent and Sheen develop an easy going relationship and a wonderful rapport, and their gestures, looks and comfortable silences are convincing. However, Manville leaves an indelible impression as Mary, who is often ignorant of the impression she leaves. Manville brings a vulnerability and fragility to her devastating yet heartbreaking performance that stands out. There are some strong emotional moments here, but the usually pessimistic and downbeat Leigh also manages to find plenty of wry humour. Another Year is a film about real and often flawed characters and realistic situations that, like his excellent Secrets And Lies, will resonate powerfully with audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film of 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was such an amazing movie, and my personal favorite of the year. The movie relied on mostly dialogue and acting, which it did greatly. Mike Leigh just had the camera focused on a small area for a couple of minutes while smart dialouge and great acting was portrayed, giving the film its more human attitude and tone. And the acting was excellent. Jim Broadbent was great as Tom, who kind of has that dry sense of humor and is just a genuinely nice guy. Ruth Sheen was as equally as great as Gerri, showing care and empathy for Mary, and always being there for her. But Lesley Manville is the most impressive performance here. She plays Mary, the friend of Tom and Gerri. She is older, not married, no children, and still emotionally searching. Very fragile, and needy. Lesley Manville was excellent. Next, the screenplay. This earned the film its only Oscar nomination, and it was well deserved. Truly smart, sad, witty, screenplay which makes this story of everyday people so complex and interesting. It develops each character well. And Mike Leigh's directing was also excellent. He has a style of having his actors doing the work. For example, Tom and Gerri getting the door for Mary, and the camera just sits there, as the actors work together so beautifully. This film (which deserved other Oscar nominations such as Best Actress and Best Picture) wasn't nominated as much because its a much more smaller movie, with a small story about everyday people. After seeing it, I went through every Best Picture nominated movie and compared it to "Another Year" and I really think it was better than everyone. This movie is just much smaller, and very subtle. (Spoiler) So to wrap it up, I have to say that this movie had the best ending of the year. The way the camera starts at Tom at the dinner table, then pans over to John and Kate together, then behind Gerri, then infront, then eventually goes over to Tom again, then lastly to Mary, who at the time is a mess. The way the volume is cut out, and focuses on her, its so amazing, and it makes it one of the most thought-provoking moments in film that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love doesn't grow old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leigh's Another Year is a prime example of how he continues to produces masterful pieces of cinema. We follow Tom and Gerri (Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen). No this isn't the cat and mouse duo of cartoon fame. This is a nice married couple in the latter years of their marriage. Tom is a geologist and Gerri is a clinical therapist. From the very beginning we understand that this couple, though they are not as youthful as they once were, still share the same passion for one another with not a hint of anything slowing down.Their friends on the other hand have done just that. Mary (Lesley Manville), both a close friend and coworker of Gerri's, is desperately looking for love. She drinks heavily, goes on about her failed marriages, and constantly seeks attention from men, unless that person is Ken (Peter Wight), one of Tom's old chums who is single, overweight, and also smokes and drinks heavily. He too is looking for love wherever he can find it. Both Ken and Mary, though as compatible as chalk and cheese, could not be more similar.We follow Tom and Gerri as they deal with their friends and their struggles, also paying attention to what their son Joe (Oliver Maltman) is up to. He too is single, though very much in the prime of his life. Mary, who has known Joe since he was a child, can't help but throw herself uncomfortably at him, to which we the audience simply pity and cringe at how desperate she has become.What is so wonderful about this film is how totally believable the characters are. Their conversations, their occupations, their houses, their relationships, etc. Nothing is questioned, only observed. Broadbent and Sheen are completely on the same wavelength, shooting each other glances at what their friends and family say to one another. There are moments of sheer joy and entertainment, as well as scenes of sorrow, awkwardness, and borderline terror, all expertly crafted and woven together.Leigh breaks the film into four parts, one for each season. With each passing season we see the change not just in the setting but in our characters as well. Tom and Gerri represent the sun, never changing, if just for the angle at which it affects us. Their friends and family however represent the earth and all that is changed due to the seasons. There are high points and low points, all happening around the sun, a beacon of light and hope, or in this case normalcy and happiness.Though like the sun, after a while we understand what it's role is, and we focus on the changing landscape of the seasons, or the supporting characters. The most noticeable by far being Lesley Manville. She gives such an emotionally driven performance. We see her high and low, never content with her surroundings. She is either beaming with delight or overwrought with despair and frustration. Her face tries so hard to hide her feelings, but behind those eyes we see her pain and suffering. She is truly a tragic character and one that is impossible to turn away from.Leigh has created a perfect film with Another Year. It's poignancy and jubilation are a part of the circle of life. This small fraction of the lives of Tom and Gerri is a tribute to the power of love and how even though there is a lot of sorrow in this world, it's nice to know that people like Tom and Gerri are still out there, living the dream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mike Leigh's best and the best of 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the best of Mike Leigh's sometimes great ("Secrets and Lies," "Naked"), sometimes ineffective ("Vera Drake," "Happy-Go-Lucky") films. The acting is beyond superb, being invisible in its realism. Everybody is marvelous, from leads Broadbent, Manville, and Sheen) to supporting players such as Karina Fernandez as Katie.The final shot of the movie has been arguably misinterpreted by many. To me it's not necessarily as sad as it may seem. It's equally possible that Mary has undergone a spiritual awakening brought about by the remarkably tough love shown by Gerri in the final sequence. She seems in the final shot to be processing the current situation, and it's very likely she'll seek the therapy Gerri has suggested, which may lead to progress in life and love. This is one of the marks of Leigh's genius; he provides layer upon layer for those willing to seek the layers out.</fullReview>

I think it would have been more interesting to watch the tomatoes growing in Tom and Geri's allotment. At least we should have been able to see Mary's car towed away.

All very simple, at first sight, but rich and fragrant and truly complex, as meaningful things usually are. And actors...Absolutely perfect every single one of them. But Lesley Manville stands out in a role of needy drunken friend Mary. If there was ever an actor deserving an Oscar-this women is. Precise, irritating and heartbreaking.

		<fullReview>ANOTHER YEAR is another victory for Mike Leigh. How he is able to write and create characters that embody the problems we all see around us and in us is nothing short of a little miracle. This film is a microcosm of extended families and how they circle around the wounded members like feral animal groups, protecting, feeding, tending and nurturing even the most impaired ones so that they know they are safe. Leigh tackles a number of problems we are seeing in our society - alcoholism, drug dependency, depression, coping with death, dissociation between child and parent, aging, retirement, an other forms of human frailties and instead of preaching about them he simply places his characters representing these problems before us for our consideration. The film opens quietly with an interview between a severely depressed insomniac Janet (Imelda Staunton) and a kind healthcare provider Tanya (Michele Austin): Janet just wants sleeping pills but finally agrees to accept Tanya's advice to seek counseling - Janet's counselor is Gerri (Ruth Sheen) who happens be one half of the couple that glues this film together, her husband being geologist Tom (Jim Broadbent). This opening encounter sets the tone for the film: there are those who are genuinely happy (Tom and Gerri, both at retirement age but very close and share their hobby of gardening with the many friends who seek solace in their presence. They have a son Joe (Oliver Maltman) who visits often, alone, sensitive about the fact that he is 30 and without a mate. Their other friends in various stages of neediness include Mary (Lesley Manville, in a stunning performance) as divorced and deserted alcoholic whose loquacious self-centered personality usually ends her visits by sleeping over, unable to drive. Mary feels her problems will resolve if she has a car and proceeds to buy a used car that is as undependable and prone to problems as is Mary. Of interest, Gerri, Tanya and Mary all work in the same establishment and Tanya is also a frequent guest at Tom and Gerri's comfortable and comforting home. Another frequent visitor is Tom's friend Ken (Peter Wight), an aging and lonely obese man who drinks constantly and fears going to his own quite empty solitary house: he is so desperate for female companionship that he approaches the needy Mary who will have nothing to do with him. Mary fantasizes a pairing with Joe, but the fantasy crashes when Joe finally brings home a girlfriend Katie (Karina Fernandez). The film is divided into seasons - spring, summer, autumn, winter - and as the seasons pass the only evidence of progress is the well ended garden of Tom and Gerri, a garden that is as happy and productive as its owners. As winter approaches a new character is introduced - Tom's brother Ronnie (David Bradley) has just lost his wife when he discovers her dead body beside him one morning. He turns to Tom and Gerri for support and they with their extended family attend the simple funeral, a funeral completed by the time Ronnie's absentee angry son Carl (Martin Savage) arrives. In the tiny wake that follows the camera dwells on each of the faces of the 'tribe' - lingering last on the empty vessel of Mary - and begs the question 'Why can some people find happiness while others cannot even imagine it?.' Writer/director Mike Leigh's ability to create profoundly moving stories simply by placing his camera on ordinary people's lives is a unique gift as a filmmaker. He is less interested in presenting answers as in posing questions, and he is aided in this successful effort with the work of some of Britain's finest actors. This is a gentle but powerful film.

		<fullReview>Pedestrian. Prosaic. Unhappy. Unresolved. Yet compellingly watchable. This is the latest offering from British writer and director Mike Leigh. He is the epitome of the phrase that "Life is just one thing after another", so this a film without a clear beginning and end but given form by four segments in which the seasons are clearly signalled by the state of a London allotment.Leigh is noted for the collaborative manner in which he crafts his work and as usual this results in outstanding performances from a cast who portray some eclectic characters. There's Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) who are not cat and mouse but love birds approaching retirement while still in married and respectful bliss. But Tom's overweight friend Ronnie (David Bradley) and widowed brother Ken (Peter Wight) and Gerri's psychotherapy client Janet (Imedla Staunton) and work colleague Mary (Lesley Manville) have the full range of personal problems that make life so hard for so many.There is plenty of pain here but also some humour and much subtle observation of the human condition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Believe it or not--a happily married couple.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Year (2010) was written and directed by the talented Mike Leigh. It's a film about a cinematic rarity--a happily married couple.Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Mary (Lesley Manville) are a happy and contented couple who are comfortable in their life and their marriage. The title "Another Year" refers to the structure of the film, as it follows Mary and Tom through the four seasons of the year. The seasons are skillfully depicted by the work they do in their plot in a community garden.What makes the movie excellent is the relationship that the two have with other people in their lives--their son, his fiancée, their friend Gerri, Tom's brother and his nephew.The acting is uniformly excellent. Leigh has always known how to bring out the best from his actors. "Another Year" is no exception. Besides Broadbent and Manville, I have to single out Karina Fernandez as Katie, who will be the ideal daughter-in-law. However, the best performance honors, in my opinion, go to Ruth Sheen as their friend Gerri. Gerri is a basically good person whose life has taken a wrong turn, and who is intelligent enough to know that things probably won't get better. The contrast between the two contented couples, and the unhappy friend is poignant, but it rings true.This is an outstanding film, that will work well on DVD. Seek it out, watch it, and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's just another year for Gerri (Ruth Sheen) and Tom (Jim Broadbent). With each passing season their friends become more disheartened and weary, if not downright delirious as is the case with Mary (Lesley Manville). Mike Leigh's "Another Year" is driven with dialogue?surprisingly humorous given the misery of its characters.There are depressed characters, more depressed characters, and even more depressed characters. In the center of it all remain Gerri and Tom stoic at least, if not optimistic. Jim Broadbent has remarkable subtle sarcasm that he can manage to keep himself amused, not offend his guests, but entertain us all at the same time.By the time winter rolls around, "Another Year" gets heavy. But I assume that's always the case when it's not just friends, but family members, who need your support. The well written script then leaves us with intellectual sustenance as some characters just might be able to come to a sort of personal resolution in face of all the despondency.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Leigh is my kind of director. His movies are very European like , yet they are in English - Perfect! Some people say his films a little too depressing but I'm not in that camp , i lust think they are very real to life and I'm fascinated by them. Another year is a Mike Leigh gem , beautifully acted by Jim Broadbent , Ruth Sheen and especially Lesley Manville , we see into the lives of a couple who are so perfect to the extent that i didn't like them very much and a woman who is so desperately lonely that she will cling on to any form of relationship just for a bit of company. The dialogue is fascinating , as it always is in Leigh films , while the story is just the year in the life of a group of friends that have very different outlooks on life. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life without faith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film gives an interesting insight into the life of secular middle-class everyday where lives revolve around the same old mundane practices and routines year in year out. In a nutshell, this film tells what a life might be without faith. Almost every character of the film doesn't really seem to have anything meaningful to do in the life. The feelings of the loneliness and disillusionment seems to be a central topic and these characters try to soothe these feelings with more drinking and material possessions - but to no avail unsurprisingly.The only ones who have really settled down are an aging couple Tom and Gerri. However, they also become insecure quickly as their happy friends finally open their hearts. They start to realize how much their circle of friends has narrowed and their best years are behind them... They have nobody to really talk to anymore. They are alone together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I really enjoyed the first half of this movie, I'm a bit ashamed to admit that it put me to sleep in the last quarter. Can someone do a plot synopsis and tell me what happened in the Winter section? Who died and how did it end?!Like many of the others who left comments, I think Mary was the center of the film and the most pitiful character of all. I wanted to see more of her at her own home to more fully understand her desperation. In so many ways she was very beautiful yet very tragic.In all of my visits to the UK, I never sensed the inner desperation in the lives of the people there that is so vividly portrayed in this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Year is a great film about life and its realities. Through the film we follow a couple with a strong relationship, and their friends. They are in their 60's and seems to be happy. They love their garden and cultivate different sorts of vegetables together. Their son Joe often helps them with their work. Joe is searching for a girlfriend, but can't seem to find anyone available. There is a great contrast between the old couple and their friends. They are happy, but their friends struggle and don't know what to do with their lives. Gerri's friend and colleague Mary, a pretty but not so young anymore woman, can't get her life sorted out. She is constantly searching for a boyfriend, and gets more and more desperate. She even tries to hook up with Joe.The film's moral has to be: Life is good and bad, but better if you have someone to hold on to.I liked the film a lot. It left you with tons of thoughts about life. Of course the eternal question: "Why do I live?" and "Does it mean anything?" My answer after watching these films is: Live for your friends and family. Live for happiness, and sharing great times with other people. You don't have to have a boy- or girl- friend to be happy. You can create your own happiness, by living your life like you want. Trust yourself, and believe you can do it.Well, I would recommend you watch the film. It's a great movie with fantastic soundtrack and use of film-techniques. I won't reveal anything, so you have to see for yourself. And the actors are great! You will completely fall in love with one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The lives of Middle-Class Suburbites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Year comes off the back of a lot of praise, earning a 92% on Rotten Tomatoes, nominated for the Palme d'Or at Cannes and a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award. But how does it really stack up? Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) are a happily married middle class couple in London who are the glue which holds their friends and family together. Over the course of a year they have to handle their alcoholic friend Mary (Lesley Manville) as she slowly sinks into depression, their 30-year-old son Joe (Oliver Maltman) who is looking for someone else, their depressed friend Ken (Peter Wight) who too is looking for a parent and Tom's brother Ronnie (David Bradley) as he struggles with grief.The strongest aspect of Another Year is the acting: this film features a top cast and their were on the top of their game. Combined with the writing all the characters felt very real and the performances were very natural and it felt like you were watching real people. The actions and conversations too felt like you were watching real people and did not feel like a false version.But the good acting can not save a film that is a rather dull after. There are some good moments, particularly the wake but for the most part you were just watching people in their every day lives. Whilst Tom and Gerri are a happy and nice couple on a dramatic view point it is dull. Characters like Mary and Ronnie's stories would made more interesting stories then what actually on the screen and Tom and Gerri should have been supporting characters who offer help, guidance and be example of what they could be. The film is also too long and a good 15 minutes to 30 minutes could have been cut or shorten.On a technical front there were some strong little touches. The seasons were shot were different colour pallets, such as summer in a golden sunlit look to winter was in a drab grey visual with scenery to match. Mike Leigh knows where to place to camera, what to shot and has a good of tracking shots and longing shots on certain characters. The film also sticks closely of its theme of others longing to be with someone else, to be like Tom and Gerri and for the exception of Joe the other characters are dysfunctional.This is a minor gripe but I have to mention it, the film starts with Imelda Staunton being examined by a doctor because of her insomnia and it has not bearing on the plot and Staunton is only in the film for two scenes.Another Year is a very well acted film and it was obvious that there was a lot of commitment to this film, but it does not save it from being more of a dull experience then a dramatic look of ordinary people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>life in the raw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching a Mike Leigh movie is a bit like eavesdropping on the lives and conversations of people we may not know personally but whom we sure do recognize, since we see so much of ourselves reflected in them. Part of the reason for this is that Leigh always casts his films with actors who look as little like conventional movie stars as one can imagine (Hollywood, please take note). It's also because the characters he concerns himself with are ordinary middle- and working class folk, many of them middle-aged, who are suddenly waking up to the fact this may indeed be all there is to life ? just a series of ruts and dull routines on the inexorable, if sometimes dawdling, march towards impending death.The individuals in Leigh's latest work, "Another Year," perfectly fit the bill. There's Mary (Lesley Manville), a ditzy divorcée who worries she'll never meet the right man, and Ken (Peter Wight), a brooding, lonely, overweight man who feels keenly the loss of his youth; then there's Imelda Staunton in a very small role as a woman trapped in a state of depression so severe she cannot recall a single happy moment in her life. At the core of the film, however, lie Gerri (Ruth Sheen) and Tom (Jim Broadbent), a happily married couple who somehow seem to have come to terms with the realities of life and aging and, thus, serve as pillars of moral strength and emotional stability that others can lean on in times of stress. As the title suggests, the story spans a twelve-month period, with the script divided into four parts, one for each season. The "story," such as it is, is basically a series of social gatherings (including one funeral) in which the characters discuss the day-to-day realities of their lives. Only Gerri and Tom remain generally reticent, preferring rather to lend an ear and offer advice than to articulate their own views on life and relationships. As such, they provide a great calming presence both for the other characters and for the audience, and we can see why each of these individuals is emotionally drawn to them. The flawless cast also features Oliver Maltman as Gerri and Tom's thirty-year-old son, Joe; David Bradley as Tom's recently widowed brother, Ronnie; and Martin Savage as Ronnie's ne'er-do-well son, Ronnie.Set in and around London, Leigh's screenplay makes art out of small-talk, as hurting people hide their pain under a veneer of everyday banter and banalities. And it's only in rare moments that those true feelings rise to the surface and manifest themselves for all to see. That seems to be the view of life put forth in not just "Another Year" but in all of Leigh's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another very good, insightful film about the human condition from Mike Leigh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like Mike Leigh, but he's only really made one great movie: Secrets &amp; Lies. Another Year, for a long while, seems like it's ready to become at least his second best film, but, in the end, it kind of falters. It's just that, as a whole, Another Year feels a tad unfocused and it never really coalesces into a whole. C'est la vie, I suppose: Leigh's purpose is to depict real life and real life is always messy. Sometimes, though, that can be unsatisfying in a film. Another Year depicts a year in the lives of Tom and Gerri (Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen) and the people in their lives, mostly their son, Oliver Maltmen, and Sheen's co-worker and friend, Leslie Manville. Manville is perhaps the film's main character, mostly because she's the most interesting one and she gives the film's standout performance. As the film opens, Manville's second husband has left her and she's become an insufferable and needy alcoholic. Sheen is an incredibly kind friend and does her best to help Manville, but it seems she is starting to go too far. Manville, a woman in her mid-fifties, has a crush on Maltmen, a man of 30, and she's far too emotionally fragile to hide it, and, as she has been a very attractive woman in the past, she perhaps believes she can land the guy. The film is all very observant and very touching. Like I said, it doesn't reach a very satisfying conclusion, but it's a moving little picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of 2010's most moving films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it wasn't my favourite of 2010's films, Another Year blew me away and is certainly in my top 10 of the year. I can understand why some mayn't like it, it is quite slow and has a subject matter that mayn't appeal to all.But it did appeal to me. I am not sure whether I would call Another Year depressing as such, if anything the more emotional parts are more maudlin and poignant rather than depressing. Not all of Another Year is depressing though, in the script there is an undercurrent of understated humour too, and also what struck me about this film was its honesty.Visually, I can't fault Another Year. The film does look beautiful, with crisp photography and editing and the scenery is very striking. I was quite taken with the score, not a favourite of the year by all means but Gary Yershon's music is positively beautiful and sensitive.The story is a wholly believable one, even with the slow pace it is one that touched me greatly as it focuses on the emotional and social insecurities of its characters. The script and direction are the assets that deserve the most credit. The script is brilliant, it being everything the film is, poignant and honest with the understated humour that I talked about beforehand in abundance and breathing life into wholly credible, honest and warm(chemistry-wise) characters. Mike Leigh's direction is superb too, he knows exactly what he is doing and manages to draw such a top-notch script, emotional wallop and superb, dignified performances too.The acting also helps to drive the film. Ruth Sheen and Jim Broadbent are wonderful and suitably reflective at times. Imelda Staunton is quite touching when she appears. Peter Wight, Phil Davis and David Bradley are also impressive in smaller roles. Lesley Manville steals the acting honours though in a characterisation that is both brutal and sympathetic. The ending is not uplifting, nor does it need to be, the ending especially is an example of the film being at its most honest and truthful.All in all, wonderful and very moving film. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but not necessarily good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that film critics will love, just because they see over 100 movies a year and praise anything different. First off I should say that I went to the movies to waste some time and bought a ticket for the movie Biutiful but after about five minutes of that film I realized I wasn't in the mood for Inarittu's classic dreariness and despair, so I noticed Another Year was playing in the theater next door and starting twenty minutes after Biutiful so I wandered into the Another Year theater. Which I realize isn't okay, but don't worry I'll go buy a ticket for another year and then wander into Biutiful perhaps, or see Another Year again.Anyways thats all beside the main point, now on to the film.First off Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen play Tom and Gerri a nice older couple who (as all the synopsis' will tell you) have their life together but their friends are all a mess.The main people involved in their life are there son Joe who is decent, and Mary who is an alcoholic mess, and Ken who is nice enough but probably drinks and smokes too much as well.Ruth Sheen and Jim Broadbent were in their late fifties when this film was shot, and while I knew Broadbent was around that age I thought that Sheen was maybe late sixties, for the majority of the film I assumed these were a couple in their late sixties, actual age is never established but Tom's brother is said to be 70 so maybe they are meant to be around that age. Mary is a woman who is around 50 but could pass for 45 or somewhere in there.The one major fault I found with this film was that Mary who is around 50 was attracted to Tom and Gerri's son who was said to be 30 in the film. Everyone else in the film seems to think it goes without saying that Joe is not interested in Mary, so no one says outright to Mary that it doesn't make sense. Joe is completely uninterested in an older woman who is also an alcoholic. And in reality a woman like Mary would be aware of this, yet in the film she is completely taken off guard when she meets Joe's girlfriend.Early in the film Tom and Gerri seem to take kindly to Mary, but I guess around the point she is rude to Joe's girlfriend they decide they are annoyed by her.There's no real plot to the film, and some people will find it absolutely unbearably slow. I found it interesting enough, the Mary character didn't quite hold up for me though. This is a somewhat flawed film but still worth checking out just to examine Mike Leigh's work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just another year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a happily married couple in their pre-retirement years. Their relatives and acquaintances seem to be less happy than they are."Another Year" looks at the ordinary lives of an ordinary couple, and their interaction with their ordinary friends. The plot is very slow and very plain. This might have been deliberate, in order to highlight the 'another year' theme, but it is not very interesting to watch. The redeeming feature is the character Mary, who is a depressed alcoholic with marked contrasts in mood states in various points in the film. She talks far too much and is annoying in the beginning, but rather unexpectedly she makes me feel so sorry for her as the film progresses.Due to its emotional and introspective nature, "Another Year" requires a certain mood state to fully appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Hollywood... I do... but just as your favourite Italian restaurant can't give you the perfect sushi... so Hollywood cannot produce films like this. There are many film industries around the world that produce insular cinema of great worth... but Mike Leigh makes English films that defy the notion of being translated, even though they tell the stories of every woman and man.Another year is a window into the lives of those whose lives are unexceptional... yet enviable. The principal characters Tom and Jerrie (ho ho), are a late middle aged couple who have 'achieved' in the middle class standards of modern England. They are both graduates (often mentioned), they both have responsible jobs, they have a lovely home (where all are welcome).... and they cook lovely food made from their own (allotment) produce. They drink responsibly, they don't smoke (even in secret)... and their son is a lawyer who works for disadvantaged clients. I this case 'disadvantaged' means Asian immigrants.While Mike Leigh might have fallen into the same vision of middle class cosiness that 'Love Actually' portrayed with such irritating blandness... the character and portrayal delivered by Lesley Manville takes the whole film to another level.The reason I am writing this is that I just want you to take the time and see this film. I then want you to take the time to ponder whether the 'Oscars' can ever mean anything at all, when Lesley Manville can produce a performance like this... and not be lauded by everyone who has the slightest interest in films.I do love Hollywood... and The Kings Speech is a good film... but I will remember "Another Year' for a few years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>thefilmsmith.comStorytelling relies on conflict and the yearning for resolution, which means that family centered tales are usually brimming with strife. Another Year, then, is all the more interesting. It centers around Tom and Gerri, a cozy happily married couple who take in their alcoholic friend Mary like a stray, emotionally unstable dog.Structured by the four seasons, the films showcases the comfortable companionship between Gerri (Ruth Sheen) and Tom (Jim Broadbent), the emotional anchor for the film. Gerri's friend Mary (Lesley Manville) visits during each of the four acts. Mary's twitchy mouse energy is relentless, and moments of losing her verbal momentum (or drinking momentum for that matter) only allows the cold, sad loneliness to crack her open before her friends. A woman who looks to be in her 50&#x2032;s (Manville herself was born in '56), Mary is smitten with Tom and Gerri's 30-year-old son Joe, which leads to awkwardness and calamity when Joe brings his new girlfriend to meet the parents.All of which makes it sound like a bloated drama, but the dialogue is rapid fire hilarity, with occasional shots fired across the bow (and over the head) of characters in a way that will make you want to shout, "Oh snap!" Such wordsmith wizardry is what British films are known for and Another Year is another fine example of the country's comedic sensibilities.But like Judd Apatow and even arguably Kevin Smith, Leigh uses the outlandish comedy aspects to lead the film to sublimely affective moments; he's not merely mining for cheap chuckles.When the laughter fades away into silence, Leigh's selective use of close-ups is classic magician misdirection: You're focusing so much on the dialogue that when people shut up, quiet glances and beats of silence ring out like gunfire.Despite the fact that Gerri and Tom provide the film's foundation, Lesley Manville as the frazzled Mary is one of the standout performances of 2010. An interesting counterpoint to Poppy from Mike Leigh's Happy-Go-Lucky (who was always loving, quiet, and together), Manville channels this outlandish character with sad sincerity that in lesser hands would have been overbearingly annoying and caricature. Instead, you can see the emotional fireworks exploding just beneath her skin. Gold star sticker for you, Ms. Manville.Another Year is a fantastic comedy whose conclusion descends like the door of a coffin, which, in its open, yet final shot is one of the ballsiest moves of recent memory. Manville's performance alone is something to behold and is deserving of your attention. Romantic comedy never looked so good.</fullReview>

Critics surely loved it for how it represents an underrepresented segment of British society. Granted, there is a naturalness to relationship of the married couple that has been a long time coming. Too bad it's mired in exaggerated situations that are used to amplify the steadiness of the couple. It's a little too obvious contrivance. More for sociologists than film lovers, there's not enough here of interest to those other than people involved in the socio-economic conditions of the characters portrayed.

		<shortDescription>Great Acting but lacked worthwhile storyline and character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Year - As the title suggestions four seasons pass and nothing has really changed. Seeing this movie reminds us why we are always looking for an interesting story line or some character development where something has changed which in our opinion this film really doesn't have. For example, Mary (played by Lelsley Manville ) is a reasonably attractive middle aged single secretary working in a counseling center in London and she periodically visits the home of one of her co-workers who happens to be counselor. She is clearly an alcoholic, hasn't been able to establish a good relationship with a man and is barely being politely tolerated during these visits by her friend and her husband. Mary flirts with the couple's son, is disappointed when she ultimately meets his future wife and even unsuccessfully tries to develop a relationship with the tacit brother of her friend's husband while he is grieving for his recently deceased wife. Mary is basically a pathetic person who hasn't changed at all in the year that we observe her. That's it! Now, the acting in this movie is fantastic. All the characters seem quite real. The married couple is warm and friendly and Manville very realistically portrays Mary the alcoholic friend, as did the other actors in their roles. In fact, Manville might even earn an Oscar nomination for her acting However, what we found interesting about this film was not what was on the screen, but rather the unique manner in which director writer Mike Leigh uses to put together this film as well as others which he has done. Lesley Manville was the guest at our preview screening of this movie and she explained how Leigh prepares the barest outline of each character. He then meets separately with each actor for a series of meetings over 2-3 months. During this time the actors invents or develops in detail the background and the history or their character. They construct their family background, likes and dislikes, nature of relationships etc. So then when the characters meet for the scenarios, which Leigh has designed, each actor acts as if they are the character, which they have invented. Various dialogue emerge and Leigh encourages the ones, which he likes. The actors never have a script but ultimately they have agreed upon the words, which they will use when they get around to shooting the film. Seeing the results of this process may be a worthwhile experience for students and aficionados of cinema. It appears to bring out a sense of realism that comes from deep in the soul. However, we get bored and turned off by real people from time to time and we didn't think the experience of watching these people was worth two hours of our time.</fullReview>

In the end we stuck it out just as a test of wills. There is simply no point to this awful movie except to make the viewer uncomfortable and depressed. Where is the character development? Why would you care about any of these people when we don't get to know anything about them? We are just skipping from one awkward scene to the next. No explanations, no conclusions, just nothing of substance. This is literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I truly can't fathom how Roger Ebert and a few others think this is a good movie, and the thought of this being nominated for any kind of award is absolutely absurd.

		<fullReview>I'm quite a fan of Mike Leigh's output, but with this latest film, perhaps someone should tell the emperor he's at least scantily clad. It's too long, it's dull, and it's more of a TV piece than a feature-length movie. Yes, the acting is excellent, although I can't help feeling that some of the names in this ensemble cast can do this sort of stuff on auto-pilot. Yes, I recognise it's supposed to be on several levels but none of them grabbed me. Other films have tackled loneliness, the passage of time, relationships etc with more insight than this. I thought something might happen when Ronnie's son turned up at the funeral. Some good acting here - but the character, I felt, was wasted. Tom and Gerry were more like Jack and Doris from The Archers (anyone remember them?). I think the praise heaped on "Another Year" is unjustified. The film just isn't cinematic enough - by which I mean that when you've paid good money, bought the popcorn, found the seat (although the cinema was almost empty when I saw this film), then you should at least be encouraged to feel involved. The boy along the row from me was playing with his mobile phone - maybe sending a text to his mate to say "don't bother". The elderly couple in front were mainlining on Maltesers, and my partner consulted her watch every ten minutes (but maybe that was my company rather than the film.) Mike Leigh has made better films than this one.</fullReview>

I can fully appreciate the talents of the director and actors and understand what they were shooting for showing the lives of the ordinary but the result is a depressing study in the mundane lives of unattractive people. The character of Mary may go down as one of the most pitifully unlikable people in movie history. We keep hoping for her to turn some sort of corner and realize she is going nowhere but she just keeps drowning her sorrows in wine, and we frankly just don't care because she is so damn annoying.

		<shortDescription>Another Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Year is a British film that falls both into the comedy and drama genres, but overall it would probably still be considered by most as a drama. The film focuses on a middle aged couple named Tom and Gerri and it focuses on their relationship with each other as well as their family and friends in the course of one year. Tom and Gerri seemed to me to be one of the most functional, well adjusted and overall happy couples I have seen in a movie in quite awhile, so that in a sense was quite refreshing. Tom and Gerri's friends however all seem to have different burdens and things they are struggling with and it is up to the couple to help bring them out of it by being considerate and overall good friends to them. I think what really makes Another Year a really good film is the writing. We are introduced to a handful of characters that the film focuses on and they all seem so believable and life like that at times I could not help, but draw comparisons to people I personally know, whether now, or in the past. The character development (something I always love) is very well done here because these are not just disposable one liner characters, but instead they have so many things that make them who they are. Their personalities, their strengths, their weaknesses and the things they may be struggling, or working on is all here and we get to see them at their best and at other times, perhaps when they are at their worst. The film is not harsh in it's look of these characters. It is not making fun of them, or to the opposite extreme making them the heroes of the movie. Instead it allows us to get to know them and see how they interact with each other and we can feel their happiness in certain scenes, but also the grief and depression they may be living with as well. The writing is fairly heavy on dialogue and it is not an action packed film, but it is interesting because of the well written characters and the scenarios and plot twists that come up along the way with them. At times in certain scenes we really do not know what will happen next. Not to say that the film is a suspense, or thriller because it is not, but because we think we know how these characters will react in certain situations and we are just sitting there in the audience waiting for something big and dramatic to happen because we feel that would be the first reaction to the characters, but a lot of the time the film catches us off guard and leaves us pleasantly surprised at the outcome. The writing is as I said, is very good here as is the performances that really bring the writing to life. Everybody in the cast does a great job here, but I have to single out Lesley Manville who plays Mary. She brings so much genuine humour and also sadness and despair to her role that throughout the film we laugh with her and also feel her deep seated pain and loneliness. It's a great performance that was overlooked by many award ceremonies last year unfortunately. To say that this film would appeal to everyone is a lie because there are some who would find it too talky, or dialogue driven and others who would find it bland and boring. These are valid criticisms because I can see where a lot of people would feel that way, but I found the film was so interesting with it's characters and the events that are going on, that once I got used to the film's pace I was thoroughly enjoying it and wanted to see where this writer and director was going to take us. A very good look at several different personality types over a yearly period and perhaps it is called Another Year because in a year we can grow as people, but also lose things, gain things and we can start anew, or go right back to where we started on this journey we are on in life. We see that with the characters as some seem to change and others not so much, but it all feels realistic and true and for that I applaud Another Year along with it's strong writing and acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Year or Time Is All We Have At The Betty Ford Center?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic film about bereavement, grief, depression and dancing with the gorilla alcohol until you can't dance anymore.What was most inspiring to me were Ben and Jerry a married couple who in their autumn years practiced the ministry of being present even with the ugly potato plants (alcoholic friends) who were threatening to take over their garden. Like the humanistic psychologist Carl Rogers, Ben and Geri believed something was always growing and becoming even if it was an ugly potato growing sproutsI don't know how this couple managed to stay serene watching their alcoholic friends continue to use alcohol despite the consequences.I wouldn't interpret their serenity as apathy but love, patience and kindness. The serenity prayer reads: "God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference".This film is a great psycho/educational tool for alcohol counselors showing a cluster of personality traits that alcoholics share in common. (low tolerance for frustration and rejection)Three cheers for the producer, director and writer who captured quiet ordinary moments Ben and Gery spent with their friends without shaming, blaming or denying!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The happy moments in life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Year is a film about an old, but happily married couple Tom who is a geologist and Gerri who is a psychotherapist played by Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen, and their circle of family and friends. We follow the happy and loving couple trough the four seasons, experiencing both death, birth and love. Tom and Gerri has a perfect marriage and somewhat perfect life. The things they go through are pretty normal and the viewer can easily relate to the situation they're in. The movie faces issues like midlife crisis, finding love and coming to terms with aging. It is also about growing old and making the right decisions leading to finding true happiness. The movie is pretty realistic, and something you definitely can relate to. The movie has no clichés and is actually really good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Mike Leigh (All or Nothing, Vera Drake), Film 2011 with Claudia Winkleman talked about this film quite a few times, discussions included that they were disappointed there were't more award nominations, so I was definitely interested. Basically the story focuses on still very much in love north London elderly married couple Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri Hepple (Ruth Sheen) through all the four seasons of a year, Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter. Through the year we see them mostly spending their time at home, and every few months visited by family, friends and colleagues either for occasions or just a catch up. These people that come and see Tom and Gerri include their son Joe (The Kevin Bishop Show's Oliver Maltman), Tom's friend Ken (Peter Wight), Tom's brother Ronnie (David Bradley), other friend Jack (Philip 'Phil' Davis) and a few others, all of which suffer some form of unhappiness. But the friend of theirs who visits the most and has the biggest degree of unhappiness, suffering from alcoholism, depression and upset to have feelings for Joe and he finds someone else, is Mary (BAFTA nominated Lesley Manville). Spring time she comes round drunken and discussing getting herself a new car, Summer she has her new car but it isn't very reliable and she finds a connection with Joe, Autumn her car is causing more and more problems, she is drinking a little and is upset to see Joe with new love Katie (Karina Fernandez), and finally Winter she has no car at all and is sitting quiet not looking like she has any kind of hope in the future. Also starring Martin Savage as Carl, Michele Austin as Tanya and Imelda Staunton as Janet. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen for Leigh, it was nominated the BAFTA for the Alexander Korda Award for Outstanding British Film of the Year. Broadbent and Sheen give great performances as the loving old couple spending their time with all these characters that come and see them mostly in the house, but also out and about a little, but I think most people would agree with me that the film wouldn't work were it not for the fantastic Manville. She gives a very poignant performance as a sympathetic boozer, played the wrong way she could have been annoying, but you really feel sorry for her that she isn't loved much and has so much tragedy, but don't worry, you will have some giggles in the film from the great writer/director Leigh as well, all in all, a great comedy drama. Jim Broadbent was number 23 on The 50 Greatest British Actors. Very good!</fullReview>

It isn't that kind of film you watch a thousand times. but to sum is up is it quite OK. Not the best in class.

		<fullReview>The movie depicts a year in the life of rather ordinary people. A couple, Tom and Gerri, seem to have the perfect life together--a loving and vivacious couple who are generous and welcoming to all their friends. In the orbit of this couple is Mary, a woman who has not had much success at love or money, is not very educated, but who is full of life, especially when she is full of alcohol. Tom &amp; Gerri indulge her and take care of her until she commits a faux pas, then Mary's life goes downhill without the support of her friends.It's a rare film that depends very little on plot or cinematography, and a lot on dialog. Nice portrayal of the envy that sad people have for those with fulfilling lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tests our tolerance of unsympathetic characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike most Hollywood films that mainly depict the lives of quirky young, well-to-do suburbanites, Mike Leigh's Another Year, shows a mature, apparently well-matched, and devoted couple that has been together for 35 years and their efforts to offer solace to their not so fortunate friends. The film is divided into four segments, each describing one of the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Leigh's Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) show begins when Gerri, a medical counselor, attempts to minister to Janet, a sleep-deprived, depressed older woman (Imelda Staunton) without any emotional response."On a scale of 1 to 10", she asks the patient, "How would you rate your happiness?" The answer not surprisingly is a "One", but Janet refuses to discuss her personal life any further and Gerri is left in a state of frustration. Though we never see Janet again, this episode sets the gloom scale for the entire film as moderate to high. Another Year tests our tolerance of unsympathetic characters to the limit. Normally, those in a healthy relationship want to surround themselves with others that reflect their own space, but the fact that Tom and Gerri do not is either a jarring incongruity, or belies the fact that they have everything so together.Gerri's husband Tom is a 60-something Geological Engineer and, contrary to the popular Hollywood notion that all families are dysfunctional, his relationship with his wife seems to work. They actually talk to each other, make jokes, tend to their garden where they grow organic food, and communicate well with their only child, Joe (Oliver Maltman), an unmarried 30-year-old attorney who works with poor people. Tom and Gerri entertain quite often and one of their regular visitors is Mary who is performed by Leslie Manville as almost a caricature of a neurotic. Mary is a woman of about fifty years of age who works in Gerri's office as a receptionist. She is divorced and dresses in a provocative way to appear younger than she is in order to attract men.Though she seems at first like a bundle of energy talking about how content she is and how much she values her independence, with the passing of each season, it becomes clearer that she is a very lonely and depressed alcoholic who is in desperate need of companionship, and her woes gradually take over the film. The parade of sad loners continues when the Tom and Gerri bring Ken (Peter Wight), an old friend of Tom's to stay with them for a short visit. Ken is single, overweight and has a drinking problem reflected on the T-shirt he wears to their home "Less Thinking, More Drinking", a slogan that might be used as a metaphor for the entire film.Ken is unable to find a partner to be with and, like Mary, is full of debilitating self pity and a negative self image. Ken makes an effort to interest Mary in himself, but she pushes him away, though she has no qualms about flirting with Joe even though he is dating Katie (Karina Fernandez), a bubbly Occupational Therapist. Without subtlety or nuance, Mary jealously gives Katie dirty looks and treats her rudely. Like many people who believe that happiness lies in accumulating things, Mary buys a used car and this makes her happy, at least for a few days, until the car acts up, she gets lost a few times, and collects parking tickets.Things go downhill from there when the wife of Tom's uncommunicative brother Ronnie (David Bradley) dies suddenly. At the family gathering afterward, Mary drops in without phoning first and sadly seeks a relationship with the distraught and uncommunicative Ronnie and the mood of the film turns from bearably dark to unbearably darker. On the surface, Tom and Gerri show their caring by wanting to be there for their friends and give them someone to lean on; however, it is all on a very superficial level, one that never threatens their comfort zone and it never dawns on them that some tough love may be needed. Neither Gerri nor Tom is willing to confront their friends by reminding them that they have the ability to transform their life if they would only wake up to their own strengths and end their self pitying act before it is too late. The only help Gerri suggests is for Mary to "try a culture holiday" for a change of pace. Neither attempt to put any limits on their friends' drinking habits, always offering them just "one more" and incongruously allowing Mary to drive Ken and her only son to the train station after she has had a few drinks. Another Year is an energy drainer, a "feel bad" bleak fest almost from start to finish with only a few moments of comic relief. The only real joy I felt was in finally seeing the end credits roll.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Judgmental, a bit mean...but great performances by cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leigh's latest experiment shows off a very likable, well-adjusted, professionally and romantically successful couple played by Ruth Sheen and Jim Broadbent over the course of one year. During that time, they show waning kindness to friend and co-worker Mary, played by Lesley Manville, who can't seem to get her life right no matter what she tries, is completely self-involved and has a bit too much fondness for wine. There's another male friend played by Peter Wight who is just as pathetic, unmarried, alcoholic and hopeless.They also have a son who at 30 is single at the outset. Then at some unseen point between spring and summer (or was it summer and autumn?), he magically gets a sweet and boring girlfriend, who Mary immediately despises because she secretly has a crush on the younger man.Manville is stunning in her role, but her character never grows and learns and just rots before us. It was sad to watch. She was pathetic and seemingly incapable of self-reflection. In the end, she's almost destroyed her friendship with Ruth Sheen's character but seems oblivious. The last shot shows her jealously looking around the dinner table at yet another meal (to which she's basically invited herself) as the happy family sit around being as jovial as ever.If you want to see some lucky, well-adjusted people sit around tolerating unlucky, badly-drawn friends who also happen to be alcoholics, this is your film. Mike Leigh usually works with his actors to build characters and stories through improvisation. Sadly, they seemed to have created interesting characters at the outset, but all of them spend the next two plus hours of the film marching in place, never changing, never growing, experiencing little if any crises except perhaps growing intolerance for Manville.Why were Sheen and Broadbent so lucky in love? Why did their son magically also find love seemingly without any effort, it just fell into his lap? Are they just lucky, or were the single people in their lives doing something wrong? The only answer Leigh gives is perhaps a fondness for alcohol or other vices by the singletons. We all know that finding love is a crap shoot. Yet here, those who find themselves single in their 50s and unhappy seem to receive special scorn and are given zero chance to improve themselves in this story. The best we get is Sheen telling Manville she needs to seek professional help.Simplistic, judgmental and a little pointless. Leigh did inspire much thought in me after seeing this. But unfortunately, Leigh's devices here seem incredibly unfair and without merit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sad end of the Baby-boomers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mike Leigh is supposed to be cruel and be sure he is in this film. His target is the baby-boomers who are unable today when they finally reach the age to retire, to face life with any positive outlook and project. They believed the world was theirs, especially after 1968, and they wake up to find the young are the kings in the pubs and everywhere else, that these young, even when they are their own children, consider they owe them nothing and at best do what they want without asking for advice. So they develop an unbearable life style, drinking too much, smoking too much, eating too much, doing no exercise, and expecting everyone else, especially the young, to be their servants, the satisfiers of their needs and desires, including vaguely sexual or sentimental impulses. And they hardly know how to take NO for an answer.They have become predators and cannibalistic predators what's more, and they suddenly wake up in a world where everyone is strict vegetarians. The cannibalism of leaks, tomatoes and courgettes, or should I say zucchinis, is not very attractive and even difficult to imagine. In other words they have cultivated in the private gardens of their minds a full homegrown schizophrenia that makes them totally misfit for life and the world. That's how you end up under a train or dangling from a beam, or, quite normal for baby-boomers, dying of an overdose.Even if Mike Leigh is making fun of these clowns of mid-life and menopause, his cruelty has no limit to show how vain and how pathetic they are in their little worlds so secluded that they do not know the world exists outside. They have not been able to find the second inspiration in their life they need to keep doing something or a few things when they retire not to sink without any hope to come back to the surface again, into depression, alcoholism, tobacco fixation, sexual drives, desires and delusions, and a fast train to hell even before dying. For them Alzheimer or simple senility will be early companions in their finishing life, finishing too early. Even simple tasks like working in the garden become chores and they don't know that a simple girdle would protect their backs from pain.This being said the film is irritatingly slow and speed-deprived, banal and tasteless, centered on innocuous and valueless artifacts like a cup of tea, a beer, a glass of wine multiplied ad infinitum, one funeral and the impossibility for these over-educated doctors or lawyers or therapists or geologists to understand there are so many other things of interest in the world and that any other human being is not only an animated virtual robot but a heart and a soul and a mind.The only moment when the film is slightly more humane is when the black pregnant lady-doctor is trying to help a woman fully engrossed with her menopause depression and that white patient is not even able to look at the doctor in the eyes and insists on getting her prescription and nothing else, unable to express what she must be thinking at this moment when she expects nothing from this? and there words are evading me to pinpoint the thinking of this woman who had never imagine that one day she might be in such a situation, discussing her personal problems with a black ? The baby scene of this black lady-doctor will be so flat later on that I just wonder if this film is not a manifesto against racism.Enjoy the film but keep in mind what Jimi Hendrix would think if he could come back in our world just for a couple of weeks of vacation from the hell where he must be rotting.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

At the age of 50 some manage to get up and continue with their "stuff", some just float with life, while for some: things just get worse every day.Either it's love, work or friendship; something just goes wrong and you start to realize that your age is working against you, and one BEAUTIFUL day; it will win. "Another year" is simply a movie about life, about the reality of life, that nothing can last forever. For those who are optimistic: try to keep your optimism and good mood; maybe you'll get unaffected out of the cinema. For the pesimistic ones: don't even think about watching this movie...! Go shopping, hang out with you friends...while you still have time. So if you still wonder "hm, this movie sounds great!", remember; if you are young, this movie is NOTHING for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good screenplay but wrong cast and sub-par direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps Mike Leigh went overboard with his anti-Hollywood attitude or couldn't afford better cast or maybe just wanted to prove that he can make a decent film with any kind of cast. Apparently he can, but a merely decent equals huge waste of a good script in this case.Screenplay carries a lot of emotional honesty and treats it's characters with dignity and sympathy and that's something we came to expect from Mike Leigh as a rule. I only wish that maybe someone else will try to do a remake with very different cast and directing with a spark to actually depict a happily married couple and some juicy and dark history between the son (Joe) and the family friend (Mary). It's just hard to believe that Mike Leigh couldn't find an order of magnitude better cast in London and vicinity.The cast is the main problem of this film and it came off so flat and distinctively plain (except Lesley Manville as Mary who did pull her weight as much as she could in a total artistic vacuum left by others) that it looks like prevailing flatness eventually overcame Leigh and he either gave up directing (just had the camera rolling) or couldn't arrive at any good directing ideas since his actors were entirely uninspiring. The leads (Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen) even turned grotesque every once in a while and Oliver Maltman as a son was so awkward and unconvincing that actual wooden doll would do better.Perhaps Mike Leigh needs to focus on writing and let someone else handle casting and direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mike Leigh is a director that usually polarises people. You either like him or you don't and this film epitomises his style. As with many of his other films the film centres around characterisation rather than plot. The story of a year in the life of the two main protagonists isn't especially interesting but then again other Leigh films like High Hopes and Naked have very little happening in the way of actual plot. The real interest is in watching the characters develop and how it is done in a snapshot of their lives. So the people who are writing their reviews of this film and using words like 'boring' really need to familiarise themselves with the Leigh back catalogue because plot development was never something his films were usually terribly concerned about.All the main cast are, as usual, excellent. Leigh really knows his actors hence why he is fond of using many of them again and again in his films. Jim Broadbent and Ruth Sheen do a great job and are always believable. Lesley Manville is also well used as the lonely and slightly mad friend whose life appears ready to fall apart like a house of cards. There are other good performances too numerous to mention and this is where Leigh excels, as an actors director. I am slightly surprised that the production budget was ?10 million though (assuming IMDb is correct) as that is a considerable amount of money for one of Leighs films.On the whole this is a decent offering from Leigh. It's not as pretentious as Topsy Turvy but its certainly not a bad film. It epitomises his style which is not to everyones taste admittedly. My favourite Leigh work is Career Girls, Meantime, High Hopes, Life is Sweet and the TV movie Nuts in May, however Another Year lacks the black humour of those films hence why i only gave it 7/10. However its certainly easier to watch than the likes of Vera Drake and is well worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid but rather manic film on the nature of maturity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A circle of friends are consumed by regret they won't face and gravitate towards a happily married couple consumed by by giggles. Crudely reduced, this latest film by Mike Leigh can seem familiar. Eddie Marsan's cranky driving instructor was stuck on Sally Hawkins' helium-hysterical primary school teacher in Happy Go Lucky. Marsan again found himself rescued from the purgatory of post-war isolation by the gentle encouragement of the tea-fixated Imelda Staunton, as Vera Drake, she also in semi-hysterical denial at the moral conflict of conducting abortions. Indeed Staunton repeats her line in denial at the outset of this picture, as a prologue.Leigh credits his characters with great existential self-awareness by getting them to perform in this fashion, but it's quite hard to watch. One of the chief caveats levelled against Happy Go Lucky was the almost unbearable effervescence of Sally Hawkins. This heightened characterisation may be useful to set up moments of powerful drama but it doesn't always endear one to the protagonists. In Another Year, the characters played by Lesley Manville, Peter Wight and latterly Martin Savage (the belligerent Carl) are actually all equally as frenetic as the solid, loving centre of the film played by Sheen (Gerri) and Broadbent (Tom). It's just that the obvious coping methods of the former group are bitter and destructive - excessive drinking, self-delusion - and those of Tom and Gerri are not.The acting is very fine, particularly that of Ruth Sheen. It's great to see Peter Wight in a Leigh film again after the wonderful Naked (another film - maybe the ur-Leigh film - where a generally hectic delivery hides the trauma of nearby existential truths). David Bradley's also a fine addition to the regular ensemble. I just wish Leigh could trust the actors - and us - a bit more. 6/10</fullReview>

During this year, they are helping their unhappy friends who have average problems. Gerri's close friend, Mary, is the person we follow the most through the movie. She has a miserable life, and she's looking for love. Mary smokes and drinks a lot because of her sad life. She becomes a burden to Tom and Gerri, who don't want much to do with her on the end. Mary becomes a problem to Tom and Gerri when she's very jealous of their son's girlfriend. She's still sad about her long, lost love, Ken, who left her ages ago. I think this movie is suitable for people who don't like good movies and want to waste their money.I did not like this movie because it didn't have a climax point. It was boring, and far too long. Anyone could have made a movie like that, which lasted half-an-hour. I would've given this movie 2/3.

		<fullReview>At the end of the credits you'll discover that the producer is named - and the year he died (2009). Presumably, when he died something connected with this film died with him. This is a pointless film with a poorly directed cast of directionless characters. It was the Imelda Staunton character whom you see only at the beginning that was of most interest to me. Imelda played her part perfectly - I also know that there are many women like the character played. Women who are struggling with real difficulty but refuse to talk to the useless creatures that provide 'talking therapies' like Gerri. I disliked Gerri to the same degree that the character was accurately portrayed as putting up a wall of 'indifference' to real distress. Well acted though it was, frankly, in the context of this film I couldn't give a damn. I'd rather I'd spent the two hours watching this car crash of a film doing something else....mucking out the stables or cleaning the rugby team's boots. I love Jim Broadbent but this was not enough to keep my interest. Sorry folks, this film lacks any merit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time was I used to admire Mike Leigh and look forward to each new title secure in the knowledge that it would be acted brilliantly. Then he made Vera Drake and although it was up to his usual standard I lost respect for him not so much because he blatantly ripped off Chabrol's Une Affaire de femmes but because of his failure (unless I missed it) to either acknowledge or apologise for this. On the other hand it's undeniable that he does make fine films and persuades fine actors to deliver extraordinary performances and Another Year is no exception. There's a definite touch of the Checkovs here as a disparate group of melancholy middle agers invade the sunny orbit of Ruth Sheen and Jim Broadbent's planet Happy Marriage without any contentment let alone happiness rubbing off on them. The first Leigh title I saw was High Hopes in which Sheen and Lesley Manville featured prominently and these two titles reveal the very broad range of Lesley Manville; in the earlier title she was a contentedly married yuppie looking with disdain on the 'ordinary' (read 'common') elderly woman living next door whilst here she is a deeply unhappy singleton desperate to put the shelf behind her in a performance that just about eclipses everything else on display. A barrel of laffs it's not but even third-rate Checkov is mesmerising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie this year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've taken the opportunity to visit London, to checkout the local theater with my lovely wife. This was one of the two movies screening, and the only one we haven't yet seen. We had free tickets and went ahead, the movie is slow paced, boring dialogs, wait to forced acting with perhaps the exception of the husband, who does a decent job. Everyone else is just washed out, it looks more like a low budget TV show than a movie. We even had a guy near by leaving the theater half through the movie, the guy was bored to death and it showed.Spare yourselves the time and go watch something else</fullReview>
