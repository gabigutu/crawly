		<shortDescription>Read the book - 'The Iceman' is a woefully underdeveloped disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read Philip Carlo's biography of Richard Kuklinski 'The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer', I can say that Ariel Vromen's big screen adaptation 'The Iceman' is a big disappointment. While the author had a habit of repeating himself and some of Richard's recollections seemed rather dubious in places, Carlo's lengthy book was an engrossing read, I enjoyed it very much.The problem with the film is that it's awfully constructed; it's all so terribly rushed. It fails to develop both the narrative and subsequently the character of Richard Kuklinski, glossing over almost everything that made the book such an interesting read. I appreciate that cramming one's life story into a screenplay can be a difficult task, however there are major flaws in the script that could have easily been avoided ? the screenplay should've been scrapped and completely rewritten. His unspeakably awful childhood, for instance, is covered with an utterly perfunctory flashback scene that lasts for all of about 15 seconds. This is a fatal mistake, because it was his harrowing formative years that shaped Richard.Stanley Kuklinski, his deeply cruel father, conditioned his son with the daily violence he inflicted upon his whole family. After Stanley dealt Richard's brother Florian a particularly malicious beating, he died from his injuries; the police were told that he fell down a flight of stairs. Richard's mother was also a callous, unpleasant person; despite her zealous religious values she had no qualms about battering her children with a broom handle. Even when Richard sought solitude in the placidity of his local church as an altar boy, nuns would punish him by splitting the skin on his knuckles with the edge of a metal ruler. All of the relentless anguish was compounded by his family's total destitution.When 13-year-old Richard also became the victims of local bullies, it all became too much for him ? he beat one of them to death with a pole and discarded his body with brutal efficiency. Kuklinski recalled that it was at this moment that he discovered 'it was better to give than receive'. The passages of Carlo's book that cover his youth make for appalling reading; unfortunately none of this power is to be found in Ariel Vromen's rather boring adaptation.Lacking also are the details of Kuklinski's career. The book recalls Kuklinski's methods of murder, the way he stalked his prey and his utter indifference towards his victims' suffering. Very little of this was explored in the film, we get little more than a brief montage of random people being blown away ? it's all so damn rushed and disorganised. Considering what a desperately violent individual Kuklinski was, 'The Iceman' is a rather neutered production. It has none of the visceral qualities that shock you like in 'The Godfather' and 'Goodfellas', mob films that draw you into their brutal world where death is merely 'business'.Not only is the narrative woefully underdeveloped but it's also sheer fiction in many instances. Despite having great dramatic material to work with, Ariel Vromen and Morgan Land decided that their own version of events were better. Even the more faithful scenes have been tweaked and messed about with for no discernible reason. For example, Roy DeMeo didn't introduce Kuklinski to contract killing, he had already had a career with the DeCavalcante New Jersey crime family and had killed scores of people both professionally and privately. It also forgets to depict the savage beatings Richard used to give his wife Barbara and the pernicious effect it had on the family dynamic.As you have probably heard, Michael Shannon is the highlight of the film. Much like the real man, he has a steely reserve and an explosive temper; he also resembles him in both appearance and speech. However, despite his best efforts, Shannon is completely let down by the script. While Shannon is indeed cold and calculated, the film fails to truly capture Kuklinski's aura of menace and particularly his notoriety in Mafiadom.While the performances are fine, 'The Iceman' is quite frankly ruined by total underdevelopment. If I had entered the film with no knowledge of the man, I would have found it a boring, mediocre mob film. But knowing the depth and drama of this tragic figure means that 'The Iceman' is a complete misfire that deserves much more, ideally a remake. The only thing that it successfully achieved was the credibility of its period styling.www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman was an enjoyable movie with very good acting, but ultimately quite unrealistic. The Iceman, Richard Kuklinski, comes off as a very sympathetic character in the end, whereas in real life he truly was a cold emotionless and sociopathic killer. His family weren't so much cherished and loved as they were possessions that were his and his alone.Much has been learned about sociopathy by interviewing Kuklinski, but unfortunately none of this was used to shape and portray his real character in the movie. Nonetheless, the movie is worth seeing, but more as entertainment than enlightenment about Kuklinski's life of crime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now this is good acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Shannon should get at least an Academy Award for his performance in this movie. This guy can act and you lose the person and totally see the characters he portrays. Reminds me of Daniel Day Lewis.Anyway, I had never heard of this Kuklinsky person and it was interesting to see his story. The multiplicity of his lifestyle had to be a killer (no pun intended) to live out. I don't know of many actors who could go from one to the other so effortlessly. From cold-hearted killer to nice person to ragging man to loving husband and father. Michael Shannon can do this well. And those subtle expressions of his! They're great. Icy. Kind. Murderous.I'm not a fan of Winona Ryder but I liked her portrayal of the Mrs. in this movie. She was believable and really had the suffering wife thing down.While leaving the movie I ran into a gentleman who had watched the actual documentary of Kuklinsky's life and he said the movie was a good portrayal of the facts. That is a good thing to hear because this kind of story like lends itself to Hollywood sensationalism. And while some of that may have happened, it was a good movie about a bad man. Did I feel sorry for Kuklinsky at the end? Yes...well actually it was pity that I felt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great story ruined!?!? OR did we (or just me) expect too much???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had to drive over 70miles one way to watch this movie and was it worth it? Hard to say if one watched "the iceman tapes" from HBO. To me personally it was disappointing, but I probably expected way too much. So lower your expectations and you will have a nice evening in the cinema. Shannon is great, superb, I guess nobody could have played him better, but the editing, the storytelling is very abrupt and a bit too edgy. Its not a good fellas, its not even close to it, don't expect even a mob flick. Its an OK movie that had so much more potential. YET it is still worth watching since you don't see movies like that nowadays very often. The potential of the story would have been an 11, this movie is a 7 with an extra point for Shannons performance. And in relevance I should mention that I would give broken city a 3.5, gangster squad a 4.5, so I guess people who watch this movie with not so high expectations will love it! PS. No "the iceman" did NOT got his nick because he was so cold, like another reviewer wrote, but because he froze a body for two years. The officials gave him then that name. All this is well known through the "iceman tapes".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A massive, formulaic disappointment, with a towering performance from Michael Shannon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having developed a morbid fascination with serial killers over the past few years, I was delighted to hear that Richard Kuklinski, one of the most prolific and emotionless mass murderers in history, was to be given the cinematic treatment. Not only was his story ripe for a juicy adaptation, but Michael Shannon, the most consistently mesmerising actor working in film today, was cast as the titular Iceman. Sadly, inexperienced director Ariel Vromen, who up to this point had only made two films I've never heard of, has delivered a by-the-numbers biopic; one that follows familiar genre conventions and whitewashes Kuklinski's story completely in favour of a formula that a mainstream audience can comfortably follow.After being impressed by his towering frame and generally intimidating nature, mob boss Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta), who is in the employ of the Gambino crime family, takes the young Richard Kuklinski under his wing. To get a feel for him, DeMeo tells Kuklinski to kill at tramp in broad daylight, to which Kuklinski coldly obeys . Soon enough, Kuklinski is carrying out mob hits for DeMeo, while telling his clueless wife Deborah (Winona Ryder) that he is in finance. He meets fellow contract killer Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Prongay (Chris Evans), who teaches Kuklinski the benefits of using cyanide to carry out the murders, and then freezing the bodies to rule out a time of death. But with DeMeo coming under pressure from his boss Leonard Marks (Robert Davi) for a drug deal gone wrong, Kuklinki finds himself and his family under threat.What might have been a fascinating insight into the inner workings of a sociopath, The Iceman is nothing more than your standard straight-to-DVD mobster movie. Completely ignoring Kuklinski's natural instinct for murder (he was a serial killer long before the mob approached him) and his reputation as a merciless and cruel man, beating and killing men for the slightest of reasons, Vromen even adds a family angle that is completely untrue. To give the lead character a bit of recognisable humanity, here he is portrayed as a loving family man, dedicated to his wife and kids as the mob close around him. In fact, in real life Kuklinski was an aggressive wife-beater; a tyrannical king of the household who regularly committed acts of physical and mental abuse on his family.Artistic license is a right that every film-maker has when conducting a biopic, but when there's a complex and fascinating story to tell, however dubious some of Kuklinski's claims are (he claims to be responsible for the murder of Jimmy Hoffa), then why make such drastic changes if all you're doing is making your subject the same character seen a thousand times before? Shannon deserves better than that, and his unnerving performance is one of the few saving graces here, but his character is reduced to nothing more than a standard mobster, seduced by the lifestyle and cutting himself off from regular life. He was a cruel, savage monster, who disposed of some of his victims by having them eaten alive by rats (or so he claims), or in one incident, he allowed his victim time to pray to God to see if he would answer his prayers, before killing him (this scene is played out in the film with James Franco as the victim).Plot strands veer off path and are offered no resolution, making them completely redundant. Some are intriguing, such as Stephen Dorff's appearance as Kuklinski's imprisoned paedophile brother, who hints at Kuklinski's dark childhood and abuse. Others are not, such as DeMeo's right-hand man Josh Rosenthal (David Schwimmer) who is given more screen time than necessary, only for the story to fizzle out into absolutely nothing, as does DeMeo himself. Given a longer running time, a more experienced director, and ultimately more commitment to the source material (various books and recordings exist of Kukinski, the most popular being Philip Carlo's book The Iceman: Confessions of a Mafia Contratc Killer and the TV movie The Iceman Tapes), this could have been highly engrossing cinema, instead it's a crushing disappointment, saved only by Shannon's imposing performance.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Make Room for Daddy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Dramatizations are at their best when actual footage of the subject or event doesn't exist. They can be an effective way to highlight a particularly interesting story or person with details we might not otherwise access. Richard Kuklinski's story is fascinating and frightening. He is known as the mob's most prolific hit-man/contract killer. Writer/director Arial Vromen has adapted Anthony Bruno's novel for the screen, and wisely cast Michael Shannon in the lead. It makes a nice companion piece to the chilling 1992 documentary The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer.The movie is dominated by the hulking presence of Shannon as Richard Kuklinski. Shannon is no match for the physical size of Kuklinski, but his movements and the camera angles capture the powerful and imposing monster that he was. If you are unfamiliar with Kuklinski's story, he killed somewhere between 100-250 people. His missions were carried forth in cold-blooded, heartless and widely disparate manners. Additionally, he often dismembered his victims and froze bodies and parts to prevent the actual time of death from being established. He was good at his job, but hardly a good guy. But wait! Not so fast ...Kuklinski was also a husband a father of two daughters who made up what appeared to be a lovely, normal family in suburban New Jersey. This guy had an internal switch he flipped from the street to the dining room table. When he was captured, his wife and daughter claimed they had no clue what he did for a living (he had told them he was in Finance). Sure, they admitted to his having a wild temper and even threatening his wife a few times, but they never once considered that he was a cold-blooded killer by day and neighborly barbecue dad on weekends.Winona Ryder plays Deborah, Kuklinski's wife. Before you roll your eyes, you should know that Ryder is exceptional in the role. Her tease in Black Swan gave us hope she had returned to form, but this turn displays the talent we always knew was there. The always dependable and creepy Ray Liotta is perfectly cast as Roy Demeo, the mobster for whom Kuklinski worked. The scenes with Shannon and Liotta together are bone-chillingly frightening. Chris Evans (light years from Captain America) plays fellow hit-man Robert Prongay aka Mr Freezy. Kuklinski credits Prongay with valuable insight into poison and disposal of bodies. It's heart-warming to see that even contract killers have support groups. Other support work comes courtesy of David Schwimmer as Josh (Demeo's right hand man), Robert Davi (as Leonard Marks. Demeo's link to the family head), James Franco (as one of the hits), and Stephen Dorff as Kuklinski's incarcerated brother Joey.Childhood flashbacks give us the table-setting necessary to understand the balance of nature v nurture in the Kuklinski household. Still, no matter how much abuse or misery one has a child, it's difficult to comprehend the stoic evil that possessed Kuklinski. And to be clear, Michael Shannon's performance is his best yet ... and that is saying a great deal. He has become one of the most interesting actors - one who can take the lead as he does here and in Take Shelter, or as a scene-stealing supporter in Revolutionary Road, Mud and the upcoming Man of Steel (as General Zod). He's not a flashy actor, just an extremely talented one.Vromen captures the gritty feel of the nearly three decades of "family" life in a manner that reminds of Kill the Irishmen ... the Ray Stevenson take on Danny Greene. The atmosphere and inner turmoil are similar, but there is no comparison the Kuklinski evil. Should you doubt this, I would highly recommend the documentary previously mentioned. Watching the actual dead eyes of the real Richard Kuklinski as he talks about his life is beyond horrifying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Straight Up Gangster Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman a biopic based on New Jersey hit-man Richard Kuklinski who managed to murder at least 100 and possibly up to 250 victims in a span of almost 40 years.Michael Shannon giving a strong performance as the hit-man with the calculating and creepy demeanor of a psychopathic killer with no conscience who can still flip the switch back to his life in the suburbs with wife and kids. Yet a shade of subtlety and pathos in his portrayal of Kuklinski that we can actually identify and take some interest in his struggles. With the exception of Winona Ryder who fits seamlessly as naive suburban housewife (and the 2 daughters) very unlikely to feel sympathy for the victims with the exception of one senseless killing. Mostly wiseguys, mostly scumbags. We're not all that mad at Kuklinski for the nasty stuff he's doing. Ray Liotta a can't miss as a minor mob boss, all the acting first rate and the characters real. But the Iceman story is told without ice and without chasers, a gangster flick without sentiments real or phony thrown in. Viewers hoping to draw insights or conclusions from all the dead bodies might end up disappointed. The 'Iceman' moniker from his practice of freezing bodies to confuse the time of death.My biggest question for Kuklinski would be, how do you get away with so many murders, so many different methods, places, people over a span of almost 40 years? In the true crime shows the perp makes one little slip in his only perfect crime and ends up in the slam.The movie is what it is because I don't think there's all that much complex or new in a Kuklinski to learn. Abused growing up, turns to sociopathic super bully behavior as an adult to get what he wants and to survive. No genius but smart enough to know when to turn it down out in the suburbs. Kuklinski was an usher at mass every Sunday. They should have included that in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>could have been better.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie let me down in so many ways. I do understand that most of the time the book is better then the movie for obvious reasons. Time restrictions,budget and movie rating system. But to not even come close and Im talking not even in the same ball park is a huge let down.Spoiler coming.... Biggest error of the movie was that the director failed to show how heartless "The Iceman" really was. Let me explain.In the book "The Iceman" would sample new weapons on people mostly the homeless walking under the East River Parkway near the Brooklyn bridge. The police most of the time just wrote it off as the homeless killing each other off. One of his more horrendous acts was to drive a victim to the deep woods of Pennsylvania and seek out a cave. He would then tie up his victim with food all over him...He would then video tape the rats chewing the victim alive. Im not getting into every murder he did but, This does sum up the point that the movie somewhat just skims the surface of how ruthless and heartless the "Iceman" really was.As for the movie as a whole...I rate this as a somewhat average run of the mill crime drama. I left feeling like I just wasted 2 hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A life of crime. Are some people genetically predisposed to crime or is it all about choices?In this hard hitting drama, we follow the rise and fall of Richard Kuklinski played utterly convincingly by Michael Shannon. The man who terrorised many, yet he was a faithful and devoted dad and husband where the constant struggle is shown in keeping the balance between a life of crime and family harmony.One scene I find particularly mesmerising is when he visits his brother in prison and as he is about to leaves his brother shouts that since are both born criminals they shall both end up in jail.Kudos to the makers for conveying tension and emotion in the correct dose. My only remark would be that it kind of lost its way between being a crime drama and autobiography, however whilst it successfully is a bit of both, I sort of craved it picked a genre and dig a little deeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent gangster flick, minus the charm and depth of Goodfellas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Iceman Ariel Vromen's The Iceman might succeed too well in depicting its subject, mob hit-man Richard Kuklinski. I saw this film recently at the Toronto International Film Festival, and was lucky enough to hear Vromen's Q&amp;A afterwards. This is a solid gangster movie if you're an aficionado of the genre, but because it doesn't probe very far beneath the surface of this true story, it fails to reach the status of a great film. In fact, I think much of the audience left the theatre with the impression that this was mostly a meditation on mental illness.Kuklinski, Vromen told the audience, was a sociopath. As such, he had no conscience, and was able to kill at least 100 people without worrying too much about it. He also had no fear ? hence the nickname 'iceman.' Michael Shannon, who plays Kuklinski, does such a good job of keeping his face clenched like a fist that we can't really empathize with him. The heart of the movie is supposed to be the dichotomy between the icy hit-man who never gets rattled and has no remorse, and the family man who only wants to take care of his family. Vromen told us that this is something we can probably all identify with ? the hardnosed lawyer or business man who wrecks peoples' careers and fortunes by weekday, and the loving husband and father by weekend, or some variation on this theme. Vromen's somewhat incongruous examples from his own life were playing backgammon one minute on an Israeli air force base, and flying into Lebanon the next to witness all the horrors of war ? and going to law school by day and being a DJ at raves by night. But Kuklinski seems so brutal, and so filled with rage that we never really believe that he cares about his family all that much. In fact there just isn't that much time devoted to scenes of Kuklinski with his family, and so this central theme never really gets off the ground.Vromen seemed to want to portray Kuklinski as something more than a sociopath, though, through certain scenes I won't discuss here, and during the Q&amp;A said that in fact, based on the outtakes he'd seen from the HBO documentary, Kuklinskli could be quite charming. Between takes, Vromen said, the real Kuklinski told the story of dropping his daughter off at Catholic school and parking on one of the sisters' spots. She told him not to do this, and he whispered that God had told him to do this. Vromen wondered why HBO hadn't included this in the documentary, which made me wonder why he didn't include it in his own film. Perhaps Kuklinski was really charming, but this just doesn't come through in the film, but would have made it far more interesting. In any case, although I'm not a psychiatrist, it seems to me that it's common for sociopaths to be charming in any case, so this doesn't make the character much more complex. Tony Soprano, if we can compare fictional characters with real ones, was a charming sociopath, but because he somehow charmed us, and his psychiatrist, he was more compelling.Another underdeveloped theme in the movie is that of chance and religion. Early on Kuklinski tells his future wife (Winona Ryder, who does a great job here) that he doesn't believe in chance. But he only becomes a contract killer when Ray Liotta's character, minor mob-boss Roy Demeo, sees how coolly Kuklinski reacts when attacked by another gangster. Roy closes down Kuklinski's porn editing studio and gives him a choice between unemployment and becoming a killer. Kuklinski thus seems to some extent to have been forced into the job. He was 'just trying to take care of his family.' This is pretty thin, though, and I think we have to see him as fully responsible for his actions. As a side note, when Vromen was asked by an audience member where the moral center of the film was, he hemmed and hawed a bit and told us that the moral of the story was that we should treat each other better. In other words, he either didn't understand the question (despite his having attended law school) or hadn't given much thought to what should have been a central theme of the film. There are some hints (which again, I won't discuss) that Kuklinski thinks that God is dead and so everything is permitted, but again, this is never really developed, and so is not very thought-provoking.As I said at the beginning, this is, despite everything, a good movie to watch if you've seen Goodfellas too many times to enjoy it anymore, but want something similar. The Iceman, though, really does feel derivative (not only in casting Liotta) of Goodfellas, but without its charm.see more at americanfilmtheory.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Difficult to emotionally invest in but wickedly entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 2011's Take Shelter, Michael Shannon is proving to be a fascinating leading man. Just through his presence, he can convey that unstable line between sanity and insanity and bad and good. You can just tell his inner conflict is going to explode at boiling point. It's unfortunate that while Shannon certainly transforms into the 'iceman,' The Iceman's script doesn't call for much of his range. Instead, it's a moody gangster film that revels in the moments where it can step just beyond the clichés while still pressing all the standard buttons. It's interesting in these kinds of scenes where a mob boss forces an associate to give to a homeless person or Shannon lets James Franco's cameo pray to God just to see what happens. It's a well-acted film, particularly Winona Ryder standing out in the supporting cast and it's very slickly made. But the fundamental problem with the film is its rhythm. The editing is constantly hectic even at the smallest things. There's no natural fluctuations that give emotional moments gravitas or action moments excitement. It does end up fatiguing and it lessens the sense of journey and change. Nevertheless, it's still a wickedly entertaining thrill ride to the end, just blunt at its edges.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Impressive True Story of a Family Man and Notorious Cold Blood Killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1964, Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) dates Deborah Pellicotti (Winona Ryder) and kills a man that made an offensive comment about her during a game of pool. The violent Kuklinski works dubbing porn films but he tells to Deborah that he dubs Disney cartoons. Soon they get married and have two daughters. When his boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) closes the laboratory where Kuklinski works, he is invited to work as contract hit man after a test killing a homeless man. Along the years he works for Roy but he falls in disgrace when he let a teenager hooker that witnessed a killing freely go since he does not kill children. Kuklinski begins to work independently as a free-lancer irritating Roy that threatens his family and him. In 1986, Kuklinski is arrested by the police after committing more than one hundred murders. "The Iceman" is a film with the impressive true story of a family man and notorious cold blood killer. It is impressive how a man could be a good father and husband and also a contract killer and hide this secret from his family for twenty-two years. The great cast is another plus in this great film. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Homem de Gelo" ("The Iceman")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read and seen the documentary about The Iceman I was a little scared that they would have gone all Hollywood on it but I was pleasantly surprised.A few details of his life were not accurate, but the movie does not focus on that anyhow. What it did do, was to show the man as what I would have imagined him as. Anyone that has seen the movie I'd recommend that you google the documentary about him. In the final scene of the movie Michael Shannon manages to catch his persona insanely well. Almost gave me the chills how well he acted in the last scene, not to say the whole movie.Hands down one of the best depicted movies on a real world person. And if you haven't seen the documentary watch it first, it won't spoil the movie but it will give you a reference point on the man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smoldering and Volcanic Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Shannon performs with such magnetic power that one can't keep from looking at the screen and wondering just how lethal his next move is going to be. His acting is so powerful it keeps drawing us closer, even though the nature of his character and his actions are repulsive and deplorable. Yet there is another side, barely hinted at that shows his humanity, and with his interaction and support of his devoted wife, beautifully played by Wynona Ryder, we wonder what makes him tick.He is a professional and ruthless assassin, one of the best in his field. Through complications in his associations, he finds himself the target of his superiors and because of domestic obligations he reneges in his contract, which complicates matters even more. Incredibly, this might generate a little sympathy from the audience because we don't want him to fall so quickly. We know this will ultimately happen, but this type of character deserves to at least, overcome and few obstacles."The Iceman" resembles other gangster sagas which have been embellished and mythologized since their release. In reality, this film might be more accurate in their portrayal because these are not very nice individual. As played by Shannon, his hit-man has a cold soul which at times unleashes so much hate and destruction, he endangers the lives of his loved ones, and in a truly spine chilling moment, he reveals his lack of regret, with one exception. I was very impressed by Liotta, giving us so much more in a few minutes than all he did in "Goodfellas". He must be better because Shannon is indeed as perfect an actor as he can be here, giving us so much with his glances, his stares, his voice, not wasting a single part of his body to create a truly frightening monster, not a special effect wonder, one peg in a machinery stressing camera moves. In fact, the camera follows him and never stops focusing on him. He might interact with different people, but this is his story, and it is his actions that attract and repel us.There are many great parts in the film, and some of them don't have anything violent in them, but it is the specter of the potentially explosive nature of Shannon's reactions that create a tension which doesn't appear in other pictures of this type. In those family life is so wonderful to provide contrast to the horrors of crime and its imminent poisoning and destruction of the innocent. There is a chilling moment at the end of "The Godfathers I and II" when Michael has surrendered to the dark forces. Here, one single comment, one careless look, one direct or indirect attack can provoke a reaction that is bound to leave a few bodies on the screen and keep us in a state of constant tension. "The Iceman" is outstanding and powerful film making, and if there is justice out there, Shannon should at least get his due for a masterful job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Shannon is Cold as Ice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman was an amazing, gritty, and gruesome movie that portrays death unlike other films. Michael Shannon continues to showcase his acting prowess as Richard Kuklinski. As Kuklinski continues to kill he becomes increasingly addicted by his gruesome actions, and like most addicts Kuklinski has masterfully concealed his secret life from his loved ones. But unlike other psychopathic killers, Kiklinski is motivated by a basic human trait, which is to support his family. Although being a hit-man is not an ideal profession, it does have a huge cash reward.The movie does an excellent job portraying Kuklinski's tragic dilemma and to top things off Shannon's chilling performance glued me to the edge of my sofa. But this film does have some faults. Some of the secondary characters are a bit shallow and some scenes tend to drag on a little bit. But these are just little knit picks to an overall outstanding movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Netflix Movie Review: The Iceman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman is a 2012 film by director, Ariel Vromen. It is a 105 minutes of nothing but tension and suspense. Based on the true story of Richie Kuklinski (portrayed by Michael Shannon), a polish hit-man contracted by the Mafia. In his career it is said that Kuklinski killed over 100 people for the mob. It showcases a great cast. To me, unrecognizable, is Winona Ryder (who portrays Deborah, Kuklinski's wife), Ray Liotta (mob boss Roy DaMeo), Chris Evans as Mr. Freeze, and get this ... David Schwimmer from Friends (Ross) as Josh Rosenthal.Dubbing porno films for a living, Kuklinski meets Deborah, and begins their relationship on a lie, claiming to dub animated films for Disney. A man of few words, once he is married the porno business comes to an end. Roy DaMeo likes Kuklinski's cool, calm and fearless attitude. He hires him to do mob hits. The condition is Kuklinski is only to work for Roy.As in any organized crime syndicate, times are not always lucrative. In an attempt to continue to support is wife and daughters, Kuklinski teams up with Mr. Freeze taking on hits as a contractor. Once Roy finds out, things spin quickly out of control.The story plot is not much more complex than. It is a movie about a hit- man. Double crossings, mistrust and paranoia. The Iceman, Richard Kuklinski, made a name for himself in the '70's. Rated R for obvious reasons, the movie is filled with violent deaths, disassembled bodies and some bad language and nudity. The acting was outstanding. I felt that Shannon did an exceptional job. And I will state again, I did not recognize Ryder at all. She doesn't look old, but neither does she look like herself. Maybe it's just me. Schwimmer will always be Ross, even if he wears a ponytail. His drug sales are almost humorous in this film, because I couldn't help anticipating the arrival of Joey and Chandler. Can you say, Typecast?But I digress -- so let me get to it. I give the Iceman 9 out of 10 Stars!Zombie Author, Phillip Tomasso http://www.philliptomasso.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies I've seen in a while.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I discovered this movie while watching another. The preview of The Iceman was screened on a DVD that I had rented and the preview certainly made me sit up and pay attention. I thought to myself "I must see this" so a week later I rented The Iceman and was certainly impressed. This movie is one of the best I've seen in a long time. I'd never heard of Richard Kuklinski before, but his story was very intriguing. Michael Shannon's performance of Kuklinski is Oscar worthy. The cold, icy demeanour that he displays when around his victims and criminal associates makes you forget that he is an actor just playing a role. Shannon steals pretty much every scene that he is in even when he is in the presence of veterans like Liotta. Winona Ryder's performance is also very good and could possibly earn her an Oscar nod.This movie had me riveted from start to finish. If you are looking for a good drama to sink your teeth into, I can definitely recommend "The Iceman".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Shannon...The New Face of Evil for Decades To Come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow!! What a great feature film for Michael Shannon to display his range of acting and depth of character portrayal as the real New Jersey contract (serial?) killer, Richard Kuklinski. Michael Shannon has played dark brooding characters before such as in his roles in movies like My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done, as Brad McCullum, The Man of Steel as General Zod, and in Take Shelter as the father Curtis LaForche, of a family who believe his fixation on building an underground shelter is too extreme. He also plays a dark brooding character in Boardwalk Empire, whose role evolves from a former Prohibition Agent on the run after murdering his partner, to the muscle for a bootlegger. In my watching Michael Shannon evolve as an actor over the past 20 years of film making, I believe he has found his true calling in the mobster/crime genre.The supporting cast is very strong with Winona Ryder playing the feeble Deborah Kuklinski, the wife of Richard Kuklinski. In actual life Richard and Deborah Kuklinski had two daughters and one son. The movie however depicts the Kuklinski's as only raising two daughters. The reason for this deviation in art imitating life may be to reveal a more softer, caring husband and father Richard Kuklinski, doting over the three women in his life. Which brings me to what I believe the director Ariel Vromen was looking to achieve with this film. Ariel Vromen was on record in stating that after he watched the real Richard Kuklinski HBO documentary The Iceman Tapes: Conversations With A Killer that he "was so amazed by the story that he actually liked Richard Kuklinski and had empathy and sympathy for him." Some movie goers will not appreciate the lack of gratuitous violence that would have been expected from the real contract killer Richard Kuklinski. So if you are expecting to see a very violent and physical Richard Kuklinski character, the director Ariel Vromen has purposely excluded the violent bloody side of the actual vicious killings of Richard Kuklinski displayed in other movies like Goodfellas, or the Godfather. Another strong performance was displayed by Ray Liotta who portrays Roy DeMeo a loan shark and drug pusher who is trying to control Richard Kulkinski as his own killing machine. Robert Davi as the middle man between the real mob bosses and Roy DeMeo who wanted more recognition from the mob was well done. Davi, only has a few scenes in the movie, but each of his scenes is significant for the historical references that unfold. Totally away from the humorous character David Schwimmer is known for in the TV series Friends, as Ross Geller, Schwimmer does an excellent job playing Josh Rosenthal, a henchman for mobster Roy DeMeo. Chris Evans portrayal of Robert Pronger, aka Mr. Freezy, was eerily real to character and a very creative role. He plays a lone wolf who mentors the Iceman and exposes Richard Kuklinski on more practical ways to murder people. Again, the gratuitous violence is very soft core of these two contract killers who are displayed cutting up body parts and loading them in to walk in freezers. The movie is less than two hours long and to capture approximately 30 years of Kuklinski's rampage is difficult to say the least, so I appreciated that the director chose to focus on Richard Kuklinski's multiple characters as the devoted family man. cold blooded killer and lack of emotion or fear, due to flashbacks of his own early childhood abuse at the hands of his father. Stephen Dorff plays Richard's brother Joseph, who true to life was serving a life time term for raping then throwing a teenage girl to her death off the top of a roof. Richard and his brother Joseph were not close in real life and when they were both imprisoned in the same cell block they merely shrugged shoulders towards each other in passing. Why? The real Richard Kuklinski felt his only true family was his children and wife, as portrayed by director Arial Vromer's The Iceman.This is a must see for any enthusiasts of the real criminal world true stories. It boasts a seasoned group of veteran actors who shared the screen with star Michael Shannon. It is two hours of excellent historical reference minus much of the bloodshed and violence one can see in any one of thousands of B movies if this is what you really want to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but this was an awful, awful adaptation. I read the book by Phillip Carlo, and it was an incredible wealth of information about Richard Kuklinski, probably too much to place in one movie, but this movie barely touched the true Richard Kuklinski's story.As a writer, I expected something more in the line of a Goodfellas, or Godfather movie, because the book is that interesting and complex. I expected more because the story and material was completely available, and then some. Not only Kuklinski, but his father, mother, and younger life were missing, the making of the killer, his first kill, the large amounts of money he made and spent, his travels abroad and around the US, and his methods for evading detection for so many years. And so much more I can't even think about.Now maybe this movie was too violent for the general public. So why make it if it's not going to be accurate (it is vague at best)? Go make damn Disney movies instead. What a loss for the movie viewing public. It should have been a great!I don't suppose Scorsese would consider doing a version of this biography...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is nothing i would love more to say that this is a brilliant film but its not....its very badly written and has little if nothing to do with the life of The Iceman. However, the lead actors especially Michael Shannon do a fantastic job and their performances are wonderful in the face of such a bad script I know in many ways the book will always be better than the film just due to the info that can be squeezed into it but even that isn't true in this case HUGE swathes of information are missing - the characters are not introduced properly and neither are their relationships to the iceman The film makes him out to be some sort of seedy porn king - this couldn't be further from the truth...no mention of his early life, his brothers death, his parents abuse, his kills that he used for practice, the people he did kill and torture, the poisoning phase, he went through, the domestic abuse between him and his wife...all of this seems to have been ignored by someone who if you ask me hasn't even read the book Hopefully a writer who has read the book will do another screenplay and they'll cast Michael Shannon again and it will be as good if not better than the book!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Franco Sucked!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wasn't a bad movie, but once I read about the life of the real Kuklinski, I felt this film was pretty much a whitewash of the man. Vronen presents Kuklinski as brutal to punks and wise guys, but essentially loving toward his wife and family (if a bit distant). In truth, K. regularly savagely beat his wife and once tried to run her over with a car. He also didn't kill just punks in pool halls and scumbag wise guys, he killed random people on the street--sometimes just to test out a method of murder that he was planning to use for a contract hire to make sure it was truly lethal. K. was savagely beaten and tortured by a father who succeeded in killing one of his older children, though never charged, during one such beating. It seems he was killing Daddy over and over again in all those murders. This is largely unexplored by Vronen's oddly two-dimensional portrait--in spite of its unjustified sympathy for the man. But now for the headline. James Franco is listed as one of the headliners in this flick, but he has only a very small part in the film. Nonetheless, he could--and should-- have given the film a very powerful moment. The scene is apparently true and K., who murdered hundreds without compunction, later felt guilty for its depth of psychological sadism. In it, Franco's character--a two bit hood, gangster hanger on--is pleading for his life, praying for it, actually, and K. tells him he will wait, delay his death, so he can see if his prayers will be answered. Franco's character, Marty, prays with a combination of desperation and hopelessness as he is confronted with the fact of his own lack of belief in an intervening God, even as he prays hoping to stave off death for as long as he can. Shannon's K. waits impassively for time to pass, for God to fail to show up, so that he can finish the task at hand. Shannon is great in the scene--his combination of patience, cruelty, and implacable power--an embodiment, like Javier Bardem's killer in No Country for Old Men, of doom. But Franco is absolutely horrible in this scene as you don't believe for one second this guy thinks he's about to die. He phones the performance in as if it were his Oscar hosting gig. The camera is on him in a scene that should make you feel intense angst and absolutely nothing is happening. It's not subtle, it's not intense. It's Franco sprawled out on a couch with his hands folded in prayer and squeezing his eyes tight like he was afraid someone was going to use a squirt gun on them. If you threw a rolled up newspaper at a casting line you'd hit somebody who could have done the scene better. Franco is a wildly inconsistent actor, who can be quite good, but is often awful simply because he's still acting like a spoiled adolescent even though he's now in his mid 30s. Get your act together, man, be professional. If I were Shannon, who delivers a great performance, watching Franco screw the pooch in this scene, I'd be feeling murderous too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Shannon is a mob hit-man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Iceman" tells a story (not the story) of real-life mob hit-man Richard Kuklinski, who racked up about 100 killings or more. Being a movie, it is necessarily fictionalized, dramatized and incomplete. We know that going in. It's not a documentary. As such, the film has some positives and some negatives, coming out just about average at best and below what it might have been. A benchmark for doing movies like this is "In Cold Blood" (1967), which is an acknowledged excellent picture about two killers."The Iceman" has a tremendous performance from Michael Shannon and good supporting performances from the cast. It conveys his life efficiently. It doesn't dwell on his childhood but we are given enough bits and pieces here and there to get the idea of why his personality became capable of such brutality. We get some idea of his ruthlessness, but not enough to see the extent of his cruelty and domination of his family. Instead, he is shown as a family man who regrets their finding out about his work for the mob. We get some idea also of his paranoia presented rather subtly by his behavior in several killings.The movie comes across as lacking zip and tension, despite its content or maybe because of it, because Kuklinski is shown feeling so little emotion when he kills. There is some truth in that, but actually Kuklinksi is on record of having enjoyed hunting his victims and getting juiced over that. He was a serial killer before his mob career. However, the movie refrains from showing his preparations and stalking for a hit.I think that the direction and music needed to emphasize more the events, so as to give the story more feeling and make more of an impact.The last part of the movie is when mob difficulties are starting to beset Kuklinski, but the way they unfold is not handled very well by the story. They become something of a jumble or at least handled elliptically. Perhaps too much time was devoted to his family life. This part and the whole movie do not adequately show Kuklinski's many criminal activities in drugs, porn, hijacking, and ruses. They don't show how his mistakes began to catch up with him. They instead tell a story of mob problems.The look of the film is modern neo-noir style, that is, tending to subdued and filtered lighting of interiors. That fits the subject matter well.The movie is worth having, for sure, and the challenges of reducing a criminal career to a movie are daunting. The career of Dillinger has never yet been captured in a really excellent way on film. This version of Kuklinski's life and career will probably not be the last one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong movie totally focused on single character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Shannon is one of the character actors catchy to watch even then when the topic or method of depiction is not your matter of taste. In the few of them I have seen, his presences provided additional value and, moreover, it is hard to forget his expressive face and height. In The Iceman, Shannon's performance of notorious Mafia hit-man Richard Kuklinski is catchy again: depiction of a man with many faces, including cruel and caring, is not easy, and his character is continuously on screen during the 1 hour 40 minutes. True, the cast is evenly strong, supporting performances by Ray Liotta as Roy DeMeo, Winona Ryder as Deborah Kuklinski, Robert Davi as Leonard Marks, Stephen Dorff as Joseph Kuklinski are memorable as well, although their appearance on screen is rather limited.As for the plot, I have read that many viewers find it unrealistic. But in the pre-Internet era, when even a pager was advanced technical widget and the use of phone booths was wide, was much easier to live double life and much harder to catch those the authorities suspected. Well, present-day people used to Google and cams may have difficulties to comprehend this... The only thing I would have like to see more how the plans to capture Kuklinski were made and how they found out about all his past - thus the part of the police and ATF could have been bigger. Recommended to all who like movies dealing with actual villains. As for Shannon, I will search others movies with his presence I am not aware of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done, but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman is a great film overall, with very skillful "execution" in most categories. Unfortunately, if you know anything about the real Richard Kuklinksi, you may find yourself disappointed. I saw both parts of the HBO documentary, The Iceman Tapes, and because of that extra knowledge it left me wanting after the film ended. The main flaw here was that they didn't depict what a truly sick bastard this man was. Such disturbing anecdotes that were described in the documentary, such as a day when Mr. Kuklinski decided to test out a crossbow on a random citizen's face "just to see what happened," and a time when he let a man be eaten alive by rats, filmed it, and watched it later, were not depicted. I still found this movie to be worth watching, and deserving of high marks, but if you know anything about the true story, don't go in with unreasonable expectations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This will play well to a casual audience of renters who want to kick back after a busy day. Along the way they'll encounter every norm of the gangster movie; the tense pieces, the sudden violence and uneasy alliances, the remorseless killer who is yet a loving family man and regrets stuff. As per gangster movie rules, the 'true story' has been reshuffled to give us a more romantic, explainable and 'cinematic' psyche, in our case of some mob hit-man who whacked people for a living.Of course the centrepiece is the actor portrait. I thought this'd be a good vessel to bring Shannon to the fore, an interesting actor for me. He plays his usual silent skulking creep here. And it seems to me that he is getting type cast, because he brings a personal truth to his craft, a woe around the eyes that can't be acted. He doesn't shine here, because the surrounding movie aims for sophomoric satisfactions, a sort of brooding Goodfellas minus the style. It could take some of Schrader's mellow suicidejazz. But it acquires a bit of dark and damaged life, if you choose to view it with the original causality in mind; a damaged kid who, in growing up and moving through the world, hurls the damage back at the world. The real woe thrown back, Shannon playing an actor trying to balance.How about this in the hands of Zulawski?</fullReview>

He used many different methods to do his killings - again we don't see many. No real background on his nurture either which would have been nice to see maybe what made him who he became.The story was supposed to be about Richard Kuklinsky but we get too quickly whisked through the generations without actually getting to know him.There were many highlights in the book which are not even mentioned. For being known as the Iceman its a shame that there was no real devotion to seeing any frozen bodies.And finally the police were never mentioned in the film until the last minute.

		<fullReview>Richard Kuklinski bosses persuade him to change his career from a film technician into that of a contract killer.He gains a reputation for being cold blooded, as he raises a family who are kept in the dark about his true career.Mob politics force him to secretly work independently with Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Pronge.As much as Kuklinski tries to keep his lives separate, circumstances and weaknesses threaten to collide as the consequences of his choices finally catch up to him.....The story is perfunctory at best, and even though it's based on 'fact', we've seen this movie a dozen times before, A person hiding his true identity from his nearest and dearest.But thanks to the incredible performances, it escalates into something pretty special, and when you get Ray Liotta's best performance since NARC, you know even he thought it would be worth putting the effort in.But it's Shannon's movie all the way through. If you thought he was menacing in Bug, or My son, My son...., prepare yourself for this.there are times when I were putting myself into the victims position and thinking to myself 'don't beg, because there is only one way out for you', the best example of this is the scene featuring James Franco, terrifying stuff.The rest of the cast are wonderful too, from bizarre performances from Evans and Schwimmer, and a brilliant turn from Ryder.I've never really heard of the story before the film was advertised, and the film hasn't revealed anything new, but it's a good movie, with a generic narrative, elevated by brilliant performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chilling portrayal; Michael Shannon is outstanding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see a movie about the life of a real hit man, a successful one, that is up to the point when he gets arrested, then this is a good one to see. There are no flamboyant characters in this one, no funny lines and not much of what we've come to expect from gangster movies; that is not what Richard Kuklinski was, so why muck it up with that. Writer/Director/Producer Ariel Vromen had a fair budget to work with ($10MM) but he did not splurge on anything fancy. He picked a terrific cast in Michael Shannon, Ray Liotta, Robert Davi, John Ventimiglia, James Franco and Winona Ryder; yes, Ryder did a terrific job in her role, she's back in true form.Kuklinski had a childhood and upbringing that predisposed him to a violent life and the movie has just enough short scenes to convey that, if anybody pays attention. The mystery and perplexing aspect of Kuklinski's life was that he had one, outside of his assassinations' business. How he cared for and the extent to which he'd go to provide the best for his family was in sharp contrast to his cold calculating behavior as a killer. Vromen did a splendid job bringing this out with his movie.Picking Michael Shannon to play, Kuklinski was the most important decision and one that was well done as Shannon does an excellent job. If you saw his performances in the past few years you should have noticed him, my favorite after this movie of course was the role he played in Premium Rush.You also can't go wrong with Ray Liotta, Robert Davi and John Ventimiglia for gangster characters. James Franco had a short but very effective role in the movie and allows us to see a cold cold Kuklinski at work; about that, you'll probably go 'Ahh, I see!' when you watch the movie. This movie is one I liked a lot and if you feel the same way, you may want to check out 'Kill the Irishman'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My interest in 'The Iceman' came from watching the prison interviews he did in a documentary by HBO. I then decided to buy the book based on his life and found that although parts may have been fictionalised, it was a brilliant read. And finally to the movie. If you have read the book by Phillip Carlo, then don't watch this movie. The Acting in itself throughout the movie is not bad, but way in which the movie is laid out is potentially the worst I have ever seen. There is no character development, no real plot, the story told through out the movie jumps from one scene to another without any explanation as to who the new characters are and why they are suddenly in the story. Everything feels so rushed. Its as if the director has read the book, and couldn't decide which parts to focus on, so decided he would just focus on the main murders which kluklinski was responsible for. Why not make the movie a 3.5 hr casino type movie where the plot can be built upon and not rushed? At least then, we could have seen the early days of Richard, the reasons for him turning out the way he did etc. The movie as I suspected was a let down, but a lot bigger let down than i ever foreseen.Word of advice, don't watch this.</fullReview>

To call this movie inaccurate is an understatement, as I soon came to the conclusion that the Spanish language "Nemo" rip-off "Ponyo" would have stood as a better Kuklinski biopic than "The Iceman"; a movie so heinous in its blatant disregard for factuality that it eventually reduces the mafia equivalent of Michael Jordan into a character better suited for late-90s-era Adam Sandler.Michael Shannon offers a moderately impressive performance, obviously utilizing the old H.B.O. interview tapes to provide a near pitch-perfect mimicry of the vocal intonations and (certain) mannerisms of our 'be- mafioed' subject matter (which, I'll admit, was a pleasant surprise). But, with that being said, it would not have been possible for Mr. Shannon to offer any kind of performance to warrant or excuse the hell in which we have to endure that is Wynona Ryder's unnecessary presence in this movie; a presence so uneven, uninspired, uninformed and unpleasant that the filmmakers must change the name of the character once it has been bludgeoned into something now nothing like the actual person. (And Ms. Ryder's statements chastising the real Barbara Kuklinski at the film's opening in Cannes for "not stopping her husband's contract killing activities" goes to show how incredibly little research she and her film counterparts put into making this picture.)Putting aside the fallacious discrepancies regarding the actual people, this film is poorly made in the generalist of terms: it hops around in story without bothering to pay attention to the flow of the plot; the film cuts at inappropriate moments; they throw in half-assed historical arcs that have absolutely nothing to do with the story they're attempting to tell; even the ages of some characters change by years while other factors have only changed by months. It is a film so badly made that there is no wonder the director had done very little beforehand, as I expect he will do very little after. The ONLY redeeming factors of this movie are the dead-on impersonation provided by Michael Shannon, and the hilarious feeling of dread that comes over you when Wynona Ryder proclaims that she is "going shopping!" and you suddenly believe Kuklinski may be arrested in connection with his wife's uncontrollable kleptomania at Saks Fifth Avenue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty unwilling to depart from mob movie formula, but well done enough to impress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRichard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) lived a double life, to his wife Deborah (Winona Ryder) and their children a devoted, if emotionally distant, husband and father, but behind the scenes a ruthless, efficient killer for the mob, working for hard nut gangster Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta.) But when he proves unreliable, he pulls off hits with fellow mob goon Mr. Freezy (Chris Evans) which send his life spiraling down.Have a browse around any good high street book store (the ones that are left standing as the recession wages on), and you will invariably find a section full of lavish, lurid true life accounts of those who were involved with/worked for the mob, peddling their stories, spilling the beans on the real goings on behind the scenes of this sub cultural, brutal world. As unsavory as this life is, there are obviously many who harbour a committed interest in knowing all about it, hoping the stylized lifestyle Martin Scorsese has shown in his films over the years is true. The Iceman, aside from being another such account, is also a film from the 'fact is stranger than fiction' staple, where real life comes off as even more unbelievable than something that could be made up in a film. But the real life Kuklinski did indeed fool his family, and even some around him, that he lived a far meeker existence than he really did.But yet, in the lead role, Shannon manages to inject this unbelievable story with a hint of the realism that really was, portraying a man who seemed perfectly capable of detaching his two identities, switching from a moody but loving family man to ice cold killer away from them, while we witness his meek smokescreen start to disintegrate in scenes later in the film, as the pressure gets too much and the brutal personality that goes with his job starts to seep through to his family. All the support cast also play their parts well, including Ryder as his strong willed but emotionally fragile wife and Liotta, as the mean hearted mob boss who employs him, a nasty piece of work who gets him to prove how ruthless he is by murdering a poor, pathetic homeless man in cold blood, without mentioning support from the likes of David Schwimmer and Robert Davi, all taking a risk with a young director who's probably just made his most high profile feature film.Strong performances aside, it never manages to stand out significantly from any other mob type film, and loses it's narrative flow slightly when The Iceman parts company from Liotta's character, before ending suddenly with no clear hint of his impending downfall. Still, if this isn't Ariel Vromen's instant classic, it certainly feels like a stepping stone to something like it. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who has read Philip Carlo's biog, I was somewhat disappointed with the attempted dramatisation of his life that more often than not left too much detail out. There was very little childhood history other than a flashback, no mention of the tortured victims and the unspeakable things he did and it left out any detail of work he did with the other Families or Sammy The Bull.In its own right was a good movie but could have been a lot better.I assume that's why it was 'based' on a 'true crime novel' as opposed to the true life biog of Carlo following weeks of interviews.Anyone who doesn't already know about the Iceman will enjoy it. Probably not for those with an understanding of what he was capable of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fair movie, but doesn't do justice to the reality.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who has watched all the Kuklinski documentaries multiple times and listened to the 18 hour audio book biography a couple of times, i consider this a fair movie in its own right but a poor representation of the reality that was Kuklinski's life.The movie is incorrect on almost every detail apart from the most basic. ie, he had a wife and loved his children.Shannons performance is good, but it simply doesn't compare to the real deal. Take the ending of the movie for instance. It is a word for word re-enactment of one of the Kuklinski interviews, but watching it is not nearly as compelling as watching Kuklinski himself. I suppose this is to be expected, a copy can never equal the original, but i just feel that this scene is out of place in a 2 hour movie without sufficient backstory to really sympathise with the character.DeMeo I think was miscast. They really needed an Italian guy - or at least someone who can do a compelling Italian accent, to pull it off. You kind of lose some of the reality that Kuklinski was a mafia hit-man due to this. There is none of the arrogance, brashness, charisma or flamboyancy that Roy DeMeo was known for. None of the mafia bosses in the movie really pull it off.In all, its an OK movie but the story is twisted and does not represent the facts accurately. The real story is far more memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great subject, very disappointing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman is based on the life of Richard Kuklinski, who is thought to have murdered somewhere between 100 and 250 people from the 50s through the 80s (authorities suspect there were many more slayings than the roughly 100 he confessed to). Most of those occurred while he worked as a contract killer for various New York and New Jersey crime families, but Kuklinski also admits to numerous killings outside of his hit-man duties. His story gained a wider audience with a couple of HBO documentaries in 1992 and 2002, respectively, where Kuklinski recalled his crimes while demonstrating a disturbing lack of remorse for committing them (he died in prison in 2006 while serving the five consecutive life sentences that were handed down in 1988). Playing Kuklinski is Michael Shannon, probably best known for his work on HBO's Boardwalk Empire and the films Take Shelter and Revolutionary Road. The interesting cast directed by Ariel Vroman includes Winona Ryder as Kuklinski's wife, Deborah, Ray Liotta and Robert Davi in familiar mobster roles, David Schwimmer playing one of their flunkies, Chris Evans as another contract killer, and James Franco and Stephen Dorff in brief one-scene roles (Franco was originally supposed to play Evans' part until a scheduling conflict arose).The middle years of Kuklinski's life make up the majority of the film, starting in the late 60s where we briefly see him courting and marrying Deborah, while hiding from her his dominant dark side and the fact that he works as a porn bootlegger. That job provides a springboard into the organized crime world, where Kuklinski soon finds himself working for Liotta's Gambino crime family-affiliated character and carrying out thuggish duties that include contract killings. Eventually, Kuklinski finds whacking employment with other upper-level east coast crime organizations, telling Deborah, their three kids, friends, and neighbours that he works in the world of finance. At this point, we're well into the 70s, meaning a number of the actors are sporting some serious porn 'stache facial hair. I had a flashback to my Cloud Atlas screening the day before, where some of the heavily made-up actors were virtually unrecognizable. In this case, Evans was on screen for several minutes before I realized it was him underneath the handlebar moustache, long hair, and glasses, looking radically different from his clean-cut Captain America character. His wisecracking Robert character is probably the best thing about The Iceman, which isn't a good thing when you consider that the role is relatively minor. The dancing scene involving him and Kuklinski, where the latter takes out their target with poison on a crowded disco floor while Blondie's "Heart Of Glass" pumps over the soundtrack, has a twistedly dark humour to it. The stark duality of Kuklinski's life as both family man and sociopath is one of his most interesting aspects, but the film fails to exploit this angle to its full potential. His modus operandi involved the unusual habit of employing various killing methods, like poisonings, explosives, strangulations, and the usage of assorted kinds of weapons, plus temporarily freezing many of his victims (hence the nickname) to confound the police as to their times of death, if the bodies were ever found. It's another pretty fascinating nugget for the film to work with, but The Iceman comes up short once again in terms of creatively exploring this potentially rich plot point. Shannon is a fantastic actor who excels at playing complex, troubled characters, as anyone who has seen his work in any of the aforementioned projects can attest to (I'll also throw in his memorable turn in The Runaways as Kim Fowley, that band's creepy svengali-ish manager). The actor can't rise above the too well-trodden crime movie territory that The Iceman inhabits, however, resulting in a hollow effort that feels like a shamefully wasted opportunity. Of the ten films I saw at this year's Toronto International Film Festival, The Iceman easily ranks as my biggest disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Iceman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this film many times a year or so after its release, specifically how good it was meant to be, and I later found out it was based on real events, so I was looking forward to sitting down and watching it. Basically set in the 1960s, Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) dates and marries Deborah Pellicotti (Winona Ryder), they have two daughters, but everything is not ordinary, Richard is very secretive to his family. Deborah thinks that Richard dubs Disney cartoons, in fact he works as a lab technician for porn films, supplied to a mob operated syndicate, he later changes career when his bosses, including the powerful Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) persuade him to become a contract killer. Richard, who had been the victim of beatings from his immigrant Polish father as a child, is emotionally disturbed and intensely violent, he easily passes his test to kill an unknown homeless man and proving his lack of feeling whilst killing. Over the years Richard spends as a contract killer he gains a reputation for his cold-blooded professionalism, while his family is kept in the dark about his true career, but mob politics force him to go independent, working secretly with psychopathic Robert "Mr. Freezy" Pronge (Chris Evans). Richard earns the nickname "Iceman", for his method of freezing a victim to mask the time of death, but he finds it very difficult to separate his professional and family lives, circumstances and his own weaknesses threaten them to collide and there follow consequences. In the end, Richard Kuklinski is arrested in the year 1986, following an undercover sting operation, neither his wife Deborah nor his daughters ever suspected he was a cold-blooded killer, he admitted to over 100 vicious murders in his 22-year career, he never saw his family again after being sentenced to two life terms, he died under suspicious circumstances in prison in 2006. Also starring James Franco as Marty Freeman, David Schwimmer as Josh Rosenthal, Robert Davi as Leonard Merks, Stephen Dorff as Joey Kuklinski and Erin Cummings as Ellen. This film ultimately belongs to Shannon, who gives a compelling as the psychopathic monster posing as an average family man, the murderer behind the human, there is good support from Ryder, Liotta, Evans and the others, it is almost a traditional mob movie premise, with strong moments of violence, it may slightly slow in places, but there are flourishes of style, and overall it is a good biographical crime thriller. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent mafia thriller with amazing performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman (2012) is a decent hit-man thriller based upon real life events. The story follows Richard Kuklinski ( Michael Shannon), a notorious contract killer. The film is complete with tons of mafia movie clichés: old cars, conversations in fancy Italian restaurants, everyone's wearing leather jackets, the main character goes from rags to riches, there's a scene at a night club, there's a cold blooded killer whose a family man and Ray Liotta is playing some angry mobster. The best part of this film is undeniably Michael Shannon's outstanding performance. His performance is definitely award worthy. However, most of this movie is bland. You don't care about anybody except Michael Shannon's character. You don't give a s*** about his wife ( Winona Ryder) and you ESPECIALLY don't give two s**ts about his two daughters. The film glosses over too much. It consistently time jumps. The action is really good and so is the acting. The story, however, is not as interesting as it should be. A movie about a hit-man with over 100 documented kills should absolutely grip me. This movie didn't do that for me. Its not bad,but its nothing creative or original. Its decent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a good study on what makes the north east fascinating to the rest of America. The reality of New York City is far different than what is shown on new Year's Eve or a film shot on Park Avenue. It is surrounded by decay and poorly built residences. I mention that because what citizens of NYC and its environs tolerate as 'ok' places to eat i.e. diners are in most instances, 'dark, greasy, dusty and old.This is relevant because the scenes throughout the film are similar to "A Most Violent Year" - this film is a solid move away from the nostalgia of 'Goodfellas' or the first two Godfather films.The protagonist Kuklinski is also a result of these dead ends - of bad decisions etc. but also the culture that is 'there'. I totally enjoyed the film - it is well acted and a great performance by Michael Shannon.Non-New Yorkers enjoy the thrill of the: accents used, violence, ethnic culture etc. Finally regardless of 'stake in the game', NYC is slowly dying out while not aware of it. This film will not be the same a mere decade or two moving forward - the future is the demographics of LA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life As Random?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film good-paced and grabbing. It is Michael Shannon's performance that glues all the scenes together solidly, especially for some scenes not so self-solidifying. The main problem here is the script. It seems like the writer has problems extracting and summarizing. The story is with a good outer frame, and yet strangely hollow on the inside. It must be at the pick-and-choose process. Another probable reason is that the basis of this film came from two different books. The evidence of doubling, and even intersecting, information is quite apparent. Conflicting personalities and emotions can help build up a film's tone. But screenwriters can't be conflictual themselves, or the entire film feels like a swinging pendulum. I think "The Iceman" is a good enough film. Certainly entertaining. But it could have been a lot better, possibly along the line of "Goodfellas" and even "The Godfather". If we can walk back, there are certain points that the filmmakers should have exploited. The contrasting life of a businessman and a ruthless contract killer is what should have been dug deeper and expressed profusely. Some extra scenes should have been added to show us the man's great, great anguish. The Winona Rider's character is incredibly underused. As someone so close, it is she who can observe or even spot the contradictions. Whatever she feels about her husband, or the resolution she may have had over the years, it should have shown much more dramatic at the arrest scene. Surprises and anger are not enough. There must be some elements of life shattering or a state of deep shock. All in all, it comes back to the script, as acting and directing are indeed satisfactory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice, classic-feeling gangster movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ICEMAN is based on the supposed true story of a Mafia hit-man who killed hundreds of people during a period ranging from the 1960s to the 1980s. It's deliberately styled to reflect the 'classic' gangster films of yesteryear, particularly Scorsese's GOODFELLAS, taking place in the same era and even with some of the same cast members (Ray Liotta, here taking the sort of role Robert De Niro would have played back in the day).The protagonist is played by the excellent Michael Shannon, of TV's BOARDWALK EMPIRE, and he helps to make this a grounded, realistic production. I admit I'm biased: I can't get enough of this guy, I love the kooky characters he plays and this is another addition to that fold. There are some great supporting actors in the film too, including an unrecognisable Chris Evans as a psycho (the best I've seen from him) and Robert Davi as another old-time gangster. I spent ages trying to place one character only to realise it was David Schwimmer, a far cry from FRIENDS.The storyline is quite predictable but there's plenty of violence and outrageous situations to keep things bubbling along, and there seems to be little "fat" on the narrative to slow things down. Winona Ryder gets short shrift as Shannon's wife, but then the focus is on executions and the like so family life doesn't count for much. THE ICEMAN is a dark gangster outing and a film I enjoyed greatly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oscar nominee Michael Shannon brings to life, Richard Kuklinski also known as the Iceman where he freezes his murder victims to avoid time detection of his murders. Richard Kuklinaki was a brutal merciless hit man for the mob and anybody who paid him. On other side, he was a loyal husband and devoted father to two daughters. They were obviously unaware of Richie's other life and world. Unlike other hit men, he refused to kill women and children. Michael Shannon is breathtaking in his performance. Winona Ryder was excellent as his wife, Debra. Kuklinski's criminal career is not pretty where he executed perhaps over a 100 men. We learn little about his background and childhood as a Polish American in New Jersey. The cast includes Ray Liotta (a New Jersey native and star of Goodfellas); David Schwimmer (Friends); and Robert Davi. This film does a good job in recounting his life. I just wonder about Debra and their daughters. What became of them in the end?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come in for Michael Shannon's performance, stay for the compelling character he plays</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never mind the true story the film is based on, the performances in "The Iceman" alone are reason enough to see the film. In this crime thriller, Michael Shannon plays Richard Kuklinski, a man who's married (Winona Ryder plays his wife Deborah) and has two beautiful daughters. They are completely unaware that he is a ruthless assassin for the mob and has been for years. The film follows the man's life from the beginning of his employment to the mob in the 1960's until his death in 2006.A word ahead of time, I'm basing my review solely on the film, not having done any research on the real-life person. If there are facts in the film that have been fudged, so be it. I'm talking about Richard Kuklinski as portrayed in this movie. That said the fascinating part of this film is Kuklinski himself. You get only limited glimpses into his past, but here's what you know: he's got a brother that's in prison for life, a history of violence (and perhaps even murder) and he had an abusive father. What I liked is that even though you follow the man for a significant part of his life (minus a few jumps in time) you're still left wondering who he is, but in a good way. The reason why they call him "The Iceman" is because of the way he froze dead bodies to throw off police investigations, but that nickname could have been used to describe his personality. The man is absolutely ruthless. He will kill anyone in the blink of an eye in a way that's almost reckless. It's as if he has no sense of self-preservation or control, except for when it comes to his family. One thing I hate above all when it comes to movies about killers is when they come up with a lame explanation about what makes them able to kill. I think back at Rob Zombie's "Halloween" and how it did absolutely everything wrong because it over explained everything. Here, you get just enough to feel like you can kind of get close to the key, but not so close that you would be comfortable around him. That's the way to do it.Another element that I really enjoyed is the strange relationship that Kuklinski has with his family. Throughout the film, he insists many times that he does not care about anything aside from his wife and daughters. This man was not a serial killer because killing didn't seem to particularly excite him and it was not to get any form of attention, it's just that he was good at murder and since it didn't affect him emotionally at all, he just kept doing it. He is a strange paradox in the sense that on the one hand, he wants to have a normal life with a family and a house and in a way I feel like he would have wanted to have quiet life running or being employed at a regular place of legitimate business but he refuses to do anything but high-paying jobs that include murder. Because of his enigmatic nature and a fantastic performance from Michael Shannon, you are compelled to keep watching, even as you become disgusted by the man.This is a solid film filled with top-notch performances. Winona Ryder does well in the role of Kuklinski's wife, a mousy woman that falls in love with him and never suspects what her husband actually does for a living. Ray Liotta plays a mob boss, a role he's familiar with but is always compelling in. Probably the biggest surprise in the film is Chris Evans, whose character I don't want to talk about too much because it would be spoiling things, but the actor is nearly unrecognizable in the role. I found it very interesting, once the film was over to compare his character to Michael Shannon's, particularly towards the end. Did he think of Kuklinsi as a friend? Did he think they might be kindred spirits? Long after the film ended, the "hero" of this picture will stick with you and you'll want to discuss it with a friend. It's a little frustrating that the film feels like such a tiny glimpse in a rather infamous career (apparently there were at least a hundred murders committed by Kuklinski) but for the performances and the fascinating, if incomplete slice of life that we get here I wholeheartedly recommend you catch "The Iceman".

		<fullReview>The story nicely balances between the depictions of the ruthlessness of the contract killer Richie and the loving husband and father of two Richie. The two sides of the characters are nicely given equal portions of screen time and detail depth. Those depictions get even better with adequate support from experienced actors and actresses acting on them. I like to see the fact that only Michael Shannon's Richie, as the central character is actually the one character who links Chris Evans' character Frezzy and Winona Ryder's Deborah, while Chris and Winona don't even get to do a scene together. On the acting side I think Michael Shannon's performance here is one of his best. He did enough in surfacing all the characters emotions while keeping the character's calm and cool as a killer. I am quite amazed at how Chris Evans swerves his schedules in and out of movie shoots, from The Avengers, to Snowpiercer, and to this movie, all with significant roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither a documentary, nor entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question can reasonably be raised about this feature-length pseudo- or quasi-biopic of Richard Kuklinski, The Iceman: why does it exist? I have not seen the YouTube interview nor the HBO miniseries to which many reviewers (and the director, in the interview included with the DVD release) allude. But having watched this feature-length film--which times in well under two hours but feels much longer--I think that the naysayers may be right. The style of this movie is sort of a neither/nor: neither is this really a documentary (apparently much of the true story has been modified, omitted, or outright falsified), nor is it very entertaining. Of course, why should a film about a serial hit man be entertaining? one might reasonably ask. Somehow the director wanted to strike a balance between the highly entertaining Goodfellas and the horribly depressing and even painful to endure Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, perhaps the most horrific feature-length film ever produced.Productions such as Goodfellas are constructed for the purpose of providing some entertainment to viewers, which is why they can be viewed multiple times. Same for the HBO series The Sopranos: people will sit through all six seasons and even purchase the DVD set! The Iceman, in contrast, has much more of a didactic tone to it. The problem, however, is that it's unclear what the "lesson" is supposed to be. Don't marry a hit man? Or maybe: do everything in your power to remain ignorant of the fact that you married a hit man? Probably neither lesson is very relevant to many viewers. Michael Shannon plays essentially the dark, Gothic, brooding time bomb waiting to explode, just as he did in Boardwalk Empire. In fact, I found that the two roles were so similar that I began to wonder whether he is just playing himself. (I have the same problem with Angelina Jolie, who seems usually to play some thinly camouflaged iteration of herself.) Don't get me wrong: Shannon does a good job in this role, which is obviously why he was chosen as the lead in The Iceman, but I had a hard time not thinking of Boardwalk Empire while watching The Iceman, particularly when talk of Atlantic City came up!I do feel that I may have learned a bit about Richard Kuklinski. But the movie was not entertaining in the least. In fact, at several points, I found myself watching the counter on my DVD player and marveling that so little time had elapsed. Needless to say, I won't be watching this movie again. If I were to compare the problem with another example, it would be Fail Safe versus Dr. Strangelove. Both films treat more or less the same topic (the specter of nuclear apocalypse). The former was serious as a heart attack and not very fun to watch. The latter, while still a trenchant critique, managed miraculously also to induce a great deal of cathartic laughter. Should we laugh about topics this serious? Why not: we're all going to die!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do like movies based on serial killers, even that the real iceman wasn't a serial one he did kill over 100 people. What we have here is The true story of Richard Kuklinski. This flick is loosely based on the real Kuklinski. It was never proofed that he was involved with the mob but this flick says he did. But don't get me wrong, there is indeed a lot true what you see also. As a teenager he did kill animals and at seventeen he did actually killed another guy. Michael Shannon (Kuklinski) is excellent here. The acting is above mediocre and to see Ray Liotta (Roy) and Robert Davi (Leonard) back again did brought me back to the good old days. It isn't really a flick full of killings but the score used and the settings did elevate this flick above mediocre. If you do like thoseold flicks from the eighties about serials and the mob then this is a must see. You know what is going to happen but I assure you that it never had a boring moment.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

Michael Shannon is great along with much of the strong cast, but the script really doesn't have enough to compete with the best of the rest, and overall it's a tad too lackluster to be worthy of a full recommendation. Although this still gets a part recommendation through being a better than average watch. But besides Shannon's well fitting, intense performance as a cold blooded killer, this is nothing overly fantastic or that memorable to be anything resembling a future classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Was This Necessary?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contract killers, Serial killers, spree killers, the truth is always incredibly devious. Especially in Richard Kulklinski. Why oh why do they make crap up? Half the things portrayed in this suck fest never happened. Kulklinski's family NEVER knew what he did.They were NEVER threatened or harmed. Richard was a ruthless killer, tied to horrific acts. Baffles me why fricking Hollywood need to write it in their own stupid visions. If you want the truth, watch his lengthy interview on YouTube. The producers of HBO did an excellent job of portraying Richard in his true form. As for this one, save your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Gripping Account of a Serial Murderer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman is a well-made, harrowing story about the rise and demise of noted serial killer, Richard Kuklinski. Who knows how much the filmmakers changed for this movie, but this is the portrait of a man who may have murdered over a hundred people. This movie plays out as sympathetic, especially in regards for his family. It's interesting to see how a dark, cruel man would show a soft heart for his family. This film is a reasonably entertaining biopic, and I can't believe how few people seen this film despite solid reviews.This film is about how the mafia forced Kuklinski to get rid of his job as a porn lab tech to a contract killer working for the mob. While he is around killing people, Kuklinski is able to raise a family with a wife and two kids while keeping them in the dark. But soon, these two separate worlds are about to collide.This film is well-acted especially as Michael Shannon in the lead role. Shannon is becoming a screen presence and every time he is on screen, we just can feel his coldness and his wrath. His scene with James Franco, who had a cameo, just gave me the chills as he forced Franco's character to pray to God. Chris Evans was effectively creepy in his role as Freezy. Winona Ryder was excellent as the wife, who is getting increasingly suspicious of his actions.Overall, The Iceman is a very entertaining picture thanks to the cold-hearted presence of Michael Shannon. While this picture paints a seemingly sympathetic picture of Kuklinski, he was actually a very cruel man. My only complaint about this film is that the film jumps all over the place in time and sometimes it was hard for me to catch up. But other than that, a very solid indie film. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicely dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about 'The Iceman' going into seeing this and, I'm pleased to say, that I was glad I didn't. For it was a nice surprise. It's a real life case (or as 'real life' as any Hollywood adaptation) of a hit-man who tries to balances a 'normal' home life with his rather brutal job.I don't know anything about the case it was based on, but I know a good story when I see it. It's as dark as you'd expect it to be and, despite being a complete psychopath, we find ourselves strangely drawn to our antihero and unable to help ourselves from rooting for him.In some ways it reminded me of a cross between Dexter and Goodfellas. It had the same gangster-feel as Goodfellas (and Ray Liota probably helped it along that way), while, at the same time, showing us a monster who was trying to lead a normal life away from (as Dexter would say) his 'dark passenger.' If anything though, The Iceman is a gangster film. It's not about the police trying to catch him, it's about him trying to survive the murky depths of the criminal underworld. It may not be as seminal as Goodfellas, but if you like American gangster films, real life crime, or are just interested in hit men, give it a go.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts quietly enough as a young couple have an awkward first date in early 60's America. Later though, when a pool-playing opponent of the male bad-mouths his girlfriend, he takes a low-key but very violent retribution. Thus, the tone of the movie is set, Michael Shannon's "Pollack" character seemingly capable of undemonstrative but nonetheless deep love for his girl and yet equally able to heartlessly gun down a friendly vagrant to ingratiate himself with the local criminal kingpin.Obviously able to compartmentalise like you wouldn't believe, the movie follows Shannon's character down the decades, committing murder to order on various individuals in a variety of different ways, unsurprisingly picking up the nickname "The Iceman", due to his clinical methodology. He has a code however to never kill women or children, which however comes back to haunt him later in the film. All the while he's building up his body count, in his quiet, intense way, he maintains a loving marriage with his unsuspecting wife, played by Winona Ryder and equally their two young daughters.Eventually and inevitably his past catches up with him and in the end, the viewer is left to judge the killer's actions as being in any way justified by his feelings for his family and code of honour if you want to call it that, especially when most of his victims are crooks and gang-members anyway.Well, the answer has to be no. The guy has the unenviable capacity of dehumanising himself to commit his grisly murders and no amount of playing the loving husband and father shoukd obscure the fact that the man is a killing machine - fifteen during the film and apparently at least 100 in real life. The film tries to be dispassionate and non-judgemental in its presentation of the central character but lost me with his first volcanic outburst.As the film progresses, the Polack has to make uneasy alliances including one with another lone-wolf contract killer, where they develop the M.O. of freezing their victims util the heat is off. In truth there's not much plot, the viewer just waiting for justice to catch up with the murderer and so the film, despite strong performances from Shannon, Rider, indeed by the whole cast, makes for a rather grim watch. For me the direction introduced too many chaacters too sketchily so that in the end the Iceman ends up bumping off anyone who suspects him so that by the end I was glad when proceedings were halted with his arrest. However, the outside police investigation is non-existent throughout which I felt unbalanced the narrative as the viewer instead is invited to be a complicit witness to this killing machine's secret life.Me, I think I'll pass and perhaps wish I'd read this terrible story in a newspaper article than have it dramatised in this unspectacular but still unsavoury way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Michael Shannon but mob life rather bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story, it's 1964 New Jersey. Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) works in a lab processing porn. He's the strong silent type dating Deborah Pellicotti (Winona Ryder). He's also a killer. A year later, he's married starting a new family. Mob boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) sees something in Kuklinski and makes him his hit man. Richard continues to lie to his family as he becomes an expert mob killer. Events force him to work independently with another killer Mr. Freezy (Chris Evans). Demeo finds out and threatens everything. The media starts calling the killer 'The Iceman'.Michael Shannon is an expert at playing the quiet intense guy who explodes. That's what he does here. He's great at what he does. The story of his mob life is surprisingly boring. It lacks tension. The main tension comes from his life with his wife. In the end, this only has Shannon and not much else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Micheal Shannon doesn't appear to have a very wide range, but he's damn good at what he does, and he's brilliant in The Iceman. The story is interesting, there are a few memorable moments, it's even-paced and keeps you interested, and the movie actually makes you feel sympathetic toward a hit-man. At least it did me. Ryder and the rest are good, but Shannon is exceptional.The Iceman is great whether you're a fan of true crime or not, but if you are, you'll really love it. Either way, the fact that it's a true story makes it all the more intriguing.If you're a fan of true crime, serial killers, or Michael Shannon, I highly recommend The Iceman.8.5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Ray Ray Liotta's acting. A very underused actor with small parts now you think Hollywood would wake up and remember Goodfellow;s who was as much or more a part of that movie some of the famous faces. He sparkled in Arizona.Anyway its a pretty good mob flick. That guy that plays the iceman does it well. I saw the "iceman" interviews on HBO. I didn't know what to think of it. For me this is a mob flick. A tough New Yorker film. It does it well. You like Soprano's and Goodfellow's you will like this film.So in my opinion you could mesh this film with the "iceman" interviews. You should come out all right. The guy in the interviews didn't seem like a stone cold killer. He's more like someone's fathers friend. The acting in this film takes it a little further. But for mob flick fans. For me anyway that was just OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While it does miss a huge opportunity, The Iceman still delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman is a dreary, dark crime drama based on the life and murders of Richard Kuklinski, a seemingly every day family man that hides his homicidal tendencies from his family. The film showcases great performances from Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder and Chris Evans but never really gets on the actor's levels as a whole film. The sheer velocity of Shannon's performance on screen is amazing, however, his performance carries an otherwise B-rated film. The film, as a whole, works but you can't help but wonder what could have been if the film was in more capable hands. Nonetheless, the film does offer some satisfying mob violence in between some useless scenes between Ray Liotta and David Schwimmer (who is damn near unrecognizable) and some poorly written but well acted family drama scenes between Shannon and Ryder. The real stand-out performance other than our lead is Chris Evans. Evans transforms himself from Hollywood heartthrob to grimy criminal in this film and pulls it off in a way only he can deliver. The film's director Ariel Vorman seems off to the sidelines, letting his actors carry the film without even trying to levitate fantastic source material to something marvelous. Instead, the film does begin to lag towards the end and features scenes where the repetitive nature of Kuklinski's murder habits suddenly loses its entertaining value and even tries to trade it in for some family drama that seems half-cocked and lazy. Overall, the film works as a character study of a violent psychopath. Yes, this is a film that shows nothing new as far as mob films are concerned, but it does showcase some awesome performances that is worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good crime biopic.The true story of Richard Kuklinski, the contract killer allegedly responsible for the deaths of over 100 people. Quite gritty and atmospheric, with a great build-up of tension as forces start to close in on him.More than just showing Kuklinski the killer, it shows Kuklinski the family man, how this overlaps with his work, and how he tries to prevent the two areas from intersecting. Great performance by Michael Shannon in the lead role. He seemed perfect for the role, and sort of reprises his role in Boardwalk Empire. That performance way well have gotten him this role.Always good to see Winona Ryder in a movie and she doesn't disappoint here, playing the innocent doting wife well.Good support from Ray Liotta, Chris Evans and Robert Davi. Cast also includes David Schwimmer who is surprisingly decent as a gangster - the last type of role I would imagine him in. James Franco has a very minor, and brief, role.</fullReview>

This movie is poor on every level except for maybe a scene where Michael Shannon actually copies part of Kuklinski's interview word for word. The rest is tripe and I look forward to the time another film maker takes the facts and recreates them faithfully from Kuklinski's childhood right up to his death.

		<fullReview>This gangster film was met with a lukewarm critical reception and barely an ounce of hype from MILLENNIUM FILMS which essentially killed its chances at expanding its limited theatrical release, which is a shame because it's a very accessible film that potentially could have found an audience. Michael Shannon is fantastic as real life contract killer Richard Kuklinski who hid his murderous lifestyle from his wife (an excellent Winona Ryder) and his daughters. The big surprise is Chris Evans as Mr. Freezy, who is both psychotic and hilarious as another hit-man who uses his ice-cream truck to store dead bodies. The film successfully navigates B gangster material, solid family related drama and some twisted dark comedy. There's good attention to 70s period detail and the whole film is very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even close to real story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have known about Richard Kuklinski since around 2004. I read court transcripts, and of course saw the "Iceman" documentaries. The parts with the psychiatrist were especially revealing. This movie trys to create the paradox that Kuklinski had some "perfect" family life. I guess that might make for some interesting movie making, but the fact is Richard Kuklinski was an animal around his family as well. In fact when his wife Barbara insinuated to him while still his girlfriend she might want to see other people, Richard jabbed her in the back with a knife which caused her to bleed and told her that is she left him he would "kill her and her entire family." His wife and daughters were routinely physically and emotionally abused when he was with them, and at one point his wife Barbara and his daughter had planned to poison Richard. They called it off after not having the guts to go through with it. Barbara stated in a recent interview that she wished her last words to Richard were to tell him "how much she hated him." If Hollywood is going to make these "true stories" they should not sacrifice real events for dramatic effect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Iceman Cometh... and Goeth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman is a movie based on the criminal career of Richard Kuklinski, a mafia hit-man who supposedly killed 200 men. These kinds of movies based on murderers are always kind of an awkward piece of work. On one hand there is opportunity to walk away with an Academy Award, like Charlize Theron for her portrayal of Aileen Wuornous in 2003's Monster. On the other hand it's almost criminal in itself to glorify these people and their crimes, especially when the movie is bad (Ed Gein, 2000).The writers and director are relatively new and I'd consider this their big debut on the silver screen. Of course you don't know that walking into the theater, but actually it becomes apparent within the first 5 minutes.I have no idea how they attracted such a strong cast on such a menial budget; it could be perhaps that Kuklinski's story is actually pretty complex and filled with potential. Of all the actors, Michael Shannon (Man of Steel, Board Walk Empire) gets the most praise with his performance as Richard Kuklinski. Some say it's Shannon at his best, but honestly I thought his portrayal was about as dynamic as a cardboard cutout of the killer himself. While Shannon got the accent down well enough, it just seems he's going through the actions rather than going for the gold. A similar role to compare would be Tony Soprano from The Sopranos (1999). James Gandolfini owns the role of Tony Soprano inside and out; he's believable and interesting, complex and compelling. If you saw The Iceman Interviews on HBO, you could tell Kuklinski has a personality and a sense of humor; but he's very guarded and cold when confessing to a murder. Shannon could've also put on some weight too. Kuklinski is a big guy, something they tried to portray in the movie but you wouldn't know it except every other bit of dialogue is commenting on Kuklinksi's apparent size. If you want to see Shannon at his best check out the HBO mini-series Board Walk Empire. Then you'll realize just how unenthused Shannon really looks here.The real star of the movie is undoubtedly Winona Ryder (Girl Interrupted, Black Swan), cast as Barbara Kuklinski. However, her performance is slightly marred by amateur direction and writing. The story goes that Kuklinski lead a double life, one as a hit-man and the other as a family man. However, an interesting controversy is Barbara's supposed ignorance of Richard's criminal affairs for nearly 30 years. To be honest, I find that quite hard to believe and I think she should've been investigated too for aiding and abetting a serial killer. The HBO interviews characterizes Kuklinski as a fun loving family guy, but he had a violent temper which Barbara would tread into, hence her reluctance to discover Richard's true occupation. The movie merely flirts with the plot point and its never really elaborated.There are other surprise faces in the movie too; such as David Schwimmer (Friends, Madagascar), Chris Evans (The Avengers, Captain America), and James Franco (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Spiderman). Again, I don't understand how this movie attracted this kind of talent. Schwimmer actually embraces his role as Josh Rosenthal and is sadly more interesting to watch than Shannon. In fact, the relationship between Josh and Roy DeMeo, masterfully played by Ray Liotta, was more interesting than Kuklinski's story while it lasted. Franco plays a victim in one of Kuklinski's infamous murders and mediocrely hams it up. Watching Evans try to play Kuklinski's vague accomplice, Robert Pronge or Mr. Freezey, was quite the stark contrast to his usual heroic portrayal of Captain America. The performance was random and not exactly to scale with the real Robert Pronge either. They definitely took the most liberties with this character, not that it did him any good.The movie fails in direction and editing. There was a chance to really dive into the underground world of the mafia, but its squandered for a lazier film. The narration is the biggest problem; the movie jumps from scene to scene and just touches on every point of interest from the HBO interviews with no elaboration. This makes it seem very rushed and disconnected. My favorite example is when Kuklinski starts to kill for Roy DeMeo. What we got was a montage of him killing people in many different ways, but a scene that stands out is when Kuklinski strangles some poor guy by hanging him over his shoulder by the neck on the rooftop of a building. No explanation of how they got there, who that man was, or why Richard is using this method other than it was mentioned in the HBO interviews and not in the same context either. The whole montage just seemed so random and rushed, and that's the movie in a nutshell.I think the potential for an Oscar was very real, and was probably the reason why talent like Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder, David Schwimmer, and Chris Evans took these roles. What it became was something very different, indeed. If you're really interested in Richard Kuklinski's story, I implore you to watch his chilling HBO interviews because actually there is no one better to tell his story than the Iceman himself. Save 2 hours, save $15 on the blue-ray, and lets put that time and money towards Godzilla due out later this year!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The allegedly "true story" of Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon), the notorious contract killer and family man. When finally arrested in 1986, neither his wife nor daughters have any clue about his real profession.I loved Ray Liotta as Roy DeMeo, David Schwimmer as as a henchman (best role he ever had) and Michael Shannon as the Iceman. Shannon never fails to impress, especially when he gets to be a little bit crazy.I am a bit disappointed that Kuklinski was portrayed as a family man rather than abusive. He has a temper in the film, but overall seems quite loving. His wife has said he broke her ribs and did other violent things, and the biographies also mention this. I know it is more fun to tell a black and white tale, but that is dishonest.Of course, the whole story is a bunch of rubbish, some weird fantasy devised by Kuklinski with no basis in fact. At least the most ludicrous parts are left out, such as his involvement with Jimmy Hoffa!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The fraud story if Richard Kuklinski, the Iceman, of Polish heritage which lived as a hit man while still being a perfect family man back home, without them knowing anything about his real profession. Kuklinski is cold as ice in all situations, hence the nick name? No, not really, he got the name from his routine of freezing down victims to confuse the time of death. After his arrest, he told that he had been working as a hit-man for the gangster boss DeCavalcante for a couple of decades, and told he had been behind at least 100, and other times up to 250 killings. He was convicted in 1986 for 3 murders, and double lifetime in prison.This is the film about his life as a killer. A good film with a great cast. A quiet man, with a temper. A kind father and a cold blooded killer. He still was a man with his principles, seemingly having a heart in some situations, never killing kids, but while growing up he and his brother experienced an abusive father, obviously giving him a temper to scary anybody.Michael Shannon is a perfect cast for this role, my respect for him grows for every time I see him in a film. This might be his very best role so far. And Winona Ryder is doing very well as his serious non-knowing wife, and his daughters attending a catholic convent school, is also perfectly casted. We're back in the sixties, and following his life for the years to come. Lots of great cars from the right periods It's the first film by Israelian Ariel Vromen, though this being his fourth feature film, including a documentary. Well directed and told, this is a very likable film. Not only a quality cast, but also the rest of this film is quality stuff. A great watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You see the Iceman crying? Once and a while I do like watching a raw mob movie like "The Godfather.And when it's based on true facts then this is really a special treat for me.Not that I have the ambition for a career change in my personal life.Although you can foresee what it is about and the film is fairly limited in terms of content, I found this a damn excellent played film which captivated and intrigued me to the end. I have seen the interview of Kuklinski,but I didn't think it was that interesting.I thought it was really just an assassin working for the Mafia.However, the film shows that besides the fact that this was his daily job,Kuklinski actually performed these murders also for pleasure and perhaps as a retaliation. An ice-cold killer with a deadly twist in his sick mind.Actually, only the career of Kuklinski and the way he combined this with an apparently perfectly normal life as a family man to the outside world,is shown in this film. That is the only criticism I can come up with. It's only limited to that issue.The performances of Michael Shannon are truly extraordinary and admirable.He plays the cold-blooded psychopathic killer brilliant. First that imperturbable "Je mon fou" look and then turning into that cozy family man who looks in a loving way at his children. Terribly oppressive, terrifying and giving you the shivers. His natural stature helps him to create the image of an impressive Polish guy. It's obvious that thanks to his acting, the movie is lifted up to a higher level. A brilliant moment and a clarification that Kuklinski doesn't only kill people for a living, was the moment he asked James Franco to pray to God to see if He would come down to rescue him. Eventually he simply killed him.It was just a game for Kuklinski at that time and a clear and precise way to demonstrate his dominance. A face that never shows any emotion,except when things go differently than planned or the moments he feels insulted or indignant about someones actions. You can see the rage building up together with an inner gurgling growl. That's the moment when the beast in him emerges. Breathtaking ! The supporting cast is also beautifully complemented. Winona Ryder as Kuklinski 's wife was irrefutably perfect for this role. The moments when she begins to realize that something is not right and the mood swings are getting worse, are played superbly. She also looks fragile and like an angel. Especially when Kuklinski takes her in his arms.Ray Liotta was way better than in "Killing them softly". His scarred face with those icy eyes make him perfect material to interpret a mob boss. Calculated and insensitive. The moment where he has to liquidate Rosenthal was magnificent played.And yes, David Schwimmer performed to my surprise as the Jewish Rosenthal. I didn't recognize him immediately with that huge mustache and ponytail. But unfortunately he reminds me every time of Ross. The way he moves and the way he talks. Every time I expect him to talk with that slow depressed voice. But actually it didn't bother me that much.Ventimiglia fitted just perfectly in this movie and despite the limited role Chris Evans delivered a meritorious contribution.The content of the film was basically limited to the necessary things in Kuklinski's life. His recruitment by Demeo and the dirty work he does for him. His family life that he tries to protect and to shield from the rest. And finally his arrest. And that was for me a downer. For example, they only used 10 seconds to shed a light on the youth of Kuklinski. He grew up in inhumane conditions bearing inexpressibly physical violence. This short fragment shows how he is terribly beaten by his father. I think it's a missed opportunity they didn't use that item more. The fact that Kuklinski grew up in a totally antisocial environment with parents who really didn't give a damn about their children, partly ensured that Kuklinski degenerated into a violent person. Both his father and his religious mother regularly used physical violence. One of his brothers died cause of that. Afterwards he was even physically abused by nuns as an altar boy, and he was a victim of bullying. It was probably at this time that he has undergone a metamorphosis. Philip Carlo goes deeper in this matter in his biography of Richard Kuklinski "The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer".Kuklinski apparently brutally killed one of the bullies with a club and got rid of him with deadly efficiency. Kuklinski claimed that he then realized that it was better to give the punches then to receive them. Apparently the part about the youth of Kuklinski leaves a big impression on the reader. Unfortunately this is completely omitted in the film .Why wasn't there also a broader explanation about the developments in his eventual arrest ? For how long were the feds watching him already ? Which informants worked on the case ? How did they proceed to infiltrate Kuklinski 's world? And why wasn't there a momentarily flash of this case in the courtroom ? Despite these personal criticisms, I thought it was a very good movie. A story about the interwoven lives of both an ordinary family man and a ruthless serial killer with a conscience issue. An adaptation of a voluminous literary work can be problematic and it's understandable there are fragments left out. Yet I had the feeling that it was still rushed through in a high gear. For me however, the final scene is sublime and shows the masterful performance of Shannon and the accuracy with which he has studied the beast Kuklinski and has portrayed him.This film won't leave you cold (appropriately) ...More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Iceman (2013) Worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high expectations of course awaiting this movie for many years since the HBO films back in 1992 and 2001. Namely: HBO America Undercover: Confessions of a Mafia Hit-man (1991 &amp; 2001). I actually really liked the film but was disappointed in how it was produced and thought the movie should have been an hour longer to really present more details as there was so much more not presented here.I think true crime movie fans like myself, would much more appreciate a film like this if they were able to watch the two HBO documentaries that preceded this movie back in the day. This helped me to understand the movie much more than an average viewer.Michael Shannon did a decent job in this movie. Regardless, it was still one of the better produced movies in years and was more or less true to the HBO documentaries I have viewed over the years about Richard Kuklinski.I will give this movie a 8/10 for overall movie. Hey, in this day and age...most of the Hollywood movies suck in my book! This movie gives Hollywood some hope in my mind if they produce more similarly. So, in conclusion, I give this movie a thumbs up:)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based off of actual events, The Iceman (2012) tells the story of notorious killer-for-hire Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) and his murderous path from porn film lab tech to a contract killer for the mob. While doing dirty deeds for dirty men (Ray Liotta, Robert Davi, and Chris Evans), Richard is able to be a devoted husband and father, convincing his wife (Winona Ryder) he is a currency trader.Things get dicey and he has to take some work outside of Roy (Liotta). The wrong person gets killed and it all falls apart. With Ray Liotta on board, it really played like a very dark version of Goodfellows.I was reminded very much of the Nazis saying they were "just following orders." How one can separate his evil life from his family life is hard to fathom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid movie following the mob assassin Richard Kuklinski.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Richard starts out as a business man who runs afoul of Roy Demeo because of some missing boxes, which translate into missing profits. Richard eventually rectifies his problem by murdering someone for Roy. Assassinations become a big part of his regular work. He chooses not to kill women and children, which becomes his reputation.Richard has a more or less normal life with Deborah, and raises two daughters with her.Things unravel a bit when he kills Marty, but lets the teenaged girl he was filming go free. He meets Mr. Freezy at this time. Freezy wants to kill the girl, since she saw his face; Richard prevents him from doing that, at least for a short time. This is a big backfire; Richard becomes unemployable. Eventually he becomes a sub-contractor for Mr. Freezy.Later Ray gets trouble from his boss, Leonard Marks, for a drug deal gone bad. Richard gets involved with Freezy's contracts with Marks. Roy eventually catches wind of this. Richard is definitely in a tight spot. After Marks stiffs him on a contract, Richard has had enough and does in Marks. This starts the fall of many pending weaknesses.Can Richard navigate his way out of this alive? Will his family survive the fallout? ------Scores-------Cinematography: 8/10 Good on the whole: often dark and atmospheric; other times a little shaky.Sound: 8/10 Good enough, but not really well used as an asset.Acting: 8/10 Michael Shannon, Robert Davi, Ray Liotta, and Chris Evans were rather good. David Schwimmer and James Franco I could have done without.Screenplay: 9/10 Well written; the plot moves right along.</fullReview>

I do not know if the story is 100% real, but show the methods to kill, and to disappear people, actors, scenery, history and context are perfect, I recommend this movie for two reasons, 1. It is a biography of the greatest murderer in history, 2.The contrast that with the love and dedication to his family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid, Entertaining Gangster flick based on a true Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just recently watched this movie on Netflix and thought I would share my 2 cents.Overall, I felt this movie was entertaining, and with a cast of many prominent actors such as Ray Liotta, Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder and Chris Evans, the acting was good to very good throughout. At no point did I feel bored or unmotivated to finish it, as it does have a fairly long run time at around 1:45 minutes. I'm always a sucker for gangster movies, and since this one happened to be based on real life mobsters from the 50s-80s(or otherwise known as the height of the mafia), I was even more intrigued upon finding it. The story centers around a notorious contract killer by the name of Richard Kuklinksi, and without going too far in to detail since you can read the synopsis elsewhere, he was a rather ruthless dude even for someone of his profession. This movie does well to portray him in this light, and with plenty of brutality and gore, there is certainly no shortage of shock value here. The cinematography is dark and the score, while not outstanding by any measure, sets the tone well enough for a gritty movie such as this. If you enjoy dark crime dramas(and especially ones based on real life events such as this one) then you will more than likely find this movie appealing to some degree. I gave this movie a 6 for a reason, and while I did enjoy it, I felt it had many flaws. First off, the pacing was absolutely horrid. The film spans some 35-40 years, and the scenes just kinda skip along throughout the film without ever really alerting the audience that a large amount of time has passed. Maybe the director thought this wasn't pertinent information, but it bothered me somewhat and took away from the overall experience. The script is also pretty flawed, despite the mostly good acting from everyone involved. Many of the important characters in the movie aren't explained well enough, and could have benefited from a bit more background information. Instead, the movie chooses to focus on Kuklinski's family life, a rather mundane part of the story, or sheer violence scenes that sometimes aren't explained at all. I understand the need to show the brutality of the man as it's the main draw of the film, but there is so much of it that some of it seems overdone. If the script had been fleshed out a bit more to delve deeper into the relationships Kuklinkski had with the people around him(his family excluded, they did fairly well portraying that dynamic), I think the movie may have had a bit more of an impact. In the end, this is still a very interesting movie that I found to be pretty entertaining. Fans of mobster flicks and true crime movies should give this one a look. It definitely has it's flaws, most notably the pacing and lack of character development, but overall the experience is still enjoyable. Michael Shannon does well portraying the massive monster that was Richard Kuklinski, and the supporting cast does well considering what they had to work with. If I could do halves, i'd give it a 6.5/10 since I enjoyed the subject material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>such a disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have Michael Shannon, Chris Evans, James Franco, Winona Ryder, and Ray Liotta. You have one of the most interesting assassins ever to have walked the earth, Richard Kuklinski, one of the most articulate, intelligent, and dangerous hit men for the mob. This movie ought been what Fincher's Zodiac was for Arthur Leigh Allen. If you compare this movie with the HBO documentary about The Iceman, the latter fares better. The 'please God' scene was eerie, and brutal, and merciless, unrelenting when narrated by the real life Kuklinski. In the movie, it's so phoned in, so light, so episodic it fails to deliver the powerful punch. Besides, I don't think Michael Shannon was cast well. Don't get me wrong, I admired his work in Take Shelter, where his neurosis was ever so subtle and his performance outstanding. Here, I find his character poorly written. Besides, the real Kuklinski looked much more ominous - he could look like a door to door seller, but also like a gangster. The real life Kuklinski sends shivers down your spine. This movie does not. I was extremely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Underdeveloped Could-have-been Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as biopics go we do have a lot but only a few that you actually remember. Of which the ones I remember are The Aviator, Gandhi, Malcolm X &amp; Walk the line &amp; The Social Network. Most of them have been undoubtedly altered to a bit to match its celluloid counterparts and some would end up being a mangled mess. Well The Iceman is nowhere close to that but it does have its flaws.Helmed by Ariel Vromen, The Iceman is the semi-biopic of Richard Kuklinski, the infamous contract killer who's killed more than 100 people. He gets name as he 1. is a Cold hearted killer completely devoid of emotions 2. He freezes his victims so as not to identify the time of their death. Yet the movie makes us root for this sociopath. I'd have felt good had it been true that Richard Kuklinski was actually a man to root for. The whole thing was on Michael Shannon's shoulders and he did splendidly well. The first time I'd seen him was in Kangaroo Jack as the badass antagonist and since then we've all came to know him, much recently in Boardwalk Empire, Premium Rush and as the unforgettably aggressive General Zod in Man Of Steel. The same of the aggression could be seen here as Richard Kuklinski and at the same time he's well portrayed the role of a loving father and who's 'everything' would be his family. Winona Ryder's role as Kuklinski's wife felt naive throughout the movie, yes her character demanded that kinda credulousness but it could have been more convincing. Chris Evans' unrecognizable role as Richard's partner in crime Mr. Freezy was really cool and proves that he has the chops for character roles. Ray Liota plays an antagonist here but we all know he won't come upto the sheer evilness maleficence Kuklinski himself. I was surprised to see James Franco &amp; David Schwimmer in a minuscule roles as well.Much of the problems that The Iceman had comes from its editing, writing and the overall tone it was taken. The movie was made more commercially, accessible to casual viewers. Had it been a bit made more dramatic it would have lost some audience but at the gain of more acclaim. Richard Kuklinski's backstory wasn't fleshed out. We do get glimpses of his brother but we are left to assume what all happened to him in the past via the short argument that they have. In the scene that shortly followed there were bits of what could have happened when they were young but it seemed chopped off. Who knows it could be added to a Directors Cut or something. Then again, I don't think I'd watch this again. The the way the movie progressed is another issue showing the time lapse through Kuklinski's bizarre facial hair. The Iceman also suffers from the movie treatment often twisting the real Kuklinski's movie counterpart to a more likable family man where in real life he was an abusive husband. A more commercial resemblance would be Michael Mann's Public Enemies which was much more entertaining than The Iceman. All said and done, The Iceman is in no way a laboring watch. It does entertain and all thanks to Michael Shannon's impeccable acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard-working expediter, of sorts.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Son of Polish immigrants, Richard Kuklinski was a real murderer for hire in the NJ and NY areas, from the 1950s to the 1980s. He wasn't emotionally involved with his killings, in his own words after being sent to prison, "I was a hard-working expediter, of sorts." He was paid well, he used the money for his family. This was his job, he didn't question it, he killed the people he was told to kill. He actually got to enjoy the thrill of the planning and hunt. He got the nickname "Iceman" because he often would freeze the bodies for a period of time then put them out for discovery, obscuring discovery of the actual time of death.During certain times he would experiment with new killing techniques, he would do this with strangers, for no other reason than to see if his new technique would work.Kuklinski was a big man, about 6-5 and around 300 pounds. In this movie he is played well by Michael Shannon, who himself is about 6-3, although not as heavy. Shannon gets Kuklinski's mannerisms and speech patterns just right, and what we see on screen is an excellent depiction. Shannon shows us once more that he is one of the better actors working today.Many of the scenes which involve killings are like Kuklinski himself describes in his prison interviews, which are fascinating in their own right, and widely available on the internet video sites.In spite of his cold-blooded manner as a killer for hire, in his home life he was very devoted to his family, especially towards his children. Until he was arrested and eventually convicted, none of his family members ever knew about his contract work.Winona Ryder of shoplifting fame is really good as his wife, Barbara, who in this movie is called Deborah . Chris Evans as Mr. Freezy and Ray Liotta as Demeo were two of the other mob guys.Really good movie of a very demented, cold-blooded killer who eventually died in prison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic But Typical Gangster Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ariel Vroman does a great job with this movie in which he appeals to several criteria that characterize the best true crime films. He uses the narrative style to tell Richard Kuklinski's story about the mob life. This biopic also posits a psychological stand line, suggesting that Kuklinski could be broken and that may be the reason behind all of his killings. Vroman makes sure to include graphic violence to show the gruesome and cold nature of Kuklinski when he kills. In the end justice triumphs and Kuklinski is caught by the police but at a great cost. Although he is stopped, the damage done by Kuklinski could not be undone.The movie has qualities that define good true crime films but none that make it unique or special. In this way, The Iceman seems to be a typical gangster film with a cliché&#x200e;d plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film iceman was very well written and directed. The acting in the film by far was the strongest feature. Michael Shannon role was one of the most perfectly acted parts i have seen in a while. His stoicism carry the part perfectly and was supported well by the other actors. This picture's film noir style adds a lot of the film. I is mostly dark and bleak which fits the film perfectly. The fact that this film was based off of a true story and portrays the true story almost spot on adds to the film. Knowing that Richard Kuklinski in real like has killed so many people and seeing this in the film plays on the audience emotion. The fact that someone can support a family of three on the salary of killing people for the mafia adds a psychological portion to this film. For someone to be so two faced and their family to not know until he is caught adds suspense and make this movie and overall interesting a good watch. The only downside to this film would be that the character development and story could be confusing at times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Between 1964 and 1986, Richard Kuklinski killed as many as 250 people for the mafia. His cold, callous style and willingness to do anything, earned him the nickname, The Iceman. In 1992, The Iceman granted HBO an exclusive interview, where he talked about his life and described his crimes, the way someone would describe their job. This film is the dramatization of Kuklinski's story, based entirely on what he said during his interview. Boardwalk Empire's Michael Shannon stars as Kuklinski and was absolutely the perfect choice to play him. Some actors, even ones like Shannon, seem to be destine to play certain characters, it's how they make a name for themselves. Shannon is often knocked for being too cold and emotionless in his other roles, so he was essentially the perfect choice to play the Iceman. Shannon is paired with Winona Ryder and all these years later, she still manages to annoy the hell out of me. I really don't get what people see in her. The cast of this film is rounded out by some terrific cameos, by the likes of Ray Liotta, James Franco, and David Schwimmer, all of whom are terrific and add to the mystique of this film. I really did enjoy this film, but it is confusing and somewhat slow at times, slower than you wouldn't expect a film about a mafia hit-man to be. This films throws so many names at you and jumps from scene to scene and time to time so quickly, that it is a little difficult to keep track of who's who. Other than that, the performances are terrific and it's amazing how they were able to piece together a film from a simple interview, definitely worth checking out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Shannon makes this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, the biggest thing I took away from this film is Michael Shannon's portrayal of Richard Kuklinski. I've been a fan of his for years now throughout his other works I've seen. His intensity sure lends a helpful hand to his character and the film as a whole.Otherwise, speaking for myself, I found it a bit hard to follow everyone's names throughout. Sometimes I have this trouble, especially if they don't really go in depth with who's who and I just got flustered. Aside from that, the supporting characters as well as the story as enjoyable and easy to get involved in.I saw a few reviews questioning the direction of Kuklinski's character not being as cold and ruthless as his real-life counter part which this film is based on. Since I'm not familiar with the man before this film, that did little to sway me.So as a whole, I enjoyed it but found all the names a bit hard to follow at least the first time through. This would surely yield a second run-through for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Iceman is well worth a watch. Michael Shannon is fantastic and conveys the cold character that Richard Kuklinski became associated with tremendously well. Rightly so he was recognized my the Newport Beach film festival for an outstanding achievement in acting. I was gripped from the start, intrigued by Shannon and his activities. If one was to be picky however, I would say there could have been more character development for Kuklinski. I actually found myself sympathizing with him as a man trying to provide for his family rather than the sadistic, cold and brutal man that he was. Nevertheless 7.5 would be a perfect rating in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Iceman" Never Generates Any Heat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What should be a horrific and gripping dramatization of a true story ends up as a tepid and unengaging film.Michael Shannon plays Richard Kuklinski, a notorious mob hit-man who kept his job secret from his wife (Winona Ryder) and two daughters for years until the law descended on him. Shannon is expert at playing crazy guys, and he gives another good performance in this film, but he's let down by a paint-by-numbers and dull screenplay and a director who would rather flit across all of the main points of Kuklinski's story rather than delve down into the fetid mess that was this man's life. We've seen mob movies ad nauseum, and the details about how he goes about with his killings have a been-there-done-that qualify. It's the dynamic between Kuklinski and his wife, who admits to herself in her more honest moments that there's something probably terribly wrong but who spends the rest of her time in utmost denial, that should have been the most interesting thing about the movie. But Ryder, who's also very good, is given little screen time, and her character is reduced to a mere sketch.Chris Evans appears as a fellow contract killer, sporting a Rip Van Winkle beard and haircut. The only scene that really comes alive, one set in a nightclub, does so because of him, even if his jocular antics feel out of place in the movie.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After finding the story about Kuklinski by random youtube surfing I decided to watch this movie. I believe that the movie was a poor representation of this man and his story where most of the focus was on how bad he was treating his family.It would have made for a much more interesting movie if the point of focus would have been more on his upbringing, how he was abused by his both his parents throughout all of his childhood which ultimately was the sole reason for his diagnose as anti-social and paranoid-sociopath.I do not wish to defend this man in any way but it should be taken in consideration that he was a hit-man, he killed as a profession for the mob. He never killed any women or children and the men that were the targets for sure came in that situation for one reason or another.Great story, poor movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm going to keep this extremely basic...this Film was way too short, it all felt extremely rushed (especially if you know his story). I was very excited for the first 30 minutes or so, but then the story went somewhere...Where? Nobody knows. Gone, poof.The rest of the movie was rushed to the full extent and the way Kuklinski was interpreted in regards to family was way exaggerated, the same goes for killing Women. Overall I was very hurt with this one...I can't make a true review because of that, if I were to blame someone, it would be Ariel Vromen for the very hasty, somewhat mainstream story. I think if we've learnt anything in recent years, is that viewers are actually starting to enjoy movies which are full, and intelligent, that being said this was a Biography of sorts. My main point is, this movie could have been so much more, but because of a premature Director it became an attempt to catch the Mainstreams eye, and judging from the costs and profits...didn't fair well either. I'll be watching Vromen closely from now on, deciding whether or not he deserves a place in my personal blacklist. - An Angry Viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fascinating but slightly inaccurate account of serial mob hit man Richard Kuklinski.The cast is good. Michael Shannon has got a face that is suitable for a killer. Although if you look at the pictures of the real person, Michael looks more sinister than the real person. It's good to see the very pretty Winona Ryder in a major role as the unsuspecting wife again. She is a bit too beautiful for the role but it's fine. Surprising major stars put in an appearance like James Franco as a victim and a barely recognizable Chris Evans all uglied up as another hit man.There are some inaccuracies which I think were wrong to write into the movie. Firstly there was a first marriage and kids. Secondly there was a son in the second marriage. Thirdly Richard was more cruel and arbitrary a killer than depicted - enjoying torture and more non job related victims etc. The movie seemed to make him a rather sympathetic character who loved his family and just did this as primarily as a job. I understand the need for brevity but why not do an accurate account? How many times are they going to depict this story anyway? Overall it's chilling for sure and worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Review: What an intense movie. I really enjoyed the intensity of this film which had a great cast who all put in great performance. Michael Shannon was perfect for his role as a hired killer who just wants to provide for his family, at any cost. Whilst watching the film, it's hard to think that these events actually happened, which made the movie even more intense. Throughout the movie you don't know if this is a good or bad guy, even though he does do some gruesome things. It does have a Goodfellas feel to it, but it doesn't glorify gangsters like some other movies do. The director done a great job putting together such an in depth concept. There are A List stars throughout the movie, like Luke Evans and James Franco who only play small roles. Anyway, in all this is a movie that is definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I have always questioned if I actually like Michael Shannon as an actor because he always seems so intense and in deep thought. That's why he was perfect for this role and he made the movie for me. After watching the extras on the DVD, I realised that he was supposed to have testified against the Gambino family, but he died a mysteries death beforehand. He ended up killing over a hundred people in real life so that tells you how much the Iceman's services were used during the 60's, 70's and 80's without his family knowing. I'm sure that there is more to the Iceman's life story, but this is a great take on a period of his life.Budget: $10million Worldwide Gross: $2million (Deserved More!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there crime/dramas about a hit man trying to provide the good things in life for his family. 7/10</fullReview>

I know that when one adapts a literary work into a film, it is bound to be "Different" - I respect that, because every artist is entitled to what we call, "Artistic License". But in this case the movie was "BAD - Different". Micheal Shannon however was BADASS. He was by far the best, and I think he will have more roles of badasses in the future.

		<shortDescription>Still waiting for the REAL "Iceman"-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lot has been said before and I have to agree with most people: A) Good movie, B) Great performance by Michael Shannon and C) Not the Iceman-movie. Just a movie.Reading the book and watching HBO series makes you just want for more. This whole story, but especially the sociopathic nature of this freak of nature is primary factor, which sucks you in. People have always been interested about gray areas in human nature. Real-life Ritchie Kuklinski did'not have any other area almost at all. He was kind of like circus-freak. He was'not even cruel, as the man just did'not feel anything. No compassion, no guilt. As he describes in HBO, he did'not enjoy killing itself - but there was a certain thrill in hunting and planning so everything could play out perfect. He shows almost no emotions talking about his murders, just rationally describing details as if he has braking refrigerators for living. That's how real Kuklinski felt towards fellow human beings. With that being said - he had this psychopathic skill still to behave almost charming in a casual way. He also had a complicated rage-problem - which most likely had developed out of constant beating in childhood.The other part, which was remarkable with real Kuklinski - was his curiosity. He agreed to talk with psychiatrists, because he was curious about why did he have such extreme lack of feelings. Killing people he often studied different items such has death itself, faith, etc. One of them is described in the movie as well.And third part in real Kuklinski - was his gambling nature. Not that he would have been gambler in a casinos, but there's something in him which always calculated different scenarios. That's why a person next to him was never safe - you could'not guess, when he decided hurting you is a necessary bet enough to achieve some goal he has at the moment. That's a little glimpse about real Kuklinski - plus - this whole underworld mobster-scene he operated in - when "at work and away from home".Is'not there a little more material than just for a regular OK mobster-flick? This should be more like a character study. Something so sinister in it's casual next-door-like appearance, which makes Hannibal Lecter almost as simple, one-dimensioned caricature. I mean - real Kuklinski was kind of worst demon in hell, true devil in his form using this big, silent, sometimes even smiling family-man - invisibly switching identities back and forth as wishes.I really hope someone accepts the challenge and just takes this very same story - story of real Kuklinski. And makes a real Iceman-movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE ICEMAN was one of those films where, seeing the preview, I thought, "I HAVE to see that, ASAP!" I was not disappointed in the film itself. The acting is good --Ryder in particular really shines--and the filming is even better. THE ICEMAN captures the 60s and 70s very well. It's tense and gripping, with a number of small twists and surprises (even though there are not a lot of really big ones).Still, this film seems to be missing a piece or two, and something more is needed. That something is probably more in the way of a beginning: THE ICEMAN is mostly middle and end. More back-story on Richard Kuklinski's early life would have provided more complete development of his character.Another issue may simply be the true story on which this film is based. It's interesting to learn the story of a less-publicized mass murderer, but, crass as it may sound, the fact that Kuklinski was a contract killer whose victims were mostly violent criminals themselves takes away a lot of the morbid fascination we find in serial killers such as Henry Lee Lucas or Ted Bundy, who murdered just for the thrill of it.I dunno, but some other reviewers have stated that the real-life Richard Kuklinski, unlike the one shown in this film, could not have cared less about his own family, would kill ANYone that got in his way, etc. Assuming that's really the case, it might have made for a better film if they'd not tried to make a noble villain out of the man, showing him as the psychopathic monster that he was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can a man be without emotion? Or a human being in general. And I'm not talking about positive emotions alone, like happiness and other stuff. There is also anger and madness. While the man portrayed by Michael Shannon here might seem like that at first, he is anything but somebody without emotion. He is just masquerading it. He's someone broiling from the inside.I haven't seen interviews with the "original" man, but if you take into account that he was a psychopath/sociopath, I'm not sure, anything he said should be taken into account. Or at least not worry too much about it that is. Michael Shannon performs on a level that is just devastating. He makes an unlikeable character believable and almost sympathetic. It's about survival and about what he cherishes in life. Someone said, that the persons near to him are like possessions. I'd like to differ.In his own crazy mind, he cares for them. In a unique way of course, but it's like a "mother instinct" if you want. We don't get too much back-story about the man at first, but eventually enough to paint a picture of him (especially during a visit to prison, where he meets a person that was close to him, reminding him of his past). There are also flashbacks, that help build the character. I don't know how close this all is, as I said, to the real "story", but it works more than neatly for the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's seldom I come away from a film thinking what an awesome performance from the lead, Michael Shannon captured this character, who while disconnected from emotions in a psychopathic way also resonated familiarity and a very identifiable normal human being making you feel compassion for him and his plight of just trying to earn enough to provide for his family and survive in a tough world. I still don't know how he pulled it off. Welcome Back Ray Liotta, Who has made some guff lately, but still not Ray at his best, I'm sure thats still to come. Wynonna was sterling and apologies for not paying more attention as she was so good she blended in as a completely believable character..if that makes any sense..so good I missed her work? In Short Legend of a film, definitely one everybody should see and its a shame this genre of films don't make the headlines anymore such as Godfather, Goodfellows even Silence of The Lambs..Thrillers is general because they are getting overlooked in favour of CGI blockbusters.More like this please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HK Auteur Review - The Iceman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The true story of Richard Kuklinski, the notorious contract killer and family man, who has claimed of killing over a hundred victims.The cast gives good performances. Michael Shannon brings gravitas to the Iceman. It's impressive how much life he's breathed into a role that is so oblique and intimidating. The audience never really knows what is going on inside his head, but a threatening violence is communicated underneath his dead calm demeanor. It's an engaging scary performance. Winona Ryder is good in the role of Kuklinski's wife Deborah but the potential of the role isn't explored to the fullest. The real-life Kuklinski did hit his wife and broke her nose several times. Unfortunately for Ryder, it is not explored in the film. Kuklinski's wife in the film suspects something is wrong but is scared to pry, which is contrary to her real-life counterpart had no idea what was going on at all. This was all probably changed to create more character likability for Kuklinski, more on that later. Chris Evans gets to transform and do some character acting as the Iceman's assassin partner Mr. Freezy. Evan seems to be reveling in this part, it's probably a breath of fresh air from having doing the recent Marvel films. James Franco also shows up in a fun cameo role.The story, however, fails to rise above the sum of its parts. One particular aspect of dramatic filmmaking is for the story to be compelling, the audience generally has to empathize and root for its protagonist. It's hard to feel that for Richard Kuklinksi because he is fully aware of his actions. Kuklinksi was an effective killer from his lack of compassion for people. He gave zero thought to murder and that's what made him scary. But director Ariel Vromen tries to insert the idea that Kuklinski had empathy and struggled with balancing his antisocial behavior with the safety of his family. This is only touched upon and never fully explored. But perhaps there was nothing behind the real Iceman's psychosis, maybe he just did not have empathy. The truth is Vromen doesn't know more than we do and the film is only working on pure speculation. . So it is soft pedaling solely for dramatic purposes, Vromen should have just taken narrative liberties and just fully presented his own take of what happened.Perhaps it's not even Vromen's fault, dramatic film was probably not the proper format for this story. I recommend everybody see the 1992 HBO documentary The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer. Watching Richard Kuklinski recount his own story was a much more compelling and shocking experience. The Iceman, by comparison, seems relatively watered down and this isn't a story that should be toned down.For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Pray to God. Tell him to come down and stop me." This is the true story of a man named Richard Kuklinski (Shannon). He is a devoted husband and father who would do anything for him family. As far as his family knows he went from making Disney movies to currency exchange. He is a great provider and great person. The truth is something Richard hides from him family. He is one of the most notorious contract killer's in history and kills with no remorse or feeling toward his victim. He is the Iceman. I am a huge fan of mafia type movies. While this isn't really a mafia type movie it has the feel of a Goodfellas-esque movie. The movie is violent and shows killings but it's not really that graphic which helps the movie by not taking you out of the emotion by showing someones head explode. While I wouldn't call this a modern classic that should be watched over and over like Goodfellas or Scarface I do think that it very much worth watching and I did enjoy it. Shannon is great in this and he can really pull off the tough guy look like few can. Overall, a very good movie that also has a Sopranos-esque feel in the way that you find it hard to hate the bad guy. I give it a B.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's nothing wrong with this film. The cast is good, the direction's not bad, Michael Shannon gives a really good performance... I remember Jon Hamm saying in an interview once that it's crazy that "good isn't good enough anymore." He meant that everyone expects everyone to be the best thing ever or else they'll ignore. I don't feel that way, but this is probably gonna come off like that.This film is good, but that's not good enough for me. It tells the story of what happened, but was just so flatly uninteresting, even while interesting things were happening with curious characters. By the time the film ended, I felt nothing. I would have rather watched a documentary, because in an effort to tell a true, ridiculous story, it did so in the flattest, most subdued way possible. I'm not asking for style, for style's sake, but this is just an anonymous film with Tarantino-esque characters and no one to really connect with.This is a film you'll forget you saw 5 minutes after it's over. And I don't wanna say there are wasted performances or anything...just...I wanted something more. Something to discern it from any other straight to VOD crime film, however true. Something more than just good cinematography, good casting and believable performances.I'm not greedy...I didn't need this to be David Fincher's Zodiac or Spike Lee's Summer of Sam or Patty Jenkins' Monster or Silence of the Lambs. But this makes We Own the Night look like The Departed.It is what it is, I guess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar ground heightened by Shannon's performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Iceman" is an unremarkable, yet competent biopic of its title character, Richard Kuklinski, providing only a limited insight into what made him one of the most prolific hit man in history. Claiming to have pulled off over one hundred hits to his name, Richard Kuklinski was a legendary mafia contract killer known for his intimidating stature, and his cold-hearted, nonchalant approach to his craft. "The Iceman," based on a true story, is a fairly standard biopic that is only exalted beyond mediocrity by an imposing performance from Michael Shannon. Shannon's commanding performance is clearly the centerpiece of the movie, as he effortlessly exudes a cold-hearted confidence as a genuine, psychopathic hit-man. Richard Leonard "The Iceman" Kuklinski was a Polish-American contract killer who worked his way up the chain of command, eventually landing a position as a hit man for the Gambino crime family. The 6'5", 300 pound "Iceman" claimed to have murdered over 100, or possibly 250 men (his recollections varied) between 1948 and 1986. Amidst all the murderous mayhem, Kuklinski found the time to marry and have two daughters as well, while successfully keeping his job as hit man a secret from them. Set primarily in the 1970s New Jersey, the film unfolds via episodic segments, chronicling Kuklinski's early beginnings editing porn movies and the marriage to his wife Deborah (Winona Ryder), to being recruited by the Gambino family by mob boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta), and finally his inevitable capture and conviction. Kuklinski was an impenetrable individual, and Shannon is first-rate in a suitably complex performance. Shannon bounces back and forth between family man and maniacal murderer with a sinister ease. Kuklinski exhibits an array of methods utilized to complete the task at hand, along with his trademark, freezing his victims for months before disposing of the bodies. An unusual collection for a supporting cast does a fine job overall. Chris Evans plays Robert, or Mr. Freezy, a cold-hearted killer who drives an ice cream truck who also works for the mob. James Franco plays Marty, a prospective hit. David Schwimmer plays Josh, Roy's right-hand man, and Stephen Dorff plays Richard's estranged, imprisoned brother Joey. Shannon does his best with the limited material, and Ryder gives a good performance as Richie's oblivious wife. Regrettably, a thin, all too familiar script of standard mob stories that span over decades undermines all efforts. The movie never offers anything new that hasn't been seen before, and the finale just kind of happens without much of a buildup. Unfortunately, besides seeing just how many era-appropriate hairstyles and beards its characters can model in one movie, this telling of Richard's story seems to care more about the body count above all else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having already read the book and watched the HBO series I may have expected a bit much from this film. While I agree that Michael Shannon was perfectly cast as the 'Ice Man' other cast members seemed to be going through the motions half heartedly. Ray Liotta in particular had a lot of work to do in creating the monster that was Roy Demeo and he played the part like he was Henry Hill trying his hardest to be Tommy Devito. The films story was quite disjointed and we never really get to know the characters in the story and it seems like the film makers are relying on you to already have foreknowledge which is quite lazy film making, possibly also it was created this way to be more palatable as the real Richard kuklinski was cold and clinical with a sickening appetite and creativity for murder (read his account of death by Rat) To be fair its not a total waste but it could have been much much more.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kuklinski's fiasco on film print</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Casted with a cream of talented actors, for which sincerely everyone gave their best, the movie actually stomped hard in a script and direction crisis that failed miserably to show interest in the protagonist.The film obviously suffers from the absence of anyone to care about because it was shot-like as a documentary - a brief and massively incomplete narrative about the life of this mafia's cold-ruthless hit-man. The director may have well in mind the "based on a true story" concept rather than going into the true Richard Kuklinski's biography idea, but the progress of the film was too expeditious and sometimes obnoxiously recurrent while dealing his countless impulse murders or contract killings.But the biggest failure in the plot line was the weak portrayal and developing line between Kuklinsky's underground life and the social relationship into his family life - Hardly toned and underplayed.Even with these serious imperfections the movie still delivers strong punches in the stomach with brilliant performances, atmospheric scores and good photography. In short, it's a demonic experience into the life of a conscienceless man that balance into bloody mayhem and the ingenious caring and love-bound knit to his family. But society often forgets that psychopaths are also pathological liars and misleading dramatis personae.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Based On The Incredible True Story Of Richard Kuklinski, the notorious contract killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Shannon gives a very menacing portrayal of Richard Kuklinski, the "cold as ice" contract killer. Incidentally the name "The Iceman" is given to him, because he froze the guys(in a deep freezer) that he killed. This meant the Police could not give an accurate time of death which is vital in a murder trial. The film shows the time he became a contract killer and to his arrest at the hands of the Police. Ray Liotta stars as Roy DeMeo who recruits Kuklinski and gives him various errands to do, from collecting to performing hits. Ray's acting is excellent as always. I have rarely seen him act badly and these Mafia roles are the ones he's best at.Kuklinski makes a mistake which severs his relation to Roy. So he starts to act independently - a sort of freelance assassin. Unaware to him, he is closely being scrutinized by undercover Police, which then leads to his arrest and incarceration. Winona Ryder plays Deborah, Kuklinski's wife. Winona is a favorite of mine and it was good to see her after a long time. I think the last film I saw her in was Alien Resurrection.The film fails in many aspects: the hits are not shown properly and the background music score is either (1)not there or (2)is inadequate and does not do the film justice. The script should have been polished and more content added. The childhood of Kuklinski and the abuse he suffered at the hands of his mother should have been explored. Also the death of his brother Florian(at the hands of Kuklinski's father) should have been shown. Kuklinski's prowlings of Hell's Kitchen is not shown. And finally his life and death in prison is not shown. Exactly how he was killed is a matter of imagination to the director.Better choice directors for this film: Francis Ford Coppola(Godfather Trilogy, and Dracula), Brian De Palma(Scarface, Carlito's Way), Martin Scorsese(Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas), Alan Parker(Midnight Express, The Life Of David Gale), Michael Mann(Manhunter, Heat, The Keep) William Friedkin(The French Connection, Cruising, The Exorcist) and David Fincher(Alien3, Seven, Panic Room). Verdict: only one time viewing, if you don't know anything about this guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading Richard Kuklinsky's biography and watching his documentary, this movie leaves much to be wanted, by anyone who had any inclination as to who he was. He was a man that demanded respect and this movie did not do him justice he hated his mother sister and brother and threatened his father with death at very young age, he used to to test weapons out on innocents just to see how they'd they work for his own amusement. He was extremely to his wife but never to his kids, his wife stated once that if you ever hit our children I'll kill you in your sleep and he understood and respected that law. There is also barely to any mention of the rat cave that was literally his killing ground where you would see just how cold this man was he'd take victims to this cave full of big rats and leave them there to be eaten alive, he'd set up cameras to watch how the rats ate his victims for his paying customers so'd they'd see and hoped they'd enjoy as much as he did. . His patterned jaw grind when he was angry was never prevalent in the film and I felt it should've as it just would've added to the character. but whatever I'm drunk so who cares right. I give this a generous six as I honestly expected more</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is based on a true story about a notorious contract killer. And it pretty much goes in a narrow direction. With a lot of the plot coming from the interview from the contract killer. I didn't particularly like how this movie gives a bit of a soft spot for this sadistic killer. Someone who has no respect for human life and wants to make a legacy of himself. The guy's name is Richard Kuklinski(Michael Shannon)and he is a guy that would kill anyone excluding women and children for money. And people he feels that have wronged him, even if it's something slight or big or intentional or not. In another word Kuklinski was a man that had no respect for human life but himself. Sure villains or more interesting since they are more unpredictable and sometimes might want to get into the head of the villain and want to see what makes the villain tick. But I just don't see how some people may idolize this guy. He even went around killing random people just for the heck of it and blamed it on his childhood. And he was mentally stable and knew exactly what he was doing. This flick shows him as this family man but it seemed like he cared more about his ego over his family. Now Michael Shannon did a good job playing the killer and has the right stature. But Shannon usually sticks out with the villain roles. Jack Nicholson would have been perfect for this role if he was younger though. I did like how this movie show the inner core of the so called family in a crime organization, because there is no such thing. And how they will easily turn on each other or use others as stepping stones for their own benefit. However there isn't any tense or enthralling or compelling or even haunting parts in this movie. It's just a very narrow movie about a hit-man who has a family. Which actually makes Richard Kuklinski even more malicious, vile and despicable. Because he only cares about his family but screws over the families of others. It's a watchable movie but nothing more. Also this movie has Chris Evans and James Franco in it, I thought it would be cool to see these 2 actors in a movie together. But they are hardly even in this, which is disappointing.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Iceman" (15) Director: Ariel Vromen Starring: Micheal Shannon, Winona Ryder, Chris Evans and James Franco. Rated: 15 for containing strong violence, sex and very strong language. Out Now in selected UK cinemas. "The Iceman", tells the story of Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon), a real-life hit man who worked for the Gambino crime family, led by Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta). Kuklinski appears to be living the American dream, by having a family, a nice house, cars and plenty of money. Soon, the cracks begin to show and it is up to Kuklinski, to keep the secrets at bay. "The Iceman" begins with an old and withered Richard Kuklinski being interviewed whilst in prison about his life and the murders which he committed. A stirring scene, as Kuklinski admits he killed people not for the fun, but for the intensity of planning the murder. From this moment onwards, I knew that Michael Shannon was the man to play Kuklinski.Without a doubt, Michael Shannon has become one of the best on-screen actors from the past ten years. From small beginnings in "Groundhog Day" (1993), Shannon rose to take larger and more complex roles. His career did not take flight though, until 2007, when he starred in "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" by Sidney Lummet. In 2012, Shannon was given his chance to take centre stage in "Premium Rush" and "Mud" and performed well.The actor has become well known for his ability to control the screen through tense stares and action. Shannon's acting ability is put to good use in "The Iceman", who takes a solemn turn on Richard Kuklinski. The film itself (unfortunately) is particularly shallow. The film leaves out key details in which documentaries have not. The beginning of the film, fails to tell the audience about Richard's abusive childhood and the murder of his own brother, by his father.The film does include however, details on his other brother, who was a convicted rapist and murderer named Joseph, a fine performance from Stephen Dorff ("Blade"). The cameo performances are very good, with Chris Evans and David Schwimmer proving that when asked they can step into the firing line to deliver a piece that is interesting to watch. The supporting cast are also well played, with names such as Ray Liotta and Winona Ryder."The Iceman" is an enjoyable thriller, which at times misses its queue, but at others shines; whether it be through performances or some great cameos.3 STARSWritten by Scott Gentry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>. . . may never sound as innocent to viewers of this movie, the true story of New Jersey's "Mr. Freezy" contract hit men, who used their distinction tasty treat truck to double as a hearse for ferrying mob hits from murder sites to their walk-in cooler. "We're gonna need more shelves," is the best line of the movie, said by the title character (played by Michael Shannon) to his "Mr. Freezy" partner, played by Chris Evans, when he realizes that a bumper crop of corpses are crowding pop-sickles and push-ups off the freezer racks. A sympathetic role model because he won't kill women or kids, "Richie" (Shannon's true life counterpart) was sent to Jersey's maximum security prison in real life and died there. The authorities did not use their brains, or they would have realized that criminals have been killing each other since Cain and Abel in 70,000 B.C. When skillful contract workers with humanitarian principles such "The Iceman" are "taken off the streets," the criminal establishment then is forced to resort to amateurs who spray bullets everywhere--killing innocent civilians--or less accurate bombings, which can have the same effect on ordinary people. Surely this country is going to the dogs when professionals such as "The Iceman" are strangled to death by the government red tape wrapping up at least half of America's entrepreneurs today!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "The Iceman", starring Michael Shannon-Jonah Hex, Bad Boys 2, and he is General Zod in next weeks' Man of Steel; Winona Ryder-Black Swan, Alien: Resurrection; Ray Liotta-Killing Them Softly, Wild Hogs and Chris Evans-Captain America in The Avengers, The Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies. This is based on a true story about Richard Kuklinski, the most famous contract killer in New Jersey. He operated from the 1960's until his arrest in 1986. He was married and had two daughters and when he was arrested, his wife and family said they did not know about his double life. Michael plays Richard and Winona plays his wife. Ray is the mob boss that Michael worked for and Chris is a fellow hit man/friend. Michael was called the Iceman because of his ability to switch from loving family man to cold blooded killer without missing a beat. Plus, he also liked to dismember his victims and freeze the body parts before disposing of them, so that the time of death would be hard to determine. He was smart. Michael was reputed to have killed anywhere between 100 to 250 people and at the end of the movie you find out what happened to him. This movie is in limited release but it has several known actors in smaller parts, including Stephen Dorff, Robert Davi and David Schwimmer-haven't seen him in a while. It's rated "R" for violence, language and sexual content and has a running time of 1 hour &amp; 45 minutes. It's not for the squeamish but I enjoyed it and I would buy this one on DVD.</fullReview>

But if you're normal, then you'll agree that "Iceman," based on the true story of the most notorious contract killer to come out of the state of New Jersey, is reprehensible, repulsive and disgusting. It makes "Goodfellows" look like the "Howdy Doody Show." At least "This Gun for Hire" starring Alan Ladd has distinction and class.

		<shortDescription>The Banality of Evil?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ICEMAN Richard Kuklinski was a real guy. He claims to have killed at least 100 people. He later claimed it was 250 including Jimmy Hoffa. He was a sociopath so believe what you want, but there doesn't seem to be much doubt that in his time, which fortunately for all of us ran out in 2006, he killed a lot of people.Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) apparently had an active amateur career as a serial killer before his talents are discovered by mob boss Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta) who employs Kuklinski to kill on his order anytime, anyplace, anywhere. It's steady work.With this trade, Kuklinski finds financial stability and takes his wife (Wynona Ryder) and kids out to the suburbs to live a life of bourgeoisie splendor, with his family none the wiser about what he really does. (I mean think about it, what could he tell them?)Director/writer/producer Ariel Vromen's resume is a little thin with only two feature films to his credit neither of which I have seen or even heard of, but he apparently had enough juice to get this thing made, and with a pretty impressive cast as well. His style is grimly straight forward, no editing gimmicks, obtuse camera angles, or slow motion stylized death. Vromen portrays the violence with the illusion of real time. It's quick and it it's brutal, and fair warning leads me to comment the there is a depiction of post mortem dismemberment, nevertheless this movie isn't even in the same league with your average Quentin Tarantino movie in either visuals or body count.What Vromen has given us is a gangster movie, without the grand ambitions of "The Godfather" or the quirky black humor of the Sopranos. It's about who whacks who, when, where and how. There will be betrayals, double crosses, car chases and all the mobsters will really love their families. So if you like gangster movies, and I do, you'll probably like this one and I did.Ray Liotta has been a favorite of mine since he lit up the screen in "Something Wild." He has never broken out into the superstardom I thought he was bound for, and he seems to be hopelessly typecast as a gangster, but when faced with the facts, nobody does it better. He's a treat to watch. He has a couple of scenes with fellow evil doing character actor Robert Davi, that together with Shannon form a trio that you would definitely not want to meet in a dark alley. Just ask some of the victims in the movie. The three of them lift the portrayal of menace to an art form.Wynona Ryder continues on the comeback trail with a solid performance. It's not a big part but she gets a chance to show some chops. Some have commented she looks a little too regal to be a Jersey house wife, but she's not trying to be Snookie, so I think she's alright.I will point out that James Franco has one scene in this movie, because there are James Franco fans out there that might want to know that, but it is Chris Evans who probably has the best supporting role as the Frostee Ice Cream truck driver who after selling ice cream bars to the kiddies, is probably a more twisted serial killer than Kuklinski. Like Kuklinski, he too is a devoted father.There is one exceptional thing about this movie, and clearly that is the performance of Michael Shannon. This guy has been a working actor for about 20 years so to presume that this could be a "breakout" role would indeed be presumptuous. I fell in love with this guy when as the nutty (not nutty eccentric, but nutty certifiable) neighbor who brought humor and life to the relentlessly depressing DeCaprio/Winslet vehicle "Revolutionary Road". He does the same thing in a supporting role for the recent release "Mud", which is a movie I liked, but it needed a kick in the ass from time to time, and Shannon provided it. He also received great critical praise as the lead in Jeff Nichols' "Take Shelter." A role of an amoral remorseless killer is unfortunately, well worn ground in Hollywood these days. The tendency is to create a character that is more apropos of a video game like Grand Theft Auto. Shannon is much better than that. I don't want to say he gives the character empathy, but he does give him a point of view that has a certain perverted logic to it. Shannon, as Kuklinski is certainly cold, cruel, and calculating but is tender to his family. As Kuklinski's world starts to collapse around him he becomes emotional, desperate, abusive, and panicky. If Shannon doesn't pull this off, this movie fails, miserably.Shannon is a pretty big guy (about 6'4" I'd judge) and he occasionally affects some stiff movements which kind of put me in mind of Frankenstein, and I don't say that as a knock, I say it as a compliment that Shannon can remind us that Kuklinski is a real scary monster, but that's not the really scary part.The really scary part is that he is a human being.Note: Shannon's star may ascend this summer as General Zod in the upcoming Superman reload "Man of Steel".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lacking in plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie started out promising...a great period piece with the cinematography, costumes, and props to represent the 60's and 70's, in which Richard Kulkinski worked as a hit-man for an organized crime boss, while leading a normal, married, suburban life. The all star cast in this movie does a great job with the material they are given, starting with Michael Shannon in the lead role. He plays this character in a similar fashion to the way he played a treasury agent on "Boardwalk Empire", with a calm, deliberate way of delivering his lines, but with the subtext of raging undertones that could set him off in an instant. Winona Ryder plays his innocent and adoring wife, Ray Liotta plays the ruthless crime boss, and a barely recognizable David Schwimmer plays a soldier who works for Ray Liotta. All of the acting in this movie was superb, but what was lacking was enough items in the storyline to keep the audience in suspense. Specific dates and times are listed on the screen, as we in the audience wait for something significant to happen at that date and time, but nothing does happen to make that specific date and time stand out. We get to see some of the contrast in Kulkinski's double life, from trying for normalcy with his family and old friends to his coldness he must bring to his work. But it simply isn't enough, and we are never told how the police eventually catch up with him. In addition, at the beginning of the movie, before he is hired by the crime boss, he ruthlessly kills someone outside of a pool hall who had insulted him a few minutes earlier. But we never really find out why this is important.With a better script which allowed the plot to be explained in further detail, this movie could have been a must see.</fullReview>

I keep nice memories of both, there are plenty of those.I always tried to figure out why is there mafia in Tristate area? But it seems to me that it is a little bit overblown, I think it is just such a blue collar state that it has to be some kind of crime issues. It simply is that kind of state.This film well portrays all this. Proximity to New York City and nice shots are part of this film. Plot is interesting, since it is based on a true story, it makes it even more cool..Acting is excellent, and I recommend this film to everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the roles that were in this movie i expected a lot more, (evans, ryder, liotta even schwimmer) and also the book itself i could not put down. This movie I felt didn't have any appeal. It dragged on and has a very slow pace. It didn't feel like the book.The movie should of took a more biographical feel and took emphasis on the unbelievable kills he managed to pull off. IT didn't feel like a non fiction movie anymore, it felt more like another wanna be made up mafia movie. People want to see how he got away with his heists and crimes for so long.It's clear that kuklinski had his share of problems, but he was a ruthless and very clever assassin who was extremely paranoid and clever at covering his tracks. He was never caught for a long time because of how he operated.He would torture his victims to teach them a lesson, the mafia would often tell him to teach a lesson. He was very effective at that. This movie does not show all the graphical brutality that i expected. It does not show all the different ways he ambushed and killed his victims. How he obsessively stalked them.In conclusion, I am disappointed in this portrayal of this incredibly twisted yet resourceful individual kuklinski. Given his personality and strange he was raised he still is a legendary individual mostly based upon his fearless ability to accomplish whatever takes the mafia puts his way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of A Great True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tale of Richard Kuklinksi is one of the most morbid, fascinating, and utterly disturbing serial killer tales I've ever encountered. The fact that he was a hit-man for the mob only made it a more incredible story.So enter a great cast of character actors, led by the always tense Michael Shannon... and this film could have been a landmark achievement in both the serial killer and mob genre. Instead it is completely wasted, as the film never even scratches at the depravity Kuklinski indulged in.Shannon, Evans, and co. all deliver... however the writers completely fail. This story needs to be retold, it's a shame this treatment was so woefully forgettable and mediocre. I look forward to the day that the proper creative talent come across Kuklinski's story. Will keep enjoying Shannon in Boardwalk Empire and other properly developed projects.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is Type Casting for a Reason. In this Real-Life Story of a Mob Hit-Man known as The Iceman, who most likely Killed Over 100 People, Michael Shannon is the Type you want. They get it here as the Actor is known for his Cold Blooded Stare and Beneath the Surface Rage.In this Low-Budget, Styleless Movie the Two Decade time Span is a Run Through of Wigs and Mustaches on some Cameos from Well Known Thespians. Taking its Cue from the Infamous Nickname of the Murderer the Movie moves Seamlessly, but Matter of Factly from One Murder to Another without much Attention to Motive or Detail. The Split-Personality of the Killer/Family Man is the Focus and it does Deliver Enough of that to be Convincing. But for a Mob/Hit-man Movie it is all quite Subdued and Subtle. A Character Study that might be Slightly Lacking in the Study of this Sociopaths Character. It is all Surface and Very Little Substance, and the Fine Acting by All Involved is Rendered Rather Limp and the Film seems more like a Snapshot than a Feature Film.Overall, the Performances are worth a Watch Propelled by the Always Fascinating Underbelly of the Human Condition. Winona Ryder is quite Effective as the Unsuspecting Wife, as She and the Two Daughters make a Mark alongside all the Grotesque Males that Inhabit this Underworld.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As cold as it's main man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a true life story about arguably one of the most notorious mob hit-man in history (kill total suspected to be over 100 victims) The Iceman sure does a good job of being pretty uninteresting and uninvolving for the majority of its relatively short running time. The reason behind this mediocrity can be attributed to the films lack of quality control and production.Working on a seemingly small budget Iceman can't help but feel like a TV movie. From the cookie cutter vintage costumes, dank and dull cinematography and some truly bad facial hair Iceman just oozes a b movie despite the presence of many a recognizable actor and a story just ready to be told again in a more involving fashion.Michael "crazy eyes" Shannon is milking his cooped up psychopath skitch for all it's worth and here as real life hit-man Richard Kuklinski has his moments but one can't help but feel it's nothing new from him and he seems better as lost cause Nelson Van Ulden in HBO's Boardwalk Empire or playing bit part roles in films such as Revolutionary Road. The rest of the cast don't really register and some actually did themselves no favours appearing in this ? here's looking at you in particular David Schwimmer but Chris Evans, James Franco and Winona Ryder aren't to far behind.Iceman like it's main man is a cold entity. Not once does it seem like there is any real effort to connect in a meaningful way and jumps in time and seemingly missed plot points work against the film and therefore it seems permanently stuck in 1st gear. Despite its premise and interesting cast Iceman is one film you can cross of your kill, I mean watch list without a moment's hesitation.2 ponytailed Ross from Friends out of 5 For more movie reviews and articles check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Michael Shannon brings notorious killer Richard Kuklinski to life in The Iceman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 90s HBO aired a series of documentaries featuring interviews with Mafia contract killer Richard Kuklinski that was a peek inside pure evil and easily some of the best documentaries to date that they aired. While it's a surprise it took this long that a film adaptation of his life would be made, the time has finally come with The Iceman featuring Michael Shannon in the lead role, but does it succeed in bringing the chilling real life story of this man to life? The Iceman follows the rise of notorious contract killer Richard Kuklinski who goes from working as a porn lab tech to one of the most notorious contract killer in history. But as he tries to keep his family life and mob killing separate, circumstances and his own weaknesses threaten a terrible collision as the consequences of his choices finally catch up to him. If you have ever seen the documentary interviews with Kuklinski then you pretty much already knew the story but seeing it come to life in this film was just chilling. Usually with these types of films it hinges on just the script and performances, but here knowing the truth and hearing him tell the stories made this feel even more real. The always awesome Michael Shannon delivers a brilliant chilling portrayal of Kuklinski carrying this movie perfectly. The story does a good job of telling his story without trying to disguise him as some misunderstood character, but also letting us in on the toll it took on him once he lost the only thing he cared about. The rest of the cast do a great job with near unrecognizable David Schwimmer and Chris Evans playing against normal type and delivering some truly bad characters. Liotta is always great in this kind of role and not surprisingly shines here. Big props go to Stephen Dorff and James Franco for taking on some smaller but important roles to elevate this film. Despite everyone else being so good this never stops being Shannon's show. He embodies Kuklinski about as much as someone who is not insane could and makes you believe that's who he is. He has down his mannerisms and overall persona that takes what could have been a good movie to a great film.If you have never seen the original interview tapes then this film will most likely not be as effective, but is still a great film. There are roles that people are born to play and while Kuklinski may not be the one you were born to play, Shannon sure makes you believe that. This film captures the time period and keeps it streamlined without a lot of useless information to create the true story of a man who was the embodiment of pure evil if there ever was one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Richard Kuklinski, "The Iceman" , apparently was creating his own legend in his interviews. What could or could not be displayed on the screen as truth has been badly blurred by Kuklinski's propensity for embellishing almost everything. Conspicuously missing from the film was his utterly fantastic story of rats eating a man he left staked to the ground in a cave. As it is, Michael Shannon is excellent as "The Iceman". Ray Liotta playing a mob boss is no surprise. Winona Ryder is a pleasant surprise as the unsuspecting wife. The movie tells a compelling story, but seems somewhat repetitive, when there was so much more that could have been told. - MERK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The iceman cometh...again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was raised on the mobster pictures of the great Martin Scorsese, which was one of the best things I feel I did for my love for film at a young age. It was also one of the worst things I could do for myself at a young age because I think in doing that I gave myself a higher expectation of all the mobster films that I see. Fortunately, 2013 won't sneak by without me recommending a film of the genre and The Iceman is that picture. The film is like a long, unmoved grimace on cinema, cold, often bleak, but very mesmerizing and well-executed.The film profiles the mob's notorious contract-killer Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon), who operated with cutthroat impunity, killing dozens of men. Also trying to do right at home, Kuklinski tried to be the ideal family man, but with the constant shadiness with his work, he winds up disappointing and angering his wife Deborah (Winona Richard Kuklinski, ) and their two children than actually making them happy. This especially when he gets mixed up with the head of the Gambino crime family (Ray Liotta), leading his life dangerously close to being over.Kuklinski is called "The Iceman" for reasons that can easily be inferred. His coldness towards emotions and has a face that expresses no sympathy or heart, even around his family. His life is practically dictated by wild behavior, mixed signals, and trying to win support and appreciation from a group of men who can never bring themselves to be pleased.Certain scenes in The Iceman beautifully replicate tension and stress in the mob life, while some just kind of linger until the camera cuts. A beautiful scene comes in later in the film when Kuklinski accidentally rear-ends another car. The man whose car he hit emerges bitter and angry, along with Kuklinski, who proceeds to scream obscenities at him. After an altercation, both men go back into their car, before the other man gets back out and includes Kuklinski's entire family in another obscene phrase. After the man gets back in his car and flees, he is pursued quickly and mercilessly by Kuklinski, as he weaves in an out of tight alleyways and through oncoming traffic in large, seventies-style cars. In his car is his extremely angry wife and his two shamelessly frightened children, frozen with fear and begging their father to stop. This is how one stages a car chase in film. Director Ariel Vromen has a great sense of the cluttered city streets and details mob unpredictability incredibly. Not to mention, Kuklinski is pursuing the man just because he said some ridiculous and impulsive phrase to him, threatening his family. He believes his family shouldn't have to deal with that disrespect. Ironically, they are more appalled and offended by the actions of their father/husband. Vromen portrays him as the enemy here in a scene that may go unnoticed.Scenes like this keep The Iceman afloat. That and the gifted, nihilistic performance by contemporary screen actor Michael Shannon helps to. In just a few years, Shannon has portrayed a paranoid man who builds a shelter in his backyard in the wake of feelings of a strong storm, an iconic supervillain, several characters with an odd screen presence, and wonderfully subtle supporting roles. Shannon is one of the best actors in current time, diverse, always frightening and unsettling, but extremely watchable and talented. Assisted by a great supporting cast including James Franco, Chris Evans, and the always-welcome Ray Liotta, Shannon is on top of his game.The Iceman works as a strong thriller and an entertaining character piece, as it knows how to build suspense and be layered without overemphasizing the role of unnecessary metaphors. Some may find the ending - which tries to offer another layer of emotion to a cold character - trite and unnecessary. I found it surprising and very revealing. The entire perspective on the character of Kuklinski changes in a film; rarely are writers that brave, completely attempting to reverse the image of a character like that. I laud Vromen and co-writer Morgan Land's bravery.Starring: Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, James Franco, and Ray Liotta. Directed by Ariel Vromen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bleak and violent look at a real life Hit-man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have only heard a little about the man known as "the iceman." He was a real life contract killer that claimed to have murdered between 100-250 men. This is a violent, twisted biography that will leave your stomach churning to the type of life this man led. I do agree with a few reviewers on IMDb that I am certain this doesn't even scratch the surface of what the true story was. Nonetheless with a first rate cast and a terrific storyline for critics and movie goers alike I'm surprised this didn't get a bigger release. Still its well made with a good pacing and tells a story that is really hard to capture just how psychotic this man was. It shows an incredible downward spiral in this man's life and leaves you breathless in some scenes because they are so powerfully done and well performed. Some might call it melodramatic but the entire intensity of this film is a testament to a strong story and even stronger performances by the cast. I think the film makers did an incredible job of getting inside this man's head and showing us how he carried out his horrendous life. Even more incredible is that the lead actor got us inside his shoes and even made us feel empathy for him at times even when it seems morbid to do so. It is a horrifying, gritty and hard to watch real life story.I love Michael Shannon. I think he's a brilliant actor (Take Shelter was magnificent!) He completely channels this role and is awe inspiring. I firmly believe this was Oscar calibre and he deserve utmost praise for portraying an awful human being that did horrible things. It is easily one of the best real life criminals I've ever seen portrayed on screen. Winona Ryder comes back swinging as the hit-man's oblivious wife. She is really terrific in the role and the two of them together are excellent and very believable as the every day husband and wife. This is the sort of performance we miss from Ryder back in her heyday and might be one of her best as far as I'm concerned. Equally deserving of praise is Chris Evans. I've always enjoyed him as a quality comedic actor and a good action guy too but this was his best role. He is dark and twisted as Kuklinski's makeshift partner. I only wish there had been more of his character but he was great in it. Ray Liotta finally shows us why he is the iconic mob actor that he is. This was actually a solid role for him. Lately he has shown up in everything as the same crooked cop or mob enforcer and I was getting so tired of his hollering and playing the same role. Now this role isn't a huge stretch from those others but there was something more emotional and frantic to his performance. He didn't feel like he was overacting as much as he usually does. It was a great role for him. David Schwimmer, Robert Davi, Danny A. Abeckaser, and John Ventimiglia all deserve mention for very small cameo roles that were very effective in driving the story.Every once in awhile a director is an exception to the rule. I see movies time and time again that are nearly ruined by a director with very little experience and credits to his name. Ariel Vromen has very few credits but this was masterfully created. Now I think having an incredibly talented cast that work so well together makes the job of a director much easier. The entire feel of the film is so well captured. The bleak colours and lack of vibrancy to each scene is perfect for the ambiance of the film. Set mostly in the late sixties and into the seventies and it is seemingly painstakingly recreated. This film gets under your skin and touches you and evokes emotion and is just excellently crafted. What a pleasure to find this gem. I can't say I would watch it again because this film isn't about entertainment. This is about recreating history and it is a disturbing look into this period. True crime fans MUST see this. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Iceman Killith</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm behind on my other reviews, but after seeing this I had to put a rush on it before anybody else got the chance to lock down this blatantly cheesy, tacky, title, which I'm very proud of.I consider this a long-overdue project. In an industry that is seemingly low on fresh ideas. I don't know why this wasn't done earlier. I wanted to see this since the 2003 HBO interviews with the Iceman Killer, "Richard Kuklinski." And this 2012 film was worth the wait. I'm not a wannbe longing to be one of these characters, but I do have favorites in this genre. I enjoy films like, Goodfellas, Casino, Godfathers I, II and III, etc. However, when a story is real, it makes the cinematic presentation all the more special to me. The overall story stays true to the best of my knowledge, per the interviews and documentaries. The storytellers here decided to start in 1964, bypassing Mr. Kuklinski's childhood. This is a decision for which I'm grateful because although I don't have Mafioso or other gang ambitions, I do sometimes admire the code of ethics that have amongst themselves. In Richard's case, I started to empathize with him and that he had a strong aversion to killing women or children. However, he watched all this away as he revealed a childhood killing of an animal which I will spare the reader the gruesome details.And the timeline is strongly represented by automobiles scenes which I appreciate. However, I noticed 2 continuity errors. Now, some errors like a windshield that's cracked in one scene and undamaged in the next or a watch that mysteriously switches wrists from scene to scene can be forgiven. However, as someone who takes his automobile religion seriously, some errors are more serious blasphemies. The continuity errors. I noticed were: a steering column ignition switch in the first murder scene stated to be 1964. Such features were not available till 1969; and a 1976 New York St. scene with some 1980s cars and taxicabs. As logic follows you can always show an earlier car in a later timeline, but not vice versa publisher doing sci-fi with time travel elements. However, the movie makers did me a solid and earned their redemption. That is, they gave me the opportunity to leer and drool over plenty of 1960s, Mopar eye candy. Most notably was the 1968 2-door fast-top Dodge Monaco during a clandestine meeting scene. And to a lesser degree, because they were 4-doors, a couple of 68 Plymouth Fury's. (I'm partial to the two door fast tops like my 1968 Plymouth Sport Fury with Center Console). Indeed, the cars gave me an adequate taste of nostalgia as I grew up in the Musclecar Era. Of Other timeline examples were given equal attention. Those cheesy 70 mustaches, sideburns, mutton chops, hot pants, clogs, beanbag chairs, and a variety of styles and furnishings indicative of the times represented were just as abundant. Playing the lead character is Michael Shannon, whose "Iceman" like style of acting was honed long before this feature, the highly successful HBO series Boardwalk Empire, or other movies such as Bug with costar Ashley Judd. In any of these you'll see his mastery of the totally unreadable veneer between a cauldron of emotional complexities and the outside world that he can break and a millisecond to express a range of personalities. And yet, can employ a different style altogether to play the super villain Gen. Zod in Man of Steel. (Note: could this be our new Lurch for any future Addams Family remakes? Sorry reader, I love this guy, but I just couldn't resist). Winona Ryder, who plays the Kuklinski housewife is definitely no hausfrau. So, she's no longer the girl from Heathers, Mermaids, or Beetlejuice, she still has the same cuteness wrapped up in a more mature 41-year-old package. Winona and Michael have one of the most passionate love scenes, brief as it was being interrupted by their children that I've seen in a long time without nudity. To me, Winona always appears as a pleasant surprise. Whenever I am in one of those "whatever happened to" ponderings, I'll see her again as Spock's mom. Ray Liotta, whose no stranger to gangsta stories, whether playing the good or bad guy, is an excellent choice to support this story. A couple of scenes leaned towards the over conventional with the gun pointing. However, Mr. Liotta played it fresh enough that I wasn't left feeling that I was watching one of his earlier films. If you want to see his diversity, he's quite good comedic actor as well. Search for him in the 2002 episode of Just Shoot Me Liotta? Liotta! Or movies like Observe and Report. Surprising new to the silver screen gangsta squad is Chris Evans. I totally didn't recognize him out of his Marvel comics uniform till I read the credits. He plays his role convincingly well as Kuklinski's temporary employment recruiter and body disposal specialist. James Franco plays in what has to be one of the briefest scenes in the movie for someone of his current ranking. He's definitely one of Hollywood's workaholics. And yet, were all still patiently waiting for Pineapple Express 2!!! Friends star David Schwimmer is one of the first to sport the bushy, cheesy, 70s whiskers. He plays one of Ray's protégés who, after some good scenes is given a typical Mafia retirement package. And lastly, Robert Davi. Ever see the 1989, 007 feature: License to Kill? Well, that's him. He gives an excellent performance as a higher ranking, decision-making level boss. That is, until his own case of sudden lead poisoning in the aforementioned Dodge Monaco (Dad, can I have the car if you're shot?) He's another actor that I like to see working and keeps very busy, I just don't notice as much as I do my other favorites. The Iceman was worth the wait and worth the price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A short review then, since I accidentally 'threw away' a longer review just now when I wanted to 'retrieve' it...'The Iceman' does not depict all of the truth about Richard Kuklinski (his horrible youth is only briefly touched, and some truly horrific stuff that Kuklinski did, such as the killings of drifters for target practice and the tying up of victims in order to let rats eat away at them, are not even mentioned) and, maybe even more importantly, the 'truth' it dóes depict seems to me to be misleading: yes, he was a family man, but that was a sham, as for instance the reckless endangerment of his family by him clearly shows. I have seen some interviews with him and this quote says a lot: 'By now you know what I liked most was the hunt, the challenge of what the thing was. The killing for me was secondary. I got no rise as such out of it... for the most part. But the figuring it out, the challenge - the stalking and doing it right, successfully - that excited me a lot. The greater the odds against me, the more juice I got out of it.' To me, Kuklinski was a sociopathic serial killer (with, in all fairness, an awful upbringing that could hardly lead to anything better) for whom the money was simply a bonus. This is not adequately portrayed here, unfortunately.A separate chapter should be about the cast. Though Shannon puts on a fine performance, I had a hard time seeing him as 'the real' Kuklinski. Ryder plays fine, though sounds awfully 'squeaky' at times. Schwimmer's role takes some getting used to, but isn't that bad. Liotta plays well, but with him also, I didn't really see him as a mobster. Evans (reminding me of Luke Wilson in 'The Royal Tenenbaums') does a fine role, but Franco and Dorff are hardly worth mentioning (their roles are very small anyway). And, finally, Robert Davi plays just about everyone off the screen.Not a bad film in itself, but nothing special either; the soundtrack could have been much more considerate of the times it takes place in, but the settings and costumes are pretty much satisfactory... as an accurate and gripping portrayal of Kuklinski it is simply a failure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Boring Movie About an Interesting Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I saw this movie first I thought of doing some background reading before going ahead with it.So I just went through the articles on Richard Kuklinski trying to build up to the movie. And when I finally watched the movie I was utterly disappointed. To be honest if the guy was still in business he would have most probably ended the lives of who were involved in the movie because it is an insult to him. The movie looks like a bunch of episodes that have no connection in to each other. Unless you read about it first you have no clue to what is going on. From start to end there is absolutely nothing that will help you enjoy the movie. I don't know why people have rated this one so high. It doesn't do any justice. They don't show why he became a killer, what makes him tick, how he started. You will see the guy killing people at random, but actually they are hits, they never give clues to why the hits were called. how he builds up to the kill. They don't show how he comes up with his methods, how he tests them first which is a major part of his character. In short this movie doesn't even deserve to be reviewed in long. Utter waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The True Story of Richard Kuklinski played by Michael Shannon,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall the movie was not bad, but it was not great either, Shannon played the role well but I think the casting of the main role could have been better, Shannon looked nothing like Kuklinski, Shannon was to skinny as Kuklinski was a very big guy, also Shannon did not capture Richards characteristics as far as I am concerned based on what I have seen in the HBO interviews. There were parts of the movie that was just boring, and there were some kills that just did not happen they Richard said in his interviews. There was another Iceman project underway with actor Mickey Rourke as Richard, he would have been a much better choice and I hope they make the movie with Mickey I really want to see that one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you enjoy true stories and mob flicks this is a must see, I have told all of my friends about it. Takes you through 1970ish to 1990 NY. A sociopath working pirating porn films for the neighborhood gangster gets involved with another gangster to become a hit-man while he is killing people on the side that make him angry. He meets a nice Italian Catholic girl, marries her and they start a family, daughters. He separates his family from his work, they think he is in currency exchange investing, by day he is murdering and disposing of bodies and in the evening he is home as a loving father and husband. He murdered over 100 people over two decades.Taken from the HBO interview of Richard done around 2002. They left some things out of the script, like the fact he was a brutally abusive husband and also had a son. The movie is not about his family, it is about his "career". Michael Shannon, I feel, is a phenomenal actor and plays this part scarily well. He was Ritchie K. Excellent bio pic, not for kids and very little gore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Iceman lives up to the name but falls a little short on the potential of the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Iceman" is Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) the mob hit-man who was responsible for 100 murders. It's an interesting story and it's a true one. The film knows that and uses all the facts to move the story note-by-note. That unfortunately makes the film slightly less interesting than it otherwise could be. The Iceman is so nicknamed because of his emotionless attitude to killing.What makes the Iceman so creepy is that he has built the life of a normal person. He got married, seemingly in love with a beautiful woman, had two daughters, goes to work during the day and comes home at night in the suburbs with a paycheck to afford a nice house, lawn and picket fence. His job just happens to be killing anybody his mob boss tells him to. He clearly must have psychological issues making him a sociopath such that he can just switch from contract killer to family man.One would assume that Michael Shannon was hired because of his ability to portray mental anguish without bubbling over with rage as his characters struggle to understand his own reality. But Shannon wasn't used to the full extent of his talent. He had the same emotionless expression throughout most of the film. The few scenes implying his severe sociopathic tendencies were too minor to make this much of a psychological character study. As a result, it's really just a mob crime drama. I was hoping for the former, but the mass legions of fans of "Goodfellas" and the like will probably appreciate the latter.On a positive note, Winona Ryder was quite impressive as the wife on the sidelines. She knew nothing about him, sometimes grew concerned, but ultimately she just wanted to love him and be loved by him. Also Chris Evans (the Hollywood actor who looks like he should be cast in films as the guy who saves the world and gets the girl) is unrecognizable here as a hippie mob hit-man who is also an ice cream salesman. Make sense of that however you want, but he was one of the best characters in the film. Ray Liotta is the mob boss, David Schwimmer plays a 1970s porn star styled mob assistant type guy, and they lead directly to the Iceman. He used to dub porn films, but the mob needs him, and use him they do. What I wanted to see more of was how much Kuklinski needed the mob. He probably couldn't function in regular society without such a violent and sadistic outlet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It won't leave you cold.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cold as Ice" (Roy describes Richard) No film title this year is as spot on as The Iceman, the partially true story of contract killer Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon), who killed over 100 men (no women or children) with a cold demeanor like ice. Shannon plays him with a scary detachment, and there are many murders to witness in the film.When James Franco plays a hood, a cameo part, then he may have wanted only to work with the accomplished Shannon. That Ray Liotta plays Roy Demeo, Richard's mob boss, is no surprise as he always plays a crook, and always a bad one, except maybe over 20 years ago in Goodfellas.The major thematic tension, present as soon as Richard marries, is that even a killer may have strong love of fellow human beings, but usually only if they are family. His wife, Deborah (a fine Winona Ryder), and their 2 lovely daughters are clueless about his crime job, making the denouement all the more heartbreaking when he is arrested in 1986.New Jersey is depicted accurately from the fifties onward, as is their dress and hair styles. Most importantly, Shannon has the right heavy accent and terse speech to make him sound like other film heavies but remain separate in his consistent characterization. Nothing happens randomly, chance is rarely an ingredient, and Richard eventually makes human mistakes, like his code about not killing women and children, leading to his end.This film has too many murders even though he committed enough for several films. Rather we should have spent more time with Richard so we could begin to understand his hard heart that melts for his family.Iceman is a small film that will elude filmgoers but not Shannon lovers and Goodfellas devotees. If life is sometime fair, then Shannon will receive an Oscar nomination: He's that good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shannon's intensity made the film for me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, I really liked this movie. The story is just awesome. How much of it is actually true (because we all know Hollywood LOVES to take liberties with the "based on a true story" films)? I don't know but watching the film version of famed contract killer Richard Kuklinski really made for a raw, gritty film that I really enjoyed.The film can be a little hard to handle as the story will make huge leaps in time while telling Kuklinski's story but this never bothered me at all. The one thing I loved above all else with this one is the acting. The movie offers up some actors taking up roles you never thought they would take and do them well (like David Schwimmer and Chris Evans) and, yes, Ray Liotta is once again playing a mobster but he does it so well.The stand out, of course, was Michael Shannon. I think Shannon is one of the best actors of this generation and he keeps proving it to me with the intensity he brings to every role he plays. The level he brought to this role was so intense that my inanimate television was on the verge of cowering in fear from the man. There was a reason they called Kuklinski The Iceman and Shannon did a perfect job of living up to the famed killer's nickname.Some may have issues with the film but, from my perspective, there was none to see or even acknowledge. I loved this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Contemporary Made Crime Cinema At Its Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ICEMAN was on my movie watch-list since I first heard of it. A true-crime film about an infamous hit-man spanning from the 1960s-1980s starring a contemporary actor I don't actually hate (Michael Shannon) in the titular role. Now I admittedly had low expectations for this film considering neigh every recent limited-release movie I've went to see has turned out to be a disappointment. Even contemporary films from great 70s/80s genre directors like Friedkin and Cronenberg (heck, even Don Coscarelli to a degree) turned out to be more on the artsy/fartsy side and just seemed to do anything but leave me cold by their weirdness, non-endings or pretentiousness. THE ICEMAN is a movie (while somewhat of a clichéd depiction of the eras it is set) feels closest to a legit 70s/80s crime movie than most new films I've seen recently that seemingly try to achieve so (except for maybe Walter Hill's BULLET TO THE HEAD, but that's more on the action side of things). Great performance by Michael Shannon (the guy has charisma even when playing a brutal killer who "doesn't give a sh!t") and some great familiar "crime" faces like Ray Liotta and Robert Davi. Appearances by David Schwimmer (at parts looking like poliziotteschi hench Riccardo Petrazzi and then Jesus from THE BIG LEWBOWSKI) and a sleazy James Franco are worth noting...I guess. The film has good cinematography (none of this shaky cam and MTV style crap), minimal (and when noticeable) appropriate uses of CGI, and plenty of good practical effects like the hard-hitting squibs and stunt driving. These elements (and Robert Davi's worthy of framing weathered face) were enough to gain my tough, gritty 70s crime film fan seal of approval. We really need more serious, medium sized (both in scope and budget) films about real-life like this out there these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Double Lives, Split Psyches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some lives that don't require reflection in the form of film and surely the true life of professional murderer (100 killings) Richard Kuklinski is one of them. But because biographies have been written about him (Anthony Bruno's "The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer" and James Thebaut's documentary "The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer"), it became a sure thing that we would have to actually watch this life on the screen (as written by Morgan Land and director Ariel Vromen). It is disconcerting to view except for the actors who take on these rather unrewarding parts.The film opens and closes with the imprisoned Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) starring at us but quick jumps back in time to the1960s with a very different Kuklinski trying to make coffee conversation with the sweet Deborah (Winona Ryder) who eventually becomes his wife and the mother of their children - a life that is sacrosanct to Kuklinski. Kuklinski is working as a porn film lab tech until his mob bosses (Ray Liotta, David Schwimmer et al) persuade him to change his career into that of a contract killer. For years, Kuklinski gains a reputation for cold-blooded professionalism who tends to freeze his murdered victims even as he raises a family who are kept in the dark about his true career. Unfortunately, mob politics ultimately forces him to secretly work independently with the psychopathic Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Pronge (Chris Evans). As much as Kuklinski tries to keep his lives separate, circumstances and his own weaknesses threaten a terrible collision as the consequences of his choices finally catch up to him. Among those actors who get killed almost as soon as they get on the screen is James Franco. Kuklinski is finally caught by the police (through a double cross maneuver) and is sentence to life in prison in the same cell with his brother Joey (Stephen Dorff).It is a strong cast but a very plodding script that burns out after about 45 minutes. Were it not for the cast, the final judgment of the film would be dyspeptic. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is simply awful and one wonders if the screenplay writers bothered to read the biography on Kulkinski (The Iceman) on which the film is allegedly based . In it they would have discovered a soulless psychopath, shaped by his unimaginably cruel childhood and which he in turn visited on his own wife and family. Instead the movie attempts to portray a killer with a heart - a family man who loves his wife and dotes on his kids. it neglects his method of practising his "art" by murdering homeless and poor sleeping on the streets and his experimentation with disposal of bodies.it also omits his cruelty and torture of many of his victims. The book wasn't perfect, repetitious and in parts poorly written but it did capture the monster that was Richard Kulkinsky. The movie hasn't and isn't worth watching</fullReview>

The writers and director seemed to phone it in.ps:I don't know the real story, so I don't know how true-to-life this really is. I would guess they sanitized Kuklinski plenty to try to make him into some kind of "family man". If a Hollywood sanitation scheme bothers you, then you probably should not watch this. It starts with him just meeting his wife (probably not his first, but they don't go into that either) and gives a tiny hint at his childhood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the cold blooded family loving criminal film I was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Loving husband. Devoted father. Ruthless killer."The main issue that I had with The Iceman is that the film never fulfills what it promises in its tagline. The Iceman never seemed like a loving husband or a devoted father. I never felt the chemistry between Michael Shannon and Winona Ryder. Shannon's character was completely detached from his wife, which would make sense considering he was a ruthless killer, but this film promised something different. Someone living a double life with no one ever suspecting him, kind of like what Kevin Costner delivered in Mr. Brooks. That was the film I was hoping to see, but somehow I felt unattached to these characters and this story. I never cared for these people and I felt there was something missing in the way the story was being told. It is a shame because the premise seemed really good and the cast is really talented, but Israeli director, Ariel Vromen, never managed to deliver a thrilling story. As a killer, The Iceman, delivered what I expected. He had no problem killing whoever his target was unless it implied killing women or children. He didn't feel any sort of remorse and all he cared about was not letting his family discover who he really was. It is that family part which I thought wasn't approached well and could have made a difference in a genre like this that is so well known. I didn't feel the balance that this man was supposed to have between his family life and his work, which is what attracted me to this film in the first place. Without that The Iceman felt like an ordinary assassin story. The film is based on the true story of Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon), a cold blooded contract killer working for the mafia during the 70's. There have been books written about him (The Iceman by Anthony Bruno) and documentaries (The Iceman Tapes directed by Jim Thebaut) which served as a starting point for the screenplay. In my opinion if you want more facts or if its an autobiography you are looking for then check those out because this screenplay only scratches the surface. Richard began working for the mafia as a porn film lab tech. He met the love of his life, Deborah (Winona Ryder), who worked at a local restaurant and an year later they got married. They had two daughters, and no one in his family or circle of friends suspected about his double life. Richard lied about his work with the mafia claiming he worked for Disney dubbing their cartoons, and later when he became a contract killer and started making more money he claimed to be an investor. He was hired by mafia boss, Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta), but when things get complicated he becomes an independent contractor teaming up with the psychotic Mr. Freezy (Chris Evans) making several enemies along the way. James Franco, David Schwimmer, and Stephen Dorff all play smaller secondary roles.Michael Shannon is a great actor and he has made several mediocre movies worth seeing, but he can't do much here to save this poorly written script that barely explores the psyche of this cold blooded killer because it fails to create tension between his loving family life and his disconnected ability to kill anyone without hesitation. His character is simply one dimensional. At least Shannon has quite some screen time because the rest of the characters in this film are completely cardboard cut out ones. Ray Liotta plays the stereotypical mob boss and there is no backstory to his character. James Franco and Stephen Dorff barely have any screen time and their roles seem like cameos. David Schwimmer plays a rather laughable character, I don't think he was the right person for the role. Chris Evans is a well known actor, but he goes over the top here in his portrayal of the psychotic Mr. Freezy. It is a shame that the screenwriters never managed to create tension between his family life and his profession. They could have used some help from the writers of Dexter which if given the choice I'd rather watch an old episode of this TV show than re watching this movie. The film lacked that balance between the family drama and the mob criminal world. As a character study film it fails as well because the film never explores the psyche of this cold blooded murderer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shannon shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Shannon gives a towering performance in the Iceman. He is cold and distant, and shows almost no emotion; much like Richard Kuklinski, the real life assassin of the title. Having read the Philip Carlo book of which the film is based; the feeling is captured quite accurately. The problem is the vast material from a four hundred page book being translated into a one hour and forty five minute movie. Carlo included so much detail drawn from hundreds of hours of interviews with the killer, and even more with his family. The story is told in a straightforward fashion beginning with a test by a Mafia boss played by Ray Liotta, who hands Kuklinski a gun and asks him to kill a complete stranger. You have to see it to believe it. Along the way, there are shootings, stabbings, strangulations, and poisonings; this is not a Disney feature, so keep the kiddies away. If you are a fan of true crime, The Iceman is well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I have to say that I was very well aware of the real Kuklinsky as I read about him years ago due to his later killing method, that was very smart and intricate, and that appears fabulously rendered in the movie. That being said, and after seeing the movie, I guess that picking someone to do the part better than Michael Shannon would be next to impossible, as the man EMBODIES the beast that Kuklinsky was: head to toe iceberg while whacking guys on one hand, loving and moderate guy towards his family on the other hand. After seeing how epic Shannon's performance was in "Take Cover" and the well above OK one in "Man of Steel", I was very skeptical about how good would he portray one of the mob's sickest enforcers to date, but I honestly was toasted with a relentless performance from the very start to the end. I'm sure we're all going to hear from the man in several other roles other than just bad guys roles.The story is quite accurate and faithful to the original events (including Kuklinsky's growing up), and those that know a little bit more of the mob's story from that era will know what I mean: sets, decor, even the street talk and walk is there. The events happen moderately fast, and its easy to understand what is happening, when and why, which is excellent for those less familiar with the man's story. Unfortunately, it ends in a very abrupt way, as much more could be explored after his arrest like what happened with the real Kuklinsky, but there's only a few perfect movies out there.Ray Liotta does his usual, and he doesn't shine more because of Shannon's domination. Yeah, I know it seems I'm revering the guy, but watch the movie and you'll see what I mean. Nice surprise to be honest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why books are better than movies, but Shannon makes this damn good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen all three HBO documentaries of The Iceman, parts 1 and 2 of the Iceman Confessions and the last one, The Iceman and the Psychiatrist, so it was with much anticipation that I awaited to watch the movie of his story. Due to the movie, now I am in search of the book The Iceman: Confessions of a Cold Blooded Killer.Even from just the documentaries alone, I was aware of the film's inaccuracies, but I was willing to ignore them due to the producers' having their hands tied when it comes to budget and time constraints and the rights of the characters involved. Obviously, they had little or no endorsement from Richard Kuklinski's real family.Despite the writer's inaccuracies and embellishments, it was the director's and Michael Shannon's performance which made this film mesmerizing. Michael Shannon has shown with this film alone, that he is now in the upper echelon of fine actors working today, if he hadn't done so already. He truly tapped into Kuklinski's mindset of an abused child becoming a sociopath in a jungle of a world. A sociopath whose only solace and love came in the form of his wife and children, even though his upbringing would harm them psychologically and his only knowledge of providing for and protecting them would be his downfall.I really didn't care for Chris Evans as Robert Pronge. He seemed too boyish for the role of a psychotic killer. Winona Ryder was pleasantly surprising as Kuklinski's reason for living and no one pulls off a jump suit like David Schwimmer! Although his role was brief, he played a good weasel in Rosenthal. If you look up real pictures of the guy, the resemblance is uncanny.All in all, with all the liberties taken (and why mess with the truth when it's stranger than fiction?)it's still a fine film. I would still recommend to all to watch the documentaries if you want to feel real chill and dread from the mouth of The Iceman himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's sad that this movie didn't make a profit in the box office. It is much better than a lot of what is in theaters today. I think a lot of your opinion of this movie will be based on what you think of Michael Shannon and the rest of the cast. If you like him in boardwalk empire you may very well like this movie. He is the same stoic self. A roll he does fairly well. It is almost hard to imagine him with much more range. Given his roll as a hard core killer, it fits the character well. They play up his staggering size in the film. At 6'3, his character is suppose to be 6'5, he towers over the rest of the cast. You have a sense in the movie he feels like he can easily break everyone's neck.Ray Liotta plays a gangster a roll he is familiar with and also very suited to play. I think the two do pretty good on screen together. I leave movies always thinking he doesn't get enough credit for his rolls. A lot of the other characters rolls slip in and out of the movie. While the movie does show some brutal scenes, you do feel almost wanting to see more blood in this movie. They really play up the family aspect but time just rockets through in the movie, at a blink of an eye the daughters are teenagers. You have a sense that part of a really good story is left out. I would have also liked to have seen how this man died in prison since foul play is a roll and why. Overall though, they did a great job. The acting and costume department did fantastic work. The scenes are well shot and put together. Hopefully the people who made this movie will keep others like it coming instead of worrying about it not making a profit. It is pleasant to watch something that doesn't suck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devoted husband, loving father, executioner of 100. Villain or victim?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1986, Richard Kuklinski was arrested. That the titular character had chalked up a tally in excess of 100 murders is shocking. That he did so without his wife or daughters having the slightest inclination is mind-blowing.The Iceman recounts the story of Kuklinski's (Michael Shannon) 'career' in the execution business but is a long way from being a black, gloomy tale of terror and violence. Certainly, the actions of the man who coldly (hence his moniker) racked up a body count in triple figures are horrific, but the violence is not depicted upon the screen casually as entertainment for gawpers, thanks largely to yet another perfectly controlled performance from Shannon, an actor finally entering the mass public consciousness.Shannon has for too long lingered in the shadows, powerfully serving up characters in superb under-the-radar films like Take Shelter, but Scorsese's Boardwalk Empire brought him to a broader audience and this month's double whammy of The Iceman and Man of Steel elevates him further. Think Christopher Walken with more bite.The joy in watching Kuklinski is that Shannon doesn't play him as a monster. In a strange way we like him; we want him to succeed and survive. There's almost a respect, or at least an understanding, for a man who has become an expert in his career, despicable as it is. Kuklinski isn't purely evil but is a man lost in his troubles. His focus is completely misguided and in a final scene that is emotionally taut and deeply affecting, we are left questioning whether he is indeed a rotten man, as the 'facts' declare, or whether he, too, is a victim.In one brief scene a solitary dark bird bobs upon the water in a flock of black birds, perhaps implying that Kuklinski actually retains some semblance of good in a dark clam of evil men.How can I say that? Because of his relationship with Deborah (Wynona Rider) and their two daughters. Kuklinski states pointedly, mid row, that they are all that he cares about in the world. At first their marriage feels like an ownership with Deborah the willing possession but as The Iceman evolves, so does the Iceman and his maiden and Rider imbues her with a steely strength of which perhaps even Kuklinski is unaware. He is devoted to her and the girls and she, in turn, is both dependent and supportive of her husband and her devotion to him is blatantly clear despite the odd hiccup.Rider is on excellent form here, perhaps the best she's been for many, many years. After her teenage stardom and young adult quagmire (both career-wise and in her personal life), she has matured as an actress and is every bit Shannon's equal here. It's too obvious to use twee analogies of fine wines maturing but Rider appears to have picked herself up, understood that she has a wonderful talent and is using it once again to full effect.Her Deborah hurts, she fights for her marriage, for the wellbeing of her children and for the love of her husband. Even at what might well be the end of her security and life as she has become accustomed, Deborah's strength is evident and her determination undeniable.There are a few odd moments that nudge The Iceman away from perfection but even David Schwimmer doing his best David Seaman impression has a certain charm, though he can't fully shake off the burden of Ross nor hide him beneath the hair.Ray Liotta is on predictably safe ground here as essentially an underworld thug and Chris Evans provides able support, but The Iceman is a film of two performances and one director, Ariel Vromen, who will surely enjoy his greatest success to date. Vromen, though he plays out Kuklinski's story for us, doesn't dictate how we should feel and certainly doesn't provide all the answers.One departs the cinema with multiple questions churning around the brain: Did Deborah genuinely not know? If not, how the hell could she be so blissfully unaware? Is Kuklinski a simple villain or partial victim? Midway through the year finds The Iceman solidly inside the top five films of the year so far. It'll be interesting to see whether it remains in six months time.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done true life crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Family man Richie Kuklinski finds that he has an aptitude for clinically killing people in and around the New Jersey underworld. This film, based on real events, follows his activities - of which his wife and daughters were completely ignorant - for the best part of 20 years.This film, always absorbing but not very pleasant - is very reminiscent of Goodfellas, and not just because Ray Liotta is in it. It is a portrait of criminal seediness with a distinctly period feel to it - that time in the fairly recent past is accurately but not showily constructed as the backdrop for Kuklinski's "work." The excellent cast all perform well. Chris Evans is unrecognisable as Mr Freezy, James Franco's appearance is no more than a cameo, and Winona Ryder is a revelation in a part with some meat on it.But the film belongs to the enormous Michael Shannon who conveys very well the paradox of a loving family man, and an emotionless brutal killing machine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, better performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Iceman' is the story of Richard Kuklinski, an infamous contract killer thought to have disposed of at least 100 people for a living, whose family simply had no idea. Director Ariel Vromen is aiming for 'Taxi Driver', 'Gooodfellas' of 'Zodiac' here, keeping to the philosophy that the lives this man and the people around him lived, and the study of their psychology, can be engaging enough. Sadly he lacks the full grip on the characters and narrative thrust to fully engage to that level, but it is not without its tense and well directed moments.Whilst it is great to see talent like Winona Ryder and Ray Liotta getting the interesting work again, the film belongs to only one man, the mighty Michael Shannon. The truth be told, without Shannon, 'The Iceman' would be little more than average, but as always, the actor invests himself so much, finds and presents a complex human who, in spite of his efforts to be a good father and husband at home, his desire to avoid being like his despicable father and brother, you can never support, and in spite of his ruthlessness at work, you can never completely despise.As I say, it is not without its merits, and it is a well paced drama with a fascinating centre, but it is also a film which lacks direction and a script polish. Whilst it certainly can't be placed in the same category as the classics with which it wants to be compared, it nevertheless features one of the best performances of the year; Michael Shannon alone raises this film to a higher level, and I suspect has earned himself a nomination at next year's Academy Awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just came from the theater and called everyone of my friends to definitely go see this movie.Michael Shannon and Ray Liotta killed it along with a cast of strong A and B list actors.Winnona Ryder,Robert Davi,Steven Dorf,James Franco even David Schwimmer turning in a believable performance playing against type.I can't believe it's only on 400 screens.This film deserved way more P&amp;A than it got.The only ads I saw were on tiny face book ads.I love the time period that it covered in the film.The 60's and 70's in New York City were some of the most volatile times in mob history.I thought the director and writer did an amazing job of making the audience root for a ruthless hit man.I did not want this movie to end!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absorbing and compelling crime drama/biopic; Shannon is superlative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ICEMAN (2013) ***1/2 Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, Ray Liotta, David Schwimmer, John Ventimiglia, McKaley Miller, Megan Sherrill, James Franco, Stephen Dorff, Robert Davi. Absorbing and compelling crime drama/biopic about the titular, notorious NJ hit man, Richard Kuklinski (Shannon in another incredible performance), whose cold demeanor in his profession belied the warm, family man who doted over his beloved daughters and loving wife (Rider equally excellent), all clueless to the monster in their home. Novice director Ariel Vromen - who co-scripted with Morgan Land -based on the Anthony Bruno book "The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer" and Jim Tebaut's HBO documentary "The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer" - manages to tread the slippery tight-rope of sympathy for the devil and depicting the sociopathic displays of murder with calm efficiency is relentless in its see- sawing of empathy and fearful disdain. Evans provides some gallows humor as an equally sick puppy (an ice cream truck driver cum assassin in cahoots with Shannon's freelance work) and Liotta returns to form with his snake-eyed seething anger at full-tilt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad, Gruesome, Horrific, and really unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is based upon a true storyThe Iceman, Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon), a natural born killer, emerges in the 1970s; he works for gangster Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta), who is subject to the Gambino Family; later he is let go by Roy and ends up in a killing partnership with Mr. Freezy (Chris Evans) also known as Mr. Softee (operates an ice cream truck). When arrested Kuklinski admitted to 100 killings. Okay, we have seen enough gangster/Mob movies to not need a lot of personal background or character development information regarding the gangsters. We know who they are and what they do especially when they are attached to organized crime. Kuklinski admits to only caring about one thing, his family: wife Deborah (Winona Ryder) and his two daughters. The killings never bothered him. When he worked with Mr. Freezy, they would cut up the bodies with saws, axes, chainsaws and dispose of them. And, we never see this done that we would have to turn away although from a distance we do see some hacking going on. Kuklinski was dubbed The Iceman by the media because he froze the bodies for a period of time. Actually, the freezing was Mr. Freezy's method of operation. The killings within are done by gun fire so there was not a lot of gore to be presented. Not to take anything away from Michael Shannon because he did a great job, but I couldn't help thinking that Ray Liotta should have been The Iceman. They almost look alike, both have that really dead-eye stare and both have a quiet sense of violence lurking just beneath their exterior. There is one noticeable difference though. You can see Liotta thinking when you look at his eyes and with Michael Shannon you don't see that. Maybe that is what the powers that be were looking for. A non-thinking killing machine. Okay, I yield. Still, Ray Liotta could have been??????Winona Ryder as Deborah, as the supportive wife, did a very good job not knowing what her Ritchie really did for a living. He told her he was in currency trading. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, 3-times (two from a porn movie clip), and brief nudity is seen once. Nudity: Yes, briefly from the porn movie clip. Language: Yes, but not overdone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Iceman Cometh... And Goeth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This true life crime melodrama is a very? mellow? drama about a hit man known as The Iceman played by Michael Shannon who, looking a cross between Jack Lord and Richard Kiel had they both morphed into Frankenstein's monster, was a real tough cookie. Beginning as a sound editor in the pornography business, and then working for temperamental mob boss Roy Demeo, our central character Richard Kuklinski never had a prayer to do anything else for a living. Immensely cold and stealthily calculating, he has what it takes to be a hit man, something Demeo (Ray Liotta) sees in him right away.The first couple hits are pretty intense but not very suspenseful. With somber music orchestrating each scene ? the mechanics of a lost soul given its own melancholy dirge ? and sporadic ultra violent montages, we never get too up close and personal into the bloody reality of Kuklinski's profession, at least not right away.The twist here is that Kuklinski has a family while working as a hit man. Enter Wionna Ryder as his soft-spoken passive wife, Deborah, supposedly oblivious to her husband's occupation. With two beautiful daughters, the Kuklinski clan seems like a Norman Rockwell painting. But the family scenes spend too much time wallowing in a contrived sense of irony, never standing out on their own merit. Until the mobsters hit too close to home, and Kuklinski begins showing his dark side in front of the wife and kids, allowing Michael Shannon to emote past an otherwise limited steely countenance.One particular scene, after Kuklinski lets a seventeen-year-old girl witness go unharmed, and then attempts to protect her from a fellow hit man named Mr. Freezy (played by Chris Evans, who would introduce him to the art of freezing victims to thwart the cop's timetable), shows us a vulnerable side missing in the segments with family and friends. This also provides a Film Noir aspect of a killer with a kind heart beating, somewhere. But like some of the duller Noirs, there's more style than substance going on. Kuklinski's gig wasn't a short one. The searing biopic zooms from the sixties to the eighties through music and distinguishing hairstyles and mustaches all sizes, yet there's never a sense of importance in any decade. That is, we never stick in one place long enough for anything to really matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterful Performances Make Up For Weak Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Iceman (2012) *** (out of 4)Good drama telling the true story of Richard Kuklinksi (Michael Shannon), a husband and father who keeps from his loved ones the fact that he's a hit man for the mob and killed over a hundred people. THE ICEMAN contains some of the best performances you're going to see all year and there's no question that the man himself is an interesting figure for a movie but sadly the picture isn't as great as one would hope and this is due to the screenplay. I'm going to say that the screenplay is what keeps this movie from being much better because it's quite uneven and never really seems to know what type of story it wants to tell. Is it a story about a man who is a normal husband and father but at night is something evil? Is it about how great of a hit man he was? Was the story trying to tell what it was like working for the mob? All of these might be correct but sadly the film just has an uneven feel because each scene doesn't really tie together in any way and it's more like we're just watching some snapshots out of Kuklinksi's life. The performances are going to be the main reason to watch this film with Shannon once again turning in a masterful performance. The killer got his nickname because of how cold he was at his job and Shannon does a masterful job at this in his performance. Just looking at this guy you can see the evil underneath him and I thought Shannon did a rather remarkable job bringing this character to the screen. I'm not sure if there's a more intense actor working today but he really shines in this lead role. Winona Ryder does a very good job in the role of the wife and we get strong work from Chris Evans as a rival "worker," Ray Liotta is perfect as a crime boss and we also get nice work from David Schwimmer, James Franco and Stephen Dorff. Robert Davi also deserves special mention as he's perfect in his role as an enforcer. The direction by Ariel Vromen is good and he certainly nails the look and atmosphere of the times that the film is set. THE ICEMAN falls short of being great but the performances are simply so wonderful that this is still worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>horrible movie,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>they total messed this movie up the real Richard Kuklinski never associated his wife/family with his work whether it be making porn films or meeting people hit worked with/hit contracts its how he lead 2 lives. also one part in the movie where he has to kill a hobo to prove hes loyal to the mafia, never happened, he did sit next to a hobo and kill him but just to see if he could get away. the dude he got in a confrontation with in the bar in the begging of the movie he never slashed the guys throat, he popped his tire waited for him to come out and shot him when was changing the tire.save your money go buy the book for $13 way more detailed way better, or watch the documentary with the real Richard Kuklinkski on you tube</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacks the emotion needed to make viewers care.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched The Iceman, as I am a fan of mobster films. When I saw that Ray Liotta, who played Henry Hill in Goodfellas, I set my expectations a bit higher then I should have.Ray Liotta didn't disappoint, but the rest of the movie did.When you're making a Mafia film, you have to understand one thing.You're not a documentary, you're a movie. You need to show us these hardened, cold, brutal criminals, and you have to make us like them.Goodfellas does this well, Casino does this well, but the Iceman does this horribly.The movie doesn't stop being cold. It lacks a moment in the film where you understand why Richard Kuklinski is even doing this. We don't see any motives to enter this line of work, other then the fact it pays well. We do not see him blowing his cash on luxuries, or helping his family out of a hole. Even after being 'laid off' from his hit-man duties, we don't see any economic stress.That is the problem with the film. The main character lacks emotion or personality. He genuinely seems like a coldblooded killer, despite the fact that the movie tries to assure you that he is simply a family man with no !@#$s to give about anyone else. It doesn't work, though, because we never see him as a person. We see him as this emotionless, devoid hit-man with a family that is completely obsolete to what he's doing.Do you feel for Richard when he gets busted? No. I didn't care when he was arrested, I actually was glad he was getting arrested. I didn't sympathize with him, because he was presented as an emotionless murderer.That is the problem with the film. It lacks emotion, it lacks that mobster feel. It has the cold, dark side of the mafia, but it lacks the side that actually pulls us in. The side that shows the advantages, the personalities, the charisma. Without that, we do not care. Why should we care about a man who is apparently devoid of emotion, and is shown killing a load of people for no reason, other then money or 'revenge', if you can call it that?When Richard kills the man who insulted him in the club, by slitting his throat, I must compare to when Tommy kills Billy Batz in Goodfellas. The motives for both murders are the same. One of the main characters gets insulted by someone, and then they later kill that someone.Except one has emotion, one has depth. The other is just a fancy show- off of their blood effects.If you're looking for a mobster film, don't watch the Iceman, it is not worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Iceman ONLY in the New York Aera?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Movie facts: The proof that the movie sucks is that it was picked up by a non-major studio, nor even a major-indie studio.The studio releasing The Iceman, Millennium Entertainment, is known for dumping movies in a very limited number of theaters for one week and then releasing on VOD and DVD soon thereafter.Goes to show that a movie starring an Oscar winner AND three Oscar nominees can be a stinker". &lt; Quoted from a site. Man did we Midwesterners get screwed with Iceman! How unfair to ONLY release a movie in the New York area with no prior notification of doing so and if there was notification, should of release it so people could actually know prior to the last minute!</fullReview>
