		<shortDescription>subtle but chilling portrayal of madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams gives what may well be the performance of his career in `One Hour Photo,' a creepy psychological thriller written and directed with cool precision by Mark Romanek. Given its premise, the film could easily have degenerated into a sordid, exploitative tale of obsession and madness. Instead, Romanek has chosen to take a more subtle approach, fashioning a film that downplays the potential violence of its material while, at the same time, recognizing the humanity of its central figure.Romanek understands that the greatest threats to our safety and lives often come from the gray, nondescript people who surround us unnoticed, the `nobodies' whose benign faces and vacuous smiles reveal no trace of the insanity, evil and potential for doing us harm that may be lurking right there under the surface. And nobody is `grayer' than Si Parrish, an innocuous, socially undeveloped milquetoast who spends his days working as a photo developer in one of those sterile five-and-dime drug stores (just like the one in `The Good Girl') - and his nights sitting all alone in his drab apartment brooding over a massive family-photo shrine he has erected to the Yorkins, a seemingly happy family of three whose pictures Si has been developing, copying and obsessing over for more than seven years now. The film centers around Si's growing fixation with this one family and his delusional belief that he too could somehow become an integral part of their family unit. Then comes the day when Si realizes that he is no longer content to be a mere vicarious member of this adopted family and, thus, begins his plan to gradually insinuate himself more and more directly into their lives.As both writer and director, Romanek manages to keep us in a state of vague uneasiness throughout. We are always anticipating some potentially dreadful event, yet Romanek doesn't go for the easy thrill or the obvious plot turn. Thanks to Williams' subtle, incisive performance, we come to understand something of what makes this strange character tick. We begin to sense the deep-seated loneliness and social awkwardness that have come to play such an important part in defining both his behavior and his character. Si is scary, but he is also pathetic. He may have slipped over the edge into madness, but it is a pathology rooted in overwhelming loneliness and the inability to `fit in' to the societal `norm' of marriage and family. Even when his character is at his most threatening and irrational, Williams somehow makes us care about him. Romanek hits upon a few ancillary themes as well. He acknowledges how photos create the appearance of a life without necessarily reflecting the reality of that life. Most people, Si confesses, record only the `special, happy' moments of their lives ? birthdays, weddings, holidays etc. and leave out the mundane or painful ones. Moreover, Si tells us that people use pictures as a way of defeating aging and time, of saying to the world of the future that `I', this seemingly insignificant person, was really here, being happy and enjoying life. To match this theme, Romanek's visual style often feels like the director's own personal homage to The Photograph, as the camera scans caressingly across a sea of snapshots ? and Si's voiceover narration complements that feeling.`One Hour Photo' is not a film for those who like their chills heavily laced with bloodshed, murder and mayhem. It is, rather, for those who can appreciate a quietly unsettling, yet strangely compassionate glimpse into the dark recesses of the troubled mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Example Of A Comedian Who Can Be Effectively Serious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams once again proves how good comedians can be at serious drama roles. Williams is especially good at playing creepy characters, as he has done several times in the last decade.Here, he plays "Sy, the photo guy," a lonely employee in the photo department of a suburban Target/Walt-Mart//K-Mart-whatever who lives vicariously through a nice family, whose family pictures he has developed and printed for years. So, when Sy discovers the husband of that family is cheating, he takes it personally....and gets involved.This was a fascinating portrait of a deranged man and a wonderfully photographed movie. The colors in here are astounding at times and the camera-work innovative with some neat angles. The suspense of the story builds and builds one gets that old film-noir feeling of impending doom.This has a different ending, though, than most old film noirs, not exactly what the viewer might think will happen.This is a film that, as far I know, never got much publicity, but it's a gem. Williams is outstanding in his role and the hour-and-a-half you invest in this movie flies by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I sincerely enjoyed this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is a film of supreme caliber. The film is powered by the haunting, chilling, silencing, and above all-genius performance by Robin Williams. But the rather extraordinary thing is that it is not Robin Williams on the screen, it's Sy Parish (the character's name). Robin Williams fades away from our senses and slips into the ever so sweet and innocent yet psychotic role of a supermarket's photo developer. The films script is only accented by Williams, at times, restrained performance. Williams ignites on the screen and burns till the last frame, and you are unable to take your eyes off him. As I mentioned the film is subliminily written as well as directed. Though being Romanek's first, I certainly don't think this is a bad start. Romanek's direction adds to the on-going tension throughout the film. More affecting is Williams' delightful calmness. Trying to hold himself in becomes more troublesome for both Williams and his character as the story develops. Yet through the calm eyes of an innocent blaze the fires of hatred and intensity, which could very well sum up Williams' performance. The film does have some disturbing images as well. Yet they are not really strong enough for you to get up from your seat and leave yet rather the opposite. Williams' contribution as well as guidance towards the actions and scenes of peril compell as well as amaze you towards both the performance and film itself. Williams' shocking contribution to the screen is enough to make you cry, scream, and yell in your seat. Because the origins of the character are bittersweet just like own known Williams, leads to a crazed and psychotic breakdown. It's as if watching our own funny and beloved Robin fail us. Though the truth could not be any further, Williams but succeeds in the art of acting, creating an achievement in the field. Creating a landmark. Writing his/its own chapter. I guarantee that this film will be required study material in acting classes for now on. In conclusion: definitely one of the best of 2002.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong performances save the day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, Robin Williams does steal the show. He's an underrated actor, who, given a good script can deliver a mind boggling performance. That's exactly what One hour photo is, a good script with brilliant performances. The whole cast does an excellent job of showing how the events of one deranged man can impact the lives of many. Let's get one thing straight, though, this not a mainstream movie. It is very much an independant film. If you don't like movies with little action or a low budget don't see this movie. This film is good because of its' strong performances and decent script. I must say, though, without Williams as the lead, this movie would not have been as good as it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average stalker flick that avoids some of the clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seymour is a lonely nondescript man who lives by himself and works in the photo developing lab in a large mall. The only bit of cheer in his day is to develop very good photos in his lab, and he takes great pride in his work. His favourite customers are the Yorkin's, who have a son and regularly develop pictures. Seymour's like for this family goes beyond `like' and he feels part of their family and has all their pictures on his wall. However when both his job and the unity of his family are threatened he reacts.I saw this film in a free preview screening before it came out so I had no reviews to cloud me first. Happily most of them appear to feel the same as I did. In terms of plot this set up will be no surprise to anyone ? we've all seen Single White Female and Pacific Heights etc, we know what happens that leads to the old bunny boiling etc.However One Hour Photo is different enough to justify watching. My wife complained that it was too slow and boring but I felt this approach helped it stand out. Instead of being a thriller it was more of a cold slow boiler than was more chilling than thrilling. The plot is well laid out ? even the money shot of all the pictures on the wall is played out while we're distracted by a joke from the Simpsons on TV. The director's cold approach to story telling works very well and highlights Seymour's grey existence and cold life. Only occasionally does he go astray ? the fantasy sequences don't always work for instance but for almost the whole film he does very well.Towards the end Seymour's behaviour goes erratic as we expect and I was worried that the film had eventually given way to cliché. Happily this is not the case. Yes, Seymour's change is a bit of a leap at first but the film cleverly pulls it back at the end. This makes it above the rest of this genre by a good head and shoulders. Clever touches abound in the film but don't always work. For example the director shows us that it is all about seeing by covering Seymour's eyes with objects in some shots to show he has lost his ability to watch, while the name Yorkin is a slight play on `Your Kin' or your family. These are clever but don't add very much ? the eye theme felt a bit too clever and intrusive.Williams is excellent. Having paid to see him mush around in Patch Adams I was worried here that eventually his emotions would run away with him. However Williams (and here's something you'd won't hear much) keeps it all in check and underplays wonderfully. His Seymour is likeable, sad, pathetic and chilling all at once. It's hard not to feel for him and he is better for being low-key. I truly felt Williams had turned himself into a `little' man ? one of those people who you barely notice on the streets as they make no lasting image. Vartan (Alias) is good as Will and Nielsen is also good as Nina. They are also given firm support in the shape of Gary Cole and La Salle. However his is Williams show and, by underplaying, he steals it easily.Overall this has it's flaws but it is head and shoulders above the rest of this stalker genre. Directed with a clinic eye rather than a thrilling eye this is clever and different enough to more than justify checking it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Hitchcock but closer than most</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A seemingly innocuous man's descent into madness, and its effect on a family, gives One Hour Photo an advantage over most attempts at psychological thrillers. As with most movies, even critical darlings by the master himself, Mr. Hitchcock, there are questionable plot contrivences and scenes where reality has to be suspended, but these annoyances did not interfere with the total enjoyment of the movie. Williams was eerily brilliant as "Sy, The Photo Guy", and was able to travel between chillingly detached and forcefully angry with ease. The brilliant use of stark colors fleshed out the film, and those that garner enjoyment from the sets and cinematography, as well as the dialogue, will be pleased. This is a film for those that enjoy the total movie experience, and those that appreciate an intensity in their psychological thrillers will not be disappointed. After viewing this film, the question now becomes who gets the Oscar, Williams for One Hour Photo, or Pacino for Insomnia ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a truely special film that hasn't got its proper recognition. People just don't get it...This movie is about REAL life, REAL people, and REAL problems...Hollywood has had a bad habbit of sugar coating reality. All movies have happy endings??? The good guy always win??? Everyone is beautiful???Give me a break. Hollywood has the tendency of making the bad BAD and the good GOOD. I think most people are somewhere in the middle. I believe that everyone has a dark side and a good side. We're always so quick to judge, label, and forget about people.A little advice to people in general, never forget anyone.Powerful film, excellent score (soundtrack). I recommend this film to all those mature enough to pay attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romanek is up and coming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. Romanek pays attention to the minute details often overlooked by most directors through the use of natural lighting, exceptional cinemaphotography that gives you a moment to take in the scenery and a soundtrack that doesn't force the viewer to keep fiddling with the volume. At 90 minutes in length, there is no pointless filler doesn't bore you and irrelevant side plots to push it to the 2-hour mark. It's a movie you can sit back and enjoy without feeling distracted by ridiculous special effects, jittery camera work or a disjointed plot. It has a peaceful, deep and thoughtful feel to the narration and dialog that is enhanced and complimented by the soundtrack. You can identify with the characters because they're not some Hollywood fantasy - but real and identifiable everyday people who react as you would expect everyday people to react.Robin Williams has proven that he's a versatile actor. I've always liked his characters in comedies (i.e., Mork and Mindy, The Birdcage and Death to Smoochy) - however he really shines in more dramatic roles (Moscow on the Hudson and Awakenings). His character Sy in One Hour Photo takes him to the next level, but he's not the center of attraction. This is a good thing. Romanek gives the movie a sense of balance by giving characters depth and dimension. He makes sure that the perfect family that is the focus of Sy's obsession has problems just like everyone else in spite of their picture perfect affluent lifestyle. We see that while Sy succeeds at work with a warm, friendly disposition - his personal life is cold and lonely with his surroundings at home the same impersonal and sterile environment at work. Sy's character fits perfectly.Another bright spot in One Hour Photo was Dylan Smith, who played the son of the family that Sy is obsessed with. He's a natural actor who has the ability to play natural characters - an average kid who does a splendid job of acting as an average kid. Romanek doesn't insult the viewer by subjecting us to the stereotypical, annoying, mouthy, whiny, know-it-all kid with the bowl haircut that has ruined movie after movie.If I could change something - I would cast someone other than Gary Cole to play Sy's boss. Maybe it's the MST3K fan inside me saying this, but after seeing Office Space many times, I kept waiting for him to reincarnate the role of Bill Lumbergh in even the most subtle way, mmmm-kay?. Romanek knew how not to cross the fine line that separated Cole's role as the sadistic boss in Office Space from boss in One Hour Photo.I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Williams Steals The Show In This Clever Little Chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On face value, 'One Hour Photo' may seem like an average thriller but you'll be in for a surprise if you think so. It is a clever little movie that works both as a psychological thriller and an intriguing character study. Thankfully it does not have the absurd twists one has witnessed in the overrated 'Fatal Attraction' or nonsensical ones like in 'Single White Female' or 'The Hand That Rocks the Cable'. The storytelling is very coherent and the portrayal of the characters is very subtle.This isn't a fast-paced thriller. Writer and director Romanek takes his time to tell the story but that does not make 'One Hour Photo' boring. On the contrary, it allows us to discover the shades of Seymour and allows the viewer to feel sympathy for but also be fear of him. Likewise, we also discover the family Seymour/Sy stalks. At first they appear to be like a happy American family but soon we see, through Seymour's point of view, that reality is something else. Romanek creates a very gloomy cold atmosphere. The viewer does feel Seymour's loneliness from the busy supermarket to his claustrophobic apartment. The film is very well shot as it highlights the gloominess, indifference and closed atmosphere. Romanek also approaches interesting themes about what photographs mean i.e. proof of ones existence (beautifully explained in the film). While people take pictures of happy moments, their reality is something else.Coming to the performances, what would 'One Hour Photo' be without Robin Williams? The actor is in a completely different form and he does an excellently downplays Sy. Sy is gentle, polite, pathetic and creepy. Williams really brings a humane quality to the character rather than portray him as the clichéd stalker. Nielsen and Vartan are good too. La Salle and Cole give sufficient support. But, in the end, it's a one man show that belongs to Mr. Williams.There are a few very minor flaws such as a few scenes where reality is suspended but overall this is a cleverly chilling film that deserves to be watched but do not expect lots of murder, bloodshed, or silly twists like boiling a live rabbit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>clinical stalking for williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>well it was a pleasant surprise to see williams in this type of role and succeeding. although he played the very questionable (and dodgy) killer in insomnia, his role in one hour photo was very near perfect in this minor gem of a film. granted williams has been actively pursuing these alternative roles of late and yes it could be construed as being a cynical move on his behalf, however this does not detract from the fact that his role in photo was scarily on the mark.the directors (romanek) flair for colour synchronicity and immaculate art direction does not stray far from his beginnings as a music video director, however it is this attention to detail and precision that accentuates williams when he chooses to lose the plot. a memorable scene in the film of william's characters eyes squirting blood is in stark contrast to the ordered white formica and polished chrome surfaces that intimate to the spectator a feeling of staring intently at snapshots of a desperate man's life.if this film was to have any criticism is in the roles of the supporting actors. they are hardly fleshed out and as a spectator i felt that at times i was watching the robin william's rebirth show, however this is a minor point. if i were to mark this out of 10 i would give it a strong 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie. My husband and the other couple we were with started putting it down as soon as we stood up, but its because they prefer formula movies. If you like to know whats going to happen next, don't bother with this movie. This is a thinking man's movie. Its the kind of film that makes you stop and think about it for days after.When we got into the car, we began discussing it, and all three of them changed their assessment of the movie. It turns out they really hadn't gotten the nuances and hidden messages. They just didn't understand it. This film is incredibly subtle. It does not take you where you think it will. You think you know whats going to happen next, but you actually have no idea.If you haven't seen the film, stop reading here, because I'm going to talk about the plot. If you haven't seen it, you shouldn't read anything about it - just go in without any assumptions.This movie was frightening, heartening, disheartening, disturbing, incredible. Robin Williams plays a character that is absolutely "nutted up." He is a perfectionist, an obsessive person, a man with no family, no warmth, no life. He works in a sterile environment in which there is no warmth, no life. His apartment is sterile and cold. As the film begins, Williams' character gets into his car and there is a crack in the windshield and this is the point at which his life begins to crack up.During the film I felt afraid of the Williams character, I felt sorry for him, I wanted him to get caught, I wanted him to get away, I wanted him to have a life, I wanted him to have warmth - the movie carried me back and forth emotionally. For example, at one point the Williams character goes to the little boy's softball game and I was worried something bad was going to happen to the boy. I mean, it gets your mind going, and you are thinking, "What do I want here? Do I want the boy to make friends with Williams? Do I just want Williams to get away from the boy?"What a brilliant performance. I think Robin Williams should be nominated for an academy award for this film. I think its the best thing I've ever seen him in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd heard about this movie, it came and went, then finally I rented it on DVD and I loved it. Robin Williams' acting is a very brilliant surprise. Every shot keeps you interested in what will follow. From the opening scene with Sy wanting to look at his photos during the police interrogation, I kept wanting to see these myself. His creepy, put-upon persona reminded me of several people I'd been acquainted with over the years, and, yes, even reminded me of some of my own neediness.Even though I know he ends up getting into trouble, I kept thinking "don't do this" (making extra print copies for himself - taking photos of his ex-Manager's daughter - having a heated argument with the Xerox repairman, holding the knife on hubby Yorkin and his girlfriend, forcing them to simulate sex for the photos) but he did it anyway. The cinematography was pin-point perfect, with white fluorescent lights in the Sav-Mart, dim, almost sepia tone in his apartment, eerie bluish tint in the hotel parking garage during the police chase.I'd read Williams was originally offered the part of the store Manager, but I was so grateful he asked for the part of Sy instead. He became him. Just like Nicole Kidman in whichever project you happen to see her in, Williams becomes chameleon-like in this character. In other films of his, it's not like he actually becomes a character, more like him being a personality used to sell tickets (Patch Adams, Toys, Hook, Jumanji, etc. - none of which I have a desire to see). The last time he was really submerged into character was with Popeye (aha - Altman knew what to do with him).I bought this on DVD, yet I was at a friend's house and it was shown on FX this past Sunday evening, being the first time I saw this in a while. I'm definitely putting this one in the machine very soon.Now, going into Wal-Mart or any other store of that nature, seeing the One-Hour-Photo department just hasn't been the same.What leads me to think this is, in part, a satire on what darkness could lurk in the minds of department store employees, is that when I see these people now, I sometimes stop and wonder what their lives are like after 9pm (or 10 if you're in a Target).Some DVD fun - keep this on the main menu screen with the loop of the opening theme music, watching photos of Robin Williams flash on screen (designed after photo packets). Sit there and stare for a while, you'll be hypnotized.Nice features include behind-the-scenes footage with interviews interspersed with rehearsal footage and outtakes. Williams really hams it up, parodying the scene he and the other actor are about to perform.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pretentious crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>the movie is an exercise in tedious story-telling, and a boring story at that. every second shot seems to be a close-up of mr. williams, with his bleached and thinned hair and the awkward glasses every psychopath needs. the fact that mr. williams character is a lonely and depressed man is made abundantly clear by a series of boring "staged" shots of him sitting alone in an empty room, whether its the cafeteria or his own home.the picure-book perfect family could have been interesting, but the director and/or screenwriter obviously couldnt decide at which point to show the "real" family situation behind the happy facade. first we see the parents and their son cuddling on the sofa while looking at their pictures of the sons birthday party. the next scene is a tender good-night scene between mother and son where she states that "not everybody is as lucky as we are." however, the very next time we see the family, the parents are having a shouting match over money and personal issues, while the son watches and runs off crying. that scene seems so misplaced and badly directed that from that point onwards the whole family structure is so uninteresting that one couldnt care less what happens to them.mr. williams actions in the hotel room towards the end of the movie seem furthermore totally unrelated to the trauma he obviously suffered as a child. his idea of punishment projected to an adult couple just doesnt make sense regarding his own past. it is just as incompetent as the whole story. and then there are the photos themselves. i just kept asking myself, if the family consists of three people, who then is always taking those pictures of the three? the same goes for the holiday pictures of the husband. did they hire a personal photographer to come along with them on the holiday so they could get those perfect couple shots on the beach? and the kid of course always considered the importance of complementary colors when shooting his pics: so that a bright blue teddy bear sits next to an orange balloon and that a pair of red rubber boots are seen standing on a very green lawn! all those pictures are so "art-directed" and staged that they in themselves rob the movie of all credibilty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning, sympathetic portrait of a damaged man and the forces that tend to make such men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, "One Hour Photo" is not for the faint of heart. Nor is it a movie to see if all you want is the escapism the movies so often offer us. For those who want that, there are no shortage of other movies out there, and good ones in their own right.Robin Williams characterization of "Sy, the Photo Guy" is wonderful, one of his best, a chilling, humanizing and many-layered portrait of a deeply disturbed individual. What struck me most in watching the performance was the tug-of-war in my own mind about his questionable sanity and his motives. While it's extremely clear from the start that he suffers some significant psychopathology, the ending leaves one wondering (at least a little) about the method madness, and whether it is he that is sick, or human society in the 21st century. We've come quite far from the use of psychopathology as a plot driver since such movies as DePalma's "Dressed to Kill."I don't wish to include any spoilers here. Suffice it to say that by the end I felt that where Seymour went wrong (aside from his obsession) was in having motives that in a sense were a little too good, too moralistic, too rigid... but for reasons that the film ultimately justifies, without excusing or judging. I could see virtually nothing in the writing that was gratuitous or unearned, even if the situations did become rather extreme. Each character remained believable, and even those one was set up to dislike, such as Sy's boss (Gary Cole) were neither presented as saints nor absolute demons, but merely as flawed human beings with motives and drives that sometimes contributed to the unfortunate chain of events that are the throughline of the movie.Rather than demonize Sy, the central character, those who made this work bring us into Sy's mind in a way that is quite certain to be deeply discomfiting to many, but with a compassion and honesty that is only rarely achieved these days (or at any time in the past) in the movies.The screenwriter-director, Mark Romanek, is a talent I hope will go on to greater public appreciation with time, but whether that happens or not, may his projects always find a green light somewhere. He has only directed one other feature film I'm aware of, STATIC, which seems nearly impossible to find on video. The rest of his work, as is so often the case with visually stunning directors, has been in music video, including videos for Madonna and Nine Inch Nails.If I could find fault with anything about the movie it would be in the marketing. Where Romanek and Williams make Sy appear as a deeply flawed (and deeply disturbed) human being, he is clearly presented utmost as a sympathetic character. This is quite a feat in an era where paranoia is rampant, especially when it comes to "stalkers" and the mentally disturbed. Yet the marketing campaign seems to present the simplistic cliche of the creepy stalker, emphasizing only the monstrous aspects of his nature.I've noted in reviews here and elsewhere a certain polarization of opinion surrounding this film. Perhaps some of those who disliked the film were drawn in by the promises made in posters and ads, and felt cheated (or confused) that this was not the one-dimensional suspense thriller that marketing tried to sell it as?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Close to Modern Hitchcock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I begin, I should mention that I have been an Alfred Hitchcock fan since the age of five, and for me to even compare any film made in the last twenty years to even the worst Hitchcock film is totally unheard of. I view hitchcock as most film buffs view Orson Welles. With that being said, I left the movie theater after viewing One Hour Photo utterly spellbound. The same uneasy (not necessarily nervous) feeling that one experiences during a film like Notorious or North By Northwest can be experienced here. The audience isn't scared of Williams' character, they're uncomfortable around him, which is just how the other characters in the film view him. The other great element of the film is that it is easy to follow. While the trend in the mystery / thriller genre of today is to confuse and disorientate the audience as a means of creating tension, the director takes down a straight road that has several bumps along the way, which provides the same tension without all the confusion (See this film, then watch either Memento or Mulholland Drive). I can go on and on, but I will leave you with the this as a close to this review. This is the first film in some years that I left the movie theater feeling that I really got my money's worth ($8.00 per ticket).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one gets an A+ from me. Stark terror in broad daylight. This is not an action movie, but very much a suspense movie in the Hitchcock tradition. Not for hyperkinetic teens -- no big gunfights, extended chase scenes, or fireballs -- but for adults who like suspense. It is like a Shyamalan film without the gore, and nothing like "Silence of the Lambs".I am always amazed when Hollywood does something original. But this one managed to surprise me constantly -- I had no clue about what would happen next at the big plot turns.BIT OF A SPOILER:The appeal of One Hour Photo would be a lot broader if they could give away the fact that nothing horrible happens and there are no blood and intestines. (Well actually there is a chase scene.) In fact, it has a happy ending and is something of a "feel good" movie, albeit following an hour of nail-biting. Again, it is very much like The Sixth Sense, or Signs, in this regard.I don't go for "artsie" movies, but One Hour Photo has a plot that kept me riveted from start to finish. This is really the best movie I have seen all year -- I was on the edge of my seat from start to finish.I have disliked Robin Williams in every movie he has made for the past 5 or 10 years -- for me, this is his first major success in drama. He has returned to something closer to his character in "Fisher King" and it really suits him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A promising directorial debut combined with yet another surprising performance by Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the movie ended I was momentarily upset because I felt the climax was too vague. But the more I thought about it, the more things fell into place. If you like your movies, crystal clear and are expecting Hanibal Lecter, this picture is not for you. On the other hand, if you occasionally like something a little more cerebral, that perhaps makes you uncomfortable, and forces you to ponder optional realities, you're about to take a ride on a moral roller coaster. At the end, ask yourself, who is the bad guy and who is the hero?SPOILER I felt that Sy took the pictures of his manager's daughter, not primarily to get back at him, but rather to purposely attract attention. He knew from his job that the pictures would result in the authorities being called. He wanted them on his trail because he wanted to lead them to the adulterous William Yorkin. When Nina Yorkin failed to react to the real photos of her philandering husband the way he'd hoped, Sy decides to give her some graphic `booster' shots, and give her husband a wake-up call at the same time. Only when Sy is sure that the police have arrived at the hotel does he attempt to make his escape, thereby insuring the police will also encounter Yorkin and Maya in their hotel. Thus, Sy makes it impossible for the Yorkins to go on living a lie. I feel Sy believed he was saving them for their sake and for their son. It's left open to you whether or not you think he succeeded.As to theories about the snapshots at the end, I seem to recall the police said there were TWO rolls of film, one in Sy's bag and one still in the camera that he left in the hotel. At the beginning, the detective says `We processed the roll of film in your bag. They are not very pretty pictures' and `What did William Yorkin do to provoke you?' implying they are prints from the first roll that we see Sy take of Yorkin and Maya--but we never see those prints. Instead, at the end of the film, we see the prints from the roll that was still in the camera. But, anticipating the former, we are confused, stunned or surprised when we instead see the bizarre shots he took after he returned to his room. The director leaves it to the viewer to interpret the meaning of those.As to the family photo that preceeds the credits, Robin Williams said (on the DVD) he felt it was Sy's dream of the way things might have been or could still be. The director said it was up to the viewer.One Hour Photo did contain some flaws as noted her in other reviews. However, given that it was Mark Romanek's first screenplay I think we should cut him some slack, and look for something even better from him next time. My rating, 3.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film- very thought provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll try to avoid divulging anything actually in the plot and touch on the overriding themes. Yes, it is conspicuously disturbing and probably should be filed under the same classification that contains Full Metal Jacket and A Clockwork Orange and consequently is rightly rated R. That said, for the right audience, it delves into the quandary oft pondered, Where does categorical love cease and morph into destructive psychological illness? Furthermore, focus on the plight of the lonely white lower-middle class worker who feels that society (read special interests and the government) neglects him but chooses to forgo complaining. Probably the the most potent element to the film is that it is quite realistic. The acting, script, and plot stand muster. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie which has Robin Williams in the performance of his career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story, in case you don't know, is that a one-hour photo employee named Sy (played by Robin Williams) is obsessed with a family that frequently visits. From every roll of film they bring in, he makes copies just for himself. He soon begins to imagine that he is a part of the family. He really does like these people, and wants nothing more than for them to like him. He gives the 9-year old boy free toys and such from the store he works. He does lots of things in hope of them liking him. I don't want to say that much more, in fear of giving too much away, but it gets extremely disturbing.It would be a crime to not give Robin Williams an Academy Award nomination for this role. He does this so well that while watching it, you sometimes forget that this is the same person that was once a loveable character like Mrs. Doubtfire. By far Robin Williams's best performance to date. The other performances in this movie were also convincing. But this is Robin's show.Mark Romanek does a great directing job and writes a great screenplay here. One hell of a movie debut for him.To sum it up: "One Hour Photo" is my favorite film of 2002 so far. Robin Williams gives us the performance of his career, and Mark Romanek comes off with one of the best debuts in recent memory. This movie is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never thought I'd say this: Robin Williams' performance made me cry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*spoilers below*What an amazing film. This is definitely Robin Williams' best performance ever. He's so believable that you forget it's Robin Williams up there on screen; this guy IS Sy. I actually cried at the part of the movie when Sy cried while looking through the pictures Jake took. I never thought Robin Williams could make me cry, but he did... which is a good thing. If you see this film, you'll feel how painful his empty and practically nonexistent life is. Also, the dialog was unexpectedly realistic. Besides Sy's explanation of why he did what he did near the end, other dialog that stood out was when Nina told her son that everybody knows that Sy's sad, and that they should just HOPE he feels happier. It would've been better if they actually DID something instead of just hoping he would feel better, but, sadly, that's the way life is. Only one thing bothered me: the very last frame! What was that? Why were we shown a happy picture of Sy with the Yorkins? Did it represent how Sy still thought he was still connected to the family? That last frame was very confusing and does nothing but hamper the ending. Many people believe "One Hour Photo" will be a thriller (based on what they see in the the trailer), but it's the farthest thing from it; it's more like a drama... a really disturbing, heartwrenching, beautiful drama that few will see because of limited release. Trust me, this film isn't for everyone, but those who see it will be satisfied. Wonderful job, Robin!My rating: 9 out of 10 (It'd be 10 out of 10 if it wasn't for the confusing last frame)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too good for Oscar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo provided me with a mixture of extreme sadness and pure delight. The main character, who`s a real "peeping tom", is played with such sincerity by Robin Williams who seems to have gotten the hang of playing the "bad guy" (last seen in Insomnia).In style and theme it`s easy to compare this flick with films like Magnolia and American Beauty, by which all of them portrays the crucial and life-changing moments which happens to the protagonist. I wouldn`t complain if OHP won an Oscar for best film, but unfortunately the statuette will probably go to some extravagant story with no references to most peoples personal life (ala Gangs of New York)instead of this wonderful treasure.

Unlike most of the pictures I've seen recently (Signs and Minority Report for example), the ending was not flat or anti-climactic. I never once felt like a line was out of place or unimportant.

		<fullReview>I just don't tire of this film. On the evening of his announced passing, we watched this film as a tribute to this unique individual. By the way, on the DVD he provides audio commentary. A rarity from him. Basically the story is about a lonely man who identifies himself with a family and it become an obsession. Strong performances and the music is perfect for this film.As a former one hour photo worker, I can identify with some of the aspects of his job. Also I worked at Wal Mart and the filmmakers replicated its look pretty well.I sure wouldn't want a boss like Gary Cole's character! He is subtle and tyrannical!This movie was even written up in Fangoria back then. Not bad for a non-gory film. Well there was a small scene with blood or a photo chemical......If you get the DVD, check out the outtakes. There you'll see Williams doing his shtick, sort of showing the comic side of One Hour Photo. It is pretty funny!Thanks, Robin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film succeeds solely through the phenomenal performance by Mr. Williams.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Hour Photo" as a film has its share of flaws, but none of them are related to Robin Williams' powerful and haunting performance. It's his fullest and yet most restrained effort to date. "One Hour Photo" creates an effective portrait of a lonely, deranged man becoming increasingly frantic. He crosses the line from being harmless and pathetic, to being dangerous when he can no longer differentiate between fantasy and reality. There comes a time when it is no longer enough for him to fantasize, when the role of distant observer, no longer satisfies. Robin plays the role of a man named Sy, who runs the photo-developing lab at the local Savmart. Sy has nothing in his life but his job and his fantasies -- no friends, no family, no wife, and no girlfriend. He looks depressed in tranquility and suicidal when he smiles. Sy's obsessive nature has a good side. The prints he develops in his lab really do look gorgeous, and takes pride in his work. On the other hand, he is also developing a fixation on a family, the Yorkins, and has an entire wall of his apartment plastered with photos of them dating back 10 years. And now -- though the movie never specifies an emotional trigger -- he is losing his grip of reality, falling further into his delusional thoughts. Much of ''One Hour Photo'' informs the audience through visual stylization. The cinematography is as finely detailed as Sy himself. Williams inhabits a carefully selected color scheme, a world of harsh whites and washed-out blues, illuminated by the glare of fluorescent bulbs. Director Mark Romanek pays more attention to this style than giving depth to his characters and plotting, exploring Sy's psychosis but never really delving into the reasons behind it. A disturbing yet compelling film that pulls you in solely on the merit of Williams' fantastic performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well acted character study needed more of a payoff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams proves with this film that his performance in "Insomnia" was not a fluke. He can play a creep as well as he can play a funny character. His performance in this film is mesmerizing, while the whole project seems to build up suspense then fizzle around him.Williams plays Sy Parrish, a mild-mannered clerk in charge of developing pictures at a Wal-Mart type store in some unnamed suburbia. Williams comes off as lonely and overbearing as he obsesses over a young couple (the Yorkins) and their son. It seems that he has made a copy for himself of every picture the couple has brought in to the store for development over the years. He has even gone as far as building a collage on one of his apartment walls of these pictures. Sy fantasizes about being a part of their family. In one sequence, he even imagines himself in their home using the toilet and watching a Michigan State football game on the tube. With no living family of his own, Sy has nobody else he feels close to.Things start falling apart for Sy by the end of the first hour. He is fired from the store when a large discrepancy of photographs were found to occur on his shifts. His boss hates him anyway, and that was the excuse he used to get rid of the old man. Sy seems to suspect that the Yorkin family has turned him in, so he decides to get some revenge on the husband. He follows him to a hotel and forces he and his mistress to pose in some pornographic photographs, presumably before slicing them up with a large hunting knife. Sounds interesting enough, but at the end, we find out that nothing really happens to Mr. Yorkin or his mistress. Sy just took pictures of various things in their hotel room; not even of the couple themselves. Okay.....I can't say for sure what the point of this film really is. Other than letting Williams show us how talented he is, there really isn't much to the whole thing. The film is certainly no classic, but it's definitely worth seeing once. Especially if you like Robin Williams. And who really doesn't like the furry little guy????? 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is a masterpiece? Maybe a movie masterfully directed, powerfully acted, with a believable and deep screenplay and with a superb use of score, cinematography and art direction.Is One Hour Photo a masterpiece?I'm almost sure.Mark Romanek, better known for directing videos for bands such as The Rentals, makes his feature film debut with an original screenplay of his own about loneliness and the alienation of our society. A sad story about sad people, and a frightening tale with ordinary life monsters.Of course this is the kind of movie that is better watch without anything spoiled at all, so I won't bore you with the plot... instead, I'll go straight to the "artistic" evaluation of the film. Having said that, why not start with the cinematography? I have to say that this is one of the best uses of cinematography I've seen in the whole story of movie making... the cold, boring Sy (Robin Williams) life is full of cold colors that will remind you of Stanley Kubrick's "2001"... but the irruption of Sy's "family" is underlined by a subtle change into "Kodak" style colors... that's the line between Sy's increasing madness and "real" life. The score, which we could consider minimalist is also perfectly used to underline the increasing tension and is no wonder that Romanek has a lot of experience shooting videos... the only score flaw, however is that some rithym reminded me a lot of Filter's version of "One" (as published in "The X Files Movie" soundtrack). This is one of those movies in which everything (art direction, costumes, cinematography, sound, editing) seem to match to perfection.For the acting, the supporting cast is believable, and Connie Nielsen is the stand out. She's a lovely wife and mother, but not a cliched one... she's believable. In fact, I bought this family as a real family, I easily forgot that these people were actors (the screenplay develop this characters to the exact point of making us actually care for them without distracting that the focus of our attention is Sy and his devotion for them).So here we get to the whole point of the buzz surrounding this movie: is this the best Robin Williams performance ever?Yes.This is not Robin Williams acting. This a candid camera work into Sy's life. How many times can you really say that after watching a movie? Not many, I guess. Robin Williams and Mark Romanek are under control of this movie and not in a single frame they lose it (well, I have just a problem with a shot... but it is a single shot and it is perfectly explained, so why really bother).And for the direction, I've just said it all: strong, accurate, perfect at acting and composition... the best director nod should be assured. Mark Romanek has achieved one of the best film debuts I can remember in a long time (maybe since Quentin Tarantino and Tim Robbins debuts in 1992 with Reservoir Dogs and Bob Roberts)... Romanek is not a promise, he is a reality.This film will be compared (it was compared, due to the similarity of the origins of Romanek and Spike Jonze) with Being John Malkovich.. but it is not an accurate comparison. One Hour Photo is a serious approach to its issues, while "Malkovich" played with surrealism in order to surprise the audience. In "Photo", it is the use of icons (as unexpected as a toy, for example) which can surprise you with unexpected references. As you can see, I really dug this movie, which was leaving me in awe in every scene... till a point that I can't do anything but surrender to the fact that Romanek's movie will play a very influential role in the next years.What about the Oscars? There is a difference between what it should and what it can be... Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actress, Original Screenplay, Score, Cinematography, Film Editing and Sound nominations should be in their deserved way. Reality is that given the competition, this may be overlooked and simply in the best of the scenarios get an Actor and an Original Screenplay nominations (maybe even wins). But as the reviews are highly positive, maybe the top 10 lists will fuel its chances and we'll see a One Hour Photo's clip at Oscar Night.Make Sy happy. Actually, he deserves it.</fullReview>

Robin Williams,(Sy Parrish),"The Final Cut",'04, put his heart and soul into every picture that he developed and had a very very large Album of his own at home. Sy Parrish had a very dark dark mental problem from his youth and it seemed to give him problems as he became very close to the Yorkin family and their son.

		<fullReview>After watching this film about 3 or 4 times I really understood the point. SY Parrish was truly a guy that I really felt sorry for because it was quite obvious that he had no one in his life. I strongly believe that even though SY got carried away with his obsession with the Yorkin family I feel that he truly cared about Jake and his mom. That is why I understood why he did some of what he did. SY however went about it the wrong way but all in all SY in a weird sense was trying to prove to Jake's Mother that Mr. Yorkin (Jake's Father) was a jerk, and I think Mr. Yorkin got what he deserved at the Hotel, the scare of his life to wake his A** up and make him see how he was hurting his family which at the end of this film it was clear that Mr. Yorkin felt bad about having the affair in the first place. The bottom line is this, even though this Movie was a thriller it was also sad and depressing-because I know people who are sad and lonely like SY and that is why my heart truly went out to SY because all he wanted was someone in his life to care about him. We all need to be loved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DON'T TURN OUT THE LIGHTS! This is one intense and downright disturbing film. It doesn't make you jump out of your seat, but instead slowly works on your nerves untill the tension is unbearable. The film is about Sy, the photo man. Sy (Robin Williams) works at a retail outlet in the photo department. Sy lives a lonely existence and has no friends or family. Over the years he has developed an obession with a seemingly perfect couple (Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan) and their little boy. His obession is so great that almost all of Sy's entire apartment is covered with stolen pics of the family. However, when circumstances cause Sy to lose his job and he discovers that Vartan is cheating on Nielsen on the same day it sends him over the edge. Robin Williams does not just act the role of Sy, he becomes Sy. Williams performance is brave and 100% convincing. However, the weak narrative structure at the start and end of the film weaken it.Rated R; Torture, Nudity, and Profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film seems to be not much more than a vehicle for Robin Williams to act up a storm, and that he does well. The plot has so many holes in it I find it amazing that it got any good reviews.One example: "Sy" finds the pictures of the cheating husband, with his girlfriend. These look like candid shots of the both of them frolicking, kissing (or rather, about to kiss), hugging, etc. Who took these candid shots? Did they stop a stranger in the street? "Excuse me sir, could you take a picture of us just as we are about to kiss?"Another example, just for good measure: the police go to the hotel where they believe there might be some foul play taking place. There are two rooms, Sy's room and the cheating couple's room. The police first goes to Sy's room to find it empty and only then, to the other room. Why do they not first go to the room where something awful might be happening? or, better yet... Why not send agents to *both* rooms, just in case?I could go on and on and on but, like the movie, it'd be to tedious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS (ALTHOUGH NONE THAT AREN'T REVEALED IN THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF THE MOVIE)Robin Williams is actually quite good in this as the friendly, lonely, emotionally stunted loser Sy. He makes a very human, even sympathetic psycho, and really disappears into the character--no small feat for such a recognizable performer. Too bad the rest of the movie is such a waste. The supporting performances (and performers) wouldn't look out of place in a soft-core porno (it doesn't help that every character but Sy is made of 100% cardboard). At times, the director actually seems to be trying to frustrate suspense: we know from the very first moments a) that Sy is a complete whack-job, b) that he survives, and c) that he gets nabbed by the cops at the end. So all we're left to ponder is the hows and the whys, and the answers provided aren't all that interesting.The plot is plodding and contrived, and features some nonsensical moments (for instance, the husband berates his wife for her expensive tastes, even though she seems to spend all her free time at the local discount superstore). About two thirds of the way through, Sy does something so irredeemably stupid that it makes one wonder how much he actually cares about his grand revenge scheme. And the final clichéd explanation of his psychosis, right out of `Peeping Tom,' is a terrible copout.The dialogue is of the absolute worst sort. It's not overwritten, or awkward, or unbelievable, or bad in any other way that could be considered fun, even for bad-movie lovers. Instead, every line is purely, hideously functional--it's as if the director handed a plot outline to a newspaper copywriter and said, `Hey, I need a workable script on this--in an hour.' It made me want to scream, honestly.This movie seems to be a throwback to the suburban beware-the-help thrillers of the eighties and nineties (`The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,' e.g.), and while it's certainly unpleasant, it's never really scary. Sy's fetishism occasionally makes you feel uncomfortable, but on its own that's not enough to make the film work. In the end, lack of craftsmanship from everyone involved, except Robin Williams, sinks this one. 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry, but I'm having trouble finding the meaning of this film. I went into the theater with no expectations. I read some of the reviews that described the movie as "deeply terrifying" and "creepy." I also noticed that Robin Williams was playing a "bad guy" in the film, and after seeing last summer's "Insomnia," I was ready to return to the dark side of Robin William's persona. Well, I must say that this movie was very dissapointing. It seemed to drag on and on...and I don't mean that this is a character-driven movie...it is just plain BORING. Nothing seems to happen. By the end of the film, I didn't really care what happened to the main characters (neither did half of the audience in the particular showing I saw, who got up and left before the movie was even over.) I felt no suspense, no terror, no edge-of-my-seat intensity. Hopefully this turkey will be forgotten in the following months. The only thing "deeply terrifying" about this movie is that it was actually made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How do we understand film? Roughly two types of it, a matter of focus and placement of the eye; outside and inside. Most films that won Oscars are the first, most brilliant makers who furthered the craft of capturing images compete in the second. Just the first few sequences reveal about this, an ominous-looking camera looking straight at us as if to point inwards, a man in his lab bringing images to life, followed by happy birthday party footage as a way of saying that life is a matter of what images you choose and keep to remember. But the study feels obvious and watered down, a voice- over pontificates.The only thing of note is a softer ambiguity around suffering, this; the film begins with the man interrogated by police so we know that something bad has taken place, except we don't know what or how bad. Our mind races ahead, imagining the thriller. A whole sequence near the end as police storm the hotel room toys with just this anticipation of images, the camera enters the bathroom and we expect some atrocity. The crime was that he was robbed of what every human being needs, warmth and affection. The suffering is that the images he inhabits are not his own. In the end we see the images he did capture in the hotel room. I'm not quite sure what the filmmaker is pointing at here, judging by how watered down feels the rest I'm inclined to think it just means he was harmless, not prurient. But it feels powerful and apt, viewers here can imagine how it completes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin William's doing what he does best, not what he does normally.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've wondering why Robin's performance in One Hour Photo is usually considered his greatest performance by people who hate his comedy, myself, it's because you haven't seen the movie. He does NOTHING funny in this film. Wait, he does do something funny, but not Robin Williams-over-the-top-idiot-with-a-million-voices "funny", ill get to it soon. The point is, he's taken on the roll of a lonely, depressed and run down senior with a true passion for quality in is line of work (a negative printer at the photo counter or "photo-guy"), a job where the mass production of sub-par material is the height of tedium in his existence, but occasionally he sees something that makes him smile with its beauty and wonder, and that's a real capture; smiling families, funny moments, and his favourite family, the Yorkins. This family he is unexplainably obsessed with, they don't realise it, and when you do it shifts the gentle persona of Si to one you suddenly want to watch our for. I liken this creepiness to the uncle you find out is a pedophile, in the scene switching between Si's flat, empty of personality and company, and the Yorkin's modern home where the mother puts the son to bed and tries to reassure her son that "I'm sure Si has lots of friends". At this point he's standing in his kitchen with a glass of juice, staring into a black void and can only be thinking of the cause of his anguish and distain. This has to be the darkest moment of the movie for me. This job I mention, the photo-guy job that rarely but surely gives him such a beautiful day every now and then, becomes his mental and emotional demise when he discovers the husband of the Yorkins is having an affair, through the submitted negatives of his mistress. There is one scene in the movie where he sits his car outside the Yorkins house and imagines himself inside their house, mentally masturbating over the idea of wearing the husband's sweater, using their toilet and watching their TV. This is the funny part i mentioned. They come home unexpectedly and he's referred to as "Uncle Si!"From imagining himself as part of the family to finding out the husband of this perfectly moulded union is having an a affair has gutted him deeply and crushed all his faith in humanity. So he flips, doesn't he :)Williams' character portrayal is brilliant to say the least and and the direction of the movie itself is nearly as brilliant. You could not a found a more suited man for this role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams does a great job of shedding his funny guy persona here. His Sy Parrish gives me the creeps ? from that moment Connie Nielson's Nina Yorkin walks into his One-Hour Photo shop. Williams provides more creeps here than he did in Insomnia. Just take a look at the light thinning crew-cut hair on this bespectacled middle-aged man with the stone-cold, mousy looking eyes and very disturbing smile. He reminds me of a weird and twisted mind with many faces. Just observe Parrish's behavior and it'd be hardly impossible not to be afraid of him. Oh yes, the viewer will get to know his character ? slowly and gradually, feeling the tease; wondering what he'd do next. It's his deceiving appearance that truly petrifies? an ordinary guy who seems so ordinary to some, yet turns out to be a low-keyed 'psychopath'. Yuks - that's exactly how I feel, studying him and his moves! The moments are very intense and scary. Look out for hints to Parrish's traumatic experiences because they help to connect the events and explain his fantasies and 'schizophrenic' wackiness. You truly have got to compare Michael Vartan's Will character to Gary Cole's Bill Owens. Maybe that too will help you accept the ending of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What clutters a man's wall is worth over a million words</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though digital cameras are becoming less and less common, that doesn't mean One Hour Photo has become any less suspenseful or any less impressive. It serves as probably my favorite Robin Williams film, and proof that many comedic actors can take on a dramatic role effectively. The problem is, many don't take the opportunity when it comes.Robin Williams plays Seymour "Sy" Parrish, a photo-developer at a corporate giant known as SavMart. Despite Sy's soft-spoken, and generally harmless aging man appearance, he is actually a very depressed man who obsesses over the seemingly perfect family of the Yorkins. The Yorkins are the typical American family; a husband, a wife, and a young boy. Sy has been developing the Yorkin family photos for years, and is assuming the role of "Uncle Sy" in the Yorkin family.He does this, of course, because he does not have a family of his own. He lives alone in an apartment with a collage of photos of the Yorkins. All the pictures are plastered to the wall in order and neatness, leaving no gaps or overlaps. He begins to stalk the family after a certain period of time, and from that moment on, Sy isn't so harmless anymore - but actually mentally ill and in dire need of psychological help.Robin Williams jumps right into the role of Sy Parrish. He's creepy, stylish, believable, and scary. From the guy who has done things like Jumanji and other nonsensical films, here comes something you'd never see from a man who played a sailor who loved spinach at one point in his life.But the true talent here is director Mark Romanek, who has worked on many music videos for Nine Inch Nails, R.E.M., and Weezer. Romanek stayed true to the story of the film, revealing more and more informations about Sy and his intentions for the story that he made subtly on purpose. He gives descriptive backstory on why Sy is the way he is at the end, but you may have to do research to piece together everything. While Romanek explained a lot, you still have to come up with your own explanation for the ending. And my view on it is something I dare not give away because I feel it's one of the most mind-boggling, yet, thought-provoking endings in recent memory.During the course of the film, Sy narrates over it, which is nothing but fantastic. His narrations are very relaxed, in a quiet tone for much of the time. And scenes where he explains his customers and what pictures they take is extra information you wouldn't think a film like One Hour Photo would contain. Even graphic insight and personal opinions on cameras and pictures are given here. The film goes outside of its plot boundaries to deliver explicit detail to the audience. I can't thank Romanek enough for giving this an extra dimension to work with.I found this a tiny bit relatable to the film LOOK, which was made about seven years after this. LOOK was directed by Adam Rifkin, a relatively unsung director who shot the entire film with security cameras giving authentic depth and feel to it, while following not-so-innocent people around and connecting them in an anthology-like format. Both this and that show people that we could be being watched and not even know it. That's the power these films bring. And you only get more skeptical every time you watch them.One Hour Photo, even with repeated viewings, is disturbing, and visually interesting. It's creepy to think about Sy's actions, but it's even creepier thinking that back when film was developed constantly, and places like Walgreens and Wal-Mart's "One Hour Photo" booths used to be filled with customers, how easy it was to obtain one person's pictures. It's amazing to think just five or six years ago we used to be protective with our pictures, count on them being done in one hour, and then only be shown to a certain number of people. When now, we upload pictures to our computers and then make them so the whole world can see. My, how times have changed.Starring: Robin Williams, Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen, Dylan Smith, Gary Cole, and Eriq La Salle. Directed by: Mark Romanek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film, but doesn't live up to the expectations the first hour builds within you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams is known for his comedy roles. He is a legendary funny guy, but where he really shines is his serious roles. He proves this in One Hour Photo, a dark and suspenseful thriller about Sy, an employee of a one hour photo lab at a local supermarket, who becomes obsessed with a seemingly idyllic suburban family. Sy's obsession grows to disturbing lengths as he starts to uncover secrets about this family and begins to feel an obligation to protect them, as well as himself. This is a disturbing film that is paced wonderfully and shot with a calm and non-intrusive specialty that captures the films growing suspense excellently.The best thing about this film is its unique pacing and very specific mood that stays consistent throughout the entire film. This film is very brooding and its plot develops very slow, establishing the troubled character of Sy very well and in some of the creepiest and most unexpected ways possible. This film has a lot of tension that builds at a pace much more intelligent than the average thriller. The entire setup is very captivating and the director of this film deserves a lot of kudos for creating a story and a protagonist that are actually engaging and really are thrilling.Sadly where this film falls short is its climax. So much tension is built and the levels of suspense rise to such great heights that it really leads you to expect a lot out of this films climax and conclusion. Unfortunately it doesn't quite get to where you really want it to be, and the way everything pans out is pretty disappointing. The climax and what happens after it isn't bad, and it would have been OK with a film that hadn't set itself up as well. It would have fit right in with the same mediocrity as before. But One Hour Photo builds itself up from the ground so well that when it reaches its peak it is fairly anti-climactic and really leaves you wanting more. All the film needed was a little more thought to go into the conclusion of this film and it would have been truly incredible, but it just lacks that last little push into excellency, thus I can only credit this film as being good.But that doesn't change the fact that Robin Williams is just incredible. This is one of his finest and creepiest performances ever. Sy is such a disturbed man, and Williams makes you believe every last bit of him. The character is extremely well written and darkly constructed to carry the tone of this film. And while Williams is the main focus of the film, the supporting cast does a great job as well. The family Sy stalks is a very believable family, other than a few small bumps along the way. There are various small roles that pop up throughout the film, and none of them seem to drag down the film as they all center around Sy and drive his character's motivations and emotions, which are the heart and soul of this film.One Hour Photo isn't quite a great film, but it is very good. There are some great things about it, but it falls short in its conclusion that it almost ends up being more disappointing than anything else. But it goes to show how fantastic the setup of the film is when I am this disappointed by a conclusion that doesn't deliver what I wanted it to. Robin Williams is the shining pilot of the film who makes it a truly disturbing and captivating experience. I would recommend this film, if only to see Williams incredible performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams Proves Himself in, One Hour Photo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be a short stretch to imagine Robin Williams becoming tied to a similar fate as his mentor, Jonathan Winters. Becoming increasingly absorbed into the complexity of his own comic genius and less and less able to return from the various personalities he could assume (sometimes vicariously) his fans could only wonder if they might concern themselves with his mental health one day. The reassurance this might not be in the offing, however, is somewhat evidenced in his role of Seymour Parrish, found in the remarkable film, One Hour Photo. For, unlike Mr. Winters, herein we see Robin Williams demonstrate a dramatic genius in parallel with that of the comedic, and a possible saving grace of sensible balance. As a fan of both, this reviewer certainly hopes so. Obsession represents itself always as bizarre; we are even advised to grave concerns when we see almost any manifestation of it for it is indeed tied to many sinister and criminal acts. Seldom do we ever get a chance to look closer, to see the more forgivable of its possible origins. One Hour Photo superbly takes advantage of this...in many ways, especially as its dramatic core builds to crescendo and to dramatic denouement, again, superbly. More and more we wonder if this was designed around the role expressly meant for Mr. Williams to play, a real feather in the cap of casting excellence. Lovely Connie Nielson performs beautifully as Nina Yorkin, a wife and mother just finding out why her self-indulgent husband is becoming more and more neglectful. The "second" woman, (Erin Daniels) coming to the same photo mat for her picture development is the one and only stretch the script makes but one allowable. The viewer is not effected by any unrealistic sense of contrivance. Viewers will presume the worst, prepare for the worst, while the unexpected ending becomes the most remarkable aspect of all. And the most heartfelt. All in all, an incredible movie that I feel certain will justify viewers' attention...and then some.Bravo for the writer/director, Mr. Mark Romanek and his casting staff.JCH</fullReview>

Great Acting here!As Sy Parrish, Williams is totally believable, as he goes through a totally locked on (psycho) obsession with the Yorkins.There is a struggle; however, in the story that is strange? His reaction to what he finds out is totally off the wall. We don't know why he does the things he does? There is no reason for his strange behavior. Some brief flashbacks would have been the answer to this, not many--just a few, would have given this movie an added touch of fear and depth. The audience is left to decide this.I do; however, believe Robin Williams has found his best place in films, that of being the scary guy.I really hope you will do more worthwhile roles like this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This may make you think twice about having the local place process your photos. This was neither something I had huge expectations for nor figured would turn out a major let-down. Just know that what I write in this review is not out of bitterness. With that said, this isn't a downright poor film. The big complaint I have about it is that, for the entire duration, from beginning to end... *nothing*, and I am not using hyperbole, not anything whatsoever, actually happens. The plot is fine, and save for one line obviously done to deliver exposition early on(apart from which, there are only a few problems with the dialog), it's told decently. The pacing is OK. Acting is good, though I've seen both Vartan and Williams do better elsewhere. The latter's character is fairly well-written, if there could have been considerably more on-screen development(and he's the one who was most fleshed out). I don't know exactly what the ending is supposed to be. Cinematography and editing are well-done. Romanek has evidently barely directed movies apart from this. I won't go out of my way to watch his other work, but I won't actively avoid it, either. I'm not making it my life's mission to view this again, but I won't have a problem with doing so. There is a little blood, some disturbing material, some graphic sexuality/nudity and the language isn't exactly restrained(I'm referring more to how strong it can be than its quantity). I recommend this to fans of Mark Romanek, thrillers and/or the other people who worked on this. 7/10</fullReview>

Robin Williams can make you feel sorry and empathy for this man who is obviously desperate for a family of his own or something to connect with in life.

		<shortDescription>Developing an obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Romanek's debut film, One Hour Photo, is a gutsy and gripping psychological thriller. The narrative follows a Photographic Lab Technician, Seymour (Sy) Parrish played by Robin Williams, who is a lonely, sad, creepy character living his life through other peoples photographs. He develops a dangerous obsession with a particular young family whose photographs he has processed over the years. Through his work he accidentally uncovers a less than ideal family situation, which he seeks to rectify.This film takes place in flashback. Voiceovers are used to drive the narrative and to heighten suspense by unnerving the audience. These are often Sy's voice-overs relating his personal knowledge on photography and applying his photographic insight to the narrative. For example in one scene Sy explains that a huntsman once noted that all the kills he had made on a particular day were hurried shots taken without deliberate aim, defining this way of hunting to the photographic term "snapshot". This voice-over reinforces the unhealthy relationship Sy has with photography by making the connection between photography and hunting.The protagonist of the film One Hour Photo Sy Parrish is reminiscent of Norman Bates the protagonist of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960's film Psycho. Both protagonists appear innocently genuine, however they both have unhealthy obsessions. Norman Bates with his mother and Sy with the Yorkin family.The theme of One Hour Photo is voyeurism with Sy Parrish's invasion of people's privacy through viewing their photographs.Another form of visual art that is used to build up suspense in One Hour Photo is the television. An example of this is when Sy is watching an episode of The Simpsons where Homer tells Bart that the person who wants to harm him is probably the person he least expects. This gives the audience an insight into Sy's obsessive and potentially dangerous personality. Another example is when Sy is watching the film The Day the Earth Stood Still, the voice that can be heard is of an alien who explains to the people of the Earth that if they extend their violence to the outside world there will be consequences. This is an effective forecasting devise which gives the audience further insight into Sy Parrish's avenging character.The re-occurring motif throughout the film is photography. The shot composition is carefully chosen by Jeff Cronenweth to symbolise photographs. A good example of this is at the end of the film Sy is sitting in a room seen through a window, the image bordered by the window frame taking the appearance of a photograph. Another scene that visually reinforces the connection between photography and the theme of this film, is where Sy is looking down at a blank sheet of photographic paper, which in my opinion symbolises the emptiness of his life.In creating the creepy character of Sy Parish Robin Williams has once again truly cements his outstanding acting ability.One Hour Photo is a promising debut from Mark Romanek and I look forward to his future projects.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My teen age son was suspicious about going to see some weird indie sh*t?" but the theater was packed for the "One-Hour Photo" matinée. However, it was completely inappropriate that one mother brought pre-teen kids -- the R rating is serious -- and I said so loud enough for her to hear unfortunately.I loved the movie from the opening credits. The use of tense, mood-building electronica music (by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek -- though I'm not sure they wrote the bulk of the pieces we hear) and mise en scene showed that writer/director Mark Romanek has watched a lot of Hitchcock and has figured out how to update his lessons.Like Hitchcock, he picks an innocuous, should-be-safe environment -- a suburban K-Mart type store (similar to but way more sterile than the one in The Good Girl. He tells us right away that something disturbing has happened, so the rest of the movie is a flashback, establishing the uneasiness right away and doesn't let it up for a minute.A particular strength is how key plot elements are shown to us not directly but by characters' reactions to them, and that the implied violence is understood in our heads more than it's shown on the screens.We've seen all the actors elsewhere, to lull our comfort level with them, even the bit players are character actors from TV (such as "E.R." and "Alias").And of course we've seen plenty of Robin Williams. But even as a villain earlier this year in "Insomnia (U.S.)" he wasn't as chilling as this. When he chuckles dryly that a customer shouldn't switch to a digital camera "Because then I'll be out of a job." you could feel the entire audience mentally meaning to immediately go out to buy one.While the story-telling is mostly straight-forward from that flashback, it reminded me a lot of Memento, from the use of the power of visual images in photographs to the total control the director has over the spooky and suspenseful environment. And us.What's around us every day can be very scary. (originally written 9/2/2002)</fullReview>

He starts to convince himself they are perfect setting up a series of stalking, intruding, stealing and assault while losing his sensible mind all for this.I recommend this movie for the performances and storyline. Although it won't keep you on the edge of your seat and you won't go messing your pants from absolute terror. It will turn a boring day meaningful for a couple of hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate "creep me out" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had an inkling that Robin Williams could do this sort of thing, but how well he did it! This is the movie that, for the rest of my life, I will never be able to watch again. Growing up with Robin (I was 7 or 8 when Mork &amp; Mindy first aired), I knew the funny, tender, pleasant, hysterically hilarious sides of one of my Hollywood faves quite well. I was completely unprepared for the darker side of him. It blindsided me, yet held me captive, until the terrifying conclusion.On a technical note, the director chose to use a weird kind of filter that, combined with Robin's blond "do" for this film, created an eerie tone to the film that wouldn't have been present with out it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Effective and extremely good acting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of this years great surprises was 'One Hour Photo'. A combination of beautiful acting by every single person to detail the disturbing story of a guy who processes photographic images for a family. You are told through the eyes of Sy, who takes extra caution in developing pictures for a family he has admired for years, the 'Yorkins'.A disturbing story that trancends into a moral plot within the final stages. The directing was very very impressive and the plot change was very good, but it did not seem dramatic enough to intitle it as a thriller. Everyone at first has a notion of a troubled guy who wants to harm the family but as it progresses you see a totally different side to 'Photo Guy' Sy.This movie is definitely worth a viewing, Robin Williams acting is incredible with the moral story within being an important lesson that we all usually, at some point in our lives take for granted.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I have to say that this movie was exceptional. Not only the visual aspect (not that it could hold a light to LOTR), but the acting was very intensive. The boy who played Jake Yorkin (the son) was...believable, which might sound sarcastic, but in reality he did well compared to all the untalented little stars and starlets out there. I haven't seen much of Michael Vartan, but I had no qualms about his performance here. He conveyed sleazy cheating husband who pretends to care about his wife and family very well in this movie. We get to Connie Nielson: at first I didn't know it was her! Perhaps it was the odd and modern hair styles that I'm not used to seeing her with. She pulled them off nonetheless. She has always been okay whenever I've seen her work, nothing overly impressive (not that I could do much better), but always interesting. Same applies here. Now we get to the GEM! Now, Robin Williams has always in my opinion, been an exquisite actor. We saw early on that we was funny...than hilarious. After time he became one of the funniest men in existence, being able to pour out comedy as a fountain does water. Moreover, it's often improvised. We saw in a few movies that he was also able to play a dramatic part, not only the goof ball funnies. Here he takes the cake...then eats it...after photographing it and placing stills on his wall to remind him of the cake he enjoyed. I've seen first hand when an actor "becomes" a part. Robin has convinced me that he has talent beyond many of today's stars...and beyond comedy. He became Sy with such commitment, that it was frightening. There was no doubt that Robin was a good actor, but with this porteyal, we see that his is one of a kind. Not everyone could pull off the subtleties that he does, from the stillness and quietness, to the enraged and semi-focused. Whoever said it wasn't kidding: an excellent character study! Congrats!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taut thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last couple of years Robin Williams has re-invented himself ? Goodbye Patch Adams, hello Norman Bates. The frenetic comedian seems to have shifted 180 degrees away from the heroic nice-guy roles he became mired in and is now determined to scare us, or at least make us uncomfortable. In Death to Smoochy he was a foul mouthed lunatic bent on revenge. After that he played Walter Finch, a brutal killer and blackmailer in Insomnia. One Hour Photo sees Williams in his most introspective role yet, an obsessed photo-mart clerk on the verge of madness. Who knew Mork could be this creepy? As Sy Parrish, Williams lets go of his usual arsenal of acting tricks, and develops a powerful performance by internalizing the character's pain. Parrish is very still, like a pot of cold water on the heat waiting to boil. Dressed head to toe in beige ? even his hair is blonde ? Parrish's world is stark, boring. He knows he has no life, and has invented an intense imaginary relationship to the Yorkin family, based on the photos of theirs he develops. When he discovers that Mr. Yorkin is cheating on his wife, he springs into action. One Hour Photo is a taut thriller that will take you down unexpected paths.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark side of Mrs Doubtfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour PhotoSeymour (call me Cy) Parish, single, middle aged and rather dapper, manages the PhotoLab service in a Shopping Mall somewhere in suburban America. He enjoys his work. He has no family and lives alone in an apartment on the other side of town. Family life is something which seems to have passed him by much to his great disappointment. He manages however to derive a certain surrogate sense of kinship with his customers through the family snapshots they leave in his care. His craving for intimacy carries him, little by little, into some uncomfortable behavioural territory. We already know from the montage of photos which lines an entire wall of his apartment that he long ago crossed the line between platonic interest and obsessive longing. His sad fantasies of a benign Uncle Cy warmly ensconced in the bosom of his chosen family-of-the-month (year?) tell us that this story is certain to end in tears. One day in the lab he is shocked to discover photo evidence of an assignation between two of his customers. One of them is a married man, a husband, a father, a man recklessly putting at risk the security of his marriage and the integrity of his family for the sake of a cheap sexual fling. Cy is mad. As always it's the children who are the first victims of parents who put their base sexual desires ahead of their responsibilities as carers. Cy ought to know. He decides to punish the offenders.This movie is no match for Sidney Lumet's bleakly masterful The Pawnbroker (1964) but I found myself frequently drawing comparisons. The main characters in both are deeply scarred by a painful past but that's where the resemblance ends. Or is it? Rod Steiger's Sol Nazerman is tormented by recurring flashbacks of Nazi Germany; Robin Williams' Cy Parish has effectively excised memories of his abusive childhood and is living in a world decorated by smiling snapshots where everyone, including himself, is happily suspended in aspic. Nazerman is emotionally anaesthetised to the point where he feels neither pain nor compassion while Parish engages amicably with the people in his world if not the world itself. The brutal backdrop of Nazerman's impoverished New York neighbourhood serves as a reminder that he has fled one hellish reality only to arrive in another. Parish's world is a still-life Twilight Zone where fantasy is slowly getting the better of reality - or is it the other way around? In the time honoured Hollywood tradition, both men find redemption of sorts in a messy catharsis.Here at last is a film where Robin Williams is relieved of all comedic duties. His demonstrated ability to deliver an emotionally powerful performance without uttering a single word seems to be lost on Director Mark Romanek. What a waste. Parish finally confronts/confesses to the grim realities of his ruined childhood in a scene I found clumsy and unnecessary - screenplay comes also courtesy of Romanek. Visually, he could have made far better use of the Shopping Mall as a cavernous, sterile, alienating and vaguely sinister reflection of Parish's own empty life. This one alas, will go to the great graveyard of might-have-beens. But it's a workmanlike film which, as an average psychodrama is otherwise right on the money. Perfect for a rainy Saturday Night. Why not get out The Pawnbroker as well?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of 2002's most overlooked films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got around to renting this DVD. It was worth the wait. The film at first seems to be a "Psycho" remake, but Robin Williams and the director Mark Romanek have crafted a truly beautiful parable of our isolated modern age. "Sy" (Seymour- SEE MORE?) is the anti-hero in this film. Perhaps hero is too strong a term, but in a world of directionless yuppie drones who choose to ignore life, he becomes a sort of existential man of action. Is he creepy and disturbed? Yes. But so are all of the blandly "normal" characters in the film. ( The young son is an exception to this rule). Most of the TV clips you may have seen really don't reveal the depth of characterization Williiams and Romanek give to Sy. In less capable hands this could have been a horrible film, but all of the characters seem all too human, and well drawn. As a former One Hour Photo employee myself, I can say that they got the working environment 100% on target. There is some very subtle and clever cinematography. Watch for how the tone of color changes to set the mood, to warm yellows when Sy interacts with people, and cold blue-white when he is alone. Even though this is a cinema buff's film, the plot turns and suspense are top notch and will keep you watching until the end; it will also keep you thinking for a good while afterwards.</fullReview>

My roommate looked me straight in to my eyes and said, "if you EVER bring home pictures of people I don't know, you are out of here!" This movie is good for the fact that it is so real. It isn't one of those movies you would say "aw, that would never happen in real life." THIS ONE IS. Robin Williams was Outstanding! Great choice of character and wonderful producing.

		<fullReview>This is, I believe, an underrated film. Robin Williams gives a stellar performance as an unlikely stalker. He works in a photo processing lab and has developed family photos for some families for several years. He lives alone and has a lonely existence. One of the families that he's served all these years seems so happy and close. He finds that he longs to be part of this seemingly idyllic family and he "adopts" them in his fantasies. He knows a lot about them, where they've been for vacations, who had piano recitals, etc., simply from their photographs. When he discovers that "his" family has a dark secret, he goes bonkers. There's no real action, per se, but a decent amount of suspense towards the end, which contains a bit of a surprise. All in all, this is a very well-scripted and executed film. I think it's well worth a rent!</fullReview>

The direction and cinematography are far, far, far too repetitive to have any real impact on the viewer after the first 5 minutes. The music is intrusive and often annoying. The total lack of a story would be forgivable if the film had some mood or suspense to it but it doesn't. You know 99% of the story after only 2 short scenes and it's not worth the wait for the last 1%.

		<fullReview>I have been a Robin Williams fan since his performance in Mrs. Doubtfire. After that, I have cherished films like Hook, Jumanji, and Patch Adams. There's no denying that Robin Williams is an incredible actor, and he brought life to One Hour Photo.One Hour Photo had a decent story about an old man obsessed with a family. He knows everything about them because of the pictures they bring in. It is an interesting story. Nothing that can win it an oscar for best picture of the year, but it's good nonetheless.Robin Williams shone through in this movie. A film critic (I forgot who) called this movie Robin Williams' finest hour. This may be true. Robin Williams didn't need to prove to us that he is a great actor, but he proved it to us anyway. Even though he was the antagonist, you feel some sort of pity for him, and even want him to succeed. The movie was actually really good, overall. It's not an epic movie, and it doesn't meet the overall greatness of Silence of the Lambs, but it's worth spending 8 dollars to sit down and watch. It's a very entertaining movie, so I give it an 8/10. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Hour Photo highlights Robin Williams in what is certainly one of the most demanding and chilling roles of his career, and he delivers on every level. Williams plays Seymour, a lonley film developer at a convenience store one hour photo center, who develops a truly unique relationship with some of his customers. In an effort to escape the void in his life, Seymour "adopts" these individuals and engrosses himself in their life through the pictures they bring in. Williams does an outstanding job in this role by playing a character that you can certainly sympathize with to a point, but whose obsession takes him to edges of sanity and beyond.This is the first film I have seen by director Mark Romanek, however he creates the perfect atmosphere through the eerie lighting in Seymour's home, and the occasional peek into his demented thoughts. Needless to say I will certainly be looking forward to Romanek's next film. To avoid giving away too much of the film, I will not disclose any details about the climax, or the surprise ending; however I tell you that this movie will not leave you disappointed</fullReview>

I left thinking I must have watched a different movie.It was not scary, creepy, or interesting. There was not one character I found appealing in this movie (well, I did like the assistant at the photo mart but that doesn't count). I like to identify with at least one person in a movie, even if it's the bad guy, and nothing helped me do that in this movie. Every character was one-dimensional, which may have been what the director was going for, but it certainly didn't work for me. There were way too many shots of Robin Williams' character looking blankly into space. And who was supposed to have been in the room and taken the pictures of the husband anyway?If you want to see Robin Williams in a REALLY good movie, go see Insomnia.

Along with INSOMNIA earlier this year he seems to becoming quite adept at playing the deranged.Have you ever thought about the guy behind the photo counter? The one who takes your weekend film and turns it into snapshots? Did you ever consider who might be looking at those naked shots of your wife or girlfriend, you know what I mean, those last two shots you snapped of her?just to finish off the roll for developing? Well, after seeing ONE-HOUR PHOTO you'll never look at Cy the Photo Guy quite the same way again.The performances in ONE-HOUR PHOTO from Williams on down are flawless.

		<shortDescription>Great film - for some</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie that everyone will enjoy, but I think most people will like it if they don't have the wrong expectations. This is not an ACTION film!!!! There is very little 'action' in the literal sense and you should not go into the theatre expecting it, or you will be disappointed. Many people complain that the film doesn't have as much action or violence as they expected, when the problem was that they were expecting any at all. I would even go so far as to object to the 'thriller' label... much of the movie is not 'thrilling' but rather suspenseful and sad.There are 3 emotions on prominent display here, and Williams portrays them both very well: loneliness, sadness and anger. Throughout the course of the movie we watch Sy progress through these three states, and it is such a natural progression that it alone is what makes the film stand out. Williams does an EXCEPTIONAL job in this role, which is fortunate because he gets most of the screen time. People who didn't like his performance I think misread the role. He does not (nor is he supposed to) have a crazy serial killer personality. He is a repressed man - that is the reason for his sometimes stifled actions and emotions. I could picture myself in his shoes easily, and I didn't find myself yelling 'No don't do that you idiot!' at the screen as I am often known to do. Audience members are able to closely identify with his emotions and that is what creates the suspense - because you know what you might think of doing if you were him - and these possibilities are unpleasant. When you see Sy begin to act these things out it is really uncomfortable.A few more brief things I should mention.. the ending is NOT anti-climatic, when you consider the rest of the film and the character. The photography is quite good (no pun intended), and the music fits very well (sorry, didn't see the similarity to American Beauty...). As long as you dont have a short attention span and are not expecting the wrong things I think you will greatly enjoy this film. I give it a strong recommendation. Grade: A</fullReview>

Robin Williams is notable for his restraint in this film and has not gotten enough credit from those who can't accept him as anything but a manic comedian.Also notable, the director shows his music video background with sophisticated production design. Pay attention to the shelves in the store, they are a design feat. I recommend this movie to people who would like to see an unusual psychological drama with the patience for a slower pace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie proved to be a vision for the eyes. It is very visual in how colors represent ideas. Robin Williams also was wonderful. When you watch this movie, you forget it is Robin Williams... and that is proof of a great actor. I highly recommend this film. It is a great art flick with a really strong and interesting plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent! Academy Award for Robin Williams!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you don´t like Robin Williams, forget it. Go and see this film. He(or what we associate with "Robin Williams") disappears into the role of a sad and lonely "Nobody" and I think, this is Robin Williams at his best movie since years. You may be surprised to see him in such a dark film (it´s a very sad movie), but if you look more carefully at some other characters he played, you also will find lonely, isoated people who have one deep longing for : to give love and to receive love. Now we see a stalker, a voyeur who makes desperate efforts to get a little bit love and it ends with violence. Pefect performance, book and camera!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disturbing Masterpiece. The best Film since American Beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>wow I loved this film. This is the best film of the year. Robin Williams deserves an oscar for best actor.He plays Sy the photo guy.He develops photos at SavMart.He is very obsessed with the Yorkins who have been his best customers. He even considers himself as uncle Sy. Behind his sad, lonely face is an obsessed man. He is obsessed and wants to fitt in. He has no family and lives alone.His wall is a huge collage of customer photos which he made copies of for himself. One day he develops photos that disturb him.He sees that Will Yorkin is cheating on his wife with another lady.This is a very haunting, disturbing film. The score in the first half of the film along with William`s narraration is very reminiscent even maybe the same score from American Beauty and the last half hour the score is the same as Requiem for a Dream. Robin Williams no doubt shood win best actor oscar, this is his geratest performance to date.He reminded me of Anthony Perkins in Psycho because he seems like a nice lonely guy but looks can be deceiving. 4 stars out of 4 a must see. This is a very haunting and disturbing film.The best film since American Beauty.Robin William`s best performance to date</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is written and directed by Mark Romanek. It stars Robin Williams, Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Dylan Smith, Gary Cole and Eriq La Salle. Music is scored by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek and cinematography by Jeff Cronenweth.Sy Parrish (Williams) is a loner photo technician at SavMart's one hour photo shop who becomes obsessed with a family whose photographs he develops....No one takes a photograph of something they want to forget.2002 was a stellar year for Robin Williams, it saw him give two dramatically potent performances that dampen down the bile spewed up by those who haven't been able to forgive him his comedy excesses. Insomnia has (rightly) found a more appreciative audience since 2002 because of the rise of its director, one Christopher Nolan. One Hour Photo, though, still seems to be striving for recognition for its qualities, in fact, for its understated qualities.It's evident now that many have gone into the film expecting some psycho stalker movie, and subsequently have been disappointed to find One Hour Photo is nothing of the sort. What unfolds is a sedately paced story of a fractured mind, of a loner who is so detached from society he imagines himself being part of a family, by way of his job, that he thinks is perfect. When the family of his selection turns out to not be a bastion of Americana, the little thread in his head clinging to sanity finally breaks, and then......Here's the problem. This is no slasher, people need to understand that mental illness or isolation from society does not mean psycho death killer, and thus Romanek's film becomes an observational character study of someone detached from realism. Creepiness permeates the picture, big time, but you shouldn't be putting this in the horror genre. Romanek always holds the upper hand, structured as it is, we the audience find ourselves holding on to see just how far Sy Parrish went with his pursuit of family harmony? With that comes the question of if the finale delivers substance? Well that depends on if you want red blood histrionics or brainy grey area.There were cuts and studio interference, and in the finale an explanation for Parrish's mental issues reeks of a writer being "handed" a solution by the studio paying his bills. Yet this is mature pot-boiling stuff, a film that dares to simmer and not let the pot spill over for multiplex appeasement. While Williams is nothing short of terrific, an edgy and understated performance that only makes us lament that he didn't do more of these portrayals at his peak. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fascinating exploration of loneliness to insanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is one of the creepiest psycho-thrillers of the last few years, because of the way it gets under our skin, and almost turns us into a voyeur, like the central character Sy Parrish (Robin Williams in one of his finest film roles to date).Sy works at SavMart as a photo lab technician. We've all met these people behind a counter where we drop off film rolls to be developed. But I'd never really given much thought to the development process. One Hour Photo actually shows us how rolls of film are slowly developed into the finished product of a collection of photographs.If there is one thing that's important to Sy it's his customers. They entrust their rolls to him, he guards them copiously, and painstakingly crafts them as if they were works of art. But of all Sy's customers, the Yorkins are the most important to him. Will Yorkin, his wife Nina and their son Jake. Sy has been developing their pictures for seven years now. And he takes an active interest in their welfare.The Yorkin family life depicted in the photos is happy and eventful. They have a beautiful house. They are loving. They share everything. They are the happiest, most content family who ever lived. In print. But in reality, it is a very different story. Nina is a good parent to Jake, but Will is much more neglectful. And he doesn't show much affection to Nina either. Because he's secretly having an affair.Sy is blissfully unaware of this. Because he prefers to live within the fantasy of his photos. Not only does he develop the Yorkins pictures, he makes extra copies for himself. And places them on a wall in his drab apartment as a bizarre sort of shrine to the Yorkin family. They represent everything missing from Sy's life. Although Sy is a seemingly unassuming man who blends in with the crowd, he is a painfully lonely soul. He has no family. No friends. No joy. No life.Robin Williams gives a powerhouse performance. playing a man forced to live with his own loneliness. Mark Romanek's direction is top notch and lends the film a sharp edge. The cinematography is gorgeous and surrealistic. There doesn't seem to be a frame wasted. And most importantly, the hues of browns and gold almost make some of the shots actually seem like real captured images. It only strengthens the point being put across how life can be captured in a photograph, and be made to seem more happier than it really is.Romanek keeps things moving at a brisk pace, giving us ample time to explore Sy's psyche while also furthering the plot. Williams gives a deeply affecting as well as moving performance of a tortured man and his inner demons. Scenes of Sy at SavMart drenched in dazzlingly white colours and neatly stacked shelves is Sy's personal heaven, and are then juxtaposed with Sy's miserable existence at home with drab colours and a lifeless atmosphere of melancholy that hangs over him.I think with One Hour Photo Robin Williams has finally put to rest some of his disastrous film choices of late. Here he is completely believable as not an evil man, just a lonely one pushed to the breaking point. His turns of character are always plausible because of the steady direction. From Sy's amusing dedication to his job, to being irked when people fail to show him the respect he feels he deserves, his anger at being fired, to his raging psychosis at the climax.There is always an ominous feeling hanging over the film. We know something bad is going to happen. But Romanek restrains himself and never goes for the easy payoff. He allows events to unfold at a leisurely pace, with a remaining residue of uncertainty forever lingering. Watch the scene when Sy has just been let go. As he's walking through the aisles, you'll notice the numbers that mark them off. And Sy's face gradually becoming more unrestrained with the passing of each number. His volatile nature is always there just waiting to explode. It is this type of subtlety that allows OHP to shrug off the others of its kind.Connie Nielson gives a good performance as Nina. She's most effective in her scenes with Sy and his clumsy attempts to make conversation with her. But this is Williams' show all the way. He is in command of every scene. Showing remarkable restraint for the most part, and when he does indulge his wild side, it is entirely in character. The funny man has changed his act.Romanek also provides some deeply creepy images. The shrine sticks firmly in my mind. As well as Sy's supremely eerie dream. Sy's voyeuristic impulses taking over when he discovers the Yorkin family life is less than perfect. There is so much communicated in a tiny shrug. Or a significant pause. Romanek knows the value of subtlety. And that is the mark of a good director. I look forward to his next film.I was a little surprised by the ending, because it wasn't quite what I was expecting. But it was still satisfying in an odd way. There are people who may feel disappointed. But I felt OHP ended with a bang.There are lots of nice touches throughout. Especially Sy's narration that easily allows us to sympathise with him and his situation. One Hour Photo is a marvellous story of one man's mental meltdown, and the tragedy is, how it largely goes unnoticed by the everyday world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Picture's Worth A Thousand Hours in Therapy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meet Sy Parrish, kindly, mind-mannered. He works at the photo lab in the SavMart discount store. He takes great pride in his work and strives to develop the best picture possible. He was the kind of guy you could trust with your pictures...Or was he? He always treated the customers with great respect. One particular family he took a shine to was the Yorkins. Nina Yorkin and her 9-year-old son Jake came in to have their film developed quite often. Sy has been developing their film since Jake was a baby. Nina and Jake were real nice, but Nina's husband, Will Yorkin, was a selfish bum. When work was through for the day, Sy went home to his empty apartment, for you see Sy was friendly on the outside, but inside he was very lonely and depressed. His only hobby was photographs. What nobody knew was that whenever Sy developed the Yorkins' pictures, he'd always keep an extra set of prints for himself, and now one entire wall of his apartment was covered in the Yorkins' photographs right up to the day Jake was born. It's not just a hobby. It's obsession; The next day, Sy clashes with the photo lab technician because he felt he did a shoddy job repairing the equipment. The technician cursed him out then left and Sy stood, shouting at him. Later, Sy's boss, Bill Owens, chided him for it. Bill's a real jerk. After work, Sy drove by the Yorkins' house and imagined what it would be like to stroll around the interior. So he imagined himself touring the house, watching the ball game on their plasma screen, drinking their beer, and even having Jake call him "Uncle Sy". But it was only a fantasy. Sy continued to act like he was part of the Yorkin family. He watched Jake's soccer game and ran into Nina at the mall and had lunch with her. It seemed the two of them had a lot in common. But it wasn't long before Bill Owens discovered what Sy was doing behind the scenes and there were hundreds of unaccounted for prints from the machines, so he abruptly fired Sy, who was simply devastated. He was allowed to finish out the week, then that was it; That night he was reviewing pictures dropped off by a Maya Burson. Suddenly he came across a photo of her making out with Will Yorkin! He was cheating on Nina! Sy was torn up inside. He felt as if it were he who was being cheated on. He then pulled the old switcheroo and hid the photo in the prints dropped off by Nina. He expected Nina to find the photo, and have a fight with Will and break up with him. Sy followed Nina home that night to make sure that happened. It didn't. Sy was disappointed. Nina had long suspected her husband of having an affair, and this picture was proof positive; Next, Sy stopped at the Owens' house and took a whole roll of film worth of pictures of Bill's daughter (one snapshot per second) to intimidate Bill, then to even further intimidate him, he dropped the photos off at SavMart. Bill angrily tried to bar him, but it did no good. Next, Sy follows Will and Maya to a fancy hotel.When the pictures are brought to Bill's attention by fellow photo lab employee, Yoshi Araki, Bill was more than intimidated: he was livid. He called in the feds. Detectives Van Der Zee and Outerbridge were now on the scene. They put an ABP out on Sy, while the police who search his apartment find Sy's wall covered in photographs of the Yorkins, only on every single photograph, Will's face had been etched out; At the hotel, Sy disguises himself as the room service bellboy and breaks into Will and Maya's room. He then whips out a hunting knife he had stolen from SavMart and forced them to get into perverted sexual poses as he took their picture! After that, Sy went back to his room. Just then, the detectives were closing in on Sy, but Sy was sly! He made a break for it, leaving the knife and camera in the hotel. He ran out the parking garage, thinking he was in the clear--when suddenly he was ambushed by the police. Sy was incarcerated while his pictures were collected as evidence. Detective Van Der Zee wanted to know why Sy did everything he did, and well, Sy just innocently took pictures. Pictures tell more than words. Sy had considered himself a member of the Yorkin family, and what Will did drove him further over the edge. He tried to break up Will and Maya and bring him closer to Nina. It didn't quite work that way. I guess the lesson to be learned here from our story is: use a digital camera, or else the guy who develops YOUR pictures may just take a shine to YOU.Well, One Hour Photo. It's a very good movie. It's very well done, it really makes you think. It's a good psychological thriller. It plays with your mind. Robin Williams was GREAT as Sy Parrish. You know, he played another character named Parrish in Jumanji: Alan Parrish; Also here, Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Dylan Smith, and Gary Cole as that lousy Bill Owens; SavMart very closely resembles Wal-Mart, and you'll notice the colors most used in this movie are white and blue. Almost everything is white and blue. I guess that's because those are the colors of Sy's uniform. Sy is supposed to be looked upon as evil, but he's actually a good guy. Will and Bill are the bad guys. That's what makes this movie so good: you root for the bad guy. Anyway, if you haven't already seen it, check out One Hour Photo today! Mark Romanek and Robin Williams have definitely developed a classic here! See it today!!-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty believable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie both in theaters and on DVD, and I found it to be very entertaining both times. Not only does Robin Williams do a wonderful job at portraying the lovable, yet psychotic Sy Parrish, but he also makes the story so eerily believable that it is scary. The way in which Sy stalks the family throughout the film is downright disturbing, and something that you wouldn't expect from the cheerful clerk at the beginning of the film. All in all, I found this movie very interesting and I enjoyed it very much. Even when you find out what type of a sick freak Sy really is at the end of the film, you still feel sorry for him. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good thriller, or a movie in which Robin Williams strays from his comedic style. 10/10 for me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bit Too Creepy For A Second Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine Robin Williams as a psychopath, until you see him play one and realize that Robin can pretty much play any part he puts his mind to. "One Hour Photo" is the story of Sy Parrish (Williams) who works as a photo developer at a local superstore. His isolated life and abusive past stimulate him into forming relationships with his customers through the photos he develops. One family in particular he favors, having developed their photos for several years and seeing all of their memorable moments (wedding, birth of their son, etc.). Williams begins a fantasy relationship with this family and imagines himself as "Uncle Sy". The desperate desire for Sy to have a normal social environment with love and support is terrifically supported and conveyed through his deluded idea of what each photo represents. When Sy realizes that the perfect family in the photos is anything but, he goes further awry.Williams does such a good job and director Mark Romanek superbly unveils how ordinary-looking, everyday people in our lives could be otherwise and an unsuspecting threat. The film had such a creepy feel afterwards and felt possible too true, that I don't think I could muster a second viewing. They should make college psych. majors watch this one! 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With all the good reviews I had seen (and the great score on imdb) I was really looking forward to this film.But what I actually got was an unbelievably weak plot where nothing rang true. For example, the photos of a couple having an extra-marital affair - you've got to wonder who was taking these photos. The strop the wife throws near the beginning at her husband also felt like it came from out of nowhere and seemed crass, at best.Robin Williams was fine in the lead role, but other than that I can't think of anything else positive to say about this film. It never for a second became intriguing or even believable. For a TV movie with average reviews this would have been fine.I'll give it 4/10, but that's based on Robin Williams' performance and the fact that I managed to remain awake throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This "psychological thriller" could have been much better but it lacked a victim we could like and a bad guy we could hate. I guess the ordinariness was intentional but it bore no resemblance to the real world. There was no grime and the cops were kind and considerate. A threat squad? Give me a break! Then there was Robin Williams' performance. It was so cold and creepy I couldn't help but wonder if he had confused his character in Insomnia with this one. Worse was that this performance was just as wooden. But then, this production was wooden and bland as it plodded along its carefully measured path -- weird, bleeding eyeball scene excepted -- to its flat conclusion. As for the self-righteousness moralising? I just wanted to puke -- I wanted a thriller and got heavy-handed propaganda instead. In all, it was a very disappointing 96 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is the best movie I have ever seen. There's no way to describe it--the only thing I can say is that it is the story I've been trying to write for the past two years...maybe not in storyline, but in general feel, photography, and dark, yet whimsically sarcastic and unknowingly-insane narration.The way that Sy narrates, in a way that he thinks he is normal and stable, is amazing--I love films that play on that (like A Clockwork Orange and Flowers for Algernon, although the latter is an innocent form of mental instability)But the way that Mark Romanek portrays the fine line between good and evil is what really makes the movie sing. Although Sy is the good guy in it all, he still holds an immensely creepy and Norman Bates-esque air about him and his actions. The concept of voyeurism and how far it can go is contrasted perfectly with the juxtaposed notion of being the protagonistic hero who does the right thing--but which one has a greater weight in the scheme of morality?god bless movies that have double meanings!And the photography is simply stunning in approach, as well--such as the slightly off centering of some scenes and the subtle yet noticeable change in camera color filters which correspond to the colors used in the color photography process.just see it, that's all...just go and rent it, buy it, whatever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film worthy to be mentioned with Hitchcock's greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film Hitchcock would have been proud to call his own.One user commented that this film was "so-so" due to the fact that the Yorkins weren't given much depth. Well, this film isn't about the Yorkins. It's how one troubled man sees the Yorkins and how he sees himself with them.The scariest part about this movie, is that we all know someone like Sy. We've met someone at the photo lab or laundromat like Sy. Hitchcock took ordinary people and the circumstances they live in and made them suspenseful. Mark Romanek has done the same and met the bar Hitchcock set.Williams deserves an Oscar for this film, but we already know he won't get it. The powers that be and their politics have already determined that Williams has won his one Oscar and that's all he's entilted to because "he's not really an actor." Romanek at least deserved a screenplay nomination, but damn it, all the man has done is music videos so there is no way in hell we'd give him a nod on his first try.Kudos to Jeff Cronenweth. His cinematography was beautiful, but alas, he won't get the nod for the same reasons as Romanek.As a side note, Romanek obviously spent some time in a Wal-Mart, or knew someone who did. As a former employee (God help me) I could only laugh during the break scenes at work and those wonderful SavMart smocks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first time I have been able to use the 3B review. Then again it is the first time those words seemed to define a picture so perfectly.Ok first remark to the person who thought this film was dull. I think the film makers owe you an apology for not casting Vin Diesel and Ja Rule in this film. Also I understand that the lack of a hip hop sound track threw you for a loop. Those damned film makers. Don't they know real cinema? Don't they know a film needs T n A and a large, steroid injected bald headed one line actor to entertain the masses? LOL!I usually respect anyone and everyone's opinion. I hate using cliche come backs in defending a film such as "You just didn't get it". This time along with the three Bs I can use that cliche comeback with pride. "If you did not like this film. Then you just did not get it." Either that or you have lost the humanity within you. You probably prefer dung to urine and probably prefer cheerleaders to poets.I know that nobody will get the same meaning fom the film, but everyone should get basically the same overall picture. This film goes into an often untackled issue uncompromisingly. That issue is that there are those who deserve the cake and get the dung. There are some who get the cake who want the other cake, and then the other cake, followed by extra cherries. While some may think that Sy is actually insane. I think this film portrays him as a loner who has lived such a torturess life that he finds other people's hapiness, in order to hold on to the idea that hapiness exists. The real shock was that he did not commit a single horrific crime. He really did not even invade the people's privacy, he just kept a record of what he already saw. I think this film goes deeper than what I got from it, but the basic point of the film is that we should never take the moments of hapiness for granted. We should strive to live life they way it looks in our family photos and not the way it looks compared to the movies. This is a great lesson for the "I can't be with you I have to find myself" generation that sucks the marrow out of originality by using overplayed romance from irritating and unrealistic Romantic scenes on film and television. Not to mention self proclaimed gurus like Dr. Phil and Oprah Winfrey. That is why this film will be over most people's heads. If you want to watch a smart film get your rear out of Dawson's Creek.One more point to mention. I typically do not admire bleeding heart films such as "One Hour Photo". So just to knock down some arguments you may throw my way. It was a registered Republican who admired the liberal message of this film. So don't go there my fellow Republicans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams in a Fine Artistic Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a psychological thriller par excelance, brought to life by Robin Williams in one of his best roles. The film is gorgeously filmed and executed. In fact, the two big stars here are Robin Williams as "Sy" and Writer/Producer Mark Romanek, with Cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth winning "Best Supporting" role. The film looks and feels simple - deceptively so. The colors, visual and sound effects, and even some snippets of music are derivative of Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey". But Romanek quickly takes us from wariness over these parallels to a comfort zone of acceptance, as he unfolds the similarities between Kubrick's "HAL 900" computer and the Sy as played by Robin Williams. Sy, like HAL, is an intelligence so detached from the human race that he can not connect to others except through a third party communication medium - his pictures. Like HAL, Sy is excellent and precise at his job (photo developer), but becomes consumed by the perfectionism he perceives as required to fulfill his niche in life. Sy's progression towards insane actions accelerates when he is pushed over the edge by a trauma that threatens his world. He, like HAL, becomes completely immersed in his version of reality, to the extent that he no longer see nor understand the consequences of his increasingly radical actions as he focuses in on an isolated ideal that ultimately means the destruction of his carefully constructed immediately "family".Be sure to arrive in time to see the beginning of this movie in order to be properly set up for the progression of events, as the beginning and ending make a satisfyingly complete loop, perhaps leaving us with a little more compassion and understanding after having met Sy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Academy Voters, WAKE UP!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the five best actor nominees for the Best Actor Academy Awards, it's disgraceful that Robin Williams didn't head the list. Not one of the five even come close to Robin's superb portrayal of "Sy", with one exception, Adrein Brody. So often the award goes to the most sympathetic character and the voters give the nod to repay the character for his hardship or loss. At other times, the Oscar goes to the actor that shouts the loudest or displays a rage of anger (Denzel Washington in "Training Day"). It takes talent and training to maintain a low key performance for two hours and make it believable (Sean Penn in "I Am Sam", Russell Crowe in "A Beautiful Mind" and "The Insider". Robin Williams plays against type in "One Hour Photo" and presents the best suppressed creep since Anthony Perkins played Norman Bates, and yet it equals Sir Anthony Hopkins (the master of low key) Hannibal in "SOTL". "One Hour Photo" is only 90 minutes long...with no blood...no gore...no slashing...and yet it is one of the best thrillers of all time.'Tis a pity, Hollywood can't recognize acting when they see it. The writing, directing, editing, music, and above all the acting (including the supporting cast) all are top-notch. This was one of the best films of 2002!! The critics agreed! Too bad that they don't nominate for the Academy!!</fullReview>

It's not a Tarantino's movie where the characters speaks too much for expressing their inner feelings, in this movie the set speaks for the characters: Emblematic is the scene where Sy is lied down on the bed of the mall alone. He is Alone in a place full of people, how is it possible? It happens because malls are fake places where fake people smile everyday and fake mothers and fathers walk quietly thinking to be happy. Sy is a victim of a commercial society that privileges the image to the communication of the emotions. Sy is alone, he hasn't friends, parents or someone who loves him, he has been spending his time watching the life of the others in the pictures he prints. He is a shlemiel who desires to be happy and loved. His faith in the image pushes him to change its good-natured aspect in cynical but its weapon is not the gun but the camera. Only in this way he thinks to be able to convert the running values and to see recognized its human superiority on the others. But he has forgotten an important thing: In a fake society made by fake people where the simple and pure men are defeated even imagine can be fake!! He is only the reproduction of a fake reality and it is not enough to allow him to conquer the life of his dreams. He was a victim and now he is a monster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, Much has been made about the "excellence" of this film, and i have to say it's really pretty much unfounded. Yes, Robin is trying something new and doing it fairly well. Is it a good performance? YES. Is it a good movie? NO. Will he get an oscar nomination? NO.In it's defense the movie does avoid a lot of stalker movie cliches, but dodging the old and tired does not necessarily mean that it's good, since the filmmakers hardly give us anything to fill the void left by avoiding the cliches. The slow, unforced pacing of the movie is nice, and subtle, but it's a slow build to NOTHING. It contains one of the most compromised, lame, pointless, and tacked on endings I have EVER seen. The last five minutes destroy everything the movie was building toward. Not to mention the dreams, while very well filmed, and the scariest thing in the whole movie, have nothing to do with anything in the movie. they hold no symbolic meaning or foreshadowing or anything.Honestly, in a year of, thus far, awful movies, this is one of the worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I went to see this movie I really had no expectation. Some said it was boring, some said it lacks of action. I believe that a movie like this one does not need to be action packed. With something as simple as the life of a guy who works at Sav-Mart (a shop exactly like Wal-Mart), they created a thriller atmosphere. A maniac-compulsive man, a truly professional in both his job and hobby: photo. This movie proove that even the life of the quite everyday guy could do an incredible movie, wich of course have incredible actors.</fullReview>

I personally enjoyed the shots of Williams character in his apartment and everything is in its proper place which reflects the sterilized environment he lives in.

		<shortDescription>Williams is excellent...movie is so-so</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A photo-processing man Seymour "Sy" Parrish (Robin Williams), becomes obsessed with a seemingly perfect family--the Yorkins. He's developed their photos for years and thinks he knows all about them. When he notices something is wrong however, he goes out of his way to correct it.This is an OK movie with a great performance. The story is interesting, but we know next to nothing about the Yorkins--they're given very little depth. So when things go crazy at the end, you feel nothing. Also Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan come across with no personality--it's not their fault--the script is against them. Also the movie gets very unpleasant at the end.But it, more or less, works because of Willaims--he's just great as Sy...charming and creepy at the same time...he's just fantastic. Also the young son of the Yorkins played by Dylan Smith is very good...he acts just like a 9 year old should.So it's somewhat worth seeing but no great shakes--except for Williams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect example of why I truly love film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a review of the film, I just wanted to share a couple of thoughts with everyone. First off, you must see this film somehow. It doesn't matter how, just go out and see it somehow! I am simply blown away with it, from top to bottom. The look, the script, the dialogue, and above all else... ...the performance of one Robin Williams. Not only is he IN it, but he gives his best performance ever IMO. Add to that, the fact that he has some of my favorite lines in the entire history of film to work with, and we are really talking. Just hearing him explain and describe pictures, photography, etc... is awesome as hell. This is a total "must see", and for him to be deprived of any recognition of this role, and film as a whole, will truly be a misfortune.With a showing like this, it makes one wonder why in the hell he never started doing more "psycho" roles until here recently (with this film, and also the recent Insomnia). What Alfred Hitchcock did to the shower in terms of how movie viewers look upon it, Mark Romanek has done to one hour photo places, and clerks.At first thought, a film about a one hour photo place, and clerk could be nothing more than a boring mess. Not here however, it is clever, inventive, and damned chilling. As a matter of fact, this film has a few of the most disturbing scenes I have ever witnessed in the history of my watching film. In short, this is about a one hour photo guy, who obsesses over those individuals who go to him to have their film developed, and it goes from there. I can't truly say much more than that, as to not give away any of the plot. I will say this though... ...have you ever wondered "what if" that one hour photo guy made just one more extra set of your photos and kept them for himself? This film, well, it really makes you think, not only about one hour photo stations or clerks, but about photography, and more importantly, life, in a whole new way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BEST "ROBIN WILLIAMS FILM" EVER.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget your expectations. Robin is absolutely terrifying as the sad, damaged photo clerk trapped in retail psycho-hell. Calm and mild-mannered on the outside, he's a ticking time-bomb ready to explode. Gary Cole as his evil boss is a stroke of pure genius. (Think 'OFFICE SPACE'. Think Lumberg's angry brother.) This film is dark, haunting, and brutal - finally a worthy return to the harsh, lonely-man films of the 70's. I've heard the original workprint was better; more subtle and less-coddling (before the FOX execs butchered it) but this is still one effective and astonishing film you won't soon forget. Written and directed by the guy who did the "Closer" video for Nine Inch Nails -- 'nuff said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>boring, linear plot with inadequate climax and unsatisfying "twist"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this movie and simply wanted to comment on how boring and linear this narrative is. I don't know how many script edits this went through but it deserved a few more in my opinion. The so-called twist at the end of the film is unsatisfying as it fails to properly re-contextualise what has gone before; instead it merely throws in some back story that provides a deeper psychological motive for his actions. There is no gradual culmination of threat/suspense to engage the audience, rather the narrative progresses almost immediately from the inciting incident (protagonist loses his job) to his initial act of retribution (threatening photos of his bosses kid in the park) to his final act of "mania" in which he forces an errant father of a picture perfect American family to engage in a mildly degrading photo shoot (at knife-point) with his second, illegitimate lover. Then he is arrested and confesses to having been abused as a child. I felt this climax (the revenge photo shoot for the fathers infidelity, which we learn retrospectively to reflect his experiences as an abused child) should have been stronger. It wasn't dark or inventive enough to illicit any real emotional reaction - in me at least - and centres around the two characters who have been developed least (consequently, we care about them less). Nothing really culminates in this scene that has been adequately seeded earlier in the movie and fails to take one by surprise. We know he's gonna do something "dark" from the first act. When it finally happens it is over in minutes and fails to subvert any expectations the writer may have chosen to inculcate in his audience. Robin William's performance is alright - it ain't that demanding a role for the guy to be honest. I.e. it doesn't require anything from him as an actor that we haven't seen him do before. Over-all, its a bit of a plain Jane of a movie. zzzzzzzzzzz</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Majorly Overrated!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I want to start off by saying that I was looking forward to seeing this movie. It had all the elements of a great thriller. But that is not what I got to see. This movie was just awful!! Why it got good reviews and why people think so highly of it is beyond me!SPOILERS!!!!!! :The film tries to pass Williams off as a man obsessed with one particular family that has been getting their pictures developed by him for 9 years, ever since their kid was born. He works for the local Savesmart as the head of the photolab. However, all the movie does is go into the troubles within the family and show that Robin Williams has a crappy life. Williams is constantly shown saying high to the mother and boy when they come in, running into the mom at the mall, and watching the kid's soccer practice. Up until this point I was falling asleep. All of this that has nothing to do with any thing remotely thrilling lasts for the first hour. The only obsessive thing that they portrayed was a huge wall of every photo that the family has ever developed that Williams has in his apartment. Oh yeah, and when he is not playing Uncle Sy to the family that he likes so much, we get to hear all about how he makes photos, the size of the photos, what makes photos look professionally done and what looks amature.Then a woman comes into the Savesmart to get pictures developed. Williams thinks that he recognizes her but can't remember where he saw her from. After he gets off of work, he goes to his place and sees this woman's face in a picture dealing with the husband's work. The next day Williams is fired from his job, because of a massive amount of prints missing. Williams always makes an extra set of pictures for himself from every customer, and never marks it down or pays for it. After 11 years they finally find that out. You'd think that it would take them a lot less time to do so.The next night after he was fired, he goes to the Savesamrt after they are closed. Even though he was fired he still gets to keep his keys. He goes into the photolab, and looks into the woman's pictures. It turns out that the husband is cheating with this woman and there are revealing photos. He takes out the pictures of the husband and his mistress and puts them in with his wife's pictures. She finds out obviously, and then she does nothing and acts like she does not even care.For the last 30 minutes of the movie, Williams becomes obsessed on making the wife actually care that her husband cheated. So he tracks down the husband and his mistress at the hotel that they sneak off to. He makes them simulate a sex scene by knife point. He takes pictures of everything. Then he leaves the room while both the husband and mistress are fine. Then the cops manage to show up and arrest him.This takes us to the end of the movie. The movie starts out with Eric Lasalle holding Robin Williams in a holding cell and talking to him. He asks why he was so obsessed with the guy that he went after. He then throws a packet of pictures still in a manilla envelope on the table. That makes the audience wonder right off the bat, what could possibly be in there. Eric's character refers to the pictures as " evidence" that show Robin William's guilt. At the end of the movie, Williams asks if he can have his pictures back. LaSalle lets Williams have his pictures. Now we finally get to see what is in them, thinking that they are off the sex simulation. The pictures were off the hotel bathroom. The shower head, the shower curtain, a towel ,and a bar of soap. Very disappointing!!4/10 - I give it a 4 for a few funny scenes pulled off by Robin Williams.The worst movie that I have seen this year, and it is my nomination for worst movie of 2002!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one hour that's brilliant is enough to make the film an unqualified success</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers follow.The first half hour is the weakest. It seems to consist of little more than forced, awkward little conversations and encounters between Sy and members of the family he obsesses about, in which Sy is too familiar, too friendly, too knowing, and the family members don't quite pick up on this - although there's always the chance that Sy will go just a hair's breadth further, and they will. This is just painful to watch. Mark Romanek doesn't yet have the skill as a director to make any of his early scenes come to life, and apart from establishing the fact that Sy is not entirely right in the head, and doing so too obviously, he doesn't seem to know where he's going. (It must also be said that even throughout the excellent final hour Romanek's competent but sometimes ill-judged direction is the biggest enemy of Romanek's fist-rate script: I wish he had used music, if at all, as music, not as a cheap horror movie sound effect; that he'd kept the camera still while showing us Sy's collection of photos of the Yorkins, rather than zooming in on them; that he hadn't included a brief dream sequence straight out of "Hellraiser".) At the start of the film it's hard not to be disappointed. "One Hour Photo" has an inspired premise; it deserves inspired story-telling.Which it ends up getting. Romanek creates something far more interesting and affecting out of his premise than I'd dared hope. The moment that jolts the film from mediocrity to brilliance is the scene in which Bill, the Sav-Mart manager, calls Sy up to his office to fire him. We keenly feel what a terrible thing this must be for Sy. We'd already known that Bill was a prick. When there was an altercation between Sy and the machine repair guy Bill had coldly reprimanded Sy about starting fights in the store, without bothering to find out who started bellowing first (it was in fact the repair guy, not Sy), or what the dispute was about (it was about something important, and Sy was completely in the right). Bill attacks Sy and undermines what little power he has in the cruellest way he can. And the manner in which Sy gets fired is likewise cruel. A decent human being - and one doesn't get to be manager of a shopping complex by being a decent human being - would have at least given Sy a choice about whether to continue working for the rest of the week, or not (without, of course, making Sy's severance salary or back holiday pay dependent on how he chose). The conditions under which Sy is expected to come to work for the rest of the week are intolerable. Not that his work conditions had been tolerable beforehand: he'd been forced to wear humiliating clothes, all but coerced into providing a poor service (we admire him for resisting), not once been TREATED like a human being, and made to set up shop inside a shopping mall more hideous and dystopian than any I've seen in Australia - I suspect more hideous and dystopian than any existing in the USA, either, although in either case it's only a slight exaggeration of reality, and in years to come it may not be an exaggeration at all.From here on the film doesn't set a foot wrong - until, perhaps, the final moment. I think it was a mistake to have Sy tell the police (but mainly the audience) about his childhood, "explaining" his subsequent behaviour by letting us know he was abused as a child, all too neatly adding (one can imagine Sigmund Freud ticking off the one remaining item on his checklist) that his father used to take photos of him doing degrading things. I'm not saying the scene doesn't work. Robin Williams didn't need to deliver this speech at all, since already in this film he'd gained our sympathy far more than he ever had in the past - but it must be said he delivers his lines movingly. And it's good that the policeman questioning Sy was given the chance to behave in a civilised manner, and nice for a change, in an American film, to see such civilised behaviour, rather than the usual fascist brutality, held up as an ideal. But we already knew that SOMETHING about the first part of Sy's life had been unhappy. Best to leave it at that. We can speculate if we want to. Besides, Sy's unhappy early life, whatever form it may happen to take, is only part of the story. Just as important, if not more so, in understanding why he went over the edge are the years of slavery he spent at Sav-Mart.</fullReview>

The film has what could have been an excellent premise for a film, but fails to deliver any sort of drama or suspense. Robin Williams plays a delightful character who cracks after having what he would consider a horrible day. True to life, the character does what he think is justice without any "violence", which while this may be a great tribute to the common man reaction.

		<shortDescription>Edgy Thriller exploring the darker side of loneliness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) works in a photo finishing lab at Savmart. He has been an employee there for 11 years and knows many of his regular customers perhaps better than they know themselves. However, Sy becomes really obsessed with one family (The Yorkins) and has kept several of their photos from over the years at his house. Sy's obsession is fairly harmless at first, but his behaviour becomes more erratic after he is sacked from Savmart and after he discovers that Will Yorkin is having an affair with another woman.One Hour Photo is, much like the development of photographs, a rather slow process. It essentially introduces us to Parrish and slowly starts to establish his psychological mind- set. Parrish is a lonely person, a man who longs for family and friends which I feel is something that he believes many people take for granted (which is what part of the film is about). Parrish's job is perhaps the only thing that's keeping him going as I think that getting brief insights into people's lives is a way of taking his mind off his own lonely existence. This becomes evident when Parrish gets sacked which is ultimately what brings his darker side to the surface.Robin Williams is better known for his comedy roles, but it's worth noting that he is also very good in dramatic roles - he plays a creepy character in Christopher Nolan's Insomnia and is excellent in both films. Williams gives an edginess to his character that makes him fascinating to watch even when the pace lags a bit in the first half. This isn't the first time he's taken on a complex character and his versatility as an actor is something that he'll long be remembered for. The supporting cast were all OK, but it's definitely Robin Williams who makes this memorable.I'm sure that many people have come to their own conclusions on what was actually going on in this film; was it all fantasy? Was some of it real and some of it fantasy? I think it's safe to assume that at least some of it must have been in Parrish's head as it's revealed on at least one occasion that what we're seeing isn't actually real.No matter how you look at this film there's no denying that it is an interesting and somewhat disturbing look on the way loneliness can affect individuals in extreme cases. The picture has a simmering slow-burning tension to it and when Parrish catches up with the adulterous couple towards the end it's actually quite a chilling sight. Fans of psychological thrillers or character studies will almost certainly enjoy this film.</fullReview>

Sy knows all of his regular customers and memorises them by what photos they regularly come to get printed, But Sy has an unhealthy obsession with the Yorkin family.The Yorkin family is a happy family of three, mother Nina her partner Will and their young son Jakob. Mother and son have been using that lab for 7 years getting their prints to the point Jakob calls Sy 'Sy The Photo Guy' unknown to them over the years Sy has been printing off separate copies of the photos to put on his wall.Mid way through the movie we see the descent of Sy, from the helpful man to stalker, always seems to be there, reading the same books and has a fascination of being known as Uncle Sy and work his way in the family unit.After an incident at work Sy is fired, and realising he will never be in the family unit he starts to up the ante in being top stalker... After discovering Will's infidelities he goes all out in letting everyone know...If your after a thriller horror with loads of jump scares and gore this isn't for you, but its more for people who appreciate the classic thriller using great cinematography and intense atmosphere</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sympath for a obsessive psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a underrated psychological thriller about a one-hour photo lab worker named Sy that is obsessed with a family, that he develops photos for. Now what really drives this movie, is how it delves into Sy's mindset and what makes him tick. Now Robin Williams did a phenomenal job playing this character. He was believable as a psycho and yet still carried that teddy bear vibe, if that makes sense. Robin Williams played another role where he plays a psychopath during the same year, in the movie "Insomnia". But there is more sympathy for his character in this one, because despite it not really delving into his backstory. You as an audience member can sense where the character is coming from. Near the end, the plot seemed to drag slightly but that is only a small gripe. Besides that this is a existential and in-depth movie that deals with loneliness and memories. How some memories we try to hold onto while others we learn from it but want to forget. And how this can have an effect on a person. Overall, this is a worthy watch especially because of Robin Williams performance.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not very well known, I only found out about it a few days ago when it popped up in my recommended section. It you haven't seen the film, it's about a man who processes film and turns them into photos. Early on into the film we find out he is obsessed with a family who comes into to have photos developed regularly. Robin Williams does a fantastic job as this character, and I can say it is one of his best performances. The rest of the acting is pretty good, and the child actor did well for a child actor.What really makes this film stand out is the directing. Mark Romanek is very talented and I'm surprised he hasn't had more well known films come out. The story is very uncomfortable, as it is told so well. This is one of those films that you can love but not ever want to watch more than once like A Woman Under The Influence or maybe Requiem for a Dream. This film is definitely worth watching. There's a lot of really well placed symbolism if you watch carefully. The only real issues I have with the film might be the pacing and little plot details. I feel like the music might have been overused and some scenes good have benefited from more silence. One last interesting point about this film: Trent Reznor actually composed a soundtrack for this film, but the filmmakers decided not to use it. A lot of this music went into the Nine Inch Nails album "Still."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing. Robin Williams plays the perfect creep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always wanted to watch this movie because i had seen so many Robin Williams movies but not this one. This movie is sharp, creepy, weird, thrilling and really, really good. I am still thinking about it days after watching it. Some of the film is even left to interpretation by the viewer so there is even more to figure out. The movie is about Sy, a photo clerk at a super store. Sy(short for Seymour) played by Robin Williams is a typical man in his 40's/50's that is a nice, lovable, loser that lives alone. His loneliness turns him mad. He becomes obsessed with a family (Nina, Will, and Jake) that regularly gets their photos developed by him. He makes copies of their photos and puts them on the wall of his apartment. He is so lonely that he dreams of being a part of this family. He buys the same book that he sees sticking out of Nina's bag at the store. At first, he wanted to be like an uncle to the family but then later on he wants to marry Nina and get rid of her husband Will. One of the creepiest parts of the movie is when Sy watches the family's son Jake (Dylan Smith) play soccer from the sidelines and acts like an uncle.Sy eventually gets in trouble for using the extra film to make the copies of the family photos and gets fired for it by his boss (Gary Cole). Sy completely loses his mind at this point, and is determined to get rid of Will by filming his infidelity. Without giving it all away, the ending is wild. I would say the first half of the movie is better than the second but I'm nitpicking.8.5/10 Very intense, very creepy. Williams at his best in my opinion. Not necessarily his best acting but his best character fit. Kudos to the director and supporting cast as well, it was very well done. Thrilling atmosphere and excellent music. This movie is gripping partly because its so cringe worthy at times how weird Williams' character is and how obsessed he is. Humans can be such odd creatures when they are alone for too long.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Hour Photo (2002): Dir: Mark Romanef / Cast: Robin Williams, Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan. Gary Cole, Eriq La Salle: Photographs capture time and memories but it only takes a short time for those moments to be invaded. Robin Williams plays photo clerk Sy Parrish who narrates the film giving viewers a bit of history on the word "snap-shot" as a hunting term. He makes extra prints and imagines himself amongst them as uncle Sy while plastering his apartment walls with photographs. He also knows that the husband id having an affair because he examined the photographs. He is an intruder who hides his knowledge behind a friendly smile. Great setup with analysis of his work and home life leading to a powerful ending. Director Mark Romanek graces the film with shots that suggest invasion of the mind. Powerful performance by Williams whose profession is both his doorway to acceptance and his reality to consequence and instability. Connie Nielsen is also strong as the mother whose romantic void is obvious when Williams knows what she doesn't. Michael Vartan as her husband needed more depth but he receives his regret in the most deliberate fashion. Gary Cole plays Williams's boss who pushes him to the limits. Eriq La Salle is superb as a detective whose final scene brings proper resolution and understanding. Loneliness is something nobody wishes to capture on film. Score: 9 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing special, but interesting performance from Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams touched a lot of people (no, not like that) in a special way (stop it!). When he passed on, I witnessed quite distraught, hysterical reactions from some fans online. A few were even espousing the idea that Patch Adams &amp; What Dreams May Come were decent films after all. While I'm not a big fan, I really enjoyed his turns as Popeye and the voice of Aladdin's Genie. The man had bags of energetic comedic talent, and his drama skills were pretty good too when not too sweetened with hardcore-saccharine. Yet the most effective comparison with a dramatic actor from his peership is when we consider Dustin Hoffman's turn as Tootsie vs Robin's effort in the Mrs Doubtfire outfit. The latter actor being for the younger and/or more sentimental type.This rather long introduction is just to explain that I generally wasn't fussed about his output, but One Hour Photo intrigued me...and more than a decade after release I finally get to see it. Biggest reason to watch/best thing about it: the character Robin creates here is genuinely believable. He's a living, breathing human being...damaged by his utter loneliness. It's an impressive performance and for me justifies his efforts back then to sell himself as a more serious &amp; versatile actor.The film itself is rather simple, with the rest of the cast blandly portraying 2-dimensional characters. Gary Cole was only given a formulaic role to play, he could've done something special if the writing wasn't so singularly fixated on Robin's character. The family are all a bit yawn. The experience as a whole is mildly-absorbing, if unremarkable. Technically everything is quite competent, tho' again it's all very standard.The premise of the story is stimulating if, like me, you enjoy photography and are engaged in the many facets of the digital-vs-analogue debate. Some might feel the ideas here are outdated already, but there's still plenty of people out there who shoot film and then let their local store develop the images. Plus when the premise really is outdated in a decade or two, this movie serves as a reasonably-accurate snapshot of that era.Recommended for film buffs looking for a very different Robin Williams performance, and also for those interested in the potential illusion of privacy when allowing your analogue film to be developed by strangers.Not particularly recommended if all you're looking for is a gripping psychological thriller, it's just a little too average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Enjoyable Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the first time that I saw One Hour Photo I couldn't have been paying too much attention to it because I actually thought it was a very slow paced mediocre film. However, after now watching it for the first time since it's release and actually paying attention, it is definitely much better than I initially thought. The film is pretty slow-paced - that view's not changed - but when you pay attention, and understand &amp; listen to what is happening, it doesn't feel all that slow as you become more drawn into the story, which is well written.The story isn't full of implausible moments, it doesn't have that "Hollywood touch" about it, and isn't full of the usual stalker film cliché's. I also enjoyed how it got you thinking if some of the later scenes were for real or if they were just in Sy's head. I mean the first main fantasy scene wasn't obvious until it's end, so maybe other scenarios weren't real either. It never confused you but it got you thinking which was good.The cast all do a great job with their roles, but Williams was the main standout with his performance of Sy. You know that Sy is obviously completely in the wrong with what he's doing but you still feel sorry for him and this is where Williams plays the part SO well. He doesn't make Sy seem like some clichéd sick twisted psycho...he portrays Sy as just a very nice but a sad, lonely individual whose only friend in life is his pet hamster. No matter what happens during the film, you just cannot feel any hate towards Sy.I sometimes don't notice the way scenes are filmed in movies at times, but the use of the colours to depict the mood for different scenarios was done well I thought. The main instance here being the difference between Sy's own personal world i.e. in his home, compared to that of the Yorkin's. It's not done for the sake of it nor to be "artsy", but done with reason which adds to the overall feel of the film.This isn't an amazing film, but it is enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams the Creep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a common saying that all comedy is based on misery. Someone needs to suffer for it to be funny. Thus it should be no surprise that comedians are more than capable of pulling off more dramatic and even outright depressing roles. One might even say they're perfect for them.Enter one Robin Williams, playing the role of Seymour Parrish. Or, as most people know him, Sy the Photo Guy. A deeply lonely man, his life consisting of nothing else than serving his customers at the local photo kiosk and watching television. Things take a turn for the worse when we find out he has developed an obsession for a particular family, called the Yorkins. Sy has lived his lived vigorously through them for years, but now he has finally turned a leaf to full stalkerdom.And thus begins our movie, and it is about as uncomfortable as you can imagine. It's one thing when an obviously creepy and scary man is doing the stalking, but it's quite another when it's someone as sympathetic and lovable as Robin Williams. You know you shouldn't root for him, but it's Robin Williams, and that creates great tension in the film, when usually such a jovial guy just stares at this little boy, offering him toys.Where the film falters slightly is the execution of this great idea. I don't blame the director however because he really wanted the film to be longer, but unfortunately studio meddling got in the way and thus the whole film feels slightly rushed, especially towards the end. I get the sense that the situation was supposed to go on much longer and thus the twist at the end of the second act would have come as a much bigger shock.As a whole One Hour Photo is definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of Robin Williams seeing that it is such an unusual role for him. It's also a decent psychological thriller on its own. It's well-acted, well-shot and the story, while rushed, is not too shabby either.</fullReview>

Robin Williams' most underrated performance, the comedian's take on the fixated sociopath Sy will make your skin crawl. While less impactful overtime, this disturbing story still clings to your psyche.Furthermore, it's nice to visit a time in history when your personal photos weren't the property of Facebook.Yellow Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark film about a troubled mind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An employee of a one-hour photo lab becomes obsessed with a young suburban family. Middle aged Sy Parrish works as a technician at a one hour photo lab located in a SavMart store in a suburban mall. Sy is a lonely man, never having had any friends. He knows much about his customers through the photographs they have developed. But he knows more about the Yorkin family - specifically Nina Yorkin and her adolescent son Jake Yorkin, the two in the family who drop off and pick up the family's photofinishing - than anyone else, the family about who he is obsessed. Nina's husband, Will Yorkin, is incidental to his obsession since Sy has only seen him in photographs. Sy's obsession includes fantasizing about being their favorite "Uncle Sy". He has even been making an extra set of prints for himself of all of their photographs since Jake was a newborn. After an incident at work and after Sy finds out more about the family through a set of photographs, he decides to right the injustices he sees in the only way he knows how. His actions demonstrate his true mental state. Roger Ebert wrote "Watching the film, I thought of Michael Powell's great 1960 British thriller "Peeping Tom," which was about a photographer who killed his victims with a stiletto concealed in his camera. Sy uses a psychological stiletto, but he's the same kind of character, the sort of man you don't much notice, who blends in, accepted, overlooked, left alone so that his rich secret life can flower. There is a moment in "Peeping Tom" when a shot suddenly reveals the full depth of the character's depravity. In "One Hour Photo," a shot with a similar purpose requires only a lot of innocent family snapshots, displayed in a way that is profoundly creepy." One Hour Photo' is not a film for those who like their chills heavily laced with bloodshed, murder and mayhem. It is, rather, for those who can appreciate a quietly unsettling, yet strangely compassionate glimpse into the dark recesses of the troubled mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thrilling And Disturbing Character Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched Nightcrawler recently, I was in the mood to see some more great performances from actors playing disturbing characters. One Hour Photo is exactly that kind of film.Robin Williams plays Sy, a man who works at the one hour photo place at a Walmart type store. The issue is that he starts to become obsessed with one family in particular that gets their photos developed by him, and it becomes clear very early on that Sy just isn't right in the head. Williams plays this character unbelievably well. He comes across as totally crazy, but in a down to earth way. The best part is, he is completely sympathetic too. Although you know he's messed up, you can't help but feel the pain this guy has deep down. Williams perfectly executes this and it's great to see. In particular, a scene at the very end that I won't spoil has Sy indirectly telling another character about something that happened in his past, and it's pretty heartbreaking to see. I think the performance also has another amount of depth to it due to the recent suicide of Williams, and it makes you wonder if that sadness that he shows in his character is something that he channeled from his own feelings. Very sad, but an amazing performance.The movie is quite well shot. The scenes in the store are very white and feel sterile in a way, and the scenes in the family home have a warm tone to it. There's lot of great uses of color throughout, like the red developing room being used to emphasize a characters emotional state. There's also a good dream sequence that is disturbing and memorable. Overall, it's a pretty wonderful film to watch.I really like how this movie plays out. It slowly builds up the characters until about the one hour mark, where things start to really kick off and the build up pays off. It's an intense and disturbing character study of a film, and I absolutely love that. Robin Williams performance is under rated, and NEEDS to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams at His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams was a fantastic actor. Very sad how things turned out for this great man. He played many parts that made us laugh and smile. He played very few that showed another side of his acting, parts that were dark and disturbed. Perhaps watching a movie like this shows how sad and alone Robin Williams may/or may not have been, as he went deep with this performance, and channeled a deeply sad and disturbing individual in this film. Most acting comes from at least 'some' part of the actor as they are the one acting the part. Just saying on that note. But this was truly a great film, one of Williams' best performances for the sheer fact that he never showed this side of his acting very often, but also just because it was a terrific performance. There is a twist at the end of the film, not so much a twist to the story, but a twist to the character and how we view him after learning the twist. Everything about this movie rides on the twist at the end. Any lesser film and the twist would have been contrived/forced, and basically phony. But the subtle way the twist unfolds with the great writing and the top level of acting William's gives in the moment, the twist unfolds very naturally. The scene also where Williams is running down the hotel parking structure, brilliant, just brilliant. Williams will be very missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Guy You Never Notice...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams unfortunately killed himself recently. In One-Hour Photo, he plays the role of Seymour, an incredibly nice guy who wants to be part of a family, but who doesn't understand boundaries and ends up terrorizing the Yorkin family and doing more harm than good. He knows Nina Yorkin and her son because he's a photo lab technician at a wholesale Wal-Mart/Costco looking store. He often develops photos of the Yorkin family but secretly keeps doubles, which he uses to build a massive collage on his wall. He has no kids, wife, even a roommate, and it's not only disturbing and creepy, but very sad to watch as Seymour's mental stability degrades to the point where he's taking photographs of his boss' daughter as blackmail and revealing to Nina that her husband cheated on her multiple times with some skanky woman.One-Hour Photo is by no means a horror film, but it certainly makes you think. Could the mailman who always brings your letters, your local pharmacist, the pizza delivery guy, want to be more than just a friendly service? With amazing acting from nearly every actor/actress in this film, it almost seems real.Don't pass up this film, it's a haunting experience and full of brilliant performances!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thrilling Hidden Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo has the suspense and subtleties straight out of a Hitchcock movie, but takes place in a more modern setting. This underrated work of film stars the late Robin Williams as a photo developer for a local store who has taken an interest in the Yorkin family through the family pictures he works on. This is truly one of the most underrated and overlooked movies to come out in recent years and it really shows Mr. Williams' acting abilities when it comes to being immersed into a chilling character.The story line, though goes off the beaten path a few times, showcases a good amount of suspense and atmosphere to keep it engaging. What makes One Hour Photo a standout from most thrillers in it's genre lies in it's avoidance of the usual clichés and nuances which makes the twists and turns all the more effective. It quietly studies the main character of Sy Parrish whose bleak sense of loneliness carries the film throughout it's well-written plot. The pacing may leave some viewers underwhelmed, but it is well worth it when given the proper chance.All of the actors do a pretty good job with their given roles, but it is ultimately Robin Williams who steals the show. The psychopathic portrayal of Sy Parrish shows the level of range Williams has as an actor. Unlike most characters in thrillers where it's easy to identify the good guy from the bad guy, the character of Sy is not so easy to distinguish where you might end up feeling both disgusted and sympathetic towards his motives. Regardless, Sy is a quiet, subtle character to study for and is one of the more memorable performances from Robin Williams' career.The use of lighting and cinematography brings in a chilling atmosphere that show you the bleak world of Sy's twisted fantasies. All the shots can range from blank to dark within the story and it really is a fascinating work of film to look at. The musical score also adds a nice touch of suspense to this already engaging thriller.In the end, One Hour Photo will remain of the most underrated thrillers of the last 15 years and I hope it will continue to get the recognition it rightfully deserves. The engaging story, creepy atmosphere, and a strong performance from Robin Williams makes this film worth recommending. And after all that I've talked about this overlooked gem of a film, I giving it an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams is brilliant here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was super good, creepy and intense in a quiet sort of way as there are lots of scenes without any dialogue at all. You just watch mild mannered 'Sy' going about his daily routine; working as a film processor at a one hour photo lab at the local mall, eating by himself, watching TV alone with a giant collage behind him, stealing a knife, stalking a young family.Robin Williams is absolutely brilliant here; chilling, fascinating and by the end sympathy inducing. As funny as he is I really enjoy him in the dramatic roles and he nails this. This has been filmed in a way that reminded me of Breaking Bad in that there are lots of scenes without dialogue, you just watch riveted and slack jawed as someone goes about their business. 8/13/14</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing portrait of obsession and loneliness capped by a tour de force by Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all have seen men like Sy Parrish: People who are on the fringe of society doing what they do to survive yet being alone and removed till they find something that makes it all worth it. In this case, the pictures of the Yorkin family which Sy has done for years has given him such pleasure that he sees himself as he puts it in 1 creepy scene as "UNCLE SY." It's remarkable to see Robin Williams who I've loved for his remarkable turns in Aladdin, Jumangi, Flubber and other comedies to be playing such a lonely, sad and perhaps sympathetic character. He is amazing in showing his loneliness, especially in his scenes at his home and how he sees himself as a member of his family by saving a copy of all their pictures in that frightening collage in his house. His silence and sad isolation from everyone is chilling, and then Williams' expertly explodes in 3 powerful scenes which you will know once you see them.In addition, the film doesn't tun into a slasher like I first feared when Sy is fired and takes the knife from the Savemart. Instead, it's a red herring and the director and Sy lead us down a curvy path where he gets revenge on his boss by doing what he says a snapshot originally was, " a hunting term." There's another scene where Williams sits in his car near the Yorkin home, and we see him stealthily going through it. The director amazingly is able to confuse the viewer into losing track of what's real and fantasy, and though Williams' is only talking to the dog watching TV in the living room the effect of the scene makes it feel wrong, he shouldn't be there and honestly this along with the eyes' scene were the films creepiest moments and no blood/gore was needed. Connie Nielsen is great as is Dylan Smith(Jake) in showing how even such a happy family like them has issues, which the director teases wonderfully between Mr. and Mrs. Yorkin till "Uncle Sy" sees the truth himself in the photo lab. He then take sit upon himself as he later says, due to his anger at Mr. Yorkin for neglecting and abusing his family to expose him to his family and what better way then with a picture which "says a thousand words."It's a shame that Williams' didn't get more acclaim for this part,though Ebert and others(2003 Saturn Award) saw what myself and others did. In the light of his tragic death, this is the first full movie of his I've seen since then, his suicide shocked me and my family who were all fans of his work.) Yet in a way, this movie seems to channel Robin's own life, someone who seemed to have a lot going for him, yet had his own pain, issues and fantasies about how he wanted to live which sadly never came to fruition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams' single best performance . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the great qualities of Robin Williams is his ability to keep surprising us. Yes, his off-screen act seems to be a repetitive act of doing the same schtick over and over, but in the movies, he always takes chances. For me, there's never been a bigger risk to one actor than his performance in "One Hour Photo." Williams plays Sy Parrish, a bland, smiling salesman at a one hour photomat that occupies the corner of one of those vast Mega-marts where you can buy everything from toothpaste to radial tires. As a human being he's pretty forgettable. He is just another face mixed into the tapestry of your busy day. You do your business and then he is gone from your mind three seconds after you stuff your receipt in your pocket and walk away.Looking at Sy, one would assume that he goes home to the wife and kids, but as it turns out, his only family is his beloved photo-mat. There isn't anything really distinctive about Sy and as we follow his day, as he goes through the routine of routine we see that a pattern of loneliness has bred routine and resentment and obsession.One day during the visit by Nina Yorkin (Connie Neilson), a regular customer, Sy carefully notices that there is one picture left on the roll. Holding the camera back he takes a picture of himself. This seemingly innocent gesture is, for Sy, a gesture of recognition. What Nina doesn't know is that over the years Sy has developed a sort of obsession with the family bliss that shows through in Nina's photographs. He wants Nina and her family to recognize him and he tries to get their approval in small gestures like giving Nina's son a free camera and making double prints free of charge.The Yorkins, Will, Nina and 8 year-old Jake are comfort food for Sy, they contrast sharply with his den of loneliness and routine. Their photos show a pretty family which stands out among the regulars like "The Cat Lady", a woman who obsessively empties roll after roll of her cats and "The Amateur Porn Artist", the shifty guy who keeps taking nude photos of his girlfriend. Sy fantasizes about being part of the Yorkin family and breaking away from his meaningless life as he wanders through their photos of birthdays, holidays, anniversaries, vacations and family bliss.Then, something happens. A young woman drops off photos of herself being intimate with Will. It is here that Sy's vision of the Yorkins begins to crack. Attempting to sabotage the affair, Sy "accidentally" drops the photos of Will and his lover into Nina's photo sleeve hoping that Will gets his comeuppance.When he doesn't get the reaction he expects, Sy comes unglued. It would be criminal of me to reveal what happens next except to say that it isn't what we expect. What I can say is that Romanek balances the routine everyday nature of the first half of the film with an ending that is just as balanced so that everything that happens makes complete sense.This was the second time in 2002 that Robin Williams had played a psychotic. The first was in Chris Nolan's Insomnia. There, as here, Williams shows portrait of a man whose frustration bubbles slowly under the surface as the irritations of the world begin to invade his private comfort zone. Sy wants to remain in his fantasy and as the fantasy and the reality begin to cave in around him you can see him desperately trying to patch the holes and keep the illusion alive.Williams' performance is, at first, understated with quiet passages that allow you to watch his eyes and see that he is always thinking. Sy is the portrait of a man who remains invisible and remains very good at his job because it allows him to keep his illusion going. Routine is a manner of remaining inside his fantasy because he knows that he can never have the life that the Yorkins enjoy.Robin Williams image will forever be cemented as the wacky nut that we saw on The Tonight Show, yet as film historians assess (especially in the wake of his tragic death) this contribution to film, his dramatic work seems to be just as important as his comedic work. Sy is an original creation from a source that we don't expect. Sy emerges as a man who smiles pleasantly while managing routines that feed his own mania.In a way Sy reminds us of Travis Bickle, the tortured soul of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver, another meaningless soul who goes unnoticed and fixates on an obsession. Bickle wanted to be the savior for Iris, the teen prostitute. Sy wants to live the idea of an idyllic fantasy that is different from the hundreds of meaningless photos that pass through his hands day after day. The difference is that Sy wants to remain in his fantasy. He is a damaged man who hides in his ordinariness, and is best left inside his delusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very underrated Robin Williams film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing the tragically sad news this week I decided I wanted to watch some of Robin's films. Mrs Doubtfire is probably my favourite film of Robin's but I also decided to watch One Hour Photo. This is a film I'd never heard of but the premise sounded intriguing. I was also keen to see how well Robin could do a 'serious' role as I'd only ever really seen him in comedies. I was very impressed with this film. The plot is extremely creepy and thought provoking. The acting is very good and Robin plays Sy the Photo Guy to perfection. He is a very strange character, his actions are disturbing and it's intriguing to find out more and more about this character as the film goes on. The film overall is pretty intense and does well to avoid some movie clichés. I felt it was a very unique film in its own kind of way.I was quite surprised to see it rated at only 6,8. I think more people need to become aware of this great little film. I will give it an 8.5/10.R.I.P Robin Williams</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oftentimes the culprit of misinterpretation is expectation.Trailers are fun and all that, but time and again my theory's proved: The less you know before seeing a film, the better.One Hour Photo's no exception.Expect the unexpected.Avoiding all synopses, an accurate prediction regarding a narrative arc is near impossible. Since it's a dramatic thriller, sinister behavior's a sure thing.Otherwise, it unfolds in an unanticipated manner. Therefore, it's difficult to draw correlatives without spoiling.It's written and directed by Mark Romanek; as of yet, the first in his two-feature career.People seem to forget Robin Williams's range as an acting talent. Aside from the voice of Genie in Aladdin, amongst a slew of other impressive roles, his achievements are featured prominently in Good Will Hunting and What Dreams May Come.Williams stars as Seymour "Sy" Parrish, a photo booth attendant with a suspicious proclivity.Connie Nielsen turns in an excellent performance as Nina Yorkin, a frequent customer of the one-hour photo development lab. Nielsen's had a long career in the film-biz. Unfortunately at first glance, her cinematic history seems unremarkable.Her most noteworthy role is that of Lucilla, Commodus's sister in Gladiator. Now that you think about it, she's very good in that, yes yes?See how easily the notion's misplaced?Nielsen's acting chops really shine through here, but her performance is easily forgettable in the midst of a confusing tale, daunting subject material and a powerhouse protagonist.Sy's workplace is a satirical version of Wal-Mart located in a suburban mall, but the setting's of minimal concern.(Side Note: If you can find me a Wal-Mart that's half as clean, organized or well-staffed as this Savmart, I'd?well, I'd never believe you.)The only necessary contextual reference is the plot's unfolding upon the cusp of digital photography. Sy's occupational necessity teeters on irrelevance.Two types of people will enjoy this: Film buffs and psychology scholars. As a piece of commercial art, it's impossible to ignore the story's merit.This is a tight, well-crafted ninety-five minute film. Priority lies with painting a clear picture of a character coping with a contemporary existential crisis, not with polishing the narrative veneer.But, should you see it? Why not?Spoiler sensitive types. stop reading here!In particular the photo development process is masterfully shot and edited beautifully. The sequence shimmers as a fountain plume of knowledge, and a cornucopia of succulent eye candy.Speaking of ocular capability, the disturbing nightmare remains a mystery to me. The scene's certainly there for a reason; I simply can't discern the purpose at present. But Romanek's first feature's such a sterile and meticulous craft I don't need to revisit the material. Its purposeful placement is fairly supposed.Nuance glimmers in the details, after all.And that's what I like about this movie; the hint of fairy dust twinkling amidst shadowy corners.During an early moment, Nina comforts her son Jake (played by Dylan Smith) who voices concerns about Sy's loneliness. Lying on his bed, Nina reassures him by suggesting they close their eyes and generate good thoughts on the photo attendant's behalf.While the scene unfolds, Jake fiddles with an 'expanding sphere' toy, and it resonates thematically with the larger narrative. As the boy expands and contracts the plastic mechanical star, their positive energy's injected into the metaphysical ether. Isolated from Sy's physical presence, the pair still generates good will for him, when nobody else is.The cosmic microcosm resonates with the later discussion of Deepak Chopra and the expanding/contracting of the universe.Another revelatory moment takes place when Sy walks the boy home from soccer practice.In this scene, Nina's son illustrates a mature level of even-handedness most adults can't muster. Without a trace of judgment, Jake accepts Sy's gesture of friendship. The boy welcomes the attendant's company, just like he would a schoolmate.Subjective audience members are acutely aware of the danger in Jake's actions because of potential instability in Sy's mental faculties. Stepping back and ignoring that bias reveals no immorality or cause for suspicion in the protagonist's actions.Up until Sy offers the action figure, he hasn't technically committed a moral transgression. But Jake's refusal of the gift draws a line in the existential sand. The boy's commitment to honesty is of significantly less concern than the alternative implications.In a way, this choice to decline is the catalyst allowing Sy's ultimate redemption. The film culminates in a realm of moral obscurity; perhaps otherwise, that wouldn't be the case.The action figure represents an unspoken power shift. Instead of being two human beings standing on equal footing; Sy tempts the boy with an unachievable material gain. You might call it 'forbidden fruit.' No matter what the phrasing, a 'gift' still represents a tangible exchange.And I'd also argue it shows Sy at his weakest. Luckily for him, Jake makes the correct decision on both their behalves.A refined detail is the framed mirror with the reminder to 'Check Your Smile' in the Savmart locker room.Even the means of self-evaluation, the lens through which Sy can inspect himself, lies in the shadow cast by the judgmental puppeteers of higher-tiered society.I never do this but I'm going to cheat by parroting the conclusion from another review.Because, hey, it's succinct.Elaine Cassel concludes, "Movies could play a more productive role in explaining psychopathology if the sources of twisted behavior were explained realistically and compassionately, as they are here. One Hour Photo is a rewarding study of abnormal behavior and one that psychology students should appreciate, if not enjoy. It leaves us wondering, and caring, now that we know what's wrong with Sy, what will happen to Sy."Brief, yeah? Hope it helps!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seymour Parrish (Robin Williams) is a lonely obsessed employee working at an one hour photo developer inside a big box store. He becomes fixated on the Yorkins (Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Dylan Smith) and tries to insinuate himself into their lives. His boss Bill Owens (Gary Cole) starts to have problems with him.It's a quiet creepy performance from Robin Williams. Writer/director Mark Romanek is mostly known for music videos. It's a very plain movie. The style is very much like the big box store. It has a possibility of a more interesting movie. A creepy Robin Williams isn't enough. There needs to be more meat on the bone. There has to be a story. The ending payoff is simply not big enough. Instead of a powerful explosion, the movie is going for poetic weirdness. This is an interesting performance in search of a more explosive story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams Sells It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams, one of the funniest people on the planet, has made a career of playing some very unpleasant people. In this one, he works at a Fotomat (now nearly extinct) and become the stalker of a family that brings their films to him for development. Not only does he stalk them, he knows everything about them, their birthday parties, their fights, their sporting events, etc. Of course, at some point he is going to inject himself into their lives. Fortunately, the scrip writers used some restraint and made this play out the way it should have (I won't' spoil this for you). Suffice it to say that the trip is a scary one and we can't help but feel our flesh creep a bit. We also are made aware of his loneliness and his dysfunctional existence. He is a multidimensional figure, as quirky as one can get. After seeing "The Social Network" recently, I have to also say that we have created a societal voyeurism in our culture. This further shows how fragile our privacy is and how we are willing to sell it to the highest bidder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo was possibly one of the most interesting movies I've watched. I don't know exactly what it is, but this movie was just really good. Before this movie, I never considered the fact that the people at a one hour photo place looked through our lives, saw the places we've been, and the people we've encountered. To me, the thought doesn't make the workers creepy, but their jobs in general feel quite invasive. This film also made me realize that we, as a society, can be very blind to those who we take for granted. For example, Sy the photo guy is clearly obsessed with Nina and her family, yet Nina just sees it as a passion for what he does. She just doesn't notice all the little things Sy does for her. Instead, she simply takes it as quality customer service. Is she na?ve, blind, or just uncaring towards this meek, insignificant photo guy? Robin Williams does a fantastic job portraying the inner psyche of a scared (and creepily meticulous) young boy who is trapped inside an awkward adult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams is great in this psychological thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always admired Robin Williams as a comedian and as a comic actor. He has equally impressed me in a dramatic role, and, to me, this is one of his finest performances of this type. The trouble with someone like Williams is that he has a famous (or infamous if you like) past and you tend to remember him for those things. But if you can see the character beyond the actor then you're most likely going to enjoy the performance a lot more.Seymour Parrish works in the one hour photo processing department of the SavMart store. He has worked there for many years and has seen many customers come and go, but one family, the Yorkin's have been coming back for ten years. They are Nina and Will and their nine year old son Jakob. Unfortunately for them, Seymour, or Sy as he prefers to be called, has become very attached to them through their photos over the years. So much so that he even fantasises about being a member of this perfect family. After an unfortunate event at work and while processing some photos Sy discovers that the Yorkin's are not as perfect as he imagined. As you can probably imagine, this does not go down too well with Sy. I won't say any more so as not to give any spoilers.A really well made film that I found quite atmospheric in places. A great performance from Robin Williams as Seymour Parrish, I really felt he nailed the part! Also worthy of note were; Connie Nielsen as Nina Yorkin, Michael Vartan as Will Yorkin, Dylan Smith as Jakob Yorkin, Erin Daniels as Maya Burson and Gary Cole as Bill Owens.There is a really great commentary all about photographs and what they mean to people that follows through the first two thirds of the film. It is read by Robin Williams as Sy and it really adds character to the film. Although not perfect, I did really enjoy this film and in particular Robin William's performance. Over all, a tight psychological thriller that does what it says on the tin? Recommended.My Score: 7.1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Romanek's 'One Hour Photo' is an interesting watch, due to it's morbid yet absorbing story. Being a psychological thriller, it offers some chilling, creepy &amp; disturbing moments on the way.'One Hour Photo' tells the story of Sy Parrish, played by Robin Williams, a mini-lab photo technician at SavMart's one-hour photo developing clinic in suburban Los Angeles, who becomes obsessed with a young suburban family.Twisted from the very beginning, Mark Romanek's writing &amp; direction is chilling, creepy, but yet absorbing. The only shortcoming comes in it's finale. The portions come out half-baked and leave you in double-thoughts. Cinematography Jeff Cronenweth is good. Editing by Jeffrey Ford, is sharp.Performance-Wise: Robin Williams rules the show with a natural &amp; effective performance. He proves his range as an actor yet again by playing such a morbid &amp; disturbing character. Michael Vartan &amp; Connie Nielsen are excellent. Dylan Smith is just right. Gary Cole leaves a mark. Others lend the required support.On the whole, apart from a half-baked &amp; questionable culmination, this psychological thriller deserves a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Neat Compact Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A well crafted, low budget, psychological thriller that succeeds because of its' restraint. Robin Williams stars as a middle aged single loner, Si Parrish, who works in the photo development lab at a supermarket. He lives his life dealing with memento's of events which others wish to remember, their photographs. But is it to replace that which he wishes to forget? Williams is terrific. Quiet, creepy, with just a hint of menace and violence he insidiously works his way into the lives of a perfect couple, possibly replacing his own less than perfect past life, past and present, with theirs.Connie Neilsen and Michael Vartan play as husband and wife , Nina and Will Yorkin whose superficially attractive life collapses as Parrish finds the cracks. The sets are limited, mainly a shopping mall, the Yorkin's home, and a Hotel giving the feel of a stage play, and it is the script, the words, the dialogue which dominate.The final act is strong, yet still Director and writer Mark Romanek pulls his punches. The sexual dimension which could easily have been gratuitously exploited, isn't. The violence which simmers under the surface is not fully realised. The only truly unexplored element is why he surrenders everything in a Pyhrric victory. Photographic, framing and picture allusions abound both obvious, and subtle, and the one and a half hour running time is perfect for the story. Romaneks previous work has been mainly with Music Video which will have helped with the stylised presentation and limited sets, but to his credit he also shows an ability to tell an extended narrative outside of his milieu.Although this falls short on the sex and violence and edge of your seat tension stakes, it is nonetheless satisfying in its own right and can be looked back on with pride by all involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: One Hour Photo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up with Robin Williams movies in a way, watching him on the telly with his Mork and Mindy series when I was a kid, and following almost all his films should they make it to the big screen here. Everyone knows he's quite the live wire comedian, so it's probably groundbreaking each time he gravitates towards more dramatic, serious fare such as Dead Poets Society and The Night Listener, with even rarer turns as negative characters, such as that in Christopher Nolan's Insomnia, and One Hour Photo.Written and directed by Mark Romanek, the film has as a central character, somebody in the background, easily forgotten, never a hero and frankly someone that we don't really care about unless we know them personally prior. Robin Williams junks his jokey side, and plays a quiet loner who works at a megamart as the one-hour photo lab tech guy who processes your photographs. Yes it's Year 2002, so cameras of the digital type were not that prevalent, and surely a film with a premise of this nature probably can no longer use this setting because it doesn't exist, at least not in a widespread manner. If you, like me, have seen the demise of this part of the photo industry, may have a tinge of sadness since you're likely to have built up some keen rapport with the person who through the development of your film, likely to have entered your personal circle of trust.And part of the brilliance of the film is how detailed it is to show how films were processed back then, from the small film roll into negatives on which photographs get printed on. William's Seymour "Sy" Parrish narrates this delicate process, which tells us his personality and his approach in life, chillingly meticulous and taking pride in his profession to deliver the best of his services, where memorizing facts and figures of his customers seem to be part of his edge in delivering customer service, never betraying that hint of misappropriation where he siphons off extra prints of the Yorkin family photos to feed his obsession.Working 11 years on the same job, he has seen the Yorkins - husband Will (Michael Vartan), wife Nina (Connie Nielsen) and son Jakob (Dylan Smith) grow in the community, and they soon become his family of choice, a unit that he craves for but knows he has missed the boat and can never enjoy what this family has in its ties. So the next best thing is to creepily collect mementos, and plots to be as close as he can to members of the family, stalking Nina even and trying extremely hard to connect at any level through a little bit of ingenious social engineering.A lesser story will have this degenerate into something of the Fatal Attraction kind, exploiting Sy's loneliness into something dangerous and threatening the family direct. But here's where Romanek's story succeeds in providing a breath of fresh air, where that tinge of danger becomes a suspenseful thriller, keeping us constantly wondering just what sort of edge does Sy get pushed over, and rolling his disgraceful past into the mix as well in one fell swoop, in desiring his utopia of what a family is to be maintained at that virginal level, keeping it perfect.It didn't go down the road of the mediocre or the typical, but kept things open especially in the final moments of conversation between Sy and detective Van Der Zee (Eriq La Salle), where we get the rug pulled from under our feet, yet allowing things to swing either way, depending on whether we desire to sympathize with Sy, or prefer that it be something more bleak than it already is. One thing's for sure though, with the advent of technology, the potential for something like this has moved from the photo-studio where a select few employees have privy to the photos you send for development, or this gets unwittingly revealed through the lack of securing our digital photos on social networking sites.Robin Williams is a one man tour de force, and he disappears effortlessly into the role, hidden behind the shy, lonely facade, becoming somewhat of an an eerie avenging angel type who sees his utopia being destroyed, and wants to do something about it. And the misc-en- scene gets carefully crafted to support this, from the music, sets and the spot on creation of mood that gets to crawl under your skin. His performance alone is astounding, and he totally owned the role and made this film come alive. Watch this to see what Robin Williams can do outside of comedy, and for Mark Romanek story and dare in taking Williams out of his comfort zone. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One hour photo is a movie about an obsessed photo technician with no personal live. He spends his years trying to compensate the emptiness inside of him by pretending that the people on the photos are part of his live.Robin Williams plays the role of an apparently dangerous psychopath very well. You see most of the movie from his special point of view. But his appearance is way too strong and any other actor in the movie is being pushed in the background. So there's the movie, there's him and that's pretty much all there is.The movie also lacks of a good solution in the ending. You don't learn what happened with him after his arrestment. Most possibly he was admit to a psychiatric hospital, but maybe he would have gotten away with less, since no one got actually hurt.However, to see him in such a serious role was interesting for a change. And he played well. Good enough for 7 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can sympathize for all the photo developers who were put out of business by digital cameras, one of the many thoughts that entered my mind when the film was over. Robin William's plays one such developer in a plot that owes much to Hitchcock, but avoids falling into the trap of ripping him off. That, plus a little emotion, and a great dramatic performance from Williams deliver a fine thriller, occasionally flawed, but I can easily recommend it.The key to the film's effectiveness is of course its subtlety, which is broken in the finale a little bit, but it doesn't harm the drama. Robin Williams can get tiring as a comedian, but his dramatic roles are always solid, (Good Will Hunting, Insomnia, The Night Listener). Here he is deliciously creepy. In the same way that kids are scared of Grandma cause they don't wanna get smooched, there is something very intimidating about the pacifism and extreme pleasantness of Williams' character in this motion picture. Part of it of course has to do, with the fact that it becomes increasingly obvious that he is more than a little bit nuts.I was told that this film was generally panned, which I find a bit hard to believe. Yes, it has its faults, and to some the plot may feel stagy and hard to accept, but I liked the film a lot for what it was. If you want a good thriller, be sure to check out One Hour Photo.</fullReview>

I saw Robin Williams as the lead, and immediately I was drawn to watch the movie.

He always brings intensity and passion to his roles, as evidenced in _Good Will Hunting (1997)_, _Dead Poets Society (1989)_, and even _Insomnia (2002/I)_. As in those, in _One Hour Photo (2002)_, he saves the movie with his intense demeanor, making his character seem more realistic, and much more creepy. The supporting role players weren't bad, but I feel without Robin Williams, this movie would not have the same feel. I would recommend this movie to anybody who enjoy thrillers with the bonus of a great character actor (Robin Williams) playing the deranged lead.Overall, I found it to be a decent thriller, but I give Robin William's performance an A+.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent performance by Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An up and coming writer and director, Mark Romanek, wrote and directed the 2002 film, "One Hour Photo" starring Robin Williams. Williams plays Sy, a deeply disturbed man who runs the photo development booth at a discount store. He is obsessed with the Yorkin family, whose photos he has been developing since the son, Jake, was an infant. Having no life of his own, Sy parks his car outside the Yorkin house, runs into Mrs. York at a mall food court, and makes extra copies of their photos for his wall at home. Then he discovers, through another customer's photos, that Mr. Yorkin (Alias star Michael Vartan) is having an affair.There is a surprising lack of dialogue in this film and some very stark cinematography, which points up Sy's isolation in the world. The film is very well done.One quibble I have is when Sy's boss (Gary Cole) questions Sy about the discrepancy in prints sold versus the excessive amount of prints made by the AGFA machine. Given how long Sy has been making extra copies, it seems strange that someone is just noticing this now.Williams' acting is excellent, proving again that many comics can do drama very well. Eriq LaSalle, formerly of "E.R." plays a police detective.Without Romanek's fine touches, this would have been on the level of a Lifetime TV movie. Thanks to his sense of style, it isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best character portrait since Taxi Driver.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams gives a very good, albeit surprisingly scary performance here. He plays Sy, a very lonely and psychologically damaged man who works as a photo developer at a local chain store, he becomes completely obsessed with what he perceives as the "perfect family." Visually, it is simplistic but also striking, there is a hint of hyper-realism in the general look of the film. Robin Williams can give a very good dramatic performance when he is given a good script, but in this film he goes to a completely different level. He literally transforms into Sy, and the result is a weak, although dangerous character who we genuinely feel sorry for.I am not sure if anyone has made this comparison before me, but when I watch this film, it reminds me a little bit of Taxi Driver, both Travis and Sy are lonely, their motivations are completely different of course, but both these films are essentially character portraits that deal with loneliness. The supporting cast give reasonably good performances but Williams truly carries the movie.In closing, this film is far from being the best of all time, but it is a great film nonetheless and I recommend it to people who liked Taxi Driver.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thrillers are most effective when they slowly build the tension. It may seem slow at first, but by the end the tension is so potent that the viewer will be unable to move. "One Hour Photo" is like that, and the lion's share of the credit has to go to Robin Williams.Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is an extremely lonely man who works at the One Hour Photo store at the SavMart (think WalMart). His only moments of happiness are when the Yorkins come to drop off and pick up their photos. But Sy's affections aren't just because he's a nice guy, he is obsessed with them, imagining himself as "Uncle Sy". But Sy is also very unstable, and any crack could make him dangerous.Robin Williams made a career in comedy, but he also has a great talent for drama. This is easily his best performance. Sy is anti-social to the extreme, but we can also see a bit of ourselves in him. All of our insecurities feelings of loneliness are present and exaggerated in him. The other cast members are great, but this film belongs to Williams.Mark Romanek is a a terrific director. The film is perfectly paced, and the tension builds to a nearly unbearable level. But the film's look, helped by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, is one of this film's most unique and helpful attributes. The too-bright lights of the store, the use of pastels (especially white) and the overly positive jargon of big corporations, is all reminiscent of Wal-Mart. Yet, there is also a tone of darkness underneath it all, and that helps increase the tension. Lighting in a thriller hasn't been used this well in any other movie I have seen next to the "The Descent." This is a bold and terrifying thriller. Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams moves away from comedy into much darker territory and delivers his finest performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fist off I have to say I have never been much of a Robin Williams fan and I am not really into these warm and funny family movies that he usually makes. I really was interested to see this movie though, after viewing Insomnia and seeing what he could do in a darker serious role.I have to say Robin Williams performance as Sy the photo guy is truly outstanding. He elicits sympathy from the audience and really is a towering presence in terms of his acting throughout the film.The Yorkin Family played decently by Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen &amp; Dylan Smith are integral to the plot and each gives convincing if not outstanding performance, after all the film centres around Sy and his obsessive behaviour. Gary Cole as Sy's boss is okay, and he helps in pushing Sy over the edge.Also I have to applaud the fledgling movie director Mark Romanek, his minimalist approach to the sets and Robin Williams appearance paired with the very dark material worked exceptionally well. The sombre and thoughtful mood of this piece is great as it moves slowly but very deliberately through the story and covering some disturbing territory.This is a truly masterfully directed and acted movie and credit goes to the pairing of Romanek and Williams in pulling this off. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mark Romanek snaps Robin Williams' mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lonely department store "One Hour Photo" guy Robin Williams (as Seymour "Sy" Parrish) lives vicariously through the pictures he develops for what seems like the perfect family: "Full frontal" father Michael Vartan (as William "Will" Yorkin), beautiful wife Connie Nielsen (as Nina Yorkin), and their cute nine-year-old son Dylan Smith (as Jakob "Jake" Yorkin). Soon, Mr. Williams is stalking the family; he watches young Smith play baseball, meets Ms. Nielsen at the Galleria food mart for lunch, and parks his car outside their home after work. When Williams discovers Mr. Vartan may not be the world's best father, he goes "Psycho".Excellent direction by Mark Romanek, complimented by Williams' creepy performance; this film succeeds in maintaining a quiet, mostly suggestive horror throughout. There are some ways it could be tighter. Some examples: Maya's pictures (who took them?) should have been suggestive solo shots of the couple, which Williams intends to "unite" in the hotel room. Jake's perceptions about "Sy" are alluded to early on, but never expanded; they are confirmed by an excellent "point-of-view" shot of Williams' car in his rear view mirror. There is no follow-up. This should have been the moment the boy convinces his mother the man is a dangerous stalker. And, while "The Day the Earth Stood Still" is a great old movie, why not substitute one that compliments "Sav-Mart", like "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"? ******* One Hour Photo (1/13/02) Mark Romanek ~ Robin Williams, Michael Vartan, Connie Nielsen</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Psychological Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 2002 Robin Williams moved away from comedy acting, going towards more serious roles in One Hour Photo and Insomnia. He should have stayed doing these sorts of roles.One Hour Photo is a story of obsession and loneliness, about a sad man who just craves acceptations. The plot of the film is about Sy (Robin Williams), a man who works in SavMart (a Walmart/KMart type department store) on the photo booth. Sy is a man who takes great pride in his work and likes to get to know his customers. There is one family he takes a particular interest in, the Yorkins. During the film he becomes more obsessed, making his own copies of their photos, looking at them when he can, placing them on the wall of his flat and even said that he is an uncle to Jake, the son of the family. He is obsessed because he sees them as the prefect family and wants to be apart of it. He goes to such extremes to stalk the family, and fantasises being apart it. However, he discovers that the family isn't as prefect as he first thought, and he world falls apart, losing his job and sets out to get revenge.As I said, the main themes of the film are obsession and lonely. Robin Williams and writer/director Mark Romanek show this very effectively, and very real. It was very believable. On the outside Sy seemed like a nice friendly man, who just cared about people. However he really is seeking acceptation and company. Slowly during the film Sy becomes more psycho. Mark Romanek did a very good writing job and his director showed skill. They were good acting performances from Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Gary Cole and Dylan Smith. However, most of my praise has to go to Robin Williams who does give a very chilling performance and should do more serious roles. Some scenes were unconformable to watch, but that was the reaction that the audience is meant to feel. The film does loose it a little in the final act, but I feel Romanek did handle the film well and it works well. I recommend it if you like this type of him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best psychological horror films I've seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is a very underrated movie that deserves more credit than it often seems to get. Robin Williams is just fantastic as Sy, and definitely deserved an Oscar nomination. His chilling performance really made the movie. He is a very sympathetic character, alternating between detachment and forceful anger. The direction and supporting cast were very good, if not great. The dialogue was well done, and the use of contrasting colors added to the film's intense atmosphere. If you like psychological horrors, or just good movies, give this one a shot.I give One Hour Photo a strong 8/10. I have it as #93 on my top 100 list. If you liked this one, definitely check out Kubrick's 'The Shining' and try 'Panic Room'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Man, What Now?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In her novel "The Death of the Heart" Elizabeth Bowen wrote "Not for nothing do we invest so much of ourselves in other people's lives- or even in momentary pictures of people we do not know. It cuts both ways; the happy group inside the lighted window, the figure in the long grass in the orchard seen from the train stay and support us in our dark hours". "One-Hour Photo" is a film about someone who invests almost all of himself in other people's lives. Sy Parrish works behind the photo counter of a large suburban supermarket and has spent the last twenty years of his life developing other people's snapshots. Sy is a lifelong bachelor, with no wife, family or romantic interest in his life. His one passion seems to be for his job, which he takes very seriously, doing his utmost to ensure that every customer receives a perfect set of photographs. He prides himself that his laboratory is "the best mini-lab in the state", and his philosophy can perhaps be summed up in the following words:- "And if these pictures have anything important to say to future generations, it's this: I was here. I existed. I was young, I was happy, and someone cared enough about me in this world to take my picture". Sy might seem like the perfect employee, but there is a darker side to his character. He has formed a great attachment to one particular family, the Yorkins- handsome dad Will, pretty young mom Nina and their cute young son Jake. He does not just see the family as customers- he has befriended them and appointed himself their "Uncle Sy". What the Yorkins do not know is that Sy has, over a number of years, been making an extra copy of every photograph they have brought in to him to develop and has been using these copies to decorate his flat, where he has several hundred images of them stuck to one wall. In Sy's eyes the Yorkins are the family he never had, his one source of happiness in his humdrum existence. And then, suddenly, his life changes. He is sacked from his job and- even worse for his peace of mind- discovers that Will is cheating on Nina with another woman.The film, superficially, falls within the "stalker" genre which was popularised in the late eighties and early nineties by films like "Fatal Attraction" and "Single White Female". When Sy discovers that his adopted family are less perfect than he had imagined, the emotional world he has constructed for himself is destroyed, and he decides to seek revenge. Unlike many stalker films, however, "One Hour Photo" contains a strong satirical element; it can be seen as a satire on suburban life not unlike "American Beauty". The Yorkins are an All-American suburban family so eerily perfect they could be taken straight out of a commercial. Although the film was shot in the Los Angeles area, the identikit homes and shopping malls could be set in the suburbs of virtually any American city. This idea of suburban conformity is emphasised by the film's bland and impersonal visual look. We can all think of films ("Girl with a Pearl Earring" and "Far from Heaven" are two recent examples) where virtually every shot looks like a painting. "One Hour Photo", with its hard, glossy look and vivid primary colours is a film where virtually every shot looks like a family snapshot. What surprised me most about this picture was not seeing Robin Williams playing a villain, as I had previously seen him in "Insomnia" (also made in 2002) and as a fanatical anarchist in "The Secret Agent". What surprised me was seeing Robin Williams playing an introvert, as I had always associated him with brash extroverts, such as the motormouth DJ Adrian Cronauer in "Good Morning Vietnam", or the inspirational teacher in "Dead Poets Society", or the eccentric actor who disguises himself as his own children's nanny in "Mrs Doubtfire". Here, however, he is completely different. Sy is the archetypal grey, anonymous "little man", a reclusive, working-class, middle-aged bachelor, hardly noticed by the rest of society. His name Sy is not short for Simon but rather Seymour, a pun on "see more". Others may overlook him, but his job enables him to see rather more of their lives than they might wish, and it is this which gives him a surprising amount of power. Even though this part is so different from the sort of roles I have come to associate with Williams, it is nevertheless one of his best. Unlike some characters in stalker films, Sy is never allowed to appear simply as a villain. He may be a creepy, dangerous obsessive, hovering on the brink of madness, but we are never allowed to forget that he is human. Williams and writer/director Mark Romanek portray him with sympathy and compassion. He is perhaps one of the casualties of the suburban lifestyle, a man whose obsessions have their roots in loneliness and in alienation from the privileged, seemingly picture-perfect lifestyle of families like the Yorkins. Watching Williams's brilliant portrayal of this alienated loner, the question that came to mind was the one originally posed by the German writer Hans Fallada in 1932, one year before Hitler's rise to power, "Kleiner Mann, was nun?" "Little man, what now?" 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remarkably character study. The film is a slow building piece that leads up to the final, surprising revelation. The entire time I was wondering what drove this man to become such a loner, living vicariously through this seemingly perfect family and when we finally get the answer, I just sat in numbed silence. It's very rare when a film can shock me to the core and just leave me laying there, numb, throughout the entire experience. I was being knowingly haunted yet I couldn't do anything to stop what was happening. Everything about the film, from Williams' shockingly horrifying (in a good way) performance to the frightening, atmospheric score. I really can't begin to describe how much this film shook the core of me. I can rarely think of a time where I was so disturbed by something so subtle. They could have made the ending some outrageously huge deal, but they made it subtle and realistic. In the end you can't do anything but pity this character and sympathize for him. He's just a man who was wrecked and deeply disturbed in his childhood which led him to such an alienated life. Being this photo processor allowed him to live vicariously through what he believed to be the perfect family. But of course no family is perfect and when he loses this perfect image of them, it throws him over the edge in one of the most disturbing displays of a deranged mind I've ever seen.</fullReview>

First, I thought it was another really good Robin Williams flick, but the 2nd time I saw it, it was confusing, weird and did a really good job making Williams look really creepy. I actually wondered why an actor like him would be inclined to even accept the role? The director did a good job making this guy seem like the biggest loner. When he got fired from his job at the SavMart, what was he dumping into the bin when he was paged over the intercom? and how did he find out his boss' address in order to take pictures of his daughter playing with a toy? Also, how did he find out Mr. Yorkin was staying in that hotel room getting ready to do the redhead? Couple thing I didn't understand? Also, his escape from the hotel was horrible!

I never thought of watching "Patch" Addams as a deranged photo technician! LOLI was thrilled by what happened with the main character, Sy, and sometimes wondered what is it like to feel that lonely. Should the filmmakers have included more of Sy's past? But in the end, these details are what make this film spectacular to experience.I'm still wondering why Sy requested to see such pictures at the end of the film. That's something everyone wonders when leaving the theater, I guess.Great film, specially if you like independent films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It'll make you think twice about getting your photos developed...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Romanek is a successful music video director who is making his first leap to feature film with this intriguing, albeit slow-paced, character study. The film revolves around Seymour 'Sy' Parrish, a one-hour photo clerk harboring a dangerous obsession with the Yorkin family, whose photos he has developed for many years. The last person I would have foreseen being cast in the role of Sy would have been Robin Williams, a man known primarily for his off-the-wall, cartoonish performances. After having watched this movie, I can picture no other actor wearing the blue Sav-Mart vest. The character of Sy is a very restrained, emotionally warped individual and this role shows the range of Williams's skill. Sy is probably one of the more fascinating characters in recent years. Despite his creepy, overbearing, and occasionally threatening behavior, it's hard not to sympathize with him and his obvious struggle for acceptance.Another aspect of this film I really enjoyed was the visual style brought to it by the cinematographer, Jeff Cronenweth. I loved the sterilized feel of the hyper-white aisles in Sav-Mart and the use of green and red filtered lights in some of Sy's scenes. In my opinion, this is probably one of the most aesthetically appealing movies from 2002.My only real complaint with the movie is the slow-pacing. There were points near the middle of the film where it almost felt like came to a complete stop. It didn't help that there were some scenes that seemed completely out-of-place and interrupted the film's flow (i.e. I still don't understand the relevance of Sy's nightmare). Thankfully, what the film lost with its pacing it made up for with its casting. Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, and Dylan Smith have great chemistry as the Yorkin family, the object of Sy's attention. Gary Cole (Bill Lumbergh from 'Office Space') has a minor role as the manager of the Sav-Mart and Eriq La Salle (of 'ER') makes an appearance as an agent of the local Threat Management Unit. And, of course, Robin Williams's fantastic performance as the disturbed one-hour photo clerk.This film brings us unseen depth from Robin Williams and a compelling story from a first-time filmmaker. The pro's heavily outweigh the con's in this independent gem and make it worth at least one good viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good but still Hollywood.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My grown-up kids keep objecting to my taste for foreign, French and Italian movies, in particular. I keep telling them that main stream Hollywood movies are rarely subtle... they hit you on the head on all fronts, visual and musical etc. etc. A good example of that is Photo. It is not a bad film but after the first 10 minutes you know where it is heading and from there on there is no escaping the stock characters, the stock situations and the stock explanations. Too bad because there is good acting and clever sets. Also, the last minute redeems the movie a tad because the ending, while using a rather hackneyed explanation for the hero's behavior still leaves us puzzled as to what the final resolution of this story is. This is not a bad thing as it gives the viewers further entertainment and mind stretching as they write their own scenarios after the curtain has fallen and the movie is discussed over coffee....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparing One Hour Photo with Evangelion...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Hour Photo" has something to deal with depression and some sexuality in it. However, this movie has one thing in relation to it, the animé "Neon Genesis Evangelion".So, you see Jake wanting a toy he wanted: a Mass-Produced EVA. Sy states to Jake that he's one of the "good guys", however, in the movie "End of Evangelion", they are really not.Sy, I'm guessing, is suffering from depression during this movie, and therefore is in some relation to Evangelion's Shinji Ikari (in which GAINAX's Hideaki Anno had suffered, therefore creating an animé with the main character with depression).Also in this movie, we see Sy resting and having a dream with endless shelves... eventually a scary sight with the eyes bleeding profusely. Then seconds later, the Mass-Produced EVA is standing on a nightstand. Think of "End of Evangelion", where Asuka Langley gets speared with the "Spear of Longinus" into her EVA's left eye, where she feels the pain. This spear, before transforming into Longinus (which the real one is on the Moon), was the weapon that the action figure has in hand, therefore the action figure is truly a bad guy, not a good guy.As Williams said in the commentary on the DVD, Evangelion is one of his most favorite animé... and the figure is one of his own from his personal collection.For being an EVA and Williams fan, this gets some serious attention and thought. 10/10 I give it.</fullReview>

After watching this movie I was amazed at Williams performance and the sheer depth of this film. Sy Perish (played by Williams) is a lonely photo finisher who secretly takes a certain families photos and pretending that they are his family. This film is not particularly easy to watch but keeps you drawn to it until the end. Robin Williams was excellent in this role proving that he's not just a one trick pony and has very impressive acting skills that make the film all the more believable and enjoyable. As you watch his character throughout the film you don't know what to feel for him. Sad or Sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sy the good guy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps most people got this movie as a cynical psychological thriller (which it most certainly is), but I was surprised that practically no one mentioned or recognized its truly important constant positiveness and overall moral message. This picture-like movie to me was a reminder of how good a life I live, of how good I really have it going. It reminded me that I fail to understand and appreciate this on a daily basis, that I fail to recognize that the warmness of my home, the love from people around me and the overall good that is the result of all this, is something I neglect and pay very little attention to. As did the picture-perfect family in this movie. And here is where the true meaning of "One hour photo" lies: it's not a story about a psychotic, neglected and non-social little man that took comfort in pretending to live a different life. It's about showing how even the ones that have it perfect don't always know how much they should be thankful for it...and in some cases even mess it up completely. The more I think about it, the more I actually see Sy as a sort of personified, flesh &amp; bone guarding angel. The soft and white tones of his hair, clothes, car and apartment further help make my point. When at the end of the movie he actually got into the position where he could have committed a serious crime, he instead punished the swindling couple by giving them both the lesson of their lives and left without a sense of guilt whatsoever. And as crazy as it sounds(even to me at this very moment), he was almost entitled to do what he did. Throughout the whole movie he was the voice of everybody that is less fortunate, of people that suffer through their lives and hope and dream of living a better one (hence his immense obsession with the Yorkins), and he was more than justified to act: he merely gave a reminder, nothing more and nothing less... ...It's a reminder that I'll need to be taught over and over again: to respect, love and appreciate what I've got. Kissing the ground I walk on should become my daily habit!:)7/10 The movie I can compare this one the most is definitely "Hard Candy", especially for the very real and possible story, as well as for the immensely brilliant aesthetics and detailed perfection of them both.Highly recommended, especially on a very laid-back night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A chillingly plausible and absorbing thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams gives a remarkably bold, subtle and stunning performance as sad and socially maladjusted convenience store worker Sy "The Photo Guy" Parrish. Sy has an unhealthy fixation on the seemingly perfect Yorkin family: loving mother Nina (a fine Connie Nielson), faithless, neglectful husband Will (the solid Michael Vartan), and sweet son Jacob (adorable Dylan Smith). When Sy gets fired from his job and discovers that Will has been cheating on Nina, his idealized perception of the Yorkins gets destroyed and he goes off the deep end into total despair and madness. Writer/director Mark Romanek relates the chilling and arresting story with exceptional precision and assurance; he does an especially expert job of vividly evoking a totally mundane and believable everyday working class reality which in turn makes the considerable suspense that much more powerful and gut-wrenching. Moreover, the central theme about violation of privacy and how loneliness can cause someone to go crazy adds additional resonance and even poignancy to the plot. Williams' astonishingly complex portrayal of the creepy, anal and obsessive, yet tragic and pitiable Sy holds the picture together and keeps things engrossing throughout. Kudos are also in order for the sterling supporting cast: Gary Cole as mean and overbearing store manager Bill Owens, Eriq La Salle as diligent detective James Van Der Zee, and Erin Daniel as Will's fetching mistress Maya Burson. Jeff Cronenworth's sharp, sparkling cinematography and the shuddery, pulsating score by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Kilmek are likewise up to par. A superior thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is a very sophisticated twist on the stalker sub-genre that, in its final moments, manages to elicit a fair amount of sympathy for the stalker from the audience. I suppose it's a truism that victims like Sy the Photo Guy eventually become the perpetrators of the crimes to which they were once subjected, but writer/director Mark Romanek is to be applauded for bringing a fresh slant on this fact. Robin Williams, in probably the best performance of his career, achieves just the right degree of contained, buttoned-down creepiness as Sy, a guy we all recognise. Sy's a loner, an invisible man living in a colourless world with only a hamster (as trapped as he is) for company.Well? a hamster and 800-odd snaps of the perfect Yorkin family he has filched from his employers. The Yorkin's family life is that which Sy aspires to, but which he can never have, so he contents himself by enjoying it vicariously through the snaps he develops for them. In their photos he sees a golden-hued utopia, as diametrically opposed from his sad, lonely life as it is possible to get. As his obsession with them threatens to topple over into violence and begins to impact on his own life, Romanek subtly manipulates our emotions and confounds our expectations before devising an ending that manages to satisfy the audience while still leaving loose ends.This is the kind of film you want to watch twice, so that you can pick up on all the clues and subtle hints that are so easily missed on first viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a Little Too Vague</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acting by Robin Williams was brilliant. He was really engaging as someone who was lonely and no one in his life. His only life was being the photo developer at Save-Mart (obviously, Walmart). He secretly keeps photos of his customers (and knows a lot about them). He loves his job, and is likable with his customers. Trouble begins when he starts delving into the personal life of a family that he has film developed for. Williams' character can't stand the fact that the father is having an affair. He decides to take action in his own hands. After all, in his delusional mind, he is the "uncle" of the family. The movie really shows how lonely and abandoned someone can be that they have to dream up a family life of their own. Gary Cole plays the boss. He is not likable and a bit too bossy. At one point, Cole tries to bar Williams' from returning to the store after being fired. There was no cause for this at this point. Williams had done nothing yet. The thing I didn't like about this film was that it never really committed to anything. Was he a total nut case without redemption? Did he have an agenda that was important? What was the point of the film? What is the film trying to say? I think the creators of the film were intentionally trying to blur this, because in today's World life is complicated and motives unclear. The best illustration of this blurring is when William's took pictures of his bosses's son and sent them to him. Williams may have been threatening his family, or just simply trying to show that he has power and control. That may have been the point of the movie. It is never entirely clear - people's motives in today's World. The movie could have done a better job though giving the audience a direction to work with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-developed Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A creepy photo lab technician becomes obsessed with the family of one of his customers, leading to grave consequences. Williams is appropriately creepy yet he seems somewhat mannered and unconvincing in the role. Although it is told primarily from his point of view, we never really learn what motivates Williams to behave in the bizarre ways that he does. The plot is silly and preposterous, including the unconvincing notion that a man would cheat on a babe like Nielsen. What's the point of the flashback structure? It does not help the story in any way. The film is generally entertaining though, and the scenes where Williams imagines himself as Uncle Sy are amusing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw this film for the first time on TV the other night. Neither of us has ever been much of a Robin Williams fan, considering his style OTT and unsubtle. But his performance as the quiet Sy Parrish blew us both away. Sy is a lonely man who lives a lonely life in a bare, bland apartment. To give himself the comfort he needs, he 'adopts' (without their knowledge) a local family who always take their photos to his lab in the mall. He makes copies of their photos and displays his favourites on his wall, and he even claims to be related to them. When he finds out (via photos) that the husband is cheating on his wife, he gets mad... This is a very sad film almost all the way through, somewhat reminiscent of Shyamalan's style. Some moments are so touching and acted so well (again amazed at Williams' underplaying) that it can bring a lump to the throat. The end is beautifully done. One to savour.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first hour is really absorbing ! Robin Williams gives one of his best performances as a solitary man ,who lives his life vicariously ,when he watches photographs of other people 's joys."Photographs are never taken when something sad happens ;if all that remains from our civilization is some photo albums,then they will think we were always happy".Best scene is perhaps the one when,all in a dream, he gets into the family circle ,sitting on the sofa and watching TV,waiting for a joyful "hello how are you uncle Sy?" Williams,under his large smile,hides something disturbing,threatening ,and he is more convincing than in his "insomnia " part.The last thirty minutes are not on the same level;handicapped by Vartan's lack of presence and Nielsen's underwritten part,the movie becomes "déj? vu" -which it was not in its original brilliant first hour" .Only the final dialog with the cop redeems them:"you're a family man,I can tell it by your ring,you are a happy man" Why is Sy such a lonely man?why hasn't he got a single friend? A relative?Perhaps his past was too hard to bear and that's why he took refuge in a happiness set for eternity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie making at its finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I was absolutely astonished by Robin Williams performance. In my opinion his best acting yet. The movie does an amazing job of pushing a feeling on you. In parts you just feel uncomfortable watching and creeped out, just wanted to yell, STOP BEING SO WEIRD. The shots the lighting the acting and the music add together to make you get this strong feeling, feeling exactly what the movie wants you to feel when it wants you to feel that way. That being an important part of a movie it does a perfect job, the movie also left me with a kinda "memento" aftermath feeling after I was done watching it. Leaving me to think about what I had just saw like the movie memento did, thuo probably less strong of a feeling. It gave me that puzzle piece falling together conclusion by the end you just thought about all the little details that all added up it was perfect, like a thousand threads making a perfect piece of cloth. It gave me the same aftermath feel as memento but didn't give me the constant headache memento did through out it, considering the movie was all backwards. For it being a relatively low budget film and a break out for the director it was a perfect piece of art, and should be enjoyed by allot more people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A superb film - a credit to all concerned, especially the art director who must have gone mad setting up all those snapshots! What I enjoyed most about One Hour Photo is the structure and pacing; people looking for cheap thrills won't get it at all, but it builds on the blatant creepiness of Sy until you really worry about what he's capable of; and the resolution is perfectly sequenced. Eriq LaSalle perfectly underplays the dispassionate 'family man' cop. There's plenty of suggested back story too - it seems as though Sy was a victim of "the worst thing you're afraid of ... has already happened", ie kiddy porn in his abusive childhood in this context, which explains his utter social incompetence, yearning for 'proper family' and drive to act out the abuse once again. Why not a 10? Because er, perversely, I think Robin Williams, although impressive beyond what you might expect, is ever so slightly over the top. Many who found it boring have commented that they didn't believe the basic plot premise of a nosey photo guy for a second, and Williams is so very creepy from the start that you do wonder, in an otherwise 'realistic' film, why nobody comments on what an absolute creep he is, though the manager seems glad to be rid of him... I kept thinking of Mrs. Doubtfire (who also wouldn't have fooled a myopic crack addict for a minute). But the unusual premise, superb direction (the escape sequence in the hotel, for example) and excellent soundtrack had me hooked; this film is clearly a cut above as a thriller while addressing a serious issue intelligently. Hitchcock, eat your heart out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>how excellent Robin Williams is in this film. I am very interested in anything Mark Romanek now directs. Everyone will be interested in this suspense/thriller; for different reasons.Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan are also very good as the victimized couple. What is interesting is the understated film technique, acting and theme of this film.I was fortunate to have seen the screening for this movie, as well as the director's comments. Cy Parrish (Williams) is a disaffected photo processor in a local Wal-Mart type store. I loved him in this role, yet the fact that he pulled it off is testament to his ability.Connie Nielsen and her son are the objects of obsession for Cy. While nothing is ever completely explained- that is what Romanek has portrayed so brilliantly. This film is like real life in that- you may encounter people every day- yet do not know/assume what they are thinking.Most of the theme is portrayed visually- a brilliant move on Romanek's part. Whatever has happened to Cy as a child, he clearly wishes for a family now- we see the bleak, sad life as he drives home from work in his Ford Focus; he is a reliable decent worker, but something is awry.Gary Cole is amusing as the anal-retentive store manager (similar in "Office Space") he tells Cy (a 50+ year old man) people come in to save 10 cents on a pair of socks- this is retail. The true banality of corporate America exposed.Eriq DeLasalle portrays the detective of the "Threat Management Unit" who investigates Cy.This film is suspenseful, well-acted, and not predictable. Thank you Mark Romanek and all actors involved!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be a much smaller movie but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...it's still a very effective and chilling film!Taking a different variation on the creepy theme from the previous Insomnia,Robin Williams is Sy Parrish,a lonely,mostly(accent mostly)harmless film developer at a Wal-Mart type store. His job allows him to be a sort of "fly on the wall" to people's lives,as they entrust their private photos,which seems to amuse him as well as feed his knowledge and curiosity,about both film AND people. He develops an attachment to a handsome,upper-middle class family named the Yorkins(Michael Vartan,Connie Nielsen and Dylan Smith)and prizes the calm,sanctity and seeming normalcy of their relationship.So when he discovers,through developing a roll of their photos one day that the father is having an affair with a co-worker,this begins to rip away at what Sy has treasured. Given his already tenuous grip on reality and low sense of self-identity,the damage becomes incrementally frightening.Where Insomnia had Williams in an almost unbending menacing role(hope I'm not giving anything away there!),One Hour Photo takes Williams down a much subtler,more sympathetic path. You could feel empathy for him at any point of the movie. You could do it with OR without feeling any dread or any sense of menace about his character.And,of course,you could JUST find him simply creepy,too. The Yorks:Will,the cheating,seemingly above-it-all dad,Nina,the reserved but vulnerable wife and Jake,the kid(who seems to be the only one that shows even a vague suspicion about Sy's quirkiness,though even he seems to be more amused than scared) are prefect counter-balances and surrogates for the audience,as we slowly begin to realize what kind of obsession is at play here.The summary title comes from a theory I've had since I first saw the movie in theaters on first release:I have a funny feeling this movie could've just as easily been translated in a film-short and not been any less effective,but as a full-length feature,this takes on layers that make this film a more viscerally effective piece of fiction. Director and writer Mark Romanek has created a great first-effort film,with characters that are flesh-deep and real and images(particularly of the cold fluorescent-lit department store)that are as haunting as they are mundane. Great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One hour photo, two hour thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams is mostly known for comedic performances such as Mrs. Doubtfire and Mork and Mindy. In this movie, he plays a seriously deranged psychotic photo department clerk who goes crazy after he learns that he no longer has the ability to service his customers- especially a family of three whom he has been stalking for over ten years. I thought that it was a breath of fresh air to see Robin Williams take on a scary role and I really liked the movie because it showed the range of characters that the actor can do. During the movie I watched how different he looked, walked and spoke. The dream scene with the eyes made me jump and the "wall of fame" gave way to how insane the character of Sy really was. After seeing this movie, all of my photos will be digital from now on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams' Best Role Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terror of the unknown can come under so many disguises, so it's no wonder that the most antiseptic of settings -- a shopping mall reminiscent of WalMart -- spawns the terrifying creature that is Seymour "Sy" Parrish.And how many of us haven't gone to these stores to develop our pictures not really paying attention to the man or woman who takes the time to make them come alive (and in one hour, at that)? We live in a society that values privacy, but nevertheless we leave ourselves more naked than we would like to think -- and this is a prime example. Because customer service representatives have been trained to smile at all times and be "of service" to their customers, when one of them becomes just a little too intrusive for comfort, no one notices. At first.This is where Sy Parrish comes in. Played by Robin Williams who carries the entire movie on his shoulders, he could be anyone, the friendly guy behind the counter of whom we know nothing. A quiet, non-descript man who has no attachments, he could fade into anonymity at any time and would not be missed. Only one person feels pity for him, Jake Yorkin, who frequents the store with his mother Nina Yorkin, and he even expresses it. "It seems Sy's a sad man," he says, and he's more than right. Sy is a broken man. Just how broken he is we will find out later on.People like Sy Parrish are bombs of anger and self-hatred waiting to explode and cause irreparable damage. Because of the hurt they've experienced they've become sponges absorbing what they deem orderly and perfect, so once they focus their warped interest on someone else, it's as if they were literally absorbing everything about that person. Mark Romanek doesn't waste too much time in exposing Parrish for what he is -- a creepy stalker -- in one masterful shot of Sy's entire living room wall covered in pilfered pictures of the Yorkin's at different times of their lives, no doubt taken every time they would visit his kiosk to get their pictures developed, as he watches -- stares, fixated -- at "The Simpsons". But despite this disturbing picture, there's a sense of sympathy, even if it comes later as Sy's psyche comes unraveling and his actions stem from an act of infidelity that someone else's pictures reveal. Will Yorkin isn't exactly the nicest man around and one scene -- a heated argument between he and Nina, early in the film -- establishes his character as a man tired of his family, throwing it all away for a sordid affair. Does this justify Sy's actions? No, but for a man who only wants to do what's right -- even when he himself deludes himself to believing the book he reads (which Nina is also reading) and the lie of the woman's picture whom he calls his mother -- this is all he knows.Mark Romanek has only done one other movie that I can recall, and haven't seen, but his video work is fascinating. Why this man hasn't done more films is beyond me, because as a visual storyteller whose work is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick. Some of his videos have gone down as the best ever (such as his rendition of the video "Hurt" or Madonna's "Rain"). His mastery in pacing this story is evident. I loved that he creates an escalating sense of suspense and dread with the smallest of elements: a continuous barrage of photo shoots of a little girl playing in the front yard becomes a predator's way of revealing himself. Shown in quick succession, they become quite terrifying. Also, the way Romanek avoids showing a drop of blood and gore -- internalizing Sy's fantasy world, making his anger only vaguely hinted at, but getting him ever so closer to the Yorkin's with his kindness. Except for the final explanation scene, reminiscent of PSYCHO as told by Sy himself, ONE HOUR PHOTO is an almost flawless art-house thriller of a man collapsing into insanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big fan of the Cable Guy, I had high hopes for this movie. No, One Hour Photo isn't a dark comedy, but it stars a renowned comedian portraying a stalker, so it relates in that aspect.With thriller movies, you can't reveal too much of what happens, otherwise it may spoil the experience. So, I can't really go into too much detail about any of the events in this film, but I will say that it did, at many moments, keep me at the edge of my seat. It's indeed very creepy.However, we seemed to have another case of 'Good movie, bad ending'. It's not as bad as Identity was; in other words, the ending wasn't so bad that it ruined the entire movie; but, it was dumb. This is just in my personal opinion. I felt that the ending could have been awesome if they went for a different approach. But, when the final moments of the movie unfold, I was just like ".....oh." I felt kind of let down when the credits began to roll.Great movie... it's an excellent film to watch in the dark... however, just don't look forward to a great ending. I'm sure that most other viewers would be disappointed with it as well.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could Have Been Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is a film filled with good ideas but none of them go anywhere unless they go backwards which they do sometimes. The greatest idea of them all is the big one of the crazy guy who becomes obsessed with a family after looking at their photos or snapshots and actually begins to believe he is Uncle Sy part of the family. And than after he finds out that the father is having an affair and that the family is not perfect he breaks down. This could have been an extremely disturbing and deeply scary film but instead it ends up simply being a little disturbing and a little scary, and thats simply because of the idea, you get scared about the same amount just thinking about it. It falls apart mostly because of the script which while trying to make Sy look like more than just a monster ends up giving him almost no development at all, in other words you don't care about him. There's very good direction here though, he has some great symbolism the colors especially. May be worth watching for some of the performances and the direction, maybe someone will take the hint from this movie and make a better film out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't find "One Hour Photo" to be that exciting as a movie. What i enjoyed about it was mostly the restrained style and the fact that for once movie-makers understand that gore is unnecessary to create suspense. What felt less appealing was the fact that in the end the story is not that dramatic and it felt a little too "light".In the end "One Hour Photo" is Robin Williams show. I have always said that he is at his best when the role is as serious as possible. Here his performance reminded me much of his performance in "Insomnia". Both are sensitive and solid portrayals of psychotic people that have much going on beneath a calm surface. Something that suits Williams very well."One Hour Photo" is a rather good movie and i enjoyed it. As a thriller it's not exceptional but it's solid and Robin Williams in the lead is the factor that really makes it worth while.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific, offbeat thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well now, another one where my review appears to have disappeared into thin air. So here we go again. ONE HOUR PHOTO is a near-perfect effort at a slightly different thriller, as a shy and retiring photo clerk (Williams) working in a Wal Mart-type store fantasizes about living out his life with a young family who are frequent and familiar customers of his store. Williams is magnificent as the very creepy Sy the Photo Guy, who makes an extra set of every batch of negatives the family drops off for processing. His home is a shrine to this family. Problem is, he then decides to take things a step further, and from that point the film enters Twilight Zone territory. The ending proved extremely controversial. Some folks loved it, some hated it, but no one was indifferent to it. I have very mixed feelings about it myself. I find it almost anti-climatic. See the film and decide for yourself. And then let me know what you think. The white and pastel motif of the store and Sy's wardrobe is extremely interesting, and reminded me of the whited-out imagery from Williams' previous flick, INSOMNIA, in which he played a very devious serial killer. My favorite scene has Sy sitting on the floor of his photo studio, but I will say no more so you may enjoy the scene as it plays out. I will tell you it is a major turning point in Sy's "evolution" from voyeur to stalker. One big flaw in this otherwise highly entertaining film: Connie Nielson's bizarre and distracting hairdo. It actually does go with her quirky personality in this quirky film, but still it is a major turnoff. Sort of like Harrison Ford's stylized hairdo in PRESUMED INNOCENT. You end up focusing on Ford's hair more than Ford himself in that one. His hair should have been billed separately.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One Hour Photo" is a great thriller that unabashedly borrows tactics from Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining": the tracking shots, the "linear" cinematography, the Black guy who can't wait to help the white family, a sensitive child character, and the overall weirdness. I read in the IMDb trivia that Jack Nicholson was originally asked to play the role of "Sy", but that would have made this film into too obvious of a "Shining" rip-off. Robin Williams' convincing and compassionate acting as "Sy" bent the film in a different direction. He is much more subtle than Nicholson, who we can imagine as being constantly at the boiling point in many of his other roles. Williams delivers a feminized performance, where even his victims, being held at knifepoint can't seem to be dominated by his weak persona. This movie is full of thriller genre clichés, yet is still very engaging and likable.</fullReview>

Who on earth thinks that a close-up of his face creates tension in a movie? Does he get praise for his ability to look moody, and staring off into the distance?

I've read the reviews and frankly I don't understand why it's not universally liked. The only reason I can conceive is that Robin Williams has been the underdog/hero for so long that perhaps people are having a hard time accepting him as the villain.These characters were well developed, the story was creatively written, the direction was strong and the plot was rather edgy. This was an excellent attempt and greatly boosted my estimation of Robin Williams's future career.I enjoyed this movie tremendously and look forward to Robin Williams's next endeavor with a level of anticipation that I have not felt about his movies in a very long time.

		<fullReview>This is one film that should have been nominated for Best Actor. It is not only the look of Robin Williams, but also his performance as Sly Parrish which elevates this from film-festival fare to nail-biting terror. It is creepy to hear the first-person narration, and awe at how Robin stayed in character; when he jokes in this movie, it is very eerie. Romanek uses the locations very well throughout the film such as when Sly gets a photo at a yard sale even though she has been in Sav-Mart many times before, and had her photos developed by Sly, you can see her nervousness around him has not faded. In fact, the main characters are very much alike: they present a certain face to hide their true feelings; Nina wears stylish clothes and high-heeled boots to stand out from everybody else, and maintain a image of being the picture-perfect wife. The director also takes advantage of his background in music videos in a sequence at the Yorkin's house. The musical score is very good. Overall, I believe that One Hour Photo may be a symbol of the future independent film, where plot and style meld perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not being a fan of Robin Williams' comedy, I was surprised to appreciate his straight-playing in Insomnia. However, One Hour Photo pushes this up ten-fold and he's simply outstanding. One Hour Photo is the tale of a lonely man who's obsessed with a young family, most likely because as their photo developer he's seen all their happy pictures and wants so much to have that in his own life. And yet can't, so is fixated on them. Williams' as 'Si the photo guy' is superlative at portraying an apparently normal person whose demons run deep and who is disturbed by his own obsession. Connie Neilson oozes class as as the mother who seems to have the idyllic life, and Michael Vartan is suitably distant as the father whose work seems to stop him being as much of a family member as he should be.The pace of the movie is unrelenting, and although it *is* a short movie it seems to go by in minutes. The direction is outstanding too, with superb cinematography adding to the atmosphere of contradictions of loneliness and togetherness.Overall a fantastic thriller and brilliantly played.</fullReview>

Photo is music video director Mark Romanek's first movie was writer-director, and it's very distinctive that it is. It's hard to explain, it just looks like a rookie operation.Williams plays Sy, a photo clerk at SavMart, a Target type place. He loves his job very much, and his customers more so. His favorite family includes the Yorkins, Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan) and Jake (Dylan Smith), who Sy thinks is a perfect family. He makes extra copies of their photos for himself, and in his apartment he has a wall filled with their cherished memories. However, Nina and Will are on shaky ground, presumably about money, but we can't really tell. When Sy realizes this, and something else that's quite obvious, he doesn't like how he's been misled. And he gets angry. This shy soul doesn't like that, and he's going to do something about it.The greatest pro and the greatest con both involve Romanek's script. Romanek has created almost a fantasy world, where it seems that everything is going right. The story is so original it seems like it could have been a true story. The character of Sy rings so true, it shows that we all know a Sy somewhere in our lives, yet we don't take the time to notice him. However, the supporting characters were some of the most uninteresting I have seen in a movie this year. I didn't care about the Yorkin family one bit. Not only that, but there was no development of the Yorkins. What did Will do that we were supposed to know? We didn't know. What about anything about Nina or Jake? I have no idea. I wanted less of the Yorkins and more of Sy.A reason it is apparent that Romanek is a auteur director is that he expects all scenes that could be thrilling to be thrilling. They could have been made tense but instead Romanek just assumes that we think it is. Although that scene, bound to be famous soon, in the hotel room at the end was, the rest of the movie wasn't. Williams showed yet again how versatile he is; he can star in comedy or drama with perfect ease. He was superb. However, all of the Yorkin family came off dull and flat. Gary Cole, as the one-note boss, was way better than people should be in supporting roles like that. Overall, One Hour Photo is an interesting drama with great lead acting.My rating: 7/10Rated R for sexual content and language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Than Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film developer becomes obsessed with a family by viewing them through their photographs. I thought Robin Williams would be dying to play against type and sink his teeth into the role of Bad Guy... I thought he'd be dying for a chance to create a memorable or original psychotic, but no such luck. Turns out he's all but invisible when he isn't frantically babbling in search of a punchline. As a result this is a flat, forgettable exercise in by-the-numbers pseudo-stalking.The two things that really bothered me about this turkey:#1) Connie Nielsen's hair is so perfect, so salon-fresh, so boldly styled in every shot that it completely distracted me from everything else. I am not usually one to notice details like this, but her hair was so artfully sculpted in proudly-absurd styles (even when she is supposed to be fearing for the life of her husband) that I had to laugh out loud. #2) Michael Vartan, who plays father Will Yorkin, manages to create NO character whatsoever. He plays a husband cheating on his wife, yet even after he is caught in bed with his lover and physically tortured by Williams, he is STILL unable to express any emotion whatsoever. Avoid this film. It's disposable pap.GRADE: D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams makes a good creep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. Williams plays Sy, a creepy loner photo-tech who has no life outside work and becomes obsessed with the Yorkin family. He makes a copy of their pictures for himself and puts them on a wall in his apartment. He fantasizes about being part of their family and how great of a life they have. He envies the Yorkins. He follows the kid, Jake, to soccer practice, and the mom, Nina, to the mall. One day a girl brings in photos and he recognizes her from one of the Yorkins photos. So, he looks at her pictures and sees that Will Yorkin is cheating on his wife. This greatly upsets him because he doesn't like seeing a guy who he thinks has the greatest life throw it all away.Sy gets fired from work and really starts stalking the Yorkins. He decides Will must pay. He confronts Will and his mistress at a hotel and I won't spoil it any more because what Sy does is so creepy and disturbing.FINAL VERDICT: Williams does a great acting job as Sy. And seeing this life of a really messed up photo-tech was really disturbing and very good. I recommend this one for anyone looking for a drama or thriller or a character driven movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behind the smiley face.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS.Freud called it "sublimation" when you convert your neurotic anxiety into a constructive channel such as your work or your art, and that's what Robin Williams shows his character doing here, in a fine subdued dramatic performance. People bring their film to him to be developed in the SavMart.And although he's nothing more than a smiley face to them, they are much more to him. He knows them all, their quirks, their joys, and their families. In fact he runs off an extra copy of family photos -- children playing, wedding ceremonies, vacations, the usual dull stuff -- and takes them home and tapes them across an entire wall of his apartment. When he's not watching The Simpsons (a family show) on TV, he's sitting back in his chair glowing with pleasure as he looks at his wall.Not that he's entirely happy. He laments the fact (in a literate and observant narration) that if we were to judge families just from the snapshots they take, it would be misleading. People just take snaps of joyous moments. They neglect everyday subjects like the used bandaid, the wasp on the jello, the edges of the sofa cushions -- things nobody pays attention to, like himself. What a well-done movie for a first-time director. One notices first the use of lighting and color. The SavMart in which Williams works is all fluorescent light and sterility -- the dominant hues are blue, white, and cream. The only advancing colors we see, warm reds and oranges, are associated with the family that occupies most of his attention, the Yorkins. His home, like his workplace, is so sterile and tidy that it makes an ordinary space look like McSorley's Old Ale House.The family snaps bloom like a spring garden of flamelike orange. The wall that they cover is the only sign of life in Williams' home, aside from the pet hamster that runs endless miles in its silly circular cage. If the film were any more "symbolic" it would have to be European. The actors wear matching wardrobes. Williams' uniform is flawless for its purpose. A blue vest, starchy gray shirt and matching tie, gray trousers, and a pair of those ugly plastic shoes with thick gum soles -- all gray. Williams is first-rate in the part, not just his bland professional behind-the-counter smile or his tentative voice but his movements, his body language. It's stilted, stiff, robotic, as if requiring an immense amount of effort to control. The black detective is good as well, if more sympathetic than we'd expect from an ordinary cop. And so is Connie Nielson, whom Williams takes to following around. (Why not?)The director has done a fine job. Camera movements are generally measured pans, and shots are held for enough time for us to absorb their contents. (What a relief after having been so often zapped in recent movies.) The influence of David Lynch, the Coen brothers, and Stanley Kubrick is there -- but not to an objectionable extent. The director is fond of the kind of brightly lighted scenes that Kubrick used to find so attractive. (See the scene between Nicholson and the waiter in the men's room in "The Shining" for an example of what I mean.) Originality shows in this movie. A less thoughtful flick would have -- could EASILY have -- included the butchery of two guilty people in the nude.Or -- when Williams has a nightmare -- he COULD have screamed, shot up from his bed, and shoved his face jarringly into the camera, but he doesn't. The nightmare, by the way, has blood squirting in buckets from Williams' eyes. There are lots of eyes in this movie. Williams at one point interrupts a lecture on eye surgery. And lots of camera lenses. The only thing that leave me puzzled a bit is the denouement, in which Williams quizzes the black detective and tells him he's a good father, and that he'd never make his children do sick things. Williams' face twists with angry distress as he says this, and the detective comments, "I think I understand, Sy." I'd rather NOT understand, if what we're meant to understand is that Williams' father was a child abuser. That's too cheap a shot to fit into the rest of this superior story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Penetrating Psychological Study</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>8 out of 10 Sy is one of those everyday type of guys you see around and then completely forget. Yet everyone DOES have a life even if for some it is only an inner life. For Sy it is a typical suburban family who he has known for years due to the fact that he develops there pictures. His obsession with them grows until it spills over with frightening results. Sounds like the basic setup for another psycho/stalker scenario and yet it isn't. This film far exceeds that and in many ways takes it into a whole new level. At times this film seems much more like a drama or even a sad movie. You actually feel for this Sy guy. He is still threatening, but in a much more complex way. The director does a very good job at getting you into Sy's emotional state. The color schemes and music bring you into Sy's world and makes for a lasting impression. The nightmare sequence is especially well done. Williams, as Sy, is terrific. His venture into unchartered territory has proved to be a successful one. His comic persona has always had a sort of 'lonely boy looking for attention' type quality. He creates a character that has a dark side and yet still shows a lot of humanity. He gets the viewer to become sensitive with someone they might not otherwise want to. This creates good tension as the viewer then becomes torn between liking him and fearing him. If there is anything wrong with what is otherwise an outstanding effort is the fact that it seems to be too rehearsed and neatly packaged. It's point is too bombarded and there seems to be no opening for a more free form style. The stylization is strong and at times drowns out the reality of the films main message. Yet on the whole director Romanek shows a lot of promise. He respects his characters and doesn't try to exploit them. His script is intelligent and dark and yet still tasteful and restrained. His filming and choosing of the young actor who plays the child is good example of this. He is not overly cute or precocious. He shows the natural awkwardness of a typical child and yet still conveys a perception to things that the adults don't. He is a child as they really are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****Couple of spoilers...if you plan on seeing this, don't read****When I first saw the trailer for "One Hour Photo" I was expecting a horror film about a crazed photo developer. Instead we get a story about this man named Seymour "Cy" Parris, who is literally obsessed with his job. But he takes interest into his customers as well, one family in particular, The Yorkins. He takes so much interest, that he makes doubles of pictures they develop, Follows them home..watches there activities..the usual Stalker material.The movie goes on to show how "Cy" is an alienated person in life...deprived of friendship..No family backround. He's overall just an empty guy, looking for friendship, and ultimately this family "The Yorkins" He has all these dreams of being "Uncle Cy" ...Aww..I think the movie is great, it kinda kept you on the edge of your seat, It had a very easy going, intriguing storyline. Most of all you just wanted to see what Mr. "Cy" Was all about.Cy ends up losing his job at the photo area, and he loses control of his emotions as well. And that's when the movie took kinda a bad turn. It got dark..And things like adultery, Assault, Attempted murder..These are brought into the picture.Now, overall, I did like the movie. I only have one problem...the very end of the movie, Like the whole outcome of the family. Will Yorkin (Michael Vartan) Has been committing adultery. Once Cy finds this out, his perfect family is ruined. So he goes on a rampage to teach Mr. Yorkin a lesson. So, CY does a lot of mean things to him...Cy gets arrested..OkayThe whole movie lead on you to think that Cy was looking for this family to take him in. It's unbelievable they decide to after what he did to Mr. Yorkin, and his petafile like instincts...not exactly flattering, more like creepy. 7/10 stars- I guess There's no such thing as happily ever after -</fullReview>

Robin Williams does an amazing job of playing a mentally ill stalker in this film. But then again, I've heard that he really is crazy, so maybe he wasn't acting at all! The story line is interesting and suspenseful, but, the film falls short at the end. I expected more and since I didn't get more, I was disappointed. If you plan on seeing this don't get your hopes up for what you think is going to happen to happen.

		<shortDescription>Makes anybody think twice about stalking somebody. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underplayed at times, but like THE TRUMAN SHOW effective in it's portrayal of a world within fantasy, ONE HOUR PHOTO is a truly chilling, thought-provoking movie that capitalises on the current vogue for obsession with familiarity. As the 'Bennifer' show continues unabated in spite of the failure of GIGLI at the US box-office and the reality shows like POP IDOL, BIG BROTHER and such-like are at their peak of popularity, such is the power and potential of cinema to take a look at the darker side of reality.ONE HOUR PHOTO utilises a genuine lack of gore and blood to provide a maximum worth of entertainment from a deceptively simple plot. Robin Williams is at his finest as the lonely photobooth developer who has never known any other job than this one and becomes friendly with a family and results in taking copies of pictures they have sent to be developed. The family in question is actually under strain and Williams' character sees a way to become accepted into the vogue by being even more friendly with the son of the couple in question. I have to admit with the whole issue of protection of children at the moment, which is quite potent in light of the Holly and Jessica murders and with the Bulger tragedy still fresh in everyone's minds after a decade, the scene in which Williams tries to give the son a present made my stomach churn and heightens the power this first-rate psychological drama has.Williams is as far away from some of his more comedic roles and indeed is virtually unrecognizable from the more dramatic movies he has done over the years (GOOD WILL HUNTING, DEAD POETS SOCIETY; admittedly, the latter does have comic moments, but it is more bittersweet than comic!) and it is because of that that he is all the more effective.Compelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great film for its qualities, despite my desire for more character development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is a thriller where Robin Williams plays a psycho with a conscience. It's a nicely paced, intelligent suspense film, where its qualities lie on aesthetic qualities, such as pace, soundtrack, and other dramatic elements. This is not a movie that relies on surprise, shock, or intrigue.The plot revolves around Robin Williams' character, Sy Parrish, a lonely and introverted photo lab technician at a SavMart convenience store. He lives his life vicariously through the photos of the regulars who drop off their film to be processed. One of his quips in a long series of narratives interjected throughout the movie, reminds us that, `people take pictures of happy times in their lives. No one ever takes a picture of something they want to forget.' The happier he perceives other people, the more he withdraws from his own life and seeks to be a part of theirs. But it's a special family, the Yorkins - a mother, father and son -- that he most strongly bonds to over the past nine years. He fantasizes that he is their `Uncle Sy', and in his mind, they treat him as such. As his emotional stability becomes increasingly unbalanced, he finally snaps when he discovers a secret that could tear apart the family.What carries the film is the character profiles and excellent visual qualities. The characters reflect their environment: cold, stark, and generically plain. Physical spaces are large, vast areas of empty isles, huge rooms, fluourescently lit sterile environments - just like the people. In a sense, nothingness. Yet, there is a lot underneath. And this is where the film's lesser quality comes in.The characters lack is a sense of depth. Psychotics are more interesting when we know their history - we don't know anything about Sy's past, and the notion that he has none takes away more than it adds. There are other conflicts that go untested, which also leaves a sense of incompleteness. (We don't need `resolution', just a sense that an issue is addressed.) For all the empty vastness of the movie that symbolizes Sy's profile, it's a perfect time to add a tiny drop of black paint on a vast white canvas: show something that gives us history. Many of Sy's pivotal plot-turning acts are done more for symbolic effect rather than to guide the plot along, and are therefore left with question-marks over the audience's collective head. Why would he do certain things? He's supposed to be cold and calculating, but some of his actions are anything but.One Hour Photo is almost more of an artsy film than a mainstream one, and in that genre, these concerns really needn't be addressed to satisfy its target audience. In the end, I loved the film, and all its qualities, despite my desire for more character development.This is Robin Williams' third film of 2002, all of which feature him as a psychotic. But it's this role that is probably the most dramatic and believable. What makes it even better is that you almost forget it's him soon after the movie begins. For an actor as easily type-cast as Williams, this marks a notable step forward in the breadth of his work.The movie was written and directed by Mark Romanek, most known for music videos; most prominently, Madonna's 1999 video collection. This is his first film, unless you want to count his indie-effort, Static, in 1985, which didn't get very much attention. In One Hour Photo, Romanek uses techniques very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrik - with the ultra-wide-angle symmetry shots, long, quiet scenes, and dramatic pauses between lines to achieve a sense of suspense and psychological drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Difficult Movie To Rate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie; I'm just not sure how much to be perfectly honest!Overall, I think this is probably the best dramatic performance that I've seen Robin Williams offer. His portrayal of Sy the Photo Guy (obsessed with a family whose pictures he's been developing for years) was probably as "creepy" a performance as I've seen, made even more so by the fact that the movie contains no overt violence, although there are several points in the movie when you expect it to. It's very much a psychological thriller, and it works very well.Perhaps Williams' strong performance actually hindered the movie in a way, though. The other characters didn't seem well developed. In particular I thought the performances of Michael Vartan as Will Yorkin and Eriq LaSalle as Det. Van Der Zee were weak and unconvincing. The DVD version I saw had an iteresting commentary version of the movie by Williams and director Mark Romanek. (I didn't watch it all, but certain scenes seemed to cry out for their perspectives - in particular the closing scene which leaves open the question of whether it was a fantasy of what Sy wanted or a look ahead to a reality that finally developed. I vote for the former.)In the end, though, I don't think I'd watch this again, and as I rate movies, if I wouldn't watch it again the highest I give it is a 6. So that's where this one falls. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a friend who will hear nothing good about Robin Williams (and that's cool, because there is nothing wrong with dissenting opinions-in fact I will always welcome the other side of the coin). Nevertheless, `One Hour Photo' is just another example that proves my friend wrong, and if he doesn't like it he knows what he can do with his opinion.I did not set out to make a brief survey of Robin William's acting career, but `One Hour Photo' prompted me to do so. Now, the chances are that Mr. Williams will never go down as one of the greatest actors of our (or any time), and rightly so. However, his contributions to film cannot be overlooked. I can think of no other comedian that has ever tried his hand at `serious' roles and actually succeeded the way he has. I mean, Robin Williams does, in fact, hold an Oscar and has been nominated on numerous occasions. What's more, unlike Jim Carrey (who might have a shot at the `serious' tip), Williams started with a dramatic role in only his second feature film! That would be `The World According to Garp;' and along with such noble (if not pretty darn cool) efforts such as, `Dead Poet's Society,' `Awakenings,' `The Fisher King,' `Good Will Hunting,' and `What Dreams May Come,' we can see that he has risen to the occasion (sometimes in grand style) and he is not so much of a hack. Which brings me to back to `One Hour Photo'?There was nothing wrong with this movie; nothing wrong with Robin Williams' performance (he was convincing, well suited for the role, and showed nice acting nuances). The movie had an interesting plot, it was well paced; it had a nice color palate, and it had a few subtle plot strokes. However, I only feel compelled to give it a 7.6/10, overall. I don't know why. Maybe the movie was just too NICE. But, I did enjoy it! I will even venture to say that if Robin Williams had not played the lead, then the movie might not have been anything.Anyway, a `7.6' is not too shabby in my book. If I saw it for 10 bucks, used, I would purchase it for my collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most disturbing movie I feel I have ever seen, but boy is it a good movie as well! I am a fan of actors turning themselves into versatile performers, as you get to see them in many different ways. That is what Robin Williams is doing with his career right now and a smart move if you ask me. ?One Hour Photo' will make you think long and hard about the people that serve behind a shop counter, especially at your local photo developer.In ?One Hour Photo', Seymour "Sy" Parrish is a quiet, consummately professional photo lab technician employed in a huge, impersonal shopping centre. One customer, Nina Yorkin is unaware that Sy has been carefully printing off extra sets of her family snapshots for years, adding them to a photo collage he has assembled in his apartment. Just how far will the lonely Sy go to become part of Nina's seemingly perfect American family unit? This film was written and directed by Mark Romanek. The start of the movie was cleverly incorporated, setting everything up beautifully. I also love the great tension that Mark included in the film, through Sy's character throughout the movie, especially at the end of the film. I am sure that Seymour would be a character that Romanek will be keeping near and dear to him, as he is a brilliantly designed character, one that the movie going public will not forget too quickly. There are other things the Romanek did well in this film as well. I loved Sy's ?Photo wall' which was a clever idea by Mark. The scene that shows Parrish imaging being part of the Yorkin family was also well written by Romanek. This was Mark's first feature film, not a bad effort, considering before this he was doing music videos, a very big and successful change from where I see it.Robin Williams is an actor who has had a very successful, but somewhat predictable career. He has been in many films, as the same sort of goodie character all the time. So, it was with great anticipation that I was able to see Williams in one of his strongest, unsentimental performances, a role that gives him a completely different complexion. As he was in ?Insomnia', Williams is cast against type in ?One Hour Photo', again being the bad guy. He suits the bad guy genre and I hope he continues in this realm.Seymour Parrish is a truly disturbing character. He has no friends or family, and we know very little about him, only that he works at the local sav-mart, in the photo processing department and that he seems psychologically unstable. Sy can process your photos quickly and tell what size best suits the picture you have taken, (he says many times that photos done in 5x7 could be better choice than 6x4 etc). We also see him having many hard times, none more so, than what the boss of ?Sav-mart', Bill Owens (Gary Cole) says and does to him, which is just gut wrenching. He makes all of Sy's problems even worse. There are other important characters in the film. The Yorkin Family, Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan) and Jake (Dylan Smith) are a family that Parrish knows a lot about. This is another creepy side to his character, as he has memorised the Yorkin family's address and every other minor detail, which is truly scary. Then when Sy has the chance to uncover a big secret in the Yorkin familles seamlessly perfect life, he takes advantage of his job, by using photos brought in by one of Sy's many customers, that being Maya Burson (Erin Daniels), to do so. Then the way Parrish meddles in this predicament was a truly enthralling moment of the movie for me. Throughout the movie, we see Parrish being both investigated and integrated by Detective Van Der Zee (former ER star Eriq LaSalle), who finds Sy to be a big problem, who is difficult to handle. But enough about the plot, I will leave some of it for you to learn, so you can enjoy the richness of the movie experience. I must say I appreciated the work of cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth. I especially love the ?savmart' locations on the film and the different camera angles that Cronenweth shows us in that place, as I feel they jump out at you. There is also a very tainted look to different parts of the film, again Cronenweth's influence, which is understandable, considering we are dealing with photography and a sick man in the film. Robin Williams also looks quite nasty in this film, and he was helped to look this way by the make-up department, headed by Suzanne Rodier, who did a great job in making Williams look as menacing as he could be. I really like this movie, in particular Robin William's gripping performance that is in it. ?One Hour Photo' has been compared to the brilliant ?American Beauty', which is a big rap, and I can see where people are forming that opinion from. I have a friend who works at one of my town's local photo shops and I have recommended that he watches this film, as I am sure he could relate to the character of Seymour and what he goes through in vocational sense at the photo shop. I just hope he is not like him, which I am sure he is not. This film will make us appreciate how memorable photos can be for us all, and that obsessed people can be extremely disturbing for the community that we live in. I am certain they are much closer than we all think. Perhaps you might be served by someone like that someday? My advice to you is, keep on the look out for them! CMRS gives ?One Hour Photo': 4.5 (Very Good ? Brilliant Film) </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yo! I felt that the movie was plenty suspenseful and decent enough, although I don't really want to see Robin Williams in these kinds of roles anymore. That said, I've got (admittedly) nerdy gripes about the movie. The toy that Sy buys for the kid is an Evangelion, and as an anime fan, you don't know how happy I was to see it used in a movie. However, both Williams and the kid pronounce the name wrong (Evan-geh-leon, not Evanjellyion) but worse was when the kid identified the toy as "a good guy, he slices bad guys with his silver sword". I don't know if this was intentional or what, but that's about as wrong as you can get. The toy in question is one of the nerd Mass Production Evas, Units 5-13, which directly oppose the protagonists of the series and help bring about the End of the World nerd That's as much "bad guy" as you can get. Odds are whoever put the toy in the movie didn't care, but if you're gonna say it's name, for pete's sake, get the facts right!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not too deep, but interesting and worth the watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams is certainly creepy, but you also sympathize with him in a way. Some good cinematography and cool use of photography related imagery and metaphors. If you're a photographer (or better yet, work at a photo lab) this movie might strike a chord with ya. I'll probably never feel the same about bringing my personal photos to the local photo lab. One Hour Photo didn't blow my mind... or teach me any huge lesson... so I don't think it's as "deep" as some other artsy/independent type movies I've seen. But I found it really interesting and worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams turns into a psychotic photoguy Sy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ONE HOUR PHOTO (2002) spoiler alert((( Robin Williams has been all years in movie making a funny guy, like in Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Jumanji and off course more, but then now he made this movie, a psychotic drama about a psychotic photo psycho! The movie is never exciting, who's certainly not too good in a so-called "thriller", but it is sometimes interesting to watch Williams playing pretty good. Though the movie never really gets into my system it shows both professional stuff and very new thinking inside the category. The thing is mostly that One Hour Photo gets maybe too much psychopath movie in the length, it gets too disgusting watching Williams, it gets too stupid almost actually! Williams plays Sy who works in a photoshop and here he has been working for like 20 years and never done a mistake, he has been following this family for a long time and loves them all...I think it was a mistake by Robin Williams playing in this movie. STARS: ** 2/5 (it gets to weird)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of a photo developer becoming emotionally attached to a family through a lifetime of photos is an interesting one, and nicely played out. There is a lot of well thought out moments, albeit fairly obvious - the stark contrast between Sy's bland off-white and light grey world to that of the family which surrounds its moments in colour as an example. Nothing overly spectacular here, but not all to familiar either, which is refreshing in today's suspense films. If I had any main criticisms, it is I wish the producers would trust the audience a little more with their own conclusions. We recognise that Sy is nearing the insanity of dillusion, we don't need it spelled out to us in the last shot. Get rid of the bookends, and the strength of the film increases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done, but . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* Terrific first outing from director Mark Romanek. Williams is great as usual, it's nice to see him taking some darker roles instead of the Patch Adams fluff he's usually associated with. The script was taught and low-key for a thriller, and builds suspense nicely at the end when the viewer is unsure what exactly Cy ends up doing to his victims. Also, nice use of primary colors and framing in the cinematography (very appropriate since the theme of the film is photo development). However, one huge plot flaw ruined the overall effect for me . . . as a general rule, if someone is fired from a job, they are walked out then and there. There's no "finishing out the week", and they certainly would have taken his keys away. It wouldn't have bothered me that much, but Cy's actions in the third act rest entirely on this premise. Too bad, cuz some better plotting would have made this a great, classic thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You couldn't get better than this.The basic story concept is somewhat basic and raw. To be honest, nothing special in it.As the story go along, the plot went stale, very usual, seen it. read it. know it. that's it.The actor and actresses and also basic. Sure, sure, we got the famous Robin Williams with other supporting actors. but to be honest, nothing special to be noted here.But the elemen of surprise is more towards the presentation.Seen in a cyclop view, this movie is far more powerful in it's vision. And motion picture is about visual language, right? So there you have it.All the scenes, especially the colour shading and tones are bleak and so rich. It's like looking at the bleak photograph. The way the main character sees his world. One bleak vision.The movie leaves a dry stain of impression of visual enchantment there. Very vivid and impressive. But to be honest, the story just went by like rolls of undeveloped film. We remember the shoot but not the picture.An interesting weekend movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just dropped some photos off a Wal-Mart It doesn't surprise me that the ideal of some creepy weirdo character for a movie would come from there. Robin was great in the movie. Just the right balance of creepiness and sympathy for the character. I liked the way it kept you off balance wondering what Robin would or wouldn't do. Like most psychos it is a pain from the past that fuels the psychotic behavior and the wall he has put up against the world to protect himself from. Until the isolation and loneliness drives him to bust through it. Great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Psycho-drama, Great Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'One Hour Photo' belongs to the category of memorable movies bringing still photography into the moving image art. Antonioni's 'Blow-up' is the masterpiece of the genre. It also belongs to the psychological drama, with the main character reminding the un-forgetable 'Psycho' character, with a striking similarity in re-creating the motivation of a criminal mind under the appearances of a quiet and kind person. The film is very well directed and filmed, but it is first of all a Robin Williams masterpiece of acting. Williams is fabulous in bringing to life the lonely Sy, his dreams of being part of a mid-class urban family, his affection to them which turns into a wrong obsession because it does not fit with the society norms. His acting is so good that the rest of the characters are rather reduced to sketches, and this may be one of the few flaws of this movie. In a year dominated in the by fantasy movies and musical, a real strong drama is refreshing. 'One Hour Photo' is one of my favorite American films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Hollywood Doo-Doo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a painful, ugly, empty, and ultimately depressing movie. I thought movies were made to entertain, not bludgeon, the audience. This movie reminded me of the message pushed in "American Beauty", where suburban life is not what it seems and Hollywood knows what REALLY goes on behind closed doors, because, you know, they are so well versed in how most of the country lives.And let's face it, this is yet another bad white person movie. If you're a white adult male or female in this movie: you're a cheater, snob, irresponsible consumer, meanie AGFA repairman, creepy stalker, evil capitalist boss, and family destroyer, among other things. If you're not, well, you're the honorable photo development apprentice, or the "good man" cop. This wouldn't bother me if it weren't so prevalent in contemporary movies. It's tiresome, and unrealistic.The best part of this movie was the brief scene with the episode of the Simpsons. No, I take that back. The best part was the opening credits, because they played against cool music and were visually exciting. Must be because the director cut his teeth on that most vacant of genres, the MUSIC VIDEO.Of predictability, my wife said it best, "oh look, super saturated white sets, there will be blood in one of these shots." Lo and behold, we only had to wait for the dream sequence for that one.This movie is such a waste of time. 1 star</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life of the Lonely - *Minor Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OHP looks into the life of Sy (Robin Williams), a 1-hour photo specialist. Over several years time, Sy becomes obsessed with his regular customers, the Yorkins. Sy learns more about them by talking to them and by covertly examining their developed photos. Sy yearns for the Yorkins' life (as portrayed through the smiling faces on their photos) so much that he starts making more and more effort to be a part of it. When Sy learns of Mr. Yorkins adultery, he begins to spiral further out of touch with reality.ACTING: Robin Williams makes one of his most notable performances in portraying Sy as asexual, perpetually reserved, and quirky. Gary Cole (Bill Owens) is good as the impersonal micro-manager who ends up firing Sy, without even knowing what Sy's job is. Eriq La Salle (Detective James Van Der Zee), like his 'E.R.' television series performance (as Dr. Peter Benton), comes across with strong presence, making a good detective.PLOT: The beginning of OHP has a slow building in tension where you aren't sure where things are going, and sometimes you feel a bit bored. As the plot unfolds, things ramp up in a very natural progression, and we never feel that the tension has been artificially pumped up. We feel for Sy in his attempts to have people in his life, even though he contrived some of them. Even though some plot points were predictable, you never felt that things were staged just to keep them unpredictable. Two plot points failed (in a minor way). When Sy is fired, he is allowed to work out the rest of the week. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen anymore, not even with long-term employees like Sy. In another minor misfire, Sy's ending reveals his abuse as a child as his motivation for his involvement with the Yorkins. It would have worked much better to put clues along the way so we could see Sy's character develop rather than springing it on us in the end.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Excellent use of color (and lack thereof) give most of the movie the stark, lonely feel that mirrors how Sy feels. At the end of a workday, Sy walks alone through an empty parking lot lit by yellow-orange sodium lights that become almost green for the camera.MUSIC: The music added well to the theme and pace of the movie.CONCLUSION: OHP is an unconventional thriller which tries with good success to open the mind of someone who is out of touch with reality. I liked the movie and would watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Although the movie is a bit stylized and somewhat sterile in it's storytelling, it's a very engaging movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of Mark Romanek's work as a video director. I think he's a lighting genius and his hyper reality style makes the artist look ultra-perfect. Mark bring this artistic style to his directorial debut. Although I'm a big fan of it, I did find it a bit distracting in a movie format. According to the director's commentary on the DVD, his intention was to make the movie somewhat hyper realistic, but everything is just a bit too squeaky clean.Yet, this fits the story somewhat, in that the characters are somewhat stereotypical. The dialog is fairly good, but in some of the more deeper sections, the dialog is a bit lacking. The relationship between the Mrs. Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and the Mr. Yorkin (Michael Vartan, of Alias fame) is one of the weaker points of the movie. They simply didn't have much in the way of chemistry and their relationship wasn't clearly established. You know that they have problems in their relationship, but it's vague and un-authentic.The standout performance has to go to Robin Williams. What was most impressive about his work in this film was his ability to condense himself into such a quiet and contained character. We all know him as this over-the-top extrovert and in this role he is supposed to blend into the background, which he does. When he blows his gasket, which you know he's going to do, you imagination just runs wild. He's such a lonely character in such need for some type of contact that you just feel for him.Another performance that surprised me was that of Dylan Smith, who plays the Yorkin's son Jake. His role wasn't all that large, but he really did well in it. You could tell he was really listening when he was in scene and he did a lot of small movements, like playing with a toy somewhat distractedly, that just seemed so natural. This was his first role in a movie, but you wouldn't know it from watching him work.Although the movie is a bit stylized and somewhat sterile in it's storytelling, it's a very engaging movie. That coupled with the lighting and other eye candy is why I gave it a rating of 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One Hour Photo" was a movie that really got to me. It's one of the first thrillers I've ever seen where I actually got the idea "hey, wait a minute, this could really happen".Instead of the bad guy being some kind of ultra-creepy serial killer that kills and/or rapes women in the most sick and twisted ways imaginable, the bad guy in this movie is an unattractive and lonely photo shop employee who becomes obsessed with the "happy family" for which he regularly develops photos. Although this character, played brilliantly by Robin Williams (didn't know he had it in him) is seriously disturbed, you can't help but feel sorry for him: he tries very hard but nobody likes him. That's about the first time ever I felt sorry for the bad guy. In terms of plot, nothing really spectacular ever happens. There's no gore, no murders and hardly any violence. Instead, we get a finely constructed tale of how Sy (the bad guy) slowly but steadily slips away into desperation until he finally snaps. This really got under my skin, which is something that not a lot of movies manage to do. All in all, a very finely crafted movie with lots of attention to detail and a very disturbing sense of realism. *** out of **** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should be viewed at LEAST twice. Without giving anything away, it's just so the audience gets both perspectives. Truly a modest, yet exquisite piece of work by Romanek who the top music video director out there today. A lot of camera play, you can spot a lot of moves he used on Fiona Apple's "Criminal" in 1hr Photo and a refined taste for colors really give the film a wonderful taste. Most of the characters are one-dimensional but all for the better since the audience needs time and space in order to absorb Seymour Parrish's intricate an confused character.Robin Williams does a great job at playing Sy, few would have done it better. He is able to creep you out and at the same time make you feel sorry for him. Definitely he is the weird little guy in the street you just can't take you eyes off from. Romanek was wise to take on such a little project and take care of it with such devotion and understanding, not having many full length movies under his belt, this type of movie is perfect for a "newcomer". Certainly he has made his mark in the music video industry doing the unforgettable videos he did for NIN, Madonna and Johnny Cash. Now he is showing us his potential as a full length motion picture director.8.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiarity breeds obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A photo developer Sy (Robin Williams) becomes obsessed with a family due to the fact that he has developed their photo's for many years. This obsession is created by a willingness to believe that he is a part of this family because he has seen the family unit through different times in their life, whilst also having the burden of no family ties himself.Robin Williams is remarkably eerie in the movie, and is a tribute that he is trying to broaden his horizons and get away from the party goof ball image, with films like this and Insomnia. There are also particularly eerie moments as the camera prolongs shots of the young boy who Sy has watched grow up through the photo's for around ten years.What is particularly noticeable is the great emptiness in Sy's life, and the way in which he takes a hyper-professional attitude to each of his prints shows an obsession of not just the family, but of perfection in what he does. For all that however, the script isn't too clever and although there are issues that would make you think twice about going to the developers, there simply isn't enough character to substantiate any emotion from the viewer. The Yorkins are wooden, and the film tries to be a little too pretentious with some of the chilling moments in the film. An interesting idea and certainly worth a watch, but not much more better than average.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing I like abou this movie is that it is realistic.The obsessions, the desire to want more,the desire for the perfect family and the overwhelming feelings of lonliness.Robin Williams was eerie as Sy the Photo Guy.The lonely man with no family or friends who wishes he was a part of the Yorkin famliy, a seemingly perfect happy family with no problems.But, as Sy learns, there is more that meets the eye.This is a great film because of the use of subtext.There is not a lot of dialogue between characters in this but you could read the faces of Willams, Michael Vartan and Connie Nielson and they showed thousands of words.That is what good acting is. *** Stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would suggest watching this movie on DVD where you can watch the extra features (afterward). The "Anatomy of a Scene" Sundance special gives insight into what the character is feeling and why he reacts to the situation the way he does. Without giving too much away, I was pleasantly surprised that even though Robin Williams is playing a weirdo, he's not a pedophile or pervert (like I assumed from the preview), so it's an enjoyable movie without being grossed out. I would recommend this if you liked The Cell, Pulp Fiction, and other strangely filmed weirdo stories.</fullReview>

Turned out to be well worth the money and I especially recommend it to cinematography buffs, the filming is beautiful...I don't think I've been enchanted by colors in a movie quite so much as I was here. Also Robin Williams does a great job as the perceived 'psycho'. Also, it ends in such a way that you certainly have not come to expect from Hollywood. Very refreshing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One Hour Photo" wasn't a stinker, but it wasn't very good either. I was very intrigued throughout this film and I was anxious to know what would happen next. But then the ending just sucked. It had no climax. Sy (Robin Williams) grabs a knife and goes to the hotel room where the daddy and his mistress are and he takes dirty pictures of them! Then he gets caught by the police and it shows him looking at pictures of his bathroom! What the hell?! I'm not trying to criticize this film but the ending just made it disappointing. I liked Robin Williams's performance but the movie just fell flat because it lacked a climax! I think the movie would've been good if he had at least killed the daddy and his mistress. I was very let down about how this film turned out. I really think that Robin should stick to comedy. I'm tired of him playing creepy characters. Please be funny again Robin! I saw you on Conan and you're were hilarious! Please make a movie where you're playing a character like that! Well, in my opinion "One Hour Photo" was a big disappointment and I wish it would've had a better ending. But thanks for reading my review and kudos to those of you who liked it! Bye!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hour Too Long</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll keep this short and sweet. Unlike those who made this movie. Let me start off with some helpful advice. Anyone who strikes up a conversation with you about this movie asking for your insight, here's what you can say. Yes, this is another distinct departure from the usual Robin Williams type of movie. Yes, there is a sense of realism about the story and it's characters. No, this doesn't make it a good movie. It's boring. It's not scary/creepy/disturbing in any respect in my opinion. Which isn't to say that Robin Williams, Michael Vartan or Connie Nielsen did terrible jobs acting in this movie, no, they just weren't given anything remotely interesting to work with. It goes on way too long, it never picks up, and the ending, oh god the ending. I won't spoil it for you because that's a capital crime in my books. Spoiling movie endings should be a punishable offense. However, if you feel like subjecting yourself to this disappointment, you'll be wishing I had so that you'd have saved yourself the pain of watching it. Just like Jim Carrey, Robin Williams should generally stick to comedy. It's what he's best at(with the exception of Good Will Hunting.) To put it bluntly(as if you couldn't have guessed so far) One Hour Photo sucked, Insomnia was mediochre only because of Al Pacino saved the movie by being in it, and Death To Smoochy was somewhat funny, again saved by Edward Norton being in it. Take from this what you will. I only have the viewing public's interest at heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams has a lot of tallent. He's done everything and most of what he's done he's done really well. This is one of his greatest achievments! He acts so depressed yet so deeply phsycotic! One Hour Photo delivers a good two hours of chills, drama, and the occasional laugh. Williams plays Sy, an expert in the fields of printing and developing photos. He takes costumer's photo cartriges with a smile, but benieth the smile is a life filled with depression and sadness. He copes with his poor life through admiring one particular family. Sy is obsessed with this family, with their photos decorating the walls at his home. But while developing the family's latest photos, he discovers that the husband is cheating. Something sparks inside of Sy, and he sets out on a quest of vengence. This truely is one of Robin's best performances, as he plays it out like it was nothing. One Hour Photo is highly recomended to all who enjoy drama and deep chills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow development with the end a bit over-exposed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gave this movie a go on rental. From what I remember it came out practically the same time Red Dragon came out, which interesting enough revolves around a psycho who happens to be a photo clerk.The movie is a fairly good character study about a lonely man with a fractured past. I enjoyed the symbolism used throughout the film, especialy the use of lighting, colors and cleaniness all obvious references to the motif of photo development. An example, are the primary colors of the films which I believe represented the emotional state at the time such as red (warmth/rage), blue (depressed, green (envy), white (purity/innocence).As a character study the movie is interesting, but the movie has so many plot holes, coincidences, subplots that go no where and suspension of disbelief that the film disolves into the catagory of "interesting but could have been so much more" type of film. Some examples of this: *possible spoilers*Is there only one photo shop in town? Wouldn't a man parked outside of your home day after day attract some kind of attention or concern from neighbors? Nit picky... but have you noticed that in every movie about a stalker the family dinning room is right by this large panal window that for whatever reason has no blinds or curtains drawn shut. If you were to fire anybody (esp. if you suspected he was a deviant of some sort)why would you give that person to the end of the week to work there? Why would Sal have keys to everything in the Safe-mart being that he only works in photo development? And the list could continue...In conclusion, the movie starts off with some good ideas and gives the ole noggin a massage over some of the more subtle symbolism and implied scenes, but when all is said and done you slap yourself in the head and say: "this movie could have been so much better"By the way, people who've raved about this being the best film of the year should compare this film to other psycho character studies, especially the fairly recent American Psycho.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rarely does a mainstream studio produce something with merit, so when it does happen it's worth mentioning. And this is a film worth mentioning.Without doubt, Robin Williams is the highlight of this film. His character is stirring, complete and believable. Truly captivating. Time and again he surprises with these brilliant performances that are difficult to fathom considering his humble beginning in sit-com TV and this is some of his very best work.Unfortunately, much of the rest that makes up the film doesn't rise to William's caliber and the end result is diminished because of it. Questionable story line (though a good concept and initial setup), weak supporting cast and non-existent (supporting) character development conspire against what would have otherwise been a 'Best Of' class film.Overall, definitely worth seeing, but without Robin Williams this would have been a B-movie relegated to the teen market and never mentioned again.</fullReview>

Something more insidious would have been more intriguing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams gives a fully convincing performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "One Hour Photo" in the theater several months ago, with an audience that seemed to, at first, interpret the role as Robin Williams downplaying his typical brand of comedy. That tone changed as the film progressed. As written and directed by Mark Romanek (who's done visually sumptuous music videos for Nine Inch Nails, among others), I was expecting a bit more in terms of visual style--the look of the film seemed glossy and clean, yet flat and dull. I recently gave the movie another look and better interpreted Romanek's intentions. Firstly, his portrait of Sy Parrish (Williams), a lonely film developer who uses the prints of one family, the Yorkins, to give his life some semblance of meaning, is very convincing--this is the first of Williams' 'dark' roles that don't convey the actor standing on a pedestal, yelling: "I'M ROBIN WILLIAMS AND I'M DOING A DARK ROLE!" Credit the controlled dramatic layering of Williams' performance--restrained, put-upon, and hollow, he disappears in the role and makes it believable. Romanek's script is conventional save for a few dramatic twists near the end, but his attention to lighting and bright (or drab) colors to create mood is impressive. Overall, "One Hour Photo" is a diverting little item buoyed by Williams' quietly creepy performance. It's one of the better films of 2002.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh boy, another "serious" project from Robin Williams, who is quickly becoming a Hollywood name to avoid. Everything about the film is artificial and pointless. Why does creepy "Uncle Cy" go off the deep edge on this particular family? The screenwriter is just too lazy or incapable of answering that question, and the whole movie becomes an exercise in "look how artistic I am!" The story is pretty good, as long as you're willing to overlook the complete lack of any discernible motive. Oh, and willing to grind your teeth though William's "confession" speech at the end, which offers a generic "I was abused as a child" motivation for his creepiness.Dumb, trite, it's been done before and far better than this. Williams as a bumbling old man who goes psycho is pretty good. Next time, get a script that actually makes sense, dude.And don't hire what's-his-bad-actor-face from ER to do your next movie because he sucked just as much as he did on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much "picture" perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILER ALERT FOR PARAGRAPHS 5 AND 6**"One Hour Photo" is one impressive movie. I honestly can't remember any other film I've seen that managed to be both creepy and deeply affecting at the same time. Once I got past "Hey, it's Robin Williams with a bleached crew-cut!", I was completely immersed in his performance as Seymour ("Sy") Parrish. It's a tour de force for Williams, and proof positive for the final 3 skeptics that he can be just as brilliant in dramatic roles as he can in comic-genius mode. Even before the traumatic roots of his obsession are revealed, Sy is a perfect-pitch blend of goosebump fodder and heartrending pathos. He's a stalker, you can't help but shudder, yet at the same time you can't hate him. And the soulless, caged-animal look in his eyes when he's caught in the police cruiser's headlights seemed to perfectly crystallize his character: lonely, desperate, crying out for some connection to life beyond the safe but soul-crushing banality of the photo counter at Sav-Mart.Thematically, the film offers a scathing indictment of the voyeuristic thread running through modern American society. The image of Sy settling down to watch TV, while his montage of Yorkin family photos fills an entire wall in the background, captures this theme most powerfully. As in Hitchcock's masterful "Rear Window," director Mark Romanek forces viewers to recognize their own role as armchair voyeurs. Through the medium of a (movie) camera lens, we too observe and judge the emptiness of Sy's existence and the disintegration of his fragile hold on reality.Carrying along this camera metaphor is Romanek's stunning cinematography. It evokes Stanley Kubrick (especially in the nightmare sequence) and M. Night Shyamalan with meticulous emphasis on symmetry and perspective lines...not to mention painstaking use of color as an arc into the different characters. Sy is painted in neutral, lifeless tones (not only his clothing, but also his apartment and even his car), in contrast to the Yorkins, who are saturated with bold, vibrant hues. Standout moments in this category include the psychedelic, puke-coloured cast of the parking-lot when Sy discovers the crack in his windshield, and subtler strokes like the blood-red chair in the otherwise stark-white interrogation room.Some commentators have criticized the film for a lack of plot and "paper-thin" performances from the supporting cast. I agree that anyone who rents "OHP" looking for a plot-driven movie is bound to be disappointed. It's not about plot; it's an intensive character study, the same sort of approach Shakespeare used in "Macbeth." Even when the spotlight isn't directly trained on Sy, it's still generally reflecting some aspect of his character -- for example the scene of Will and Nina Yorkin's argument, which establishes the critical difference between Sy's idealized vision and the reality of a strained marriage. Within this "one-man show" framework, I though the supporting cast did just fine. The only one that jarred a little was Gary Cole, and that was only because I couldn't stop seeing his previous, insufferable turn as a boss in "Office Space." (I kept waiting for him to say "Yeahhhhh... I'm, ahhh...gonna have to, ahhhh...get you to go ahead and ahhhh...move your desk, Sy...")Other shortcomings were few and minor. **SPOILER ALERT** Sy's revelation of his childhood trauma seemed a little out of sync to me. It was an insightful, perhaps obligatory, scene (and another magnificent piece of acting by Williams), but it might have seemed less obtrusive if presented earlier on in the film, rather than at the end as a typical sort of "oh yeah, and by the way, this is why I'm such a head case." But that's nitpicking, really. The only other thing that troubled me was Jake's complacency in talking to this man, barely more than a stranger, who freakishly pops up at his soccer game. I kept wondering, "Didn't anybody streetproof this kid? *I'd* sure as hell have told my parents when I got home!"I don't feel this movie was too predictable. The ambiguity of what happened to the pictures from Sy's shocking "photo session" plainly frustrated some, but I found it intriguing. The other ambiguity I liked was how the film blurred the lines between heroes and villains. The fact that Will Yorkin survives in the end *did* come as a surprise, but it wasn't inconsistent with Sy's character. Either outcome would have fit, and I felt this choice had more power because forcing Will to live with the shame of his infidelity was the greater punishment. The scene of his homecoming was an exquisite and devastating example (not the film's first or only, by any means) of how much one can convey on film without words...and stalwart proof that the supporting characters had more to do than just play backdrop to Sy's chilling psychodrama. **END SPOILER ALERT**The film is so richly textured that I could go on for pages more, but I'll wrap up just as I came in: "OHP" is an extraordinary picture. It forces us to examine that squeamish area of the psyche that no one wants to admit exists (much less to visit!), implicates us in the act of voyeurism, and at least for this viewer, leaves an indelible impression. Hats off to all, especially Williams and Romanek!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is a winding, artsy, cinematic mosaic of a movie that invariably succeeds on certain elemental levels while it fails on others. On the positive, the writing is for the most part original, clever, and witty - especially the narratives and how they metaphorically relate life experiences and photography. The set design was very well planned, appropriate, and the color contrasts are extremely visual and appealing. The editing is quite good based on the pacing of the movie, as there really aren't any obvious slow parts and the story transitions smoothly.However, on the whole the acting is inconsistent with Robin Williams and Gary Cole noticeably outclassing the rest of the lead cast. Additionally, the plot line is limited as the movie really doesn't make the viewer draw their own conclusions about what is happening. It is contrived and lacking sub plot. Let me expand, the basic premise of the characters is rather weak. They don't seem to think for themselves. Instead, the focus is on stimulating the viewers' sense of compassion for main character. A tragic hero, oh how sad - yawn. On top of that - the score is annoying, redundant, and particularly over-used. The ending is disappointing as well, for the most part being anti-climatic.In summary, the movie is a bit of an oddity - walking a fine line between artsy, independent film and a cliché Hollywood blockbuster. One Hour Photo should not be dismissed as rubbish or held up on a pedestal as a masterpiece. It falls somewhere in between, succeeding in some aspects while falling short in others. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For most of us, dropping off film to the one-hour photolab isn't a big deal. We drop it off, pick up our little claim ticket, and then go shopping for an hour or so. But for the photo technician, who sees hundreds and hundreds of daily life pictures, each snapshot is a glimpse into another person's world, whether it's a birthday party for an eight-year-old boy or softcore porn for a local entrepreneur. Seymour Parrish (Robin Williams) has been developing photos at the SavMart for many, many years. He's cheerful and friendly to his customers (and he does consider them to be "his" customers), and he knows his stuff when it comes to the technical aspects of the job. See, Sy's no mere clerk, although that's how you and I and most other people see him; he's a qualified, experienced technician. So much so that he gets into a brief shouting match with the guy who delivers Agfa developing equipment over a minor discrepancy in the machine.Sy lives alone; he's middleaged and has no friends or close family. He doesn't even have a dog. What he does have, though, is the opportunity to live his life through the pictures his customers have taken, from birthday parties to sex games to vacations to any and all events in people's lives.There's one family in particular through which Sy lives vicariously the most often: Nina and Will Yorkin, with son Jake (age 8). Sy's been developing the Yorkins' photos sinec before Jake was born, and he's been able to watch the boy grow.This might seem to be a normal obsession, right? At least as normal as obsessions can be, anyway. But Sy, as you may have guessed, is a little different. He has an entire wall in his house devoted to the Yorkin family. Over the past decade or so, whenever he's developed prints for Mrs. Yorkin, Sy has made a copy for himself. As a result, there are thousands and thousands of photos on the wall from the Yorkin family. When the store manager (Gary Cole) discovers the discrepancy between the number of prints produced and the number that have been actually paid for, he confronts Sy, and the downward spiral begins. Sy's obsession with his surrogate family intensifies as he descends even deeper into madness.But he's not just a creepy loner, although that's a big part of his character makeup. Sy feels a certain kinship with the family - at least with Mrs. Yorkin and Jake - and also feels protective of them. So when he comes across some damaging photos, that descent into madness accelerates rapidly.Is this a good role for Williams? In his recent turn in Insomnia, he was creepy and not at all the hyperkinetic funnyman we all know, and he was very effective at essaying deep emotions. The same holds true here. In fact, I think this is among the best work Williams has ever turned in. He's mesmerizing as Sy, making him not into an unfeeling monster but rather into an obsessive man with a warped sense of values. The other actors are well cast, too, especially Gary Cole as his boss and Connie Nielsen as Nina Yorkin. But it's Williams's show, and while in olden days he might have turned this into a tour-de-force, pull-out-the-stops performance, in One Hour Photo Williams takes a very effective subtle approach. He underplays Sy just enough to let the audience know what he's feeling and what his motivations are without beating them over the head with it.The story moves along very well, and the film is exceptionally photographed (so to speak). The original music by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek is fantastic and - best of all - appropriate to the movie, which is a rare treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I bought this movie once it came out on DVD and have watched it many times. It's an excellent movie and I must say is one of Robin Williams' best performances. This movie is not your typical movie, however. It's plot is suspensful but smart and the acting is magnificent. Williams stars as a lonely man, Seymore, who works at a photo place in Sav-Mart. He becomes obsessed with this one paticular family he has developed pictures for since their 9 year old son was born. He wants to become part of their family so badly that he will do anything to make that wish come true. Although in the movie he doesn't display too violent of a person, we can clearly see a mentally disturbed man due to his tragic years of childhood sex abuse. The rest I can't tell you. You have to see it!!! This movie also makes you think twice about the people that develope your pictures!! I give this movie 5 out of 5*'s!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Instantly Forgettable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unchallenging material and execution renders this Robin Williams thriller instantly forgettable. Everything is anticipated, even the twists; there are absolutely no shocks and though the film does get a bit creepy toward the end, it does so in a voyeuristic fashion designed only to sate the viewer's appetite for torture and manipulation. Williams stars as a mild-mannered film developer at a discount retailer who develops an unhealthy fixation on a family he perceives to be perfect; when he discovers they're not, his balance is thrown and he feels he must remedy the situation. This is the kind of character you always fear manic comedian Robin Williams will play: a character self-consciously trying not to be manic comedian Robin Williams, an introspective, lonely drone who shelters his thoughts of violence behind his placid but friendly demeanor; naturally, in such a self-serving performance, he's dismal, never allowing himself to get lost in the role and revealing precious few nooks or crannies to peek into. (Which is a shame because he was much more interesting doing serious work in his prior role in `Insomnia'; at least there he was able to bring some humanity to his goading blackmailer/killer.) Mark Romanek, the writer/director, has created an cold, sterile world for Williams to roam around in that by itself is a dead giveaway but he himself brings no fresh ideas to his project and prefers to deal with everything in a precise, technical manner; everything has to be timed perfectly (including the score by the great Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimak from `Run Lola Run') with no margin for error. Unfortunately, it makes for a very uninteresting movie. There is, however, some fine tracking work from cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, who also did `K-19: The Widowmaker' and `Fight Club'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reminds me of an old joke....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminds me of an old joke.... At the beginning of the film, we see Robin William's character, Sy, being booked at a downtown police station. We don't hear anything detailing the charges, but we get the impression the crime was grisly, heinous and fiendish. Well, the only thing grisly, heinous and/or fiendish is the way the audience is treated. Remember the old joke, the one where a person is chased through city and country by a large, hairy, and scary monster? The joke where the subject of the chase is panicked, terrorized and pursued to the very ends of the earth? The joke where, once the prey has been cornered at the edge of a towering cliff (or against a solid brick wall, take your pick) the huge, hairy, scary monster slowly approaches, growling, snarling and salivating? Remember the punchline of the joke? The one where the monster reaches for the prey and then.. THEN ... taps them on the shoulder saying "TAG! Your it!"Well.... Now you know what the movie is all about... Disappointment and deception... Some might like it. Some might see it as an opportunity for Robin Williams to undertake a character study of a disturbed photoshop clerk. I see it as the waste of the purchase price of the DVD... Do yourself a favor, rent Insonmia instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To echo other reviewers, Robin Williams is outstanding in this realistic portrayal of a lonely, taken for granted worker. Lately I have been to our nearby photo place frequently, and I still have a roll of film in my camera. This film accomplished that which Alfred Hitchcock did in his direction of The Birds, based upon Daphne du Maurier's short story -- something ordinary becomes scary and weird. All these film developers have a 24- or 36-frame invitation into our homes and into those happy and somewhat intimate moments of our lives. I really felt strange during this film. **SPOILERS** I would have liked this film more if it remained within the boundaries of a "normal" family life and if it "focused" on the loneliness of Sy and his desire to become part of a family, even if only through photos. I do not like the affair, the revenge and the police involvement. Those events remove this film from The Birds kind of fright. And I agree with Sy -- "What's wrong with these people?" when he observes a rather tranquil dinner even after the wife and the son are aware of the affair, pictured in clear, sharp color. As someone else asked: who took those pictures? The ending is muddled. Does the camera contain the disgusting photos? Among my favorite scenes is his fantasy (unknown to the viewer) visit to the family's home; among the unfavorites the toilet and the nude scenes. Excellent job, Robin Williams.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Subversive Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Romanek has written and directed a disquieting, subtle, and excellent film in One Hour Photo. The tagline at IMDb "There's nothing more dangerous than a familiar face," could read, "There's nothing more disturbing than a familiar place." Mr. Romanek has created a disturbing film populated by people we can recognize moving through the space Americans find themselves moving every day. (At one point while Sy is spying on the Yorkins, his eyes are the rearview mirror of his car.) Using color, pacing, sound and excellent acting Romanek creates a subversive and unsettling portrait of our cultural neurosis. The most disturbing part of the film for me is how alienated the people are from one another and from their environment. The Savmarts of our world oppress us. Sy isn't the only lonely character here and he doesn't destroy Yorkin family, the cultural of meaningless terminal greed pictured here has done that quite nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first order of business is to declare that Robin Williams' performance is superb. As far as I'm concerned, this is Williams' best work to date. The second order of business is to point out what initially disturbed me as I was viewing the film for the first time. I felt that the pacing in the beginning was rather slow. But after thinking about it and discussing it with another viewer, I have come to the conclusion that the pacing cleverly supports the main character's persona and reinforces (emphasizes) that character's predicament in life. So the pacing (though at first disturbing) works very well.The cinematography in a number of silent scenes is carefully planned and deliberately symbolic (lots of echoings of photography). In some talking scenes there are "photography" metaphors and historical expositions. Though interesting, these scenes are sometimes slightly intrusive. But overall, I think they help support the careful character development so central to the plot.The script is well written and carries the plot exquisitely to its "terrifying" conclusion. And as it turns out, the reason that the conclusion is so terrifying (Williams' superb acting is a given, of course) is because the pacing, the cinematography, and the metaphors distract the viewer (derail, so to speak) just enough to allow the ending to erupt with such unexpected elegance that the viewer is stunned by the final "meaning" -- the truth being told by this fascinating tale. The "truth," as it turns, out is pretty terrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Robin Williams, but this foray into his dramatic side was a disappointment. The real villain here is the script. It's thin and predictable. For instance, more imaginative suggestions about Sy's character history would have been helpful. Lots of folks are forced to work in shopping barns, grinding out somebody else's amateur snapshots. But, what exactly led Sy to becoming an imaginary uncle to the Yorkins? Loneliness? Job dissatisfaction? Lousy nutrition? Please... we need more. This film is a short set of scenes drawn out in a feature-length effort. Perhaps it's a signpost of a music video director's growing pains. But an Oscar contender - it is not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is one of the creepiest movies I have seen recently. Robin Williams deserves an Oscar nomination for his role as Sy Parish one hour photo guy. This movie is haunting and true to life. This is a movie that uses psychology to scare the pants off of you. If Alfred Hitchcock were still alive this would be one of his favorite movies. I am so glad that this movie was made because hopefully more movies of this quality will be made. One Hour Photo is chilling, thoughtful, compelling and a fresh look at how we live our lives and how other people live theirs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyed the variety of elements used to tell the story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo captured and maintained my interest because it appealed to me visually, emotionally, and intellectually. Visually, the store appears perfect; and the Yorkin family and home are beautiful. Emotionally, I felt interested, connected, sympathetic, creeped out, and confused. Intellectually, the dichotomy of lonely and threatening (photo guy); and the dichotomy of fortunate and unfulfilled (Yorkin family), are stimulating to observe and analyze.Since I could relate to and understand some of the characters' experiences and feelings, I found the story interesting. The acting was superb. I also enjoyed the variety of visual and musical elements used to tell the story. Also, I liked the elements of vagueness and unpredictability because that creates suspense for me and makes me think "outside the box". Isn't that what life is all about? Just when we think we understand it, or have it planned out so well, something happens that we never even considered, and we realize that we have to deal with it anyway. This was true for the main characters in this story.This is the type of movie that may seem boring to some people because it appeals to people who like a story about different types of people, the complexity of human nature and life, and who enjoy that type of intellectual stimulation. So, although I don't think this movie is for everyone, I enjoyed it and continue to think about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific drama that is both haunting and moving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One hour photo is a movie about how a lonely man slowly spirals into insanity because of constant trauma, and the fact that nothing good happens to him. The audience is shown just how lonely he is, that he likes to fantasize a lot, and that inside he's a kind person. Robin Williams gives a terrific performance with his acting, and his facial expressions when he isn't speaking. There is a slightly haunting touch to how he starts to lose it, but at the climax of the movie Williams really frightens his audience when portraying his character at the peak of insanity. The ending however, is both powerful and moving and your feelings for Sy completely change. The final shot of the movie, truly, inspires a huge sense of guilt and sadness in both Sy and the audience. A great movie about a misunderstood man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*******Mondo Spoiler Warning***********It's wrong really to classify this movie as horror, since it's really more a study of one man's voyage into darkness. The pace is slow, and thankfully for once the camerawork is also, gving you time to absorb and think about things. This is good as several events in the movie aren't really clear until some time after they happened.Sy the Photo Guy is someone we've all met before, the lonely loser who doesn't seem to have friends or family, and embraces something to hold onto their fleeting life. In Sy's case it's photos, and he's the best darn photo processor you'll meet, even if it's at a second run discount store. Like a maestro spinning music Sy churns out our family pictures, seeing other people's lives and happiness, and knowing how empty he is. Nothing brings that part home more than a scene of the Yorkins's son telling his mother how he feels sorry for Sy and they both try to send him happy thoughts, and at the very moment those thoughts are being sent we see Sy staring off in his kitchen in a look of one seeing the abyss.Anyone who's worked in a department store knows how humiliating it is to put on the little vest and work a shift of phony smiles, and Sy on the surface is the model employee. He is as the neat and tidy as the store aisles around him, but beneath it, though, his soul is quite literally missing. He is ever yearning for something more. Sy is so into the background it's almost as if he was one of the store mannequins had come to life. This moment is portrayed ever so clearly when Sy learns he is losing his job, and sits dejectedly on what could have been his bed, until the camera pulls back and we see they're floor models in the furniture section, and Sy is transparent to the shoppers around him. It's never explained why he chose the Yorkins as his family to dream of, but he lives vicariously through them. It would have been easy and a little cheap to make Sy's desires focus on the wife or even worse the child, but instead he wants to be Uncle Sy, the fourth member of the family. The film stumbles a little on only a few plot points, for example I wonder how Sy could be making extra photos for himself for literally years and only recently his boss clued into it, and why Sy didn't just ring the photos up for cash out of his pocket when no one was looking, that way they never would have figured it out.Much could and likely will be made of the ending, my interpretation is thus: Sy makes a one line statement at the end about children being forced to do horrible things in pictures. Sy was probably abused as a child and photographed while it happened, which explains his life long fascination with photos and how they're supposed to capture happiness. As Sy's world crumbles after losing his job he realizes Will Yorkin was having an affair, and considers that as much the cause as the symptom of his troubles. Sy gets his revenge the way he's lived his life, by photos. He makes his boss think he's going to harm his daughter, and forces Will and Maya to be humiliated just like he had been, the worst punishment in his world that can be meted out.Having Sy actually take pictures of everything in the room but the couple is the real thinking point. I've heard one theory that Sy was never even in the room and fantasizing the whole thing, taking photos of what he imagined he was doing. That's plausible, but considering how Will and Maya are acting when the cop arrives I don't think so. My feeling is the camera Sy was using on Will and Maya was actually empty of film, and I think it's more Sy wanted to teach them a lesson but have it be something that would be forgotten, to deny them even the photos of what they were going through. He instead took pictures of everything in the room he was staying in down the hall. Philosophically it was showing Sy's place in things, that no matter what he does he's always what's overlooked, the things people don't see.The final shot of Sy with the family is to me his vain desire to retreat into a dreamworld, even though he's rooted here in the cold and empty shell of reality.Overall a very good movie, and definitely one worth thinking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Making the most from mental illness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reclusive, dissociated neurotic, whose personal reality is going through a projected identification with a fantasy world, created around a family whose photos he has been developing for years, has rapidly progressed from disturbed thinking to the obsessive, and needs only a push to go over the edge to a full blown psychosis. If he had been showing up at work with, say, a chronic cough, or some other "physical" ailment, his manager would have required that he see his doctor about it. Similarly, an intelligent manager, recognizing his mental irregularities as symptomatic of a psychological condition, could have saved the day by requiring that he become involved in professional counseling as a condition of continued employment. But the manager is a fool, so he just pushes the guy right over the edge.Typical reviews of this film tend to focus only on the most obvious and superficial: That it succeeds as a well crafted psychological thriller; that hard though it may be to get the image of "Mrs. Doubtfire" out of the way long enough to imagine Robin Williams as a mentally disturbed individual, spiraling out of control into desperation, nevertheless he gives a convincing performance, and so forth. Unfortunately, while it might be highly entertaining as a thriller, it does a serious disservice to issues related to mental illness. If the manager had acted responsibly, there would have been no basis for the plot--that much is granted. But all too many managers in the "real" world act with similar disregard in matters related to human dignity, and that is a point sadly underplayed in this story. Instead, the finger is only pointed at the "victim" of the manager's callousness, the lonely creepy "crazy" guy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams was great in this film!! I don't usually like to see him in movies that are creepy but he was so good in this part. You feel for his character but at the same time it's hard to believe that anyones life can be this bad. Sometimes it's hard to tell what's real and what's not in the movie so it's kind of disconcerting. I really like Michael Vartan but not in this movie, I didn't care for his character at all. I still prefer the lighter movies with Robin Williams but I have to say I moved by his portrayal of this guy. You know he's falling farther over the edge with every breath he takes but you still feel sorry for him even though you know he has TOTALLY lost it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams' brilliant performance is what carries this film. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Williams- wow. This movie is one very well done character study- it shows a verylonely man, a very disturbed man, Sy the Photo Guy (RobinWilliams) who lives vicariously through his customers- specificallythe Yorkin family. Sy sees the Yorkins as the perfect family- he hasno friends or family himself, and he'd love to be a part of theirs.Every time he develops a roll of pictures for the Yorkins, he printsan extra set for himself- creepy. Then, when he discovers that Mr.Yorkin is having an affair, his fantasy of being part of the 'perfectfamily' crumbles, and he snaps. The film lacks action- but that'snot what it's about. It echoes Taxi Driver and 2001: A SpaceOdyssey. The best part of the film is Robin Williams in a truly greatperformance. The man was very much ignored at Oscar time- I sayit's the second best performance of the year, behind only DanielDay-Lewis' Gangs of New York role. I enjoyed very much listeningto Sy's philosophy of why photos are so important- with that voiceWilliams uses, it's really creepy. I love it. Recommended! 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most disturbing films in recent years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with very little prior knowledge of what it was really about. Robin Williams is excellent as Sy "The Photo Guy" as well is the rest of the cast. I remember seeing one review for this movie where the person said that the family in the movie wasn't focused on enough to have too much sympathy for them. I disagree; I think the family is focused on about as much as Sy himself. The overall feeling I got from this movie was extremely similar to the one I got after watching Requiem For A Dream. I really didn't know how to feel. I didn't know which characters to feel pity for and which to not. The reason for feeling this way was because the movie was extremely disturbing - I mean, just to think that someone like this could be out there. It doesn't have to be someone developing your photos. It could be a child's teacher or even a close friend. The reviewer who stated that this film would do for photos what Psycho did for showers was correct. And to tell you the truth, I think as a dramatic thriller, this movie stands up well next to Psycho.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mark Romanek will help save the Film Industry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been following Mark Romanek's career since he directed Lenny Kravitz's "Are you Gonna Go My Way" video, and David Bowie's "Jump They Said" and "Black Tie White Noise" videos (No I am not forgetting the incredible NIN "Closer" video). His style of direction and creating basically worlds have done much to force music videos and movies to do what Studio execs do not want to do...evolve.I have waited a long time for a visually stunning movie to come from Romanek and One Hour Photo delivers, making the normal seem creepy, and the every day seem dreamlike almost whimsical. I would have to agree that it is very Kubrikian but only merely because it is different than what we are used to seeing.The story in itself is about a loner, who wishes to be a part of a family that frequents the photo both where he works. His story is a sad one but also in a way it seems like he is better off than he thinks he is in a weird way.The story is tight, shocking, and creepy in it's sterile normalness. I highly recommend it and can only be disgusted by the fact that it received an R rating (aka kiss of death) for what I assumed is the showing of the nude male and female body. I think if more films that looked this beautiful and also made you think (and received a fair rating PG-13) instead of paper thin shlock like Fast and the Furious being hailed as 'the best movie ever', Movies would actually be held up to the standard that One Hour Photo so easily reached.</fullReview>

"cleanliness/sterility=perfection...or does it?" Sums up the central theme of the film; nothing new here. The film has been compared to Taxi Driver and I definitely see that comparison, but OHP I felt was much tooderivative of and less compelling than psychological thrillers like Taxi Driver, Full Metal Jacket, et al. So, while OHP is a pleasant change of pace from the shoot 'em up mold, it's not particularly good either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was going to be all about Robin Williams.....trying to change his image. Instead, I have a new favorite DP...Jeff Cronenweth. The cinematography in this movie is remarkable. For me, it stole the show. He was able to mix a surreal, almost Kubrick-esquq style (to show the mental state of the character) with a subtle, almost Dogma style (to mimic the snapshots). It was amazing. He was the DP on Fight Club also. I remember the work on that was good, but I'll have to go back and compare. If you liked Fight Club's camera work, I recommend 'One Hour Photo' I have no doubt that most people will watch this movie and never notice the camera work, but for those who notice, watch this film. The plot is descent, though a bit predictable as it unfolds. The acting is superb. The direction is quite remarkable. Especially considering Mark Romanek is still relatively new to film (I believe this is only his second feature). If you are a film buff, don't overlook this movie simply because of it's mass appeal. If you are not, don't skip it due to it's poor box office sales. It's one of last year's best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i must give a rate for this movie,i give it a 5,a good thriller of medium level,nothing to less,the only thing that give that something to more to the standard thriller movie is the favolous play to Robin Williams.The movie offers,after a slow first half ,a second half full of tension ,where it's groove up till a revelation end.Another point to demerit is the cause for the troubled psychology to a leading characters,that it's used for the most thriller movie direct to a video or for the TV :the character has been victim a children's trauma.They can find something more original!But the similitude used in the moviebis great,it's enough to say that for characterize the empty life of the character all of his dress,his house.his work are white or grey aqnd the nightmare where he dream that he is deeply immerse in a empty store all colored to white is very disquieting.Anyway,watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the moment this film opens, you can't take your eyes off the screen! It's about Sy Parrish (Williams) being obsessed with the Yorkin family, he stalks them, does them favors. And after losing his job, things only grow more tense. I'm impressed that Mark Romanek managed to pen and helm something like this knowing that he usually does music videos! I expect to see more good Romanek movies in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little negative to say about the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Playing against type must present a great attraction to any mainstream star bored with making the same film for the tenth time to satisfy their agents demands to have a better defined public persona. Similarly doing a low budget independent film to prove that fame hasn't changed them has flattered more than one ego over the years. Unfortunately the product of these two things is usually the ugly bug a windscreen type mess of an interesting squashed beneath the shortcomings of a showboating star performance. One Hour Photo is the opposite of this.Robin Williams plays Sy, the manager of a the one hour photo development booth at an American supermarket. Sy is courteous, talented and caring about his job, he is also dangerously obsessed with the lives of a family who develop all their pictures at his booth. Soon this obsession is spiralling out of control.To say that Robin Williams is a revelation is an understatement. In fact attempting to adequately enthuse about the subtly restraint and power of a performance that could unsettle a major land mass is likely to cause any reviewer sprained muscles. Suffice to say that Insomnia clearly represented Williams on autopilot and Patch Adams must have been him sleepwalking.The pacing and composition of the film are expertly judged with the ultra normality of the surroundings and the proliferation of whites and greys perfectly capturing the emptiness of the life drawing Sy to insanity. One Hour Photo is never graphic or obscene, but on an emotional level it is devastating and has one of the graceful and inventive endings in years, one that is characteristic of the whole film.</fullReview>

Instead of the over sentimentality which ruined Bicentennial Man, Williams keeps audiences on the edge of their seats with a gripping performance as Cy the photographer. It also proves that Williams knows how to play the psychopath role having done so many light hearted comedies over the years.

		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is a remarkable film to watch. Strong cinematic cues underpinthe story. Monotone, washed out colours surround Sy Parrish, a regular onehour photo guy, seems to live a deprived life. No friends, no family. Only the colourful countless faces and moments of his customers as he processes theirfilms.One young suburban family becomes the target of his obsession and we followSy as he descends into the potential of his character.Robin Williams is brilliant and his performance is a true reflection of his genius as an actor. The cinematography is beautiful - director Mark Romanek's musicvideo experience shows clearly, and effectively.Upon reflection, One Hour Photo starts off with a great idea (the openingnarrative of Williams' character reveals brilliant observations about snapshots), but the film unravels rather disappointingly. But see for yourself - it's worth the try.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ONE HOUR PHOTO September 19, 2002 Sy Parrish: Robin Williams Nina Yorkin: Connie Nielsen Will Yorkin: Michael Vartan Bill Owens: Gary Cole Jake Yorkin: Dylan Smith Det. Van Der Zee: Eriq LaSalle Maya Burson: Erin Daniels Fox Searchlight Pictures presents a film written and directed by Mark Romanek. Running time: 98 minutes. Rated R (for sexual content and language).*** Warning: Some Spoilers ***'One-Hour Photo' is a scary movie. No, it's not your typical scary movie that we are accustomed to seeing on the big screen. It's scary because the character that we see on film is not so different than most of us. However, he's not quite right . just a little off, so to speak. He's like a car we drive which has a cracked windshield. The car still runs fine, but it's not the same, and the vision of the world we see through that glass . is just a bit warped at times. Robin Williams plays that character, and his name is Sy Parrish.Sy Parrish has worked in the photo shop at the local SavMart, which is your typical discount store. He loves his job and takes pride in developing the pictures for SavMart's customers. They are not just SavMart's customers . they are HIS customers.One particular customer is a family by the name of Yorkin. Sy pays particular attention to this family, for he keeps a set of prints of them just for himself. He imagines himself being a part of that family. To him, he is `Uncle' Sy. Sy doesn't appear to have any family or friends of his own . so he pretends to have a life that is more meaningful . more significant. To most people, he is just another insignificant person we see in our daily lives. Sy is someone that wants to be accepted and more importantly . loved. He lives in a fantasy world. Why is he this way? What has made him a little more 'cracked' than the rest of us? We don't really have time to think about that as we watch this movie. And, come to think of it, we don't take the time to think about people like Sy in our own lives either.This movie, superbly directed by Mark Romanek, utilizes the camera in ways that I've not seen before in a motion picture. In other words, although this is a `motion' picture, the director lets us take a `snapshot' of the world much how our own mind takes in the series of events we see every day.Robin Williams, in perhaps his best role on screen, is not playing his typical role. Normally, we either see him as a bigger than life character or the typical `Clown'. In this movie, he is neither of these things. He is a lonely man, a man without a sense of purpose, at least not in the real world. He is not very funny, but in fact, quite sad. And, there is nothing more melancholy and gloomy than that of a sad clown.I highly recommend this movie and give it a score of 8.5 on a scale of 1 to 10.- David Hardin</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A change of pace that reminds audiences of Williams' gift as actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis: Lonely photo developer Sy Parrish has spent his entire life in a quiet, mundane existence. With his employment behind the counter of a one hour photo lab being his only solace, there isn't much joy that Sy seeks out. But his one curiosity transforms into an unhealthy obsession with the Yorkin family, a seemingly idyllic suburban family that has it all. That obsession begins to take over Sy's perception of what is real and what isn't.The Review: With this film having sealed up what critics call his "Dark Trilogy", Robin Williams finally puts an end to that perception of critics saying he does roles that are too goody goody. Following the mean spirited "Death To Smoochy" and dreadful atmosphere of "Insomnia", "One Hour Photo" is a performance in which we sympathize with Williams' performance as an outsider of society, damaged by his psychological background and left to wander aimlessly without a family. It's an about face performance for the man who gave us "Patch Adams" and "Dead Poets Society" that is one of his best. The film itself is truly disturbing by undermining a normal, everyday thing such as photo developing, as being something more devious than expected. Mark Romanek's film is intentionally disturbing in the fact that it came from his own mind, with it's dreary atmosphere and odd music. But it's the work of a master who doesn't compromise story in favor of commercialism. Speaking of which, "One Hour Photo" is an art film that's away from the furthest recesses of anything Robin Williams has done in the past five or so years.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being one of the greatest musical videos makers, Mark Romanek couldn't save this mess and ridiculous story. Robin Williams disappoints me as usual. He's always been foolish in most of his movies; therefore I find it really hard to see him in a supposedly dramatic role. His performance wasn't convincing or flashy. I only ended up laughing at his supposedly dramatic scenes. I'd never see a Robin Williams' movie again unless it really is worth it.This mediocre and uninteresting story is about a photo clerk who is always smiling and wearing a blue uniform. He is a solitary, repressed, strange, lonely man who projects himself into the lives of this family through mounting their photos on his wall. He is convinced that people who want to develop their photos only want to remember happy moments of their lives and forget the tragedies and pathos of their lives by looking at those pictures.The movie is a portrait of a sick individual and his deluded use of photos and his photo-printing job. The movie's purpose is to present a portrait of the Robin Williams' character, and to delineate his psychological sickness, the way he lives in a fantasy world, fueled by the stolen snapshots and his photo-printing job.Sy (Robin Williams) thinks that people take pictures and develop them to remember that they were happy for an instant. These pictures separate us from being forgotten by others and if it has a meaning, it's that you should tell your future generations that you were there, that you existed, that you were young, happy, because somebody was worried about taking a picture of you. I didn't find "One Hour Photo" so interesting or moving. Williams' performance leaves too much to be desired and he doesn't do anything other than pretend he's a good actor. The movie is not dark, thrilling or interesting as I heard. This is a disappointing and I hope I will never see something like this. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>But really the movie doesn't do very well in the genre it pretends to be good at, which is a sort of psychological thriller. Giving away the ending in the beginning can never be a good idea for this kind of movie.On the other hand almost everything is quite good, starting by the Robin Williams part which I think is very deservedly oscar material. Photography and other techinal parts, like the soundtrack, or set design is also very good and very clear.The Yorkin house is very beautiful and so is Nina. I wouldn't mind getting a little psychopath over any of them as well...In the end, this is not, as I said, a good suspense movie, but rather a reasonable mix of other genres. I laughed a little at certain sections of the movie and the way the movie develops makes you swing from hating Sy to sort of love him for his determination in righting the wrongs of this society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story: A family regularly develop their photos at the local Sav-Mart. There, "Sy the photo-guy" takes special care of all their photos. However, he is obsessed with the family, obsessed with the lives that he can only watch from outside, yet feels more a part of than his own. As the movie develops, it gets darker and darker in tone, and giving away any more of the story would be spoiling it.Now, Robin Williams as psycho is a bit of an oddity. In Insomnia, he played another psycho part with a twist of humour, giving the film wit and a dash of dark comedy. Here, he plays the role absolutely straight and sincere. And he succeeds, phenomenally. We know that this isn't Hannibal Lecter, or some serial killer - we seem his as a person, perceive many of his insecurities, his feelings, his obsession. We understand him, and in my case, identify with him.But does that make for good entertainment? In the beginning, the film lags a bit. After a promising start (I expected the movie to be slightly clever but end with a climactic slaughtering of the psychopath in self-defence by the wife - as most average Hollywood movies would have done. Well, the start of the movie makes it quite clear that this outcome is not an option, and so I was delighted) the movie hits a bump of boredom or two. Perhaps that is intentional - we are getting a glimpse of Sy's life and job, which is boredom, but it does not drive the story very much. Also, his intrusions on the family happen too quickly - at the start of the story, he has already obsessed about them for years, so it is harder to understand him than if we had been led there more gradually. But as the plot develops, and takes a twist and turn or two, the pace increases rapidly and towards the end the movie is very thrilling, disturbing, yet brilliant.Of course, there are some flaws. One dream sequence in particular is meant to cause cheap shocks - a boo-scare moment that should have been beneath this movie and feels totally out of place. The boring moments near the start can disappoint a bit. And the child acting is a bit, well, not Haley Joel Osmond...But, despite its flaws, the movie is clever, it misleads the audience several times, it is thrilling and disturbing, and generally very entertaining. Probably one of the best movies this year - and certainly quite original.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the films I've seen at the theater this year, One Hour Photo has been one of the finest. Its production has taken years, giving Mark Romanek plenty of time to tweak his magnum opus to a searing perfection. There are little clues of foreshadowing, that you'll miss, if you don't pay close attention to the film. Robin William's acting is so vivid and convincing that it's hard to believe he once portrayed the flamboyant Mrs. Doubtfire. And the excellent use of colors, lighting and editing to convey emotions, is almost identical to the masterful cinematography of American Beauty.I must admit I wasn't thrilled about seeing a movie about an obsessive stalker, but to enjoy and appreciate this film, one doesn't have to like its subject matter. When my mother asked me if she would like it, I said, `View this movie as if it were a piece of art.' If you like a painting, you're going to like how it looks and makes you feel. If you judge One Hour Photo based upon its disturbing content, you haven't fully appreciated its utter brilliance.</fullReview>

But it is amazing to watch someone, an actor to act perfectly like the loneliest human being in the world. Because he moves he talks he cries he walks he turns the way that one can instantly recognize someone in his neighborhood. The loneliest one. And it was so heartbreaking that I could hardly bear it. I grew up in a big, loving family, in a family he is only yearning for. And I can not help him and any other people like him. How sad.

		<fullReview>Beyond the aesthetic, "thriller" plot progression of this movie, is a very heartfelt, understanding interpretation of the character Cy. If you identify with Cy early on, and what he most certainly has gone through in his life, you don't see him as "crazy" or wonder "oh no! whats he gonna do next??" Once you identify with him, you know (to an extent) the ending, and simply feel for him; throughout the movie, I found myself incredibly sad as I watched Cy walk through the aisles at work, battling with himself - with his desire to be "normal," and to just be rid of whats in his head, if even for the few seconds involved in indulging in his "uncle Cy" fantasies.Overall, the movie is a message of how important family is, and the reality of what happens when abuse enters the equation. From abuse come frail, depressing figures like Cy, and also serial killers, who are more ubiquitous than you think.I love the movie: 8.5</fullReview>

But finally I so wished to experience a potentially good film that I went risking the following nightmares. I will not have any. I made a mistake but for an entirely different reason. The film was so empty and boring that it simply shouldn't have been spent money on (not only my buying a ticket but on producing it). It is only the performance from Robin Williams (Sy, the photo guy) that gave something to watch, as a study in acting, perhaps, but the script is so shallow and hollow that it hurts. What bothers me most is that this film has a certain so-called "arty" approach, overly simple script, pretentious direction and photography among others. It strives to be subtle and but it is affected, has no strength and no depth. I have seen enough good and bad European films to recognize it immediately. There is the classic approach: "show and don't tell" which has been clearly not heard by Romanek or simply overlooked. He should try much harder or not at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this movie starts out slowly and finishes with less than a bang,it has it's moments.I was a bit bothered by the utterly drab and sterile environment,in which the lead character and entire focus of movie is based.Seymore {Williams} is very ordinary and overly pleasant with his job and it's consummation. He takes his duties as photo lab tech. very seriously and can't seem to understand why other's may not. It's this persnickety obligation to job and life's other machinations {he will eventually unravel} which are interesting within the psychological mindset of his being. A terse and almost uncomplicated storyline are what's in store,both in the white and superstored environment of the protagonist and also a reason for the imagery of his thinking.Seymore's world is very neat &amp; tidy ,but also wide open and exposed,not terribly unlike his job. To take film development orders and complete the exposures to their completion,hopefull by day's end.What transpires in-between those hrs. waiting for film to develop and customer to return for pickup are what fill his world and also the tragic void,within his dreary and lovelorn life. As the movie progresses from simple and pleasant photo man to ill-tempered kook,on a mission to find that which has abandoned and sheltered his sense of right and wrong. Seymore starts out being a nice guy and overly competent and polite, but turns into a monster,befitting a psycho movie sans weird castle or haunted house. But nevertheless,Seymore gives a contemporary view into madness and all it's weird pontification. I give it a 7/10 for lackluster finish but a wielding approach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Snap' up this film with Robin Williams in great acting shock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well this movie proves one thing - `Insomnia' was not a one-off for Robin Williams. He's capable of doing dark roles and doing them very well. In `One Hour Photo' he plays Seymour Parrish, a photo developer, who becomes obsessed with pictures, and the family, of one his clients. How far will this obsession go?Well I won't spend an age talking about the plot. There's not too much there - more a gradual decline by Seymour as his obsession with the Yorkins grows. There's an element of Yorkin being crazy - having visions. The photos of course act as a tool - showing how Seymour can only relate to people from a distance, contemplating from afar. There's a great sadness in them. Much of this is helped by an excellent performance by Robin Williams. He carries Seymour with a great sadness in him - in his eyes, his posture, and the lines on his face. Even when angry, you can see Williams is showing that the anger is directed not so much at the person in front of him, but at the ghosts of his past. This movie is essentially about Williams and that's one of the problems. No one else really gets a look in. Sure we see the Yorkins but we mostly only see them through Seymour. We don't ever really get to know them and so we cannot empathise with them as Seymour's obsession grows. It's a flaw but it's not a killing blow.Mark Romanek, who wrote and directed, shows some nice skill with the set-up of scenes. Seymour is decked out in light colours - typically cream. Dressed blandly and inoffensively, he blends into the dull workplace and home. He doesn't want to be seen. He also allows a bit of humour into the movie, with Seymour's wonderful discourse about his customers' photo habits. It not only alleviates the tension in a generally downbeat movie, but allows Seymour to become than the brooding-weirdo cliché. The movie is structured in a relatively conventional scene, recounted in flashback form with Seymour at the police station. It allows the audience to wonder how he got there - and is it for the reasons we think. The final few minutes are very satisfying as a result.`One Hour Photo' is very character based and succeeds because of (and not in spite of) Robin Williams' performance. You cannot help but feel sympathy for this man and watch with sadness as his tale unfolds. Shot well, scripted with enough care that you are left bored, it's a movie that - while not maybe worthy of many viewings - is certainly worth seeing. 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In French they called it: "Le complex de la caméra". The photographer who wants to be considered as an artist, has only this little camera to catch the complicated reality, so don't blame him that he is not creative as everything goes through this little thing. The reality can be surprisingly different as Sy Parish (Robin Williams) discovers by the photos developed in one hour, the time to shop at Sav-Mart. A beautiful woman Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) is there with her son and Sy is really happy that he can give a present to her son. But is this a reason to throw him out? No there are other reasons: he is dreaming, takes too long lunches and gives away photo-developments. I didn't like his boss: he is so typically a big store capitalist without hart. He says: I am not going to risk by employment for this. The director Mark Romanek succeeds in depicting the people in their every-day life without exaggerations which makes of this movie a good social drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..watching this move had a wonderful down note from begin on, there is this photo clerk, taking an awful pride in his work that no one notices. He does not care about that, but he is the one who has an eye for pictures.. the whole film is made of great pictures and the great acting of Robin Williams just fits in the frame. A little disturbing is the theme from "American Beauty" in there, since that music already was used on a very emotional film of the same kind, I can't stop thinking about the Pictures connected to that decent Piano. It takes me away from what I 'd like to keep my eye on. The music totally fits in there, but it was already used. Its like seeing someone familiar talking with a different voice, it distracts and should have really been avoided. Of course, you could say that is the whole trick.. everything is a copy, is a copy, is a copy ....Anyway, there is a close connection to the pictures, and the text, the way these two media go together here is brilliant. I wonder about the last frame in the movie, is it Sy's imagination?Go get the Picture.SmilingDevil</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams has once again shown himself to be an actor with depth.He can inhabit the life of any character handed to him. Wheter it's thephyciatrist in Good Will Hunting or the Kiddie Show host in Death toSchmoochie, Williams' skills in improvisation and character study are awonder to behold. Director Mark Romanek deserves an award for hisvision. He accurately depicts the sterility of suburban life and thebanality of of the oh-so-hip yuppie couble portrayed by Cinnie Neilsonand Michael Vartan. Romanek owns alot to Alfred Hitchcock in hisattention to detail. Everything means something in this film. Thenarration by Williams is brilliant and lends a sympathy to the characterof Sy, the photo guy. This film is sure to become a cult</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams saves it from being a flop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The more I think about this movie the more I dislike it. Normally I would not put the blame on a writer for a bad movie but in this case, since it is written AND directed by Mark Romanek I will make an exception. This movie had so much potential because of the originality of the idea, but left me wanting more in the end. What more did I want you ask? Well lets start with start with Robin Williams character Sy. Robin Williams plays a photo developer who becomes obsessed with the family of a long time customer. Williams is a lonely man who entire life revolves around the photo mat and store it resides in. Williams does a great job playing the underdeveloped character to the best of his ability. I needed more character development through out the movie. We get a small glimpse at his deep seeded emotional problems from some, for lack of a better word, f***ed up dream sequences. No where amidst all these dreams do we get a feel for his true loneliness and disparity he suffers from. The story never dwelled deeply in to Sy the photo guy's psyche. I never understood why he acted the way he did until the vary end. Where he, instead of though dialogue and acting, openly bares all to the arresting officer, played by Eriq La Salle from E.R. The idea behind it all was a good one, a man, who works in a photo developing lab, sees the world through the pictures taken by other people. And since most pictures are happy ones i.e., birthdays, graduations, vacations. This is how he develops an obsession for a fairy tale family, a family that he may not have had, although that is purely a guess since the movie never brought out that detail. I would have liked to see the family in question developed much more. In stead we have an extremely sensitive 7 year-old, a husband who is a good provider but not a father, and a beautiful wife who is hung up on her not so perfect husband. I am a person who feels the ending is one of the most critical parts of a good thriller/mystery movie. And let me say, I was extremely disappointed. At no point was I shocked, surprised, stunned, or bewildered. Disturbed? Yes. All in all, Williams delivers the best performance he could have with the material given to him. Though there was little substance it was a good idea, but maybe One Hour Photo could have been one hour longer to develop the characters a little more. I give this movie a C+ generously. You can thank Robin Williams for saving it from being a total disaster. Williams gives us another Oscar worthy performance, but may not get the nod due to the lack of script.One thing I did get from this movie is that I should consider switching to a digital camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a complete waste of my hard-earned cash. I couldn't work out what sort of movie this was meant to be - thriller, chiller, what? All it ended up as was a pointless waste of perfectly good film. It made me want to stand on my seat and shout "Get on with it". While the ads were on at the start I thought to myself that I hoped that the movie wasn't going to be as pretentious as the ads - I was right, it wasn't - it was worse. The movie started off painfully slowly, and carried on at that pace throughout the movie. Nothing happened to speed the pace up, or add to any lingering interest which I may have had left. You could see what was happening several miles off, and there seemed to be no reason to continue. Don't go and see it unless you like pretentious boring movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this film, I couldn't help but wonder if it would have ever gotten wide release without the star attached. Maybe not.The high concept, star powered aspect, I'm sure drew the audience to theaters. But the payoff is a bit muddy, and had me scratching my head.The casting is right on, especially the lead female, who is delicious. The creepy moments almost had the Kubrick creepiness, but not quite. The tension was thick, but I still feel like Robin Williams' characters motivation wasn't very clear. Sure he's just a lonely middle aged one hour photo guy. And sure his favorite customers are a seemingly prefect family, in a J. Crew kind of way. But what exactly caused him to become so infatuated with them?Not to mention the fact that, for a middle aged one hour photo guy living in the suburbs, he sure was pretty savvy about some definitely non-middle aged one hour photo guy stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant thriller to keep you on edge to the very end, with a superb performance by Robin Williams.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an interesting film. Having heard Robin Williams was in it I was originally put off, until I saw his performance in Insomnia and was extremely impressed (although considering that film, it wasn't difficult). Seeing the trailers and hearing some comments about it I became very interested, and when I finally saw the movie I wasn't disappointed, far from it. Williams shows he is a superb and extremely capable actor, it's almost a shame this has been overlooked by his comic genius. As for his performance, he is fantastic. Throughout the film he keeps the feeling of something unsettling, and slowly, bit by bit, the film reveals to you little aspects of his character and lifestyle to take you deeper into his mind. He plays this character extremely well, and there's not, as one of my friends said, any `Robin Williams' moments. That little recognition of his stage persona. The film is superbly shot, and builds the brooding menace feeling. With a few nice twists in the tale too, it proves to be a superb thriller. Cinematography and soundtrack are emphasized heavily in the movie and help to put you on edge throughout. Even the smallest, seemingly innocent scenes prove to be the ones that keep the audience quiet. A brilliant movie with a superb performance by Williams. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler!It is nice to see a movie that is original and has not been done before. Robin Williams plays another weirdo with past demons in this film. I'm starting to wonder if this is his new type of character. Williams who has a bad family past adopts a photo perfect family who are not perfect that have their own demons. He finds out about their infidelities and it cracks him. He goes over the deep end. I like how the store he works at has all the similarities of Wal-Mart; they called it Sav-Mart. I am surprised Wal-Mart hasn't sued them. The employees even wear the same blue vest. This guy has trouble coping with reality. A whole bunch of outside events catch up to him and the viewer gets to find out if he is a violent man. Watch the film and find out. I am glad I went to see this one in the theatre as I was pleasantly surprised. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For people who like their thrillers to be thrilling, this film makes a crucial mistake in the very beginning, by telling us more or less what the outcome is. Specifically, we see Seymour ("Sy") Parrish (Robin Williams) in an amazingly sterile, bright white police facility having his picture taken and being questioned by a detective (Eriq La Salle from "ER"). The film is told in flashback.Sy has been working for years as the photo developer at SavMart, which looks a lot like WalMart only brighter and less colorful, like the sterile police station seen earlier. We find out early that he has an interest in the Yorkin family - Nina (Connie Nielson from "Gladiator"), Will, and son Jakob - even memorizing their home address and giving Jakob a disposable camera for his birthday. Creepier still, he gets an extra set of their photos for himself.I won't go into any more detail on the story, to save the remaining surprises.The performance by Robin Williams is remarkable. Despite being very well known and familiar to the audience, he disappears into this character, leaving no trace of the stand-up comedian or "Mrs. Doubtfire." He is bland and deliberate, but with turmoil sensed beneath the surface. This performance should be remembered at Oscar nomination time.But what really made me enjoy the film as much as I did was a feeling that it just *worked.* I don't really know how to describe this feeling I sometimes get (not often enough), except that the films that evoke it often win awards for screen writing. The story is simply told well.But is it a thriller? It has been sold as one, and there are certainly many tense moments, but I think it is really more of a character study of someone you would normally hardly notice. When someone suddenly erupts in violence, going "postal," the neighbors are very often heard to say "he was a quiet man." Sy Parrish was a quiet man.Seen on 10/10/2002.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie recently and Robin Williams as usual lends a special intense study of a decent man caught up in a situation by being too possessive and possibly too neurotic, and what the outcome does to him. Rejection and deceit he cannot take. How he reacts to it, is very thought provoking. The causes and effects are clearly shown, but I still had the feeling near the end of the film that something was lacking. I felt like they had edited out something, or were misleading us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's the payoff?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know, this really seemed like a movie I should like. Seeing the previews and the advance buzz, watching the movie, even thinking about it and talking with Amanda about it afterwards, I thought, "Damn, that was a solid piece of film making. Then why didn't I like it?"And three days later, I'm still not sure if I have an answer.One Hour Photo is the story of Sy the Photo Guy, a negative pusher at Sav-Mart. He takes a nearly sexual satisfaction in his work. He's personable, careful, one of those guys that you enjoy talking to for the 45 seconds you're dropping off your prints, and instantly forget about.At the opening of the film, you know that he's in jail for something. You don't know what, and you're kind of scared to find out. He's so meticulous, you know that he could be pure, delicious evil. It's uncovered that he has a slight obsession with the Yorkins, a family that's brought their prints to him for years. He's watched their little boy grow up, one 4x6 at a time. And he identifies a little too much with them.Robin Williams is perfect for the role, for the same reason he was perfect for the role in Insomnia, another film I didn't like. He's so reserved, so particular, that you identify very strongly with his character. He's just a lonely guy that wants a family of his own. He just doesn't know quite how to go about it in a healthy way.This is the first film from music-video director Mark Romanek. His videos have always had a certain care to them, an attention to detail. Fiona Apple's "Criminal", NIN's "Closer", Lenny Kravitz' "Are You Gonna Go My Way" have all been examples for the genre - showy, attention-grabbing, information-packed. He has the same attention for detail in One Hour Photo. Tom Foden, the production designer for Tarsem's The Cell, shows the same eye for color and specific detail. The design of Sav-Mart is perfect. It's the soulless, impersonal discount store that we've all been to, complete with the manager's one-way window over the aisles, except it's been whitewashed and sterilized even more. The aisle ends have the contents listed in a tiny, tiny font that makes you feel insignificant.The fact that the photo booth is so far away from the rest of the store is fairly significant. He's dealing with the happiest memories of people lives that have been captured onto little bits of plastic. People speak to him for moments at a time, and then resume their lives as he handles what was. He's just that guy, shoved off in the corner, an afterthought.So why didn't I like One Hour Photo? To figure it out, I had to look at other films that were psychologically disturbing that I did enjoy: Aranofsky's Requiem for a Dream and Fincher's Seven. Both films leave you feeling grimy, unclean, like you need a shower in sulfuric acid or something. But with both of those films, there was a big payoff or something that made you feel like it was worth the trip. In Seven, there's the big surprise ending that makes you reconsider everything that had come before. In Requiem, there's the overarching message about addiction and its effect on the human spirit.In One Hour Photo, you don't have that. You've simply got a guy that, while he's extremely well-drawn, is a little crazy. You don't have the overall moral. You don't have the big payoff. (There's almost a reverse payoff. You'll see what I mean.)In One Hour Photo, you've simply got a guy who wants a family, loves cameras, and is a little nuts. And for me, that wasn't worth the trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The strange Parrish clan...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, this is the user review site but part of me wants to ask a trivia question - namely, which other actor, if any, has ever played two separate characters with the same surname? Robin Williams has managed it. Several years ago he played Alan Parrish, who got himself trapped in the jungle for 26 years, courtesy of a strange board game. Now he's Sy Parrish, who has obviously been trapped in the jungle of his mind for all of his life. I am convinced the Parrish clan contains a lot of weird and wonderful characters...but Sy appears to have no relatives at all. He exists only to develop family snapshots to the best of his ability, and of those families, one captures his attention so much that he begins to fel actually a part of their lives. This is not a movie for crash, bang, wallop merchants. It's got something called tension; something which is lacking in many thrillers, forfeited for cheap gory interludes. I am not normally a big Robin Williams fan. He's made some bad movies, and was not too convincing in 'Insomnia' playing the villain. But here, he comes of age in a role in which Anthony Hopkins would apparently have been more suited. But Williams deserves rich acclaim. There are one or two moments when the character appears ominously real. In fact, this is Oscar-material, from his point of view. The colourless images on screen, especially of Williams' scenes, are perfect to suit the mood of the piece. I do feel the 'flashback' tool (if you'll pardon the pun) is a mistake in some ways, but it doesn't alter the powerful message. Obsessions can be very dangerous. Anyone who has had one will appreciate this fact. I have had; and I do, respectively. This isn't going to sweep the board on Oscars night, but it is a refreshing, if morose, change of style. I've heard comparisons with Hitchcock (again!) and in this case they are quite justified. Not a film you will ever forget, especially when you next get a roll of film developed! 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When we first saw Robin Williams on Mork &amp; Mindy, and later during stage performances and his first movies, all we could think is "Geez, this guy's a real whacko." Well, we were right. But Robin has surprised us. He's turned into an actor with an incredibly broad range, all the way from Airman Kronauer in "Good Morning, Vietnam" to Sy, the Photo Guy who has made me swear to go totally digital from this day onward.His performance in this movie reminded me a lot of what Hitchcock liked to do, and probably did best with "Psycho" - the ordinary little guy who goes around the bend and the effect it has on other people. And Robin does it almost too well.There's a thin line between genius and insanity and sometimes it's hard to tell which side Robin is on. He's usually parked right across the middle. I smell an Oscar nomination for him in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this film made me feel one sensation only. Cold. very VERY cold. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Seymour Parrish (Robing Williams) is a photo lab tech at a local discount super store. Sy, as he likes to be called, is an aged loner much ostracized from the world. In his lonelyness he ends up fantasizing about belonging to a real family that frequents the store to drop off film. However, Sy's fantasy ends up into an obsession as he takes duplicate pictures for safe keeping and imagines himself as actually being part of the family.Sy's attempts are awkward to watch, his first glimpse at conversation is painful to observe. He's like that school kid hurt and alone on the playground who people might talk to, but nobody wants to play with. Eventually Sy's obsession ends up getting blurred between reality and fantasy, and gets ready to explode as he gets fired from his job.The makers of this film have also created a great look to Sy's world. Sy's store front is awash in a see of white, bland looking and hopefuly empty. Here he works and not so much as an employee but more of a fixture to an already lifeless world. Much of the cinematography is awash in a see of white, from an interogation room that Sy is held in flashbacks, and the store front of never ending white shelves. The film also has a grainy touch creating an even more sterile feel into Sy's world.Nevertheless, the film is a little slow plodding, and it's a gradual but sure climactic climb. Also one note of interest is that Sy's boss is played by Gary Cole, who was also the annoying boss in "Office Space". However playing similar roles but completely different characters as Gary does here (and very well might I add), I couldn't help but wait for Gary to come up to Sy and say "Hey Sy what's happening? About those TPS reports..." Just a minor distraction :)But looks aside and minor flipant technicalities (same boss 2 different films), Williams pulls off an amazing performance in what is sure to the best role of his career. The hard thing is believing that this guy use to be an A+ class comic clown. Seems Robin can inherit the world of serial killers like nobodys business. The dilemma is whether to give him a best actor nomination for either this film or Insomnia.See this film for Robin Williams performance alone.Rating 7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams has always been my all-time favorite actor, which made me look forward to seeing this movie. The problem is I'm used to the hilarious, and half-dramatic Robin Williams, so seeing him in this movie took some getting used to. Actually, he scared the hell out of me in this movie, which proves that he is an excellent actor, no matter what kind of movie. Another thing I liked about this movie, is that it can be seen in many different ways, you can think that Sy Parrish is either a hero or a monster, and you never know what he's about to do next, which is the part that really scared me.

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking and sad, despite Romanek's overblown direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Final Score (calculated average of various classic cinematic qualities):8.2 (out of 10)People often ask why do we need critics and why do we need award shows other than to have all the snotty Hollywood elitist peers pat themselves on the back. Robin Williams gives a performance in this movie that is not only his best to date, it occurs to me that this is why we give out Oscars for acting in the first place. This is a guy that in this film - away from his usual mugging, sappy roles and jokes about Prozac - really embodies what the craft of acting is all about. He immerses himself so deeply into the character of Sy Parrish that it might actually come as a shock to see the name "Robin Williams" over the end credits. When a director does a good job he is rewarded with another job on a promising script, when a studio markets a movie well they are rewarded with a big opening weekend at the box office and when the movie itself is good it is rewarded at the video counter when you buy it and take it home for your library. When an actor does a job as well as Williams does with this movie the least you can do is give him a trophy to put on his mantel. Every once in a while a movie is worth seeing simply because the lead performance drives it to being good where it otherwise might not have been. Dustin Hoffman did it with "Rain Man", Dustin Hoffman did it with "Wag the Dog" and Robin Williams does it with "One Hour Photo".The movie itself is a great idea. How much does the guy that processes your photos know about you? Or more importantly what does the sum of the pictures you've taken say about your life? Your family? and the life you wish you had? The script, in Sy's musing over why photos are so important and what they say about us, is a real thought provoker. The story unfolds as a real puzzler with the operative question hanging over our heads the whole time "How far will Sy go?". But to me "One Hour Photo" isn't just about making you think twice about where you take your pictures. It is to make you think twice about everybody. By focusing the film on a quiet, lonely man that we otherwise wouldn't give a second thought scribe Mark Romanek makes a comment about the system we all live in. We don't really think the guy processing your photos or busing your table or cutting your hair has a purpose in life or has needs other than to serve us at that moment. In many ways the film is like "Psycho", which does not necessarily mean it is a rip-off. The thriller elements in the 3rd act are fully realized and yet true to the characters. I don't believe Sy is evil or deranged, just delusional and misguided. He seems to genuinely love the Yorkins. But it shows how love, in the wrong mind, can easily slip into obsession. His efforts to fit into society (like reading the books they do) are realistic, clumsy, sweet and at times genuinely heart-breaking. Finally, the look of the movie is top-notch with vibrant colors. However, it is hampered by a couple of things. Number one being the music. The music itself is great - particularly the creepy chimes as Sy walks down the hotel hall in the finale - it just seems like it's in the wrong movie. In fact, Romanek's entire style seems off. He doesn't seem to realize that this is a subtle, quiet independent film taking us into the mind of a quiet man. As a result he blasts the speakers out with a bunch of false music cues and frenzied camera work. It reminded me of Mark Pellington's style in "Arlington Road" and while it worked for that film it doesn't here. Granted he does create intensity in the 3rd act, but the rest of the film seem completely overblown. The opening shot of the camera is built up like it's going to release armageddon. Not to mention the scene where the Yorkin's send good thoughts to Sy and Romanek cues up the music to a frenzied pace as if to suggest Sy is somehow telepathically receiving their thoughts. It's laughably bad. All of this contradicts the more subtle distant stuff. One of the best moments in the film is the way Romanek shows- by not showing- Mrs. Yorkin's reaction to her husband's infidelity as Sy watches from a following car. Ultimately, despite the director's efforts to make a different movie, I think "One Hour Photo" works as a portrait of a sad man, as an examination of photography, as a visual stunner, as a puzzler without clear heroes or villains and as a well acted piece. In all the fuss about Williams it also should be mentioned that Connie Nielson holds her own in a fantastic 2nd bill, but lead performance. As does Gary Cole doing a complete 180 on his cartoonish "Office Space" boss. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Morality Play</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope Robin Williams gets an oscar for this performance. I see this movie as a great morality play and couldn't get it out of my mind for quite a while after seeing it. Robin Williams plays a dysfunctional person, who for whatever reason has never married and apparently has no family at all. He is the outsider always looking in, but never really participating in relationships. To make his pitifully empty life bearable, he has adopted a family whose photos he copies for himself. He sees himself in this 'perfect' family as the beloved Uncle. The excitement begins when Robin's character sees things happening to degrade this perfection. His response makes for some very fine acting.**Possible Spoiler**People who are having affairs outside of their marriage should probably see this movie by themselves. It may reveal something about yourself you don't want to see with your secret 'squeeze' sitting by your side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not miss One Hour Photo if you like to predict Oscar Winners</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour PhotoIf you enjoy film, do not miss One Hour Photo, a psychological thriller.Robin Williams gives an Oscar worthy performance as Sy, the photo guy at a local Savmart. Robin Williams is unrecognizable as Sy. He is a sad, disturbed, lonely character who creates a fantasy world, in which he is a part of a young suburban family. Sy creates this connection to the family because he has been developing their family pictures for almost a decade. Eventually, his obsession with the family turns psychotic. Sy intervenes in the family dynamics using particularly twisted methods. Robin Williams does a remarkable job of making the viewer empathize with his craziness.One Hour Photo is written and directed by Mark Romanek. He captures the lonely, desperate world of Sy brilliantly. One technique he uses is emphasizing Sy's squeaky work shoes as he walks down the aisles of Savmart. The viewer feels his desperation, isolation, and loneliness. Romanek deserves an Oscar nomination for his clever script, which grips the audience in the first scene and holds their attention.One Hour Photo is not for the weak. It is dark and depressing. If you plan on predicting the Oscar winners then this is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a second look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* Like a previous comment, I agree that the photos at the end were of the "little things" that Sy spoke of. I thought to myself, "these are the things *Sy* doesn't want to forget." He also says in the narration, "No one ever takes a picture of something they want to forget." So, these little things are what Sy doesn't want to forget. I think it is not only a part of his psychosis and disconnection with reality that he doesn't want to forget the details (since his fantasy life is so out of control) but also that he is still really a child, which another writer mentioned about Sy's reaction to the child's photos. I had forgotten about that, and I'm glad I'm reminded. My interpretation is that Sy was drawn to the photo business in the first place because there is trauma in his past dealing with photographs... Otherwise, I don't think he would get all weepy at the end talking about such things and I don't think he would be so messed up. Also, I believe that after the film's end, Sy actually DOES become a part of the family and the photograph at the end and the "dream sequence" in the middle of the film are actually flash-forwards... He really does become Uncle Sy because he's brought this family closer than ever... Remember this is the same family that managed to keep its cool even after the mom had discovered dad's unfaithfulness. Sy says, "What the hell is wrong with these people?" They're apathetic, willing to turn a blind eye. And, unfortunately, in my opinion, this even includes the relationship between Sy and the little kid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting...but far from great...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is not exactly an enjoyable movie, but a very well made and interesting one where Robin Williams plays a lonely and quite possibly psychotic photo guy working at a place surreally like WalMart who seems a bit too infatuated with a young family whose photos he has been developing for years. Honestly, though Williams ultimately gives this "psycho" a very sympathetic human side, he was far more effective and entertaining as the murdering pulp novelist in "Insomnia" (which still holds the place of best movie of 2002 thus far). In the end, despite taut direction from Mark Romanek (who directs with a style that is equal bits David Fincher and David Lynch), the film collapses under its own depressive weight. In the end we realize that the events that unfold in the film are probably happening on a daily basis in America, which isn't a very entertaining nor original notion, but still a powerful one. Oh, yeah, and everybody's favorite actor Gary Cole is in it as Robin Williams' mean boss. Stat! Get Mr. Brady (aka the Devil Sheriff) an Oscar! His best performance since playing Lundberg in "Office Space." Of random note....did anyone else notice how the kid playing Jake Yorkin never really smiled (he half smiled at best and it seemed strained, or he just "smirked"--did that have some hidden meaning or was it just the way the kid smiled?) and how is eyes also seemed puffy? Also, if that was the same Connie Neilsen from Gladiator as Mrs. Yorkin (and it was!), then she is quite possibly the most underrated and miss-used actress of her generation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(POSSIBLE SPOILER)This morbid little quasi-thriller boasts impressive direction and good performances, but it's part of a movie trend which is even more alarming than the use of KING OF KINGS-style Heavenly choirs in the musical scores of pedestrian crime dramas and silly action/adventure romps... Call it genre-tweaking, or Dead Greek Male-bashing, it should be against the law of Movieland to present without the slightest differentiation a sequence of events which are only vaguely implausible (not like riding a tornado from a black-and-white Dust Bowl to a Technicolor fairyland) and then have them suddenly turn out to be someone's daydream... To crash the relationships of the main characters into a brick wall with about forty minutes of show to go. As for that weisenheimer sicko/ gotcha! ending, it's as cheap a trick as a greeting card which promises something naughty on the cover and inside has only a lame joke meant to shame the reader... But back to Aristotle. The opposite of catharsis is not a pretty thing...It's a shame. If the writer/director had played it straighter, had he not been so set on engaging in postmodern antics with the psychokiller thriller genre, this easily could have made for some great human comedy/drama. I'd bet that a good script doctor would have ordered that Sy try somehow to SAVE the Yorkin's sad situation. That might have led to something genuine, quirky, and interesting- embarrassing, disturbing, and touching all at once. But that would have cramped the trailer's style... So... We get instead a replay the usual psychokiller cliches- ingenious preliminaries to mayhem of which Hannibal Lecter could be proud..The good points... Everyone praises the direction. The last shots, of course, are a rip-off from PSYCHO, but I was thinking not so much of Hitchcock or David Lynch as of Peter Weir for most of the movie... Robin Williams is especially good when he gives the objects of his obsession the brush-off, his angry, despairing rebuff as out-of-whack as his warm devotion had been. (I just hope that our ever sadder clown is not revving up for a John Wayne Gacy biopic...) As the late Gene Siskel used to say, "I wanted to see more" of that oddball family: the all-time wimp father who is as hard as Sy to look at by the end, the kindly but clinically depressed little boy, the speciously perky and chic Mom crying out for help with her defiantly Bad Hair... Above all, I think, the always memorable Gary Cole as a middle management type, one who's too uptight and insensitive to qualify as a Regular Joe, but not quite mean or unreasonable enough to qualify as an..., well, what middle management types are so often called... </fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautifully crafted film -- a piece of art, where every frame, every choice is true artistry. I have thought a lot about this film, and I respect the filmmakers and actors and artists who contributed to it -- like Kubrick's THE SHINING in its use of music, for instance -- and yet, ultimately, I am left wondering why this high level of talent was used for this film with its ultimate lack of anything that we take from it. Is this just another look at an American psycho? Do we really need to see another person go crazy? Don't we see enough of that in real life, in real news -- need we make up more of these stories about people who terrorize others. No matter the reason, or the ending differing from other typical Hlywd stories -- it's still the same thing we're being sold -- about a man who goes off his rocker and terrorizes other people -- and, ultimately, you want to ask the artists involved: why? There is nothing redemptive here, no room for change, or hope. Just a sick and hurt person, who has injured others in his pain. Do we really want to make this one of our storytelling highpoints in film? Such beauty, such craft, such talent -- for what?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(SPOILERS)I had underestimated this movie's creepiness. I did not believe the dude who voiced the Genie in 'Aladdin' could play a character so twisted and creepy. I did not believe that any script would include such realism in what seemed like the most unrealistic and scary situations. I WAS WRONG! If you thought Robin Williams stepped over the line in 'Insomnia', be prepared...Robin Williams, finally out of his sappy movie phase and into the psycho phase, stars as Sy the Photo Guy at a SavMart who cares deeply for the quality of people's photos and the Yorkin family, regular shoppers who have their pictures developed where he works. Sy, a lonely man with only is love for photos and an apartment, has been obsessed with the family since the little boy Jake has been born. He has been keeping extra copies of their pictures on his wall at his apartment, shows up the boy's soccer practices, reading the same books as the mom, and fantasizing about becoming Uncle Sy in the family he perceives to be perfect. Except that they are not perfect. When Sy comes across photos of the dad having an affair with another woman, Sy totally snaps, and what happens afterwards definitely will make you wish you had not watched the movie.9.5 out 10 (there were a few things in the plot that neither my dad nor I didn't get). Overall, this isn't a movie to be taken lightly and definitely not for immature people. Robin Williams puts up a great performance better than he did in Insomnia and the supporting cast (Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan) are also great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I'll skip the overview since you already know what happens in the movie. There is really very little to dislike in this movie. It is brilliantly directed and the cinematography and editing is superb. Oh yeah, and Robin Williams is a phenomenal actor. There is also a lot of meaning in the movie if you are willing to look for it. The white color motif is very obvious, and there are several shots that make beautiful and telling use of the mise en scene. The ending was perfect, given Sy's character. I believe some people were thinking that Sy was going to kill the couple at the end, but that just wouldn't fit with the Sy that we are presented with the whole movie. He's not a killer, he's not even really a bad guy, he's just misguided a little (ok, a lot). To explain the ending for those who didn't catch it, Sy had two rolls of film (one in the camera and one in his bag). He did take pictures of Will and Maya in forced sexual positions, but the pictures that Eriq LaSalle's character hands him are the ones that he took of the little things; the remote control, the toilet, the sofa, etc. Early in the movie, he says "Nobody takes pictures of the little things." This is also why he liked the pictures that the little kid took, because they were just of the everyday things that people take for granted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Actor Oscar Robin Williams/Best Screenplay Mark Romanek</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is excellent from beginning to end. Of course there is much more to it then meets the eye. Robin's latest non-comedic role is that of Sy the Camera Guy, a friendless, familyless man who's childhood demons are about to catch up with him.  He lives vicariously through the Yorkin's, a seemingly ideal family who he develops film for. Robin's narrative IS significant, as it gives many cryptic clues as to what the film's really about. (SPOILERS--SPOILERS--SPOILERS) Sy collects extra sets of the Yorkin photos and puts them on his wall, seeing Jake's childhood as the ideal one he wished he had. The background music by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek (Run Lola Run) sets the melancholy mood of despair as we are given clue after clue as to his actual abused childhood, starting with the red eye effect in an actual photo of him and family. Then the Deepak Chopra quote, "What we fear most, already happend to us." Then his telling Jake he broke his collarbone as a kid by "falling from a tree". The lid on his demons explodes when he develops photos showing Will's infidelity, then gets fired by a fascist boss.  Then the elaborate plan goes into effect. He threatens his boss, leaving clues for the authorities, and finally in cathartic release acts out his own abuse, his abusive father taking him over. Then the regression to the ideal childhood, hence the photos of objects a la Jake's photos. Importantly we don't know all this until the end, when he explains it to the detective. Of course this will go over the heads of many in the mainstream audience, so we get the "weak ending" criticisms that show they don't get it. This is a subjective jump into Sy's tortured world and the most appropriate comparison would be to Midnight Cowboy. The parellel to Joe Buck's isolation and naivetee, his disconnection with the TV and radio shows he watches/listens to for example is strikingly similar.This film works on every level and if any justice exists will sweep the Oscars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I fell asleep during Insomnia, but I stayed awake during the showing of One Hour Photo. Does anyone ever stop to think if the person who processed your photos may be stealing copies of them for reasons unknown to you?Insomnia never did anything for me. And Robin Williams has done other serious things before that movie or OHP. This movie, coming from an artist, Mark Romanek, is better than all the stale Hollywood fluff like Swimfan, Stealing Harvard, or XXX. This is because Romanek knows how to make your heart feel like it's being gripped really tight. And no one else could ever do that through a movie. I'd rather hear about a lonely man obsessed with a family instead of a girl who leaves her panties in another girl's car on purpose like in Swimfan.Sy is a man who needs someone to love. A man like this is someone I felt sorry for, just like Norman Bates in Psycho (1960). All Sy has is his work, a knowledge of photography, and an apartment to live in. That's it. Nina, Will, and Jakob Yorkin have each other, a lovely home, and they have Sy to develop their film. So yet, Sy does have some friends, but all four of these characters have their flaws like any else would have. Many of us have been obsessed with someone in their life, and that obsession has led to bad results for some people. I can't help but once again, feel sorry for Sy after his obsession with the Yorkin family takes it's toll. However, That should make us aware of all the scandals that have taken place in 2002. Sy isn't the only one who collects photos and obsesses over them.So, I can't agree with the negative reviews but I will respect them. But just think about where your photographs go when you drop off your film.9.5 out of 10This film actually gave me INSOMNIA</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams delivers a brilliant performance. The art direction is wonderful. The cinematography is also great. But, the film presents the same shallow stereotypes about human behavior as a cheapo Halloween film might do with more camp and gore. Single poor middle aged men are scary or bad or crazy or gay or all of the above. Married pretty young people have everything and feelings too. All single poor middle aged men must therefore hate or envy all young pretty married people. These cultural stereotypes are the basis of the film's credibility. They are derived from the sensational press stories of psycho serial killers and such. The film would make excellent propaganda against anyone who deviates from the nuclear family norm. The hotel scene seems especially confused to me. One minute, the Robin Williams character seems like Dirty Harry, and then he seems like Hannibal Lechter. The thematic core seems adolescent. It lacks mature humanity. I prefer the Halloween films' version of the subject matter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS! AND LOTS OF 'EM!I remarked to my date upon leaving "One Hour Photo" that it should win an Academy Award for "Best White Paint", including that used upon Robin Williams, who looked blank all through the picture. Let me see now. This here guy who works as a photo developer in a (white) SavMart, has become fixated on what he perceives as a perfect family judging from the photos he develops. He then gets fired by his meany of a boss because he has been stupid enough to make extra copies of the family's photos to use as wallpaper in his (white) apartment without paying SavMart for them. (The boss, apparently, has taken twelve years or so to figure out that the books don't balance.) Have I got it right so far?Meanwhile, Sy has discovered that the husband in this perfect family has been having an affair. And not only THAT, the affair has been chronicled in detail in snapshots! (Taken by... who? Was it one of those manage-a-trois things? If so, is that what Sy is so upset about?)Anyway, he decides to ruin the lives of his perfect family by making sure the wife learns of her husband's affair, and also decides to scare the bejesus out of his ex-boss by taking pictures of his daughter - and he makes sure the boss knows HE took the pictures so the cops will come after him. (Help! Stop me before I photograph again!) He then terrorizes the errant husband and his girlfriend at knifepoint and makes them pose for dirty pictures, because... Oh! Of course! HE had had to do the same when he was a child. Which, of course, explains everything. At least for anybody under the age of five. Being over the age of five, my reaction was: "Jeez, talk about being Politically Correct!OR--- The whole episode with the husband and girlfriend is something Sy made up. OR--- The whole episode with his boss was something Sy made up. OR--- The cops catching and interrogating him (in a dazzling white room) was something Sy made up. OR--- the whole movie was made up by someone who thought "Well, I'm writing about a psychotic, and psychotics are not rational, therefore my movie doesn't have to be rational either. I can't lose!"And judging by some of the comments I've seen, he was right. Personally, if I want to puzzle out a puzzle, I'll get a puzzlebook. I go to movies in hopes of 1) being entertained, or 2) if I'm very lucky, being enlightened on some aspect of the human condition. (Doesn't happen often.) But not puzzled. I can do without puzzled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Romanek seemed like he did a good job writing this one, as I was certainly pleased with this film. What some others might critique about the movie I am not personally concerned with. All of the small details aren't always what every movie is about, you don't need to know every little detail. The film did develop slowly, yes, but that was the foundation of this film, it was supposed to be that way, it wasn't a mistake on the part of the film crew. This film wasn't 100% thriller, not in my opinion at least. It leaned more towards drama, spiked with the perfect thriller elements. Robin's character makes you feel sympathetic for him, as he is nothing more than a "one hour photo guy" that seemingly has seen little love and compassion in his life, therefore he lives inside of everyone else's lives, making their personal photos the backbone of his own life. At one point during the film I found myself calling him a psycho, and 2 minutes later I found myself feeling sorry for him. Robin Williams, you devil! What a wonderful role played by the man "formerly known as Jack". The rest of the cast also did an excellent job, especially "Jake". I also thought that the lighting in this film was superb, it certainly set the tone and kept me in tune with the film. The music was also pleasing, helped ease the film along quite well. $6 well spent for me, and my hats off to Robin.</fullReview>

FACT: Not all wives react immediately to finding out about their husbands infidelity. and who cares if the pictures took over an hour to process? Robin Williams, known for over acting many times in other movies, does a very good job of playing creepy guy beneath the surface of a sad and lonely man. A nice change of pace from all the pseudo realistic Hollywood movie machine. Don't get me wrong, I love a lot of the stuff the Hollywood machine cranks out.

		<shortDescription>A highly disturbing anti-thriller with excellent acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo follows "Sy the Photo Guy" your average old guy working at the photo center at your average *insert-name-here*-Mart. As everyone knows Sy is played by Robin Williams who shows off an uncanny acting ability that I wish we would've seen earlier. Sure, Williams is great as the funny guy, but he has such a great skill at well disturbing the hell out of me. The rest of the cast is pretty good, especially the boy Jacob, he was a good kid that had the perfect balance of youthful innocence and well not being annoying. Also while the plot can be somewhat predicted at certain points the end is great because you get completely set-up and then are given a 180. A lot of people will complain that the movie is slow and isn't a thriller, well then you came to the wrong movie. The film is a slow methodical thriller that sets up Sy's breakdown, not a thrill ride. its called suspense, look it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Your not going to be at the edge of your seat. You probably won't really be creeped out by Sy. But you will see an interesting movie with a brilliant performance by Robin Williams. Sy the Photo Guy is not just a creepy guy who's there to chase an innocent family around the screen. He's a real sympathetic human character. And watching this character develop is really what the movie is all about. The reviewsers here who have dinged this movie for its weak story line have a point. But a paitent viewer will find this a rewarding movie.This is not the best of Robin William's recent spate of "dark" movies, but it is his best "dark" performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One flaw I could not get past...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie did live up to my expectations - it was disturbing, and Robin Williams has again proven himself capable of a flawless performance on any end of the spectrum he chooses. There was one major flaw in the story line that I just could not get past (may be a bit of a spoiler here): When Sy was fired, and visibly upset about it, he was allowed to "finish out the week," and to keep the keys to the store. If he were truly fired for suspected wrongdoing, he would have been escorted out immediately upon his firing, not given unlimited freedom for two or three more days. Then, when he returned to the store as a customer, he was under suspicion.The film was a frightening depiction of the type of insanity that happens, unnoticed, every day in the world. Makes you want to take a deeper look into the mundane.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though you may not of heard of Mark Romanek, the writer/director of "One Hour Photo," you've probably seen a few of his music videos. One of his most famous is the video for "Closer" by Nine Inch Nails. Knowing this, would you be surprised to know that "One Hour Photo" is, in a nutshell . . . creepy?Evoking a visual style reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick, Romanek's engrossing story tells the tale of the lonely photo clerk Sy Parrish. He obsesses over the smallest details of his job as though each photo was a work of art, and he is as proud of the pictures he develops as those who took them. Robin Williams' performance as the idiosyncratic and solitary Sy is breath-taking.The plot of the movie isn't as important as its style. Sy spends about half the movie fantasizing of a better life. We are guiding very carefully through some of these dreams, both waking and unconscious. Other dreams we enter as they occur, and Sy's mind is our only guild. We are never too sure what is really happening and what is all in Sy's head.Sy wants nothing more than a family that loves him, and if he had to choose, it'd be the Yorkins. Will, Nina and little Jakob, they are the, ahem, picture of suburban happiness. Sy should know; every time they get a role of film developed, Sy keeps a copy for himself.But all is not well in the Yorkin house. There are fights over money, negligence, and other things that never make it to the one hour photo. When Sy discovers his ideal family is being torn apart, the movie gets a little .. . weird. Or should I say, weirder. This is where a typical movie would turn Sy into a mass murderer or some kind of maniacal ranting loony. Instead, Sy chooses his actions and his words with more care. He hones his attention to detail like a conductor of a symphony and tracks down the people that are responsible for shattering his dream world. His ultimate revenge is probably the hardest to understand. This is where the movie becomes the most difficult to watch, but where the most intrigue lays. To understand his actions in this scene, and indeed throughout the movie, we must try to understand Sy's entire life. Romanek's skill as a director is that he gives us the tools to decode Sy's odder behavior, but doesn't spell it out in obvious terms. While it's not the greatest film in its genre, its certainly worth a look to anyone interested in some intense character study. And as a foot note, I can't tell you how great it was to see the second movie in as many weeks that featured bleeding eyes. Ug. I need a shower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually thrillers like this are shown on minor television stations at about ten p.m. and never find their way to the movies (only, of course, if someone like Robin Williams stars). I was invited to a preview of this film, and I got negatively surprised. The plot of One Hour Photo is based on the idea that it is quite spooky to think of somebody who knows a lot about you because he regularly develops your photographs. A nice idea this is but that's where it ends: The story is predictable and the dialogues are tense and artificial, therefore no suspense arises, and after a couple of minutes it's perfectly clear how things are going to develop. Robin Williams is brilliant, though, but he has no competitors. The family he persecutes is boring and pale, and Connie Nielsen stands out concerning soap-opera-acting.An obvious means of style is the use of pale colours only to present the main character's every-day surroundings. I am not quite sure whether to regard this as a good trick or just as a lack of creativity. In the end, the main character explains his whole life (and the whole film) to the audience, and it doesn't take him more than two minutes. I guess this is how this movie came into existence: the writers presented their idea to the producers, it didn't take them longer than ten sentences, the producers were convinced, and everything else was just a matter of time and money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly Creepy and Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Hour Photo" is a movie for people who love good movies and not the blockbuster garbage Hollywood so frequently churns out. It is an intimate portrayal of Sy the photo guy(Robin Williams) and his descent into madness. We actually start to feel for Sy, because we can fully understand the reasons for his actions, even though they may be twisted and removed from reality. Sy is neither a good guy or a bad guy he is just "there". This film will make you think about a lot of things, but it will probably have you taking a closer look at the grocery store clerk or the fast food employee or any other common labourer we see everyday. The camera angles and use of color is done very well. The director obviously had a very detailed idea of the look he wanted for every scene and in every scene it works very well. The ending at first seems out of place, but after being removed from the movie for awhile, it starts to make more sense. If you're a fan of the psycho thriller, than this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kodak moment?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We're accustomed to Robin Williams playing quirky characters. From the unscripted Mork to the unconventional Patch Adams, we have learned to cut him slack in taking roles to enhance his range rather than his image. This one is a stark contrast to his recent touring performances and HBO special, and perhaps it's his way of achieving balance. We see a remarkable portrayal of Seymour (Sy) Parrish, a lonely guy getting his life experiences by vicarious means and an extra copy of selected prints. Without a life of his own, Sy lives through his fantasies triggered by the photos he expertly develops. His narrative on the lives of select regular patrons of his shop is a classic of middle American profiling. And his strict attention to detail brings him close to blows with a repair technician whose reality is closer to pedestrian standards.Beige is Sy's theme from his clothes and car to most of his apartment. The contrast between his sallow life and his target fantasy family is vivid. His only friends seem to be imaginary as Sy move from fantasy to reality in dream sequences that get more bizarre as the story moves forward.Gary Cole portrays the typical discount store manager (Bill Owens) who's waiting to pounce on any oversight as he peers out from the perch overlooking his domain. His management style, as evidenced by Sy's discharge, is a textbook example of bad management, but more the rule rather than the exception for a mall manager. When Sy begins to use his camera as a weapon (with an interesting explanation of the derivation of the word "snapshot") he really goes for revenge. And by the time he's through, you have a very strong argument for digital photography and marital fidelity.In the absence of a dark room - since these high-tech developers do it in broad daylight - we have a very dark film. Not one that will give you nightmares, but you'll never again leave your real address with the clerk at your one-hour photo. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had alot of promise building up throughout the first half but unfortunately leads the audience to a complete let down. I can understand the character Sy is supposed to be a complusive and somewhat disturbed individual and his actions do make sense on one level however it just doesn't translate as being very entertaining. Your left with an empty feeling at the conclusion and you sit and wonder what direction the film intended on taking.Was it supposed to chronicle this short duration in his life when his world comes tumbling apart?Was it supposed to display people in general can become fixated on events or activities of others as a result of other stimulation?Was it supposed to teach us not to trust aging and creepy photo men at our local Walmart?I could not derive a definitive answer. In the end I guess the movie is worth a watch just to say you saw and it form your own opinion. It does have some decent dialogue and Robin Williams manages to pull off a believable performance however I wouldn't be rushing out to see it. (wait for someone else to rent)There is one more aspect which deserves a severe amount of criticism and that is the use of the soundtrack. For one it is extremely unoriginal ranging from the theme music in American Beauty to the concluding score of Requiem for a Dream. Its like the director watched those movies a few months ago and said "wow I think I will take this track and that track and try to create the exact same mood with them in my movie". It completely threw me off of the scenes that were trying to use it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went with my dad to see this out of the lack of good movies going around right now. And I'm happy I did. One Hour Photo is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen."One Hour Photo" focuses on a man named Seymour "Sy" Parrish who works at the photo development area in Savmart. He seems normal, if a little monotone. He definately loves his work. But theres something more. Hes fixated on The Yorkins, a family he has been developing pictures for. In secret, he makes extra prints of the pictures they want developed and takes them for his own, quietly adopting the family as his own. Then one day, everything changes.I loved this movie. Pure and simple. But, I wouldnt have loved it as much if Robin Williams wasnt in it. He makes Seymour come alive and does a hell of a job doing it. After this and "Insomnia", if he doesnt get an Oscar nomination, Im gonna be really surprised. See One Hour Photo ASAP!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oscar Nom for Robin?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was far better than I expected. *** SPOILER ALERT, SORT-OF *** What could have easily, on a number of occasions, turned into a story filled with cliches and formulas seen a dozen times before in movies about psychologically disturbed people, the director-writer chooses instead (to his credit) to make this a study of a character, with actual character development. I expected, so many times, that a certain standard Hollywood plot twist would naturally happen, but it did not. I thank the writer-director for such inventiveness and restraint. Robin Williams, along with the script and direction, takes what would otherwise be a two-dimensional character (Sy Parrish, or "Sy the Photo Guy"), and develops him (pun intended) in various ways. The most important way is to allow the audience see the peels coming off the seemingly rigid outside of an otherwise fragile, insecure, soft-in-the-middle, and pathetic human being. But Williams is so good at this role, that we even are allowed to feel empathy (not sorry, not pity) for this lonely man, this truly disturbed, isolated individual. And we even get to understand him, thanks to the writer!, quite the opposite of what we expect when Hollywood uses a plot about a dangerous person. This is not an evil person -- it is someone who desperately needs to feel loved and needed. Then two events shatter his entire self-made life, and he becomes downright scary.When Sy's isolation and how he deals with it, is depicted throughout, the Simon and Garfunkel song "I Am a Rock" somehow comes to mind. Also, early in the film, when we first see Sy sitting alone watching "The Simpsons" (a cartoon family, just as unreal as the seemingly ideal family he develops in his own mind), and as the camera pulls back, we see the extent of his obsession and madness. But it reminds you of the Robert DeNiro character rehearsing at his home in "The King of Comedy".I think that Robin Williams should expect at least a nomination for best actor. He is superb as someone who is both chilling and frightening and also who needs to be loved and treated with care. His Sy Parrish might end up being as famous as Norman Bates and Travis Bickel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply, over all, I'd give this film a 4 out of 5 stars. Williams performance was excellent. I think he has the voice and look to pull of a subtel obsessed person. The filmtography was great. But the overall movie didn't live up to what I expected to be.I belive the main trouble is that the writer/director tries too hard to show you how obsessed Sy the photo guy is with the family. I liked it when Sy was able to site the family's address of the top of his head, but then he has fantasies about the family, which I think the film could've done without.It also seems that the family is so concerned about Sy and his personal well-being. This, I found, to be rather unbelievible. I think the story would've benifited if the family didn't acknowledge Sy too much.The motivation for Sy's actions was very well put. And also the reason why Sy became a photo guy (which you find out at the end) is very well writen.I also had mixed feelings about the voice-overs in which Sy talks about photos. In the beginning it was fine, but then some voice-overs were thrown in to the middle of the movie which I found distracting and tended to bring me back to reality. The thing I did like about the voice-overs was the writing, because, if you listen to them, they bring up asspects that one would never really think of. (Altho, I have but I think about stuff like that.)So altho there were a few problems, mostly with the writing, I would say over all it is worth watching.</fullReview>

To Sy photography is more than a job/hobby it is obsession. His loneness to sadness into anger for the family whose photos he has on the wall of the apartment. He not knows when the fantasy end and reality to begin. End of possible spoiler.I think the family characters nicely explained in movie, but Sy needed more little screen time to understand how he was when he younger. This movie is not for everyone taste and for younger audience than 17 years. The film is hard to describe, nevertheless it is interesting and haunted images of people.

All in all One Hour Photo could of been made into a one hour movie and still be as good or better than it is now. Do not get me wrong One Hour Photo is one of the better films I have seen this year. Robin Williams really stepped up his career this past year or two (see also Insomnia). He is now in my book for one of the most versatile actors to date. Connie Nielsen (Nina Yorkin) is great like usual- from Mission to Mars to Gladiator Connie Nielsen is a well developed actress that just has not got the name for herself yet( hopefully she will, she is great). Eriq LaSalle is a great suprise actor in this film playing a smooth not over-acted cop. He brings to the screen necessity of a cop character - nice to see him in something great after E.R. Director Mark Romanek makes a wise choice for his first hit film - should have a great career in his future if he keeps this up. It seems he kind of over did it with the nudity but it wasn't entirely bad, it wasn't like it was a Porno. The end will leave you on the edge of your seat (cliche for all suspense movies, but this really does). You could not ask for anymore out of any involved in this picture. Last the composition for this film is absolutely amazing. The composers from Twyker's Run Lola Run and The Princess and the Warrior create a smooth and paced film score that is one of the better ones i have ever heard. The score fits the film so well that during the semi-slow scenes the music keepes you intrested. What a GREAT film - in my opinion a MUST SEE! One Hour Photo - 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little more work here and there in the direction and effects within this movie, and a little more drama or impact in the finale would have made this otherwise above average movie into an outstanding movie. Still, it's one of the best performances by Robin Williams to date. Slightly dark, good conveyances of emotion, good acting and directing make for a very enjoyable Friday evening movie. The movie was particularly effective at portraying to the viewer the emotions and illusions within the emotionally unstable, or psychotic Williams. You get your money's worth with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams shows us that he is one of the best in Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite thing about this film was the fact that the lead character Seymour Parrish, played by Williams, was not as black and white (no pun intended) as many of these so called 'psychos' we see in these thrillers popping up all over the place. We understood and are as the film rolls to a close made to understand what has driven this man and how, given his life, we may make the same choices he has made. I found it very disturbing to find myself identifying with this man and yet feeling so very far from him. This falls heavily on excellent writing, but could not have been possible without the stellar performance of Oscar Award winning actor Robin Williams.This films release falls very close to the release of Robin Williams' latest stand-up comedy special on HBO. It's amazing to see this man transform himself from the insane comic to this brilliantly played character. It does nothing but reassure us, the audience, that Mr. Williams is not only one of the greatest actors of our time, but maybe one of the finest ever. This is not to deny the well-played performances of the supporting cast. The ever beautiful and sexy, Connie Nielsen portrays the ever-loving mother, who even in the face of tragedy will never do anything to break up her family. Also, at times it is hard to remember that young Dylan Smith is an actor and not a young boy thrust into this situation. My applause goes out to the cast of this motion picture.However, a film cannot survive on it's cast alone. My hat goes off to director Mark Romanek. A fan of Romanek's work as a music video director (particularly his work with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails) I was simply blown away by his full length picture debut. I was very impressed with the use of the RGB. Anyone who knows any thing about the production of photography knows that the colors are done in levels of Red Green and Blue. The way these three colors are schemed throughout the fill was utterly brilliant. Camera use and cinematography also help capture the surreal and horrifying reality of this film.I was also very found off the soundtrack. Its simplicity gave the film the perfect feel. If you look at the track from start to finish, you'll realize that the entire score is one huge build from start to finish. It really pushes you toward what's coming next, which is what the thriller is all about.Overall I give it a 9 out of 10. And if you know me, nobody ever gets a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER---I am labeling this analysis as a spoiler. It does not actually give the end. But reading will help the viewer enjoy the movie--like seeing the cameo of Hitch in any of his movies.]____________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________________________________________________I read up on this movie at this site yesterday, but went to see it today. NOW I understand why some viewers were disappointed. I DEFINITELY WAS NOT!!! THIS WAS AN OUTSTANDING MOVIE!! The telescoping symbols in OHP tell a consistent, subtextual story that has the viewer 'put the pieces together.' The writer/director, I believe intentionally eliminated outright, 'right-foot,left-foot' lame tell all storytelling, but allowed the viewer to assemble the information cumulatively. This is a rare intelligent psychological thriller--like The Talented Mr. Rippley--only not so dark.Telescoping examples: RW character is exemplified in the shot of the pet hamster, running as fast as he could in the exercise wheel. Hamster lived within the given confines, and responded with reflexive normalcy.Meaning: Sy is a person living the caged and kept 'hamster's life'. He waits for the caretaker to feed him (Sy feeds hamster/Savmore feeds Sy).The cage is Sy's knowlege and practice of confining animal expression wanting to get out, but not knowing how.The wheel is a telescoping metaphore for daily activities of life; whether the hamster goes fast, or slow, he does not go anywhere or exceed the boundaries of the cage.The 'eye' is a symbol for ultimately individual perceptual subjectivity in life. Life is as we see it is.Some examples: photography as life sustaining, medical corneal lecture at hotel, the blood from Sy's eye in his mind, the argument in the store (3+ blue miscalibration)Meaning: a telescoping hint that Sy is highly influenced by the [eye's] information. He built his life around flat visuals--the pictures--and 'all was well' perception. The perception was again put forward when after being fired, Sy turns up a photo on the floor and it is blank. This is as far as the director went in [obviously] putting out the key his symbols for examination.I study movies for symbolic content--and HIGHLY RECOMMEND this one. Robin Williams is an outstanding actor--and proved it here. Anyone else "do metaphors"??</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film will be remembered along with other great suspense movies of the all time. With this film, Mark Romanek should be considered easily on par with classic suspense directors like Alfred Hitchcock or Henri-Georges Clouzot."One Hour Photo" is an amazing character study with Robin Williams portraying a slightly disturbed, definitely quirky individual. There is no clichéd treatment to the film and this is what makes it timeless. The story unfolds deliberately and with a high sense of craft. There is an uneasiness felt throughout and it is obvious that the film makers want the viewer to experience this. They deserve accolades for not bowing to convention and potentially ruining what proved to be a clever finale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this movie, the first one where I've seen Robin Williams in a serious lead role, he dominates the screen with his total immersion into his character. To watch him in pain hurts the viewer. The theater where I went to see this movie with a friend was completely silent, not a sound--everyone was fully drawn into this film and connected to it. Of course, it's easier to connect to a character who has the opportunity to commit murder but does not, seeking to punish the transgressor, but this doesn't take anything away from Williams--he's simply great, possibly Oscar worthy. I was slightly disturbed by the fact that the boy ran to his father at the end, although he knew of the father's infidelity. Other than that, this is easily one of the best films I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I'm sure you know already, Williams is as great as he usually is in serious roles. The film is creepy and very atmospheric. The climax, however, is a bit disappointing. I will not count this against the movie because I believe that it is simply years of SEVEN-style movies that have shaped us into accepting nothing less than an awfully disturbing ending for a film that builds up such creepy tension. Instead, we are given a more realistic, character-driven, climax that was very well done, but, unfortunately, steps on our expectations. I think that if viewers are prepared for a lack of a climax they might very well find one. One side note that I must mention is the fact that this film reused a lot of classic score. It used clips from AMERICAN BEAUTY, BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM: all great movies whose score helps define and it was kind of upsetting to see it used in convenient parts of ONE HOUR PHOTO. However the scene that used the NIN clip was excellent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I for one, was very excited to see Robin Williams in a gritty,villianous role, and was incredibly let down by "Insomnia", andagain, though not as badly, by One Hour Photo. In the beginningand middle portions of the film, there is a very effective creepy buildup, as to what Sy Parish will do for this family, or more likely tothem, when he isn't accepted as Great ole' Uncle Sy. This is alsoplayed out brilliantly by Williams, my let down mentioned at thestart is not of his acting, but how his roles are written really. Thebuild up this film offers is just so let down by its ending. Sy reallydoesn't do anything, he takes some odd photographs, thats aboutit, then the police catch him, we find out about his troubledchildhood, and all end well. So much of a let down. I always feel inmovies about a psycho type, no motive or explanation (in this caseSy being an abused child) makes it much scarier. I understandthis film was a psychological thriller, and I am not at all saying Ineed a shooting or gore to scare me for an ending, but somethingmore frightening for an ending to this film's creepy build up wouldbe nice. For a MUCH more effective thriller along similar lines, gowatch "The Talented Mr. Ripley".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, Robin Williams has long ago proven he can really act. His recent foray into darker, more menacing characters is an interesting change. His work here is excellent. For a first time directing a movie, this is also impressive. The biggest problem we had with the movie was that we never got more than a brief glance into Sy's motivation and past. We never really got to know the rest of the characters either. We saw more of the Yorkin family than Sy did, so we weren't looking at them only through Sy's perspective, yet we knew only a little more about them then he did. We never got inside of any of the characters, we never really came to know any of them enough to like or dislike them. Although slow paced, the atmosphere was great, the tension and emotions built nicely and a couple of nice surprises delivered cleverly. Overall worth checking out, just don't be surprised if the movie seems a little unfinished at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Photo Positive/Photo Negative</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In ONE HOUR PHOTO Robin Williams gives an electrifying performance as a photo lab technician in a giant retail emporium (generically named SAV-MART in the movie). A slight , bespectacled middle-aged man with nondescript features, Seymour "Sy the Photo Guy" Parish is fastidious in appearance (his blue work smock is always neatly ironed) and meticulous in his dealings with customers ( almost overly polite, he nimbly handles customers' rolls of film as if they were prized possessions). Sy's voice-over narration at the film's beginning stresses his obsession with photographic perfection and gives a strong clue that for Sy, work is everything. Inherent in the job is the role of voyeur, for Sy peruses the countless number of negative turned -to -positive photos as records of the day to day lives of his customers. He hones in particularly on the pictures of one attractive suburban family, the Yorkins, whose negatives he has been developing for years. When pretty mom Nina Yorkin drops off her film for processing, Sy never fails to ask how the family is doing, and charms Nina's young son Jakob with surprise gifts ( a disposable camera). When Nina's husband Will meets Sy for the first time while looking for an item in the store, he is nonplussed by Sy's overly-friendly manner and familiarity with family names and events. In this scene and in others, the audience feels a discomfort that is almost palpable. Sy Parrish is a desperately lonely man ; when not at work he spends his nights in his dingy, second - story apartment sitting on his sofa in a catatonic state, watching episodes of The Simpsons. His living room is spare and barren but for one wall that is covered with photos.......As a character study of a social misfit, ONE HOUR PHOTO relies heavily on Robin Williams' brilliant acting, which covers mightily for what is essentially a scenario that has been played out ad nauseam on countless made for t.v. movies. Mark Romanek, directing his first feature film after years of helming some of the best music videos (featuring David Bowie, Madonna and Nine Inch Nails among others), imbues this movie with an edgy atmosphere that makes it compulsively watchable if not particularly entertaining. His screenplay never really explains why Sy acts the way he does , and a vague reference by Sy toward the film's conclusion of past abuse doesn't dramatically satisfy. The other characters take a back seat to the Williams portrayal; not fully fleshed out, they seem to serve merely as victims to Sy's explosive rage. This film is, however, an impressive first effort by a promising talent, and a must see for anyone wanting to witness Robin Williams giving the performance of his life.</fullReview>

This is a powerful, interestingly ambiguous and non-judgmental, subtle portrait of a psycho - or is he ? The whole movie is very restrained in both filming and acting, yet very suggestive and often chilling; the story appears simple at first but it has more depth than first meets the eye. Forget about supporting cast here, this is the story of one man and Robin Williams (as usual or for once, take your pick) more than suffices to make it grippingly successful. I heard the director used to make videos for Nine Inch Nails - well, it sure looks like Trent Reznor knows how to pick his collaborators !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, Complex, But Not Complete</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) says, in the show's opening, "No one ever takes a photograph of something they want to forget." This is an important comment to keep in mind throughout the course of the film. After receiving some very troubling news at work, Sy finds a picture lying on the floor. He picks it up only to find it is blank, representing a point in Sy's life that he would obviously like to forget. The movie is both clever and complex, but yet not thoroughly developed. I left the film wanting something more; more background, more insight. We do not know why Sy first selected the Yorkin family as the object of his obsession. Nor do we learn much about Sy's life either. We are only given a few brief bits of sketchy information with which to form our own conclusions. These rather fuzzy details are an interesting contrast to the meticulous way in which Sy routinely develops the Yorkin family photos.The film helps to illustrate Williams' range as an actor. I would say that Sy is a complex character, but not a menacing, or even disturbing one. He did not threaten any member of the Yorkin family until Will Yorkin (Michael Vartan) began to do that himself with his own neglectful and unfaithful actions. The film also shows us that Williams still has the ability to make us laugh regardless of the role he is portraying. Despite the film's incompleteness, I could not help but like it. It is an enjoyable glimpse into human behavior and its consequences. We come in contact with people everyday, some on a regular basis. One Hour Photo is a story of one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams stars as Sy the Photo Guy in the powerfully disturbing `One Hour Photo'. Sy is an obsessed photo clerk who obsesses on a family who have developed their pictures with him throughout the years. This is Williams' best work and shot on winning a leading Best Actor Oscar. At least, I do picture him being nominated. Williams portrays Sy as a disturbed loner with a misplaced psychotic behavior. Because Williams executes a masterful job in revealing the melancholic loneliness of Sy, audiences will tend to feel guilty when rooting for our antagonistic protagonist. By being kept in the dark throughout most of the film on Sy's reasons behind his maniac obsession, viewers are unable to predict on how the story develops. However, the information on Sy's `unkodak childhood moments' which explains the method to his madness are eventually revealed. It is Williams' picture perfect performance which makes `One Hour Photo' no flash in the pan.***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely do I walk out, at the end of the film, being honestly creeped out to the extent that I look behind me from the theatre, all the way to the car. "One Hour Photo" did just that. I'm not sure if it was the fact that the situation was something that could happen to anyone that gets a photo developed, or the fact that Robin Williams played the part so convincingly. It avoids the typical Hollywood route of making Williams' character obsessed with his victims in a sexual sense. It is more a case of severe envy. He envies the customer that seemingly has it all, and when you see him go home to his empty, lonely appartment, you don't know whether or not to fear him, or feel sorry for him.There's a number of things going on in this film. Imagery that I cannot begin to comprehend. However the placing of Williams' character in a store that is painted white with innocence, when he, deep down, is a distrubed scarey individual, is nothing short of brilliance.Definately an Oscar contender, if not for the film itself, then for Williams' portrayl. See this movie.</fullReview>

This only happens with about 20 rented and theater movies a month, you'd figure I'd learn. Maybe its cool, everyone knows that when you expect less from a movie the better it is the better it seems. Anyway...We've all heard that "One Hour Photo" is a great film and once again I wasn't all about seeing it. I was thinking that the best part of the film may be the cool flavored popcorn that my favorite movie theater has, but was I wrong.Okay, so you have this kinda creepy photo guy who's all anal about his pic's looking perfect for "his customers". He seems to just care about everyone and their pictures, but actually, he REALLY cares about one family in particular. As the movie goes on we find that he's that typical creep-o who seems to have never had a happy life of his own, so he likes to imagine himself in the pictures he develops.The movie is great, I think, because of what it does to you. I'm very big on not mistaking a movie for good just because it makes you feel something, but I have to give this one credit because of the roller-coaster it puts you on. Not in an action way, but in an emotional, suspenseful way. I found myself thinking this movie was predictable and not suspenseful, but every time I thought I knew what to expect, the exact opposite would happen. I wish that I could write a couple of examples but writing in *SPOILER* and typing away just isn't my style (I play it cool, you know, like when you're a Jet you're a Jet). The play with colors and lack there of was very cool too, I love when directors know what they are doing with color, like Soderbergh and Scorsese (not to put Romanek on such a pedestal, but he did a great job). The couple seems to be a bit 'shaggy' in my opinion and Gary Cole gave a performance that makes you wonder how he crawled out of the 'TV and straight-to-video' click with Mike Pare and Judith Light. These things did nothing to hurt the movie though, so they are barley worth the mention. Robin Williams is fantastic and even though there are some scenes that make you think 'what's the odds' it does a good job to say, maybe small, but there is a chance with this wacko. Okay, okay...I'm done, go see and enjoy the movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wait a minute: THAT was Connie Nielsen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a relatively dark film, but with a certain sense of humanity for a film produced by Christine Vachon. I thought the ending did a nice job of wrapping up without too much explanation exactly why Sy would be so obsessed by the images of happy families, and why something that disturbed that perfection would so unnerve him. Unfortunately, in our rather full theater, almost all of the conversations in the photo shop itself seemed to have been dubbed over again, and so the sound was just the slightest bit off the lip movement.  However, beyond the brilliantly tender yet menacing performance of Robin Williams here, I've got to give it to Connie Nielsen. I kept on thinking the name sounded familiar, and only today did I remember that this was the woman who so grandly played the emperor's brother in Gladiator. To go from that role into this one so easily, seeming 10 years younger/hipper and totally unrecognizable to me, shows that this woman has got a real future. The whole cast does a great job living out what is really a simple, deliberate, well-developed plot. One qualm: why begin with Sy in the interrogation room with the cop? That moment spoils the whole suspense at the end about whether Sy's going to make it out of the hotel. It would've been far more appealing had we not known what was going to happen, if he would have gotten shot or caught. On the other hand, the camerawork in that five minute sequence, along with the majority of the film, is fantastic and I hope Romanek goes on and makes another picture just as engrossing as this one. This guy could be the next Chris Nolan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. And I do mean darkness. Not sure if this one is more about lonliness, mental illness or life as an illusion. So many ways to analyze the script, I think it best left to each filmgoer to think about it their own way. Director Mark Romanek had a nice cast to support the mostly harrowing performance of Robin Williams. Only a couple of times does Williams go over the top, but mostly he plays the creepy Sy the Photo Guy to perfection. Copnnie Nielsen (superb in "Rushmore") and Michael Vartan ("Never Been Kissed") are the blissfully yuppie couple where you can't tell the book by the cover. Eriq LaSalle as the detective mostly raises an eyebrow here and there to emote. My one complaint with the cast is the stereotyped Gary Cole. He should stick to made for TV movies, although he almost pulls off the discount store manager role. Yet, he is too cheesy even for this. Romanek has obviously studied Hitchcock and Kubrick; however, I had the feeling he also studied the Hitchcock-copying DePalma in many shots. The stark feel of the Sav-Mart and specifically the photo lab make for wonderful back drops and contrast for the earthy colors and textures of the Yorkin's home. Overall a decent psychological thriller, but could have been great with a little more script effort. Too many "easy outs" for a true thriller - especially the ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"One Hour Photo" was an all around solid movie. Robin Williams gave a good performance of one of the most interesting characters in recent memory. The main draw of the movie, for me, was at first feeling sorry for Sy, someone who simply wants to be part of a family, and slowly and slowly learn to realize how psychotic his motives are. Otherwise, the movie was just so-so. Connie Nielsein and the family were all fine, but none of the characters were very deep. There weren't enough twists in the plot, but it nevertheless managed to be exciting.The only problem I had was Gary Cole and the boss. The role reminded me too much of his role as Lumberg in "Office Space". Even though he did a fine job, I was expecting him to come up to Sy with a cup of coffee in his hand, saying "Hello, Sy. What's happening? We have sort've a problem here, yeeeeah."**/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a movie that needed to be powered by the paranoia of the Haves about the Have Nots - but the Haves were too blah to be enviable and the Have Not was too pathetic to be threatening. SPOILERS. The Haves were a young and incredibly photogenic Family straight out of an insurance ad. The Have Not was middle aged, poor and plain with a dead end job processing photos. He also had a secret imaginary life as part of the Family, whose film he processes. In this movie people are pared down to the bare plot necessities. Cy is an all purpose stalker. At first he is too attentive to the wife. Then he is determined to make contact with the son. Then he gets hostile with the husband. Ridiculous? Robin Williams saves the day by giving a performance without vanity. He inhabits the Photo Guy and grabs your attention, not for himself but for his character. It's not pleasant because Cy suffers a lot of embarassment and he turns creepy but it is vivid. Williams got an emotional response from me for a character I didn't like but the other actors couldn't do the same hat trick. The Family seemed to have been assembled out of all the most boring parts of bad TV: wife shops all day, complains husband doesn't spend enough time at home. Get a job! Play a musical instrument! Husband has mistress - inevitable. Lack of identification the victims threw the movie off balance. It might have helped if Cy had been frightening rather than creepy. It seemed rather amusing when he terrorized the husband and the mistress with a knife (not a gun) because those two athletic types should have disarmed him easily.The plot is full of holes. The funniest fantasy was a set of cops ready go the whole nine yards over just a hint of a threat. It's a good Robin Williams vehicle but not a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent study of delusional disorder with psychotic features.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams is brilliant as a photo developer imprisoned by his delusions of being a part of a perfect family. It is hard to believe that Williams could give such a restrained performance in a role that requires him to become more and more obsessed with the family of his dreams. The movie illustrates how a person who is dangerously mentally ill can function in society without those around him knowing of the peril he represents. This movie and Williams certainly merit consideration at Oscar nomination time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Expected More...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer for this movie is so exciting &amp; suspenseful, it's actually more entertaining than the film itself. It makes you want more, so when I got to watch the whole movie, I felt cheated, because I expected so much more from it. Robin Williams (looking like a bleached-blond middle aged queen) does a decent job portraying "Sy The Photo Guy". He's obsessed with a family who's photos he's been developing for years at the local Sav-Mart. Instead of going the predictable route of Sy wanting to take the father/husband's place in this "picture-perfect" upwardly mobile family, Sy envisions himself as an extended member of this family, an uncle. His sparse apartment is splattered with pictures of this family who hardly knows he exists. Yet Sy doesn't even have a photo of his own mother. His life is so empty, he's created his own reality. One problem I had with this movie was the female lead (Connie Nielsen) she's so non-descript, it was hard to tell from one scene to the next if it was her character or not. Also, some scenes really drag on at times. The ending is a letdown, but at least the viewer gets to find out what made Sy the whacko/stalker he is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Robin Williams weren't so funny as a comedian, he would be consideredone of America's greatest dramatic actors. He is superb in this role -subdued and menacing in a quiet, simmering kind of way. It is hard tobelieve it took Hollywood this much time to deliver a good thriller about aphoto developing lab - having known people who worked at such labs, thetruth is that the people on the job do in fact look at your photos, and onecan easily see how Robin Williams' fixation on the Yorkins' could "develop"so to speak over years of service. Because the premise is credible, and thecharacters' actions and reactions to each other are credible (with one glaring exception necessary to advance the plot), this one really hooks you andkeeps you on the edge of your seat. Gary Cole - who so perfectly nailedMike Brady in the Brady Bunch movie - managed to make me forget thatrole for a few minutes and consider him a dramatic actor - no easy feat. Agood film well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mark Romanek creates a stark, scary world inhabited by a brilliant Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers)`One Hour Photo' is a powerful little film whose stark perfection was laid out by writer-director Mark Romanek and secured by a courageous, edgy, disturbing performance by Robin Williams as Sy, the photo guy, the would-be uncle of the nice little family of Jake and Nina and Will Yorkin, whom he adopts through appropriating copies of their snapshots and mounding them all over a wall of his lonely apartment.Sy is a very isolated, very unsocialized, very sad man. He not only produces beautiful copies of the snapshots he's assigned to develop and print at the SavMart photo department: they are his sole existence. We don't learn why he has picked only this one family to identify with and plaster over his wall: this is an artificial assumption of the filmmakers. He could have appropriated other people's photos and fantasized about them too. Other customers are indicated whose lives, or occupations, Sy sees into, but the Yorkins are his single-minded obsession. Other than doing his job at SavMart and eating and sleeping and nursing this obsession, Sy has no life.What's scary about this movie is that nobody has a life, because we know even less about the others than about Sy. At times `One Hour Photo' becomes literally a monodrama, a play happening only inside its protagonist's head. Sy knows the Yorkins only from brief conversations and from what the camera has shown him. It's all superficial, like SavMart, like suburbia, like Sy's pretense of having a life.Another peculiarity of the story is that, sad and crippled though he is, Sy is a nice man and has only nice thoughts about Jake and Will and Nina. He admires and envies their apparently wholesome life and their lovely modernistic house, and he as much as tells them this when they come to the photo department or he runs into them. He even tells them - tossing it off almost as a joke - that he likes to think of himself as their uncle. And this is - almost - healthy. At least there's no dark concealment of even darker thoughts. When Sy approaches Jake at a boys' soccer game and offers him a toy, the scene is full of danger because it looks like pedophile stalking; but there's no indication that Sy's thoughts are anything but innocent - except that he's odd and loony to be feeding emotionally off people he barely knows. He's psychologically crippled, but has no twisted fantasies or awful impulses. He just wants to be normal and longs to enter the Yorkins' life. But this isn't possible. The situation is untenable.So after Sy finds flaws in this little family's world just when he's been fired and has nothing to lose, the craziness and violence latent in ultra-repressed Sy have to come out.Robin Williams' performance is riveting because the energy that has gone into it is all of implosion, of holding in, and without histrionics. Much of Sy's dialogue revolves around the Yorkins or is directed at them, so it's naturally pleasant and upbeat: Sy loves the Yorkins and he's at his best when doing something related to them. They are his life. But there's always an edge of desperation that grows from Sy's doomed efforts to ignore how empty his existence really is and how little he actually has to do with the Yorkins. Williams conveys an enormous sense of control which is reinforced by the antiseptic world the filmmakers give him to live in. This contributes to an almost unbearable mood of quiet tension that pervades the movie from first to last.Everything in this movie is visually styled: it's as obsessive-neurotic as its protagonist. When we're in the posh suburbs with the Yorkins, all the colors are Kodak bright. Everything in Sy's special world, his corner of SavMart and his downtown apartment, is `2001' white or cyanned-out gray, and his face is either blushing (with quickly repressed embarrassment or anger) or of an unhealthy pallor. All discussion, all symbolism, is of photo imagery or of seeing or surfaces. Sy is first seen being given mug shots in a police station even more antiseptic than SavMart. He speaks in voice-over of `snap shot' being originally a hunting term, and when he's trapped by police, his face is flattened by a bright light and he looks like a trapped animal. When he's trying to escape, he runs thorough a hall where an expert is lecturing on retinal transplants, and in his worst nightmare he imagines his eyes - which now have seen horror in the destruction of his dream - tortured and streaming blood. Perhaps Romanek's extensive background in music videos fed his obsessive pursuit of visual symbols in the movie.The effect is one of artificiality, though that adds to the starkness of the portrait. Even the scenes of the Yorkins together unseen by Sy are just a succession of clear Kodak Moments in saturated color. Later, it appears that a climactic sequence was only Sy's imagining. The movie neutralizes some of the horror we'd come to expect. Not everything about `One Hour Photo' seems fully alive and engaging. But Romanek shows a sense of stylistic force that's unusual. The movie is elegant like a mathematical proof. And it's not bloodless, because Robin Williams makes it come alive with his quite passionate performance. This is definitely one of the best and most powerful American movies of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hour Photo was visually interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo starring Robin Williams and directed by Mark Romanek was one of the films I eagerly anticipated once I heard that Robin did another 'dark' role after his work as an Alaskan serial killer in Insomnia. I wasn't disappointed. One Hour Photo's slow, almost snail-pace, storytelling, stunning use of color, startling imagery, and misguided dream sequences made me think of one director...the late Stanley Kubrick. I felt elements of The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Eyes Wide Shut as Sy Parrish went about silently stalking, and living vicariously through, the Yorkin family. Robin does an excellent job just as he did in Insomnia and What Dreams May Come elevating him to the head of the 'comic actors' class (Jim Carrey, Tom Hanks, and Marlon Wayans being the others). While not necessarily a surprise ending, the climax did take me in a direction that most films of this nature just don't. You think you know what happens from the first 5 minutes on but the ending gives you a different spin on it. A very interesting case study in what happens to a soul without someone to love, One Hour Photo was definitely worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mark Romanek scores twice!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been often said that a great painting can be judged just as much by the use of space surrounding the central subject as the subject itself. The same analogy can adjusted for cinema. Often it is the judicious use of silence that can carry as much of an impact in a movie as the dialog. "One Hour Photo" is such a film. Wearing two hats, that of writer and director, Mark Romanek has enough confidence in the power of his screen play to allow the principle editor (Jeffrey Ford) to set a languid pace to the film and utilize long stretches without chatter. This pace does not hinder the underlying creepiness of the film, on the contrary, the tension packs as slowly and surely as nitrogen in the tissues of a deep sea diver. The central character of the film is Cy Parrish "Cy, the Camera Guy!" played with consummate skill by Robin Williams. Parrish is a film developer that works in a one hour photo within a store that could be any Target or Wal-Mart. Having no life of his own and living day to day through the snap shots taken by others, he becomes enamored, and later, obsessed with a neighborhood family who's only contact with him are the photos that they drop off for development. A word here about Mr. Williams. I have never really considered him a good actor. He's played a multitude of roles and in each one you can see small bits of the Robin Williams "Shtick" peaking out from under the costume.(Another great example would be Chris Walken. I could watch him read a phone book, but have you ever seen him in a role where you didn't find yourself saying "Heh, heh.... Christopher Walken... Cool!"?). This movie changed all that. Rarely have I ever seen an actor submerge so completely his public mannerisms and persona. Robin Williams *was* Cy Parrish, the embodiment of the potential evil that can lurk under even the most banal of exteriors. Kudos are also due to Connie Nielson and Michael Vartan, who play the "twenty something" couple with son that becomes the unknowing object of Cy Parrish's obsession, as well as to Darrell Hall, the supervising music editor. Recommended, 8 out of 10 Bear Claws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, a great, atypical, summer movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film. It was nearly two hours of nerve-racking, discomforting, disturbing movie going -- but not in a traditional way whatsoever. The cinematography was absolutely brilliant, itself contributing largely to the harrowing feel. If this doesn't win any awards (which it won't, of course) for that alone, then The Academy Awards are useless! Washed out, antiseptic tones, and a skewed vision of consumer hungry America from inside a Wal-Mart styled market -- fantastic, and original. I felt so uncomfrtable throughout this entire movie, due in part to that, and in part to Robin Williams' portrayal of Sy. No typical Hollywood movie ever goes out on a limb like this did to create such tension and discomfort, while avoiding typical pitfalls such as graphic violence (except for one brief harrowing dream), canned dialog, and cheesy acting. I think the ending was a bit off-putting, but once you put some thought into it (when was the last time a Hollywood movie really made you do that?), then it feels perfect.A fantastic blend of psychological terror and thought. Do yourself a favor -- take a break from force-fed fast food movie nonsense, and see this welcome relief from recent American movie making.</fullReview>

Williams creates a believable character, one we can empathise with on many levels, in his most realistic performance to date (this is partially due to the fact that we have grown accustomed to him playing fluffy roles).All in all an impressive directorial debut for Romanek in an intelligent look at the darker side of the human psyche.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Hour PhotoBy Greg UrsicThou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife or thy neighbour's goods. One needn't be religious to accept the wisdom of these words, which although penned over 5000 years ago, hold true today. While everyone likes to think they're above such pettiness, we've all experienced it? whether you're admiring your neighbour's new Porsche or your buddy's Baywatch clone girlfriend ? if only fleeting. In its mildest form these desires can lead to bitterness, at its worst, it may require a visit from the coroner.Sy Parrish is an unassuming nebbish whose life is upholstered in beige: friendless, clueless and stuck in a nowhere job (he's a photo clerk at the local SavMart ) he readily fades into the background. While the customers who bring their film in for developing barely acknowledge him, Sy has an all access pass into their most private moments. W hen someone tampers with his favorite happy shiny family, the Yorkins, Sy's not prepared to stand by and watch as his vision of perfection is sullied. It took Robin Williams - a Juilliard graduate and standup icon - nearly a decade to get accepted as more than a one trick pony (of course the drugs, alcohol and disastrous flops a la `Popeye' didn't help). With his breakthrough performance in The Dead Poets Society Hollywood finally began to take him serious and several acclaimed performances followed, culminating in his 1997 Oscar . Unfortunately the past few years saw Williams lapse into a succession of roles so banal and sickeningly sweet they had audiences reaching for their insulin. Whether or not this motivated his most recent choices ? deranged childrens show star in Death to Smoochy and killer in Insomnia ? is debatable (Williams claims it didn't). But with Sy, Williams reaches new heights (or more appropriately depths).Within moments of Sy's appearance you forget that you are watching Williams: there are none of the classic mannerisms, indeed Sy is hyper subdued. It is also quickly apparent that there is something seriously amiss; Sy is the atypical bad guy, guided not by money or global domination, but a desire to `do the right thing' (however warped that happens to be). It is a tribute to William's talent that as Sy's descent into the sinister grows the audience is simultaneously squirming in discomfort and feeling sorry for him. While the supporting cast helps to provide perspective, it is the physical elements of the film that qualify as the co-stars.The feel of the story is dramatically enhanced by the cinematography: the blandness of Sy's monochromatic existence appears even starker when juxtaposed next to the color flushed surroundings of the SavMart. Several shots mimic the through the lens view of a still camera, turning the viewer into a voyeur, and careful framing gives sections of the film a photo album quality . The final polish comes from the score which meshes flawlessly with the film, augmenting the dramatic elements without pandering to melodrama. If you see only one Robin Williams film this year, make it this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Day My Prints Will Come (SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sy Parrish is a quiet, introverted technician at a busy photo lab. For the past decade he has been developing the pictures for an ordinary family, and, with the passing of time, he has gradually become obsessed with becoming a permanent part of their lives...I had been looking forward to seeing this film. A change of direction is exactly what Robin Williams needs to maintain his creative vitality, and having seen documentaries about his work in music videos, I greatly anticipated seeing a feature film directed by Mark Romanek.The opening act is carefully judged and virtually note-perfect. Parrish is shown as pedantic about creating the finest set of prints possible, this care and attention being balanced by his lonely existence. He eats, and lives, alone, and Romanek provides the natural ending to this segment with a long shot of Sy sitting in his near-empty apartment watching television, with the wall behind him covered in duplicate prints of the Yorkin family's pictures.The acting is excellent across the board. Advance reviews from Sundance had championed Williams, and rightly so: it's far and away the best "straight" performance he's ever delivered, streets ahead of the monotonous, sentimental goo he is normally required to emote. Nielson and Vartan are both good as the unwitting objects of Sy's psychosis, although Eriq La Salle appears still to be playing Dr. Peter Benton, his character in ER, failing to show sufficient distance to make Det. Van Der Zee a person rather than a plot convenience. Gary Cole is such obvious casting as Sy's boss, store manager Bill Owens, that somehow he feels entirely wrong in the part. It's as though the casting director's imagination was entirely sapped by putting Williams in the lead.The direction is atmospheric, and the photography elegant. Other than Sy's blood-soaked, yet antiseptic nightmare, one shot that in particular stayed in my mind was of Sy walking to his car, bathed in the sodium yellow of a street lamp. Heil and Klimek's music is subtle in how it evokes fear and unease without intruding on the audience's concentration. But the script is something else entirely.The film's ending was far too neat for my taste, given the build-up it had been given. Maya and Will did not seem sufficiently traumatised by their ordeal for it to have any lasting impact on themselves, their families or the viewers. The most disappointing aspect of Romanek's clever script was the final revelation that Sy had been abused and photographed as a child. This simple safety valve was so formulaic that it almost negated the originality of the rest of the film. Could Sy not have been driven insane by his years of isolation, solitude and looking at the pictures of others' happy times? This conceit drove the film from brave, virgin territory almost into the path of the mainstream and should have been more clearly thought out.One Hour Photo realises most of it's potential, and it is certainly one of the best films I have seen this year. I just feel annoyed that a film so bold and original could have such a contrived final twist. Had Sy's quiet madness been the result of living a nothing life, many of us in the audience might be left asking: what if it happened to the people we know? What if it happened to us?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Robin Williams' best performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie itself is not great - there are a couple of nagging questions I had unanswered at the end. One of Williams' other 'dark' movies from earlier this year, 'Insomnia' was a better movie all around. With that said, though, it should also be noted that Williams delivers one of his best performances in this movie, and should definetly be nominated for Best Actor based on this movie. Williams is Sy Parrish, a lonely man who has an huge obsession with the Yorkins. It's one thing to have an obsession and to allow rage to color all your feelings - we've seen that happen many times before - but in this case, he loves this family as if he were part of it, to the point where he breaks down sobbing when he finds some dirt on Will Yorkin (Michael Vartan). He gives a wonderfully creepy performance in this movie, and it's hard not to think about Sy after the movie is over. Between this and Insomnia, Robin Williams is having the movie year of his life, and he should be recognized for it when the Oscar nominations come down.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Will you be cautious about visiting photo-shops in future? That's left to your judgment after you've seen this flick. But the man behind the photo counter deals with an important fact: photos do reflect memories of one's happy days! If you haven't yet seen this movie, do so, and you'll know exactly what I mean. Sure, this is a spooky and disturbing movie. Why? It puts the viewers to the test, challenging them in the way they handle their mental perception and character analysis! Yep, it's a clever film that delivers.There'll be no comical Robin Williams of the good old funny films here. Okay, Sy Parrish gives me the creeps ? from that moment Connie Nielson's Nina Yorkin walks into his One-Hour Photo shop. Williams provides more creeps here than he did in Insomnia. Just take a look at the light thinning crew-cut hair on this bespectacled middle-aged man with the stone-cold, mousy looking eyes and very disturbing smile. He reminds me of a weird and twisted mind with many faces. Just observe Parrish's behavior and it'd be hardly impossible not to be afraid of him. Oh yes, the viewer will get to know his character ? slowly and gradually, feeling the tease; wondering what he'd do next. It's his deceiving appearance that truly petrifies? an ordinary guy who seems so ordinary to some, yet turns out to be a low-keyed ?psychopath'. Yuks - that's exactly how I feel, studying him and his moves!The moments are very intense and scary. Look out for hints to Parrish's traumatic experiences because they help to connect the events and explain his fantasies and ?schizophrenic' wackiness. You truly have got to compare Michael Vartan's Will character to Gary Cole's Bill Owens. Maybe that too will help you accept the ending of the story. Hey, the use of ?Yorkin' for the family name is a clever play on the meaning `your kin'? a cue to Parrish's psychotic desire to belong to this family, perhaps. Screenplay writer/Director Mark Romanek is remarkable in his direction of the characters and events. The color schemes and the music scores match the moods of the characters and the events. But it's Robin Williams who gets my applause for making this film work for me. He is so hauntingly credible in his role? not to say I'm already persuaded to change my camera for a digital. The ending is an anti-climax for me. It's not the fault of the storyteller, the filmmaker, nor the scriptwriter, of course. I have myself solely to be blamed? for allowing my silly perception to play tricks on me?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, but very good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is, to sum it up as easily as possible, a very intense thriller that is anything but mainstream. The extremely disturbing film is a very tense story, wrapped together with a very good character study of Robin Williams' character Cy. It may be one of the best movies of the year, a year where there have been only a handful of ones, three or four at the most, but they are of very high quality, and I think Robin should definitely get nods during the award season for this (I'm adding him to my category of Richard Gere, Mel Gibson, and Tom Hanks that I want nominated for the men's acting prizes). Robin Williams is exceptional in this because after a while as I was watching him act, I forgot the character actually was the actor, he took on the role with an almost chameleon approach where he blended into the character, and that always further movies on along up the scale, for you are more able to focus on the plot and story. The kid is also good in this; he clearly has some talent. The plot also successfully messes with your head, making you constantly change your opinions about Cy, I personally almost felt sorry for him at parts, and then it changed and went back and just went on changing till the last forty five minutes or so. Which proves the psychologically thrilling greatness of this movie.  Overall, I give One Hour Photo a recommend, but it is intense and very intensely creepy, but still a very good film. Robin Williams is an incredible actor and in here he even goes past the great performance he gave in Insomnia earlier this year. 3 out of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One Hour Photo builds its stark intensity from "the little things" - brilliant nuances of expression and detail that elevate the film above the level of just another borderline-wacko-going-over-the-edge thriller, and Robin Williams gives an Oscar-worthy performance here, a hypnotic, masterfully etched portrayal of what it feels like - truly FEELS like - to eke out a traumatized existence of profound loneliness while still craving acceptance and human connection on the only level he can actually deal with it. This level, of course, gets him into trouble, and the most extraordinary thing about Williams' performance is that we UNDERSTAND this tormented character, we understand why he does what he does, and we sympathize. But Sy gets our sympathy not because Williams tries to get it superficially (from the outside), but rather because he lets us IN - he lets us FEEL his vulnerability, his rage, his monumental sadness, his overwhelming need, and by the end of the movie we have experienced something truly rare: somebody else's reality. And we have recognized the part of ourselves that, chillingly, relates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since this picture is playing in selected cities across the nation,I had the chance to catch it during a sneak preview one Saturday evening and I was blown completely away since Robin Williams is better known for his comedies("Good Morning Vietnam","Mrs. Doubtfire","Death To Smoochy"),but here this has OSCAR written all over it and here Williams gives the most creepy and hallowing performance to date and the electrifying one of his career. Williams brings a painfully exquisite vitality to a complicated character which has that picture-perfect imagine that is accomplished so gracefully. The director of the picture,Mark Romanek,feature film debut director who previously directed music videos for various artists is a master at work here who maintains the nuanced humanity of the story's focal point. Carefully,buliding to a dramatic resolution,"One Hour Photo" joins the esteemed company of works that comment on the subject of American life and the institution from which the priviliged vantage point of suburbia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is a philosopher of photography. The odd part is that he develops film at a one-hour-photo stand at "SavMart"--a giant chain store designed in the austere white-on-white of the space station in "2001." Working this nearly minimum-wage gig next to recent high-school grads, Sy has plenty of time to meditate on photography's relationship to mortality, memory and identity; the job seems more or less a cinch, when he isn't making duplicates of the family photos brought in by a lovely, absurdly photogenic soccer mom (Connie Nielsen). One might think that Sy had a Walter Mitty crush on the onetime Mrs. Gladiator; but then, Sy fixates on her adorable nine-year-old kid--a boy Sy wants to be his pretend nephew. (This being a Christine Vachon production, a creepout-inducing whiff of paedophilia is never too far away.) Then we go back to Sy's overemphatically empty apartment, where he sits watching a quite funny "Simpsons" episode with a sour, sober expression (so you know he's not right in the head), and the camera moves off Sy to reveal... a wall-sized shrine full of Connie Nielsen's family photos! Mom, Dad and Little Junior times a thousand! It's like Rupert Pupkin's roomful of cardboard cutouts given a slightly higher-tech twists There's an interesting, unpleasant, eerie thread in the middle of ONE HOUR PHOTO: the adulation of one stratum of American culture--the hopeless, Lotto-ticket-buying, fifty-year-old-who-makes -$25,000-a-year side--for another stratum: the new suburban family, rich and safe yet funky and sexy and not TOO white, bringing a little collegiate tang into American Beautyville. The Yorkins, the family Sy yearns to enter, suggest a late-nineties boomtime advertiser's wet dream: a $400,000 house and an SUV, yet they still buy vintage vinyl on ebay! (Or so one assumes.) The writer-director Mark Romanek paints the gap between Sy's world and the Yorkins' in not-too-subtle colors: Sy lives in uninhabited, austere, corporatized spaces that seem left over from Todd Haynes' SAFE, and the Yorkins live in an ickily warm tongue-bath of color--every second is a Kodak moment. (Sy's world, in which his blue SavMart blazer is the only lightning-bolt of color, at least has a freaky, Kubrick-derivative allure. The Yorkins' manse makes you want to run for the ghetto.) The movie is about Sy's attempt to "get over"--to realize the American dream of status, of belonging, of being like the family-friendly ad images that surround him all day. And, of course, that attempt is phrased in the uncolorful language of a horror movie. Essentially, ONE HOUR PHOTO is THE KING OF COMEDY given a HAND THAT ROCKS THE CRADLE Botox shot. Like DeNiro's Rupert Pupkin, Robin Williams' Sy wants in so bad that he ignores everything--everyday courtesy, the rules of his job, the desire not to appear to be a predatory paedophile, and the little bubble that Mrs. Yorkin would no doubt call her "personal space." But whose side is the movie on? Early on, Mr. Yorkin accuses the missus of overwhelming him with her demands for Jil Sander smocks and a new Mercedes sedan; late in the day, when Mr. Yorkin commits an awful and obvious pecadillo, Mrs. Y turns a blind eye to it. Does Romanek intend for us to think--as I suspect--that Mrs. Yorkin is more interested in her husband's credit cards than in being the nobly long-suffering wife? And if so, does that mean that Romanek intends the Yorkins to come across as they do--as Banana Republic replicants, 2-D nonentities who are less alive than their one-hour photos? Though it gets cheaper and cheesier with each passing half-hour, ONE HOUR PHOTO might've had a fleeting hauntingness if the man proudly wearing the blue SavMart vest were William H. Macy-- a master at painting the embattled dignity of small-potato white guys. As Sy, Robin Williams has been touted and lambasted for giving a most un-Williams-like performance. To me, this is the same Williams we see in JUMANJI and WHAT DREAMS MAY COME--humble, choked up, as deferential as Red Skelton, and dying to endear himself to us at every opportunity. One can feel the glee in the moment when Williams finally Goes Psycho, but it doesn't seem to come from anywhere within the character, or the actor. Is it possible that Robin Williams really doesn't have much of a dark side? His sentimentality seems to be closer to the bone than his recent streak of playing maniacs. I think Williams' best movie performance was in Michael Ritchie's criminally underrated 1983 comedy THE SURVIVORS: he could do his multi-character motormouth shtik in the context of a character as deranged as Sy. There, the derangement set him free. Here, Williams seems overimpressed by the notion that contrasting his typical nice-guy side with scenes of frothing lunacy is incredibly subversive and powerful. (Tom Hanks seems to have overcalculated the shock of seeing Tom Hanks shoot a man in the head in ROAD TO PERDITION.&gt; Like David Fincher, Mark Romanek floats about, head over heels, in a world where Aesthetic Equals Anaesthetic. As in Fincher's PANIC ROOM, there seems to be no directorial opinion as to who should win, or even who we should like; and this is not, I think, a Todd Haynes-like ambiguity. These filmmakers are simply more interested in the visual trimmings than in the traditional investments that power Hollywood storytelling. That can work when Fincher is at his peak--as in PANIC ROOM, where he breaks down a conventional thriller script into visual components as abstract as an Ad Reinhardt canvas. Romanek is nowhere near Fincher's level of mastery of craft; he seems to have issued one direction while making PHOTO--"Make it all look like 2001!"--and then kept his distance. He intentionally makes Sy's artisanship-cum-artistry metaphorically resonate in a number of different directions, but he seems to have no point of view about those resonances. Like most of his rock-video-god peers, he seems more a set dresser than a storyteller. Spike Jonze could give him some needed lessons in anti-style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an amazing performance from Robin Williams. He proved here that if anyone had doubts about him winning the Oscar for 'Good Will Hunting', they were wrong. In 'One Hour Photo' he plays that character we have seen before but Williams plays it with a great amount of sympathy. That lonely, single man who drowns in resentment of what others have and wants to act out his frustration with violence and twisted logic for justification. This is a man who wants to break free from his pathetic and meaningless life and uses a slow burn of emotion to do it. Also a visual marvel, 'One Hour Photo' is an old story using a new label with some acute observations of just how important photography is to our life and how we view it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While raves should flood in about Robin Williams, the film as a whole suffers from slow pacing, a mediocre script and, ironically, Williams himself.Mark Romanek seemed to go out of his way, to the film's discredit, to shatter his MTV video past. There's nothing fast or flashy about this picture. Not that I wanted "flash", but the rate at which this story unfolds is tediously slow and detrimental to the plot. I enjoy films that take their time, but... be interesting at the same time.The script seemed to lack the courage to go where it should have gone. This WAS NOT the dark, disturbing film it's advertised to be. Or maybe I've seen one too many Darren Aronofsky films. There was a huge, very slow build up to what I felt was an extremely flat climax. And while the ending makes sense, I would've preferred if the filmmakers took it to a colder, darker ending.The character of "Sy the Photo Guy" was to be a wallflower. Someone who blends into the background of society. And even though Williams does a great job, he is anything but a wallflower - he's a complete distraction. He's Robin Williams! He's a big star. It's impossible to ever lose Williams in the background of anything. Every frame of film that went by, I just kept thinking, "That's Robin Williams." Not "Sy the Photo guy."I think the film would have been better served with someone like William H. Macy, Philip Seymore Hoffman or Steve Buscemi as Sy.Williams was good, but it's the case of "good performance, wrong casting choice."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful thriller. This movie is about a lonely man who is not so lonely because he has a loving family. It's not his family though, it's the Yorkins whose pictures he has developed for years. Sy has taken them on as his own adapted family without their knowing.This is the set up for One Hour Photo. You may think this is a movie about voyeurism, and while there is an aspect of that, it is really about loneliness and need. In the beginning of the movie Sy the photo guy is in a police station. He has done something that they do not reveal. A gruesome murder? You can sense that it is not a killing but still something very serious. Not one of those NYPD Blue police stations where you have good cop/bad cop, but a suburban police station with a very soft spoken, professional investigator. The choice in settings gives the whole movie a creepy realistic undertone. That key first scene sets the stage for a movie that is in the Spielberg tradition of playing on our simplest of fears. Imagine how much your average photo guy knows about your life. Creepy indeed.The Yorkin family is not very well developed. They seem to be reading lines out of a hundred other movies. However this is not a failure on the director's part. It is to put us in the shoes of Sy, only able to see from the outside of the family.This movie is also a great thriller. Robin Williams makes the character of Sy not like your typical Hollywood villain but very realistic. He sounds like the kind of character you would see local news anchors reporting on. Not someone you would read about in a movie script though. We know he gets arrested for something serious and it plagues our curiosity until the end to see what his intentions become when everything in his life comes crashing down on him.This movie makes you afraid to go back into the One Hour Photo.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I usually HATE Robin Williams for 1. his insane ramblings which, I feel, is him performing for himself and 2. his lame attempt to win our hearts through sentimental slime. However, I must admit that his new performance as a lonely photo technician is a revelation. I somehow always knew he was capable of this type of role. All he had to do was turn DOWN the energy. He was great!!!The film is a different matter. I felt that once the script writer had established this very creepy concept, he ended up asking himself, "Well, what can I make this guy do that will be believable and satisfying to audiences?"Well, it didn't satisfy me. Insane characters are usually fascinating: Travis Bickle, Norman Bates, Hannibal Lecter....Here we have an obsessive man who dotes on a perfect family. Maybe it would have been truer to the character to suppress his actions and live in his fantasies. I don't know.Repeat viewing potential: 0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams gives a great performance in a rare subtle role for him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams delivers his third creepy role this year (see also "Death To Smoochy" and "Insomnia") to prove that, yes, he can be more than just the funnyman he is known for. Unlike the other two roles, though, there are more identifiable human elements to this character. Those misled by the trailer expecting to see Williams in a slasher flick will have to keep waiting. In this he is more of a sad and lonely type than the aggressive stalker that the previews make him out to be. This goes into the mind of someone that is definitely "stalking", but doesn't see it that way. He's scariest because he's one of those people you see, but don't take notice of. You don't know a thing about him but he seems to know a lot about you. Who would've thought that one of the most frightening characters on film this summer would not be Jason or Michael Myers, but Sy the Photo Guy? Frighteningly realistic is always scarier than any run-of-the-mill gory horror film.Video director Mark Romanek (Madonna, Nine Inch Nails) does a great job of adding a style that is MTV-acceptable, but not completely distracting. The simple set designs and harsh fluorescent lighting seem all too familiar, as the Sav-Mart can be associated with just about any discount store you can think of. Like the studio's other recent "weirdos in retail" film, "The Good Girl", this focuses on what's behind the eyes of those seemingly normal folks in their sterile work environment.  This one is definitely worth checking out. Robin Williams gives a great performance in a rare subtle role for him. Unlike his other two dramatic roles this summer, he seems to become the character rather than just playing one. This is the kind of role that actors dream of. This was a chance to change the public's perception about his role selection and he took it. The results are splendid and Williams seems to have exposed a side of him left undeveloped before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is definitely on my top 10 list for this year, maybe even all time. Robin Williams plays his character so subtley and controlled that it freaks the hell out of you yet demands sympathy from the viewer. You can't help but feel sorry for his character (Sy) and how he is so disconnected from the rest of the world. Also *possible spoiler ahead* his confession at the end with the police officer and the apartment scene were particularly chilling and disturbing. I also thought the musical score was excellent. I'm not entirely sure who wrote it but it suits the mood perfectly. Try to listen as the score swells up at the near end of the movie. That part just gave me goosebumps. This is by far Robin Williams' greatest performance EVER. This proves that Williams is not only a comic genius, but he can act as well. You totally forget that you are watching Williams on screen most of the time. In conclusion, do yourself a favour, and watch this film. I doubt it will do good at the box office but I really hope it gets nominations particularly the Oscars but you know how they are with comedians turning serious (Jim Carrey anyone?). But I warn you this film is not for the weak at heart nor mind. It grabs your mind and doesn't let go. It will leave you thinking long after you leave the movie theatre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is the technician at the SavMart photo lab where he has worked for many years. Over time he has gotten to know many of the customers, but none more so than the Yorkin family. But just how far does Sy's obsession run?One Hour Photo is simply a stunning film; it's a tour de force of a movie that is not only a stunning debut movie (80's flick 'Static' not withstanding) from an exciting young director, but also boats a career best performance from Robin Williams.Williams is so convincing as Seymour 'Sy' Parrish that you completely forget that you are watching the man that tortured the movie watching world with the likes of 'Bicentennial Man', 'What Dreams May Come', 'Patch Adams', 'Father's Day', 'Jack', 'Flubber' and 'Mrs. Doubtifre'. But, I digress; it seems vulgar to mention such films in the same breath as this stunning performance. Williams builds on the work he did in Insomnia (which was actually filmed after this film, but you understand what I'm saying, right?) and brings to film history one of the finest portrayals of anonymous danger.Williams Sy is the guy you see every day, but never give more than a passing thought to. But, what if he is giving more than a passing thought to you? What if he has become so obsessed with your family that he starts turning up at your lunch break, or your kid's sports practice? Williams plays Sy perfectly, so ambiguous, so controlled. You're never sure what he's thinking behind those cold, cold eyes. His many voiceovers are delivered with an ice cold matter-of-fact manner that sends a chill down the spine. You're never quite sure what Sy is capable of, Williams never gives anything away and this creates tension from the very first frame. It's tension that continues to build slowly and deliberately throughout the film right up to the final frame. The tension practically drips out of the screen during the scenes where Sy 'bumps' into the various members of the family outside of the SavMart setting, you feel as uncomfortable as the family members, it's impressive stuff. Williams cold ambiguous manner coupled with Romanek's stark visual style leave the viewer unsettled and unsure what to expect next from the film. This certainly no by-the-numbers Hollywood stalker/slasher film, that much is certain.Romanek has teamed up with David Fincher's cinematographer of choice Jeff Cronenweth to produce a visually astounding movie. Although both Fincher and Romenek have a background in music videos, Fincher is a lot flashier than Romanek. Romanek's style is subdued, but stark and barren. The movie is beautifully filmed, with incredible use of light employed, whether it's in the sterile white photolab or the warm home of the Yorkin's. A stunning lighting effect is used in the final moments of the film to ground Sy in one of his earlier voiceovers. It's an incredible moment and one that will live with me for a good while.I look forward to Romaneks next film as after his work here he can now be mentioned in the same breath as the likes of Soderbergh, PT Anderson, Fincher and Nolan as a new hot director to watch out for.Williams steals this film, but let's not do disservice to the rest of the cast who step up to the plate and give some admirable work. Connie Nielsen is perhaps the best on offer; she works well as the mother of the Yorkin family. I like Michael Vartan in TV show 'Alias' and it's nice to see him in a film, he is given little to do until later in the film, but he handles some difficult scenes well. Dylan Smith has little to do, but be suitably cute as the Yorkin's son.It's always nice to see Gary 'Boss from Hell' Cole and he again plays a boss here. He had better watch out though, or he'll become stereotyped! Also, apparently there is life after ER as Eriq La Salle pops up later in the film and has some impressive scenes with Williams.The supporting players however, are just the lettuce at the side of the cheeseburger that is Robin Williams. I cannot stress how good he is here; it's easily his best work to date, surpassing the likes of 'The World According To Garp', 'Good Will Hunting', 'The Fisher King', 'Dead Poet's Society' and the recent 'Insomnia'. This is an Oscar worthy performance, but I fear that the Academy might shirk at the films dark subject matter and ambiguous nature. The Academy likes easy films, which One Hour Photo is certainly not.In-fact One Hour Photo is a cold, dark, ambiguous film that leaves the viewer unsure of its direction for the entire running time. It asks questions of the viewer constantly and leaves itself burned into the viewers conscience long after the end titles have rolled and the lights have came up.9/10 for One Hour Photo.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most visionary and important films ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Im sure my customers never think about it, but these snapshots are their little stands against the flow of time...all that stands between us and oblivion"-Robin Williams, OHPI have just seen an advance screening of One Hour Photo, which literally left me in awe...the kind of feeling you got the first time you saw Se7en or The Game. There's just those rare films that come along once in a great while, a moment out of time masterpiece. This is one of those extrordinary films. After a year of buzz and waiting, I saw it and...quite simply, Mark Romanek has crafted one of the most visionary and important films on the American cinematic landscape today. In Robin Willaims most brilliant role since Toys(1992), we see one of the bravest performances of a lifetime. How to describe OHP? With heavy shades of Harmony Korine(namely still photos with narrations) and Kubrick(lot sof Kubrick!) OHP in lamens terms could be called Red Dragon with a dash of Office Space and The Game. Robin Williams is at once Lecter-cum-Walt Whitman intellect and sad recluse. Williams plays sy Parrish, a guy who phillosophizes over episodes of The Simpsons and obsesses over collecting Neon Genesis Evangelion anime figures. He is living through a decade worth of yorkin family photos, trying to belong...through dreaming and fantasy, meticulously finishing his final masterpiece.Sy Parrish wants to be accepted, desperately living life through the most innate and smallest of details. Mark Romanek's stunning visual cinematography and his attention to the smallest of details is remarkable, as Romanek fills the screen with the most ornate of images and Aronofsky like inner working closeups. Romanek paces his film with master precision, giving us standing attention to his subject and where he wants us to go. We sympathize with Sy, as the world has been shattered for him. This is more than just a portrait of a man at his breaking point, living in his own reality...this is also a study on the family structure, and a lesson in great cinematic filmaking in general.Romanek uses not broad strokes, but powerful stains of symbolic and surreal dreamlike visuals. If youve seen his avant garde videos for Madonna's Betime Stories or Nine Inch Nails Closer you know what I mean. In fact, Trent Reznor did a brillaint job on the score, a minimalist yet intense ambience that provides an effective backbone.I am already calling this the best film of 2002, and when OHP hits theatres this Fall, movie goers will be in for quite a treat. What is going to be one of the most talked about films of the year, Willians and Romanek surely need to be frontrunners for Oscars next year. One Hour Photo is not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Hour Photo delivers in the end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One Hour Photo is a thriller of a different sort. While the buzz is about Robin Williams taking on a dark, malevolant role, the substance is a unexpectedly honest look into the mind of a stalker who perceives himself as anything but.Mark Romanek puts the audience through a variety of paces, forcing us to re-evaluate our opinion about Seymour (Sy) Parrish throughout. Williams performance transcends himself, and allows the viewer to forget who the actor is and focus on the story within the first 1/2 hour. He is uncharacteristically subdued, and often leaves you wishing for more animation and insight, though this is obviously deliberate, and ultimately a boon to the film.The story develops around Sy's peripheral involvement in Nina (Connie Nielsen) and Will (Michael Vartan) Yorkin's and their son's life, via years of developing their family photos. Sy quietly adopts the Yorkin's as his own family, but what starts as a benign fixation is slowly revealed as much more, in remarkably subtle, but twisted examples. While we are immediately told that Sy has done something wrong at the beginning of the film, Romanek leads us on a red-herring filled chase to the end.Nielsen gives a realistic portrayal of an unhappy housewife in a financially successful marriage, though Vartan comes off paper thin throughout, particularly in a rather stilted marital tiff designed to clue us in on the state of the Yorkin's life. The son, uncredited here, provides the biggest dramatic peril, as he immediately connects with the viewer, but ultimately his competition for screentime with his mother blunts the emotional impact intended.Romanek's unique approach to staging, color choice, and costuming all lend to a surreal view into his characters everyday life. While his approach to symbolism can be heavy handed at times, at others it is equally subtle, and effective in either case.Despite these shortcomings, One Hour Photo delivers in the end, leading to a stunning climax uncommon in today's Hollywood fare. One Hour Photo is a leap into a new approach in audience manipulation, character insight, and selective plot development. A strong effort, that may come up lacking in box office success, but will certainly find its audience in video sales, and overseas distribution.</fullReview>

Walked myself down to the bargain bin and scooped this up What I realized about 30 minutes in was for $2.95 I had hit an absolute home run. My feelings about Robin Williams were sandblasted away from my conscious, and if anything I thought for one of the first times in my life that he was an outright star and created a character so terribly hurt and introverted that I would find great pleasure in seeing that identical character in more films. I gave it a 9, and that's a dead solid indie 9. If it were a massive budget blockbuster with a theater full of friends you may not see it that way but it's the definition of intelligent indie making. There are no explosions or car chases so don't expect that. This is the PERFECT film for a dark rainy night by yourself. It moved slow and somewhat quiet manner but in the most positive light.All in all this film is in a niche. A wonderful little niche and everyone involved should be proud. It's one of those films you miss for 10 years (like myself) and then magically stumble upon expecting nothing, but instead end up asking yourself "how did I miss this!?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost a masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see this at the movies, I am not a fan of Robin Williams and the trailers didn't appeal, now I regret that. Caught it on TV and was immediately involved.Sadly one reason I was so engaged is i related to the isolation of Sy. The loneliness of people with no family is something few understand.Some of the scenes really capture life of the unconnected. No-one to buy a present for or spend Christmas with, just work, home, work, home ........Of course Sy takes it much farther but hey it's a movie.If you missed this first time around get the DVD but be prepared for a disturbing time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Williams Saves It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams is chilling as Sy, a nut ball who works at a one hour photo lab and becomes obsessed with Will and Nina Yorkin and their son Jake. He develops their film and gives them the prints, while also making copies and placing them on his wall in a collage. He is a lonely man who lives with a pet hamster. He gets fired and looks at a batch of photos before he leaves, and realizes that the perfect husband, Will Yorkin, is having an affair. He follows them to a hotel, and forces the couple to pose nude at knife point. His boss has informed the police that Sy has been stalking his young daughter, and taking pictures of her. The cops catch him at the hotel and bring him in for questioning. The story goes off the rails a bit at this point and I did not like the ending at all. Williams is excellent as the weirdo, Sy, but a better script would have made One Hour Photo a lot more believable, but I will give it a slight thumbs up for his performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is quite understated all the way through. Robin William's acting ability coupled with the cinematography tells a very tense and emotive story which goes above and beyond what is played out on the screen. I felt drawn in to his character and world.Having said this, there was the odd moment where it all felt a little clichéd but they were few and far between.As with all good films, it has its own special personality, heightened by supermarket colours and camera angles, and an interesting concept at it's base.Worth watching in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frightening portrait of life on the edge of madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams's mysterious character creates an unnerving story line which is visually successful in this extremely creepy thriller. The story deals with a theme which is not at all unique but still touched on which is loneliness. Many films show the struggle that the protagonist has to go through; in particular it's is an ideology shared with young men such as Travis Bickle in "Taxi Driver" and the nameless narrator in "Fight Club". The film draws on how our society is capable of excluding people who are unable to articulate their feelings. Whilst watching it I enjoyed how visually through some of the unusual shots of surreal lighting it managed to captivate me and I was in Seymour Parrish's world. Overall the film was an excellent portrayal of a character that is deeply disturbed and falls further into insanity. The concept is simple, Seymour lives his life and his opinions are made up through the snap shots of others. It shows us how the emptiness in his life is fulfilled by that of others, as in this world it is safe compared to his life. Deep down he knew it was flawed and admitted that when you take photos it is misleading into someone's life as pain is hardly shown. He realises his urban alienation halfway through the film and attempts to rectify the situation which leads to its ending.Moments of the film which make it stand out to other psychological films can be considered as strange or even disturbing; the prime example of this is his dream. Director Mark Romanek cleverly uses the blood out of Sy's (Seymour's) eyes to show the pain he has experienced when he realises the family he observes isn't as perfect as he first thought. The blood is symbolic of how is blinded in pain and confusion, the surreal white glow makes it more haunting. The film in my opinion was also successful because of the performance of Robin Williams. He is underrated as a serious actor and although he has thrived as a comedic actor in "Mrs Doubtfire" and "Good Morning Vietnam", it is very harsh to overlook his serious performances. In both "Awakenings" and "Insomnia" he was excellent at supporting two humongous actors in De Niro and Pacino. But in One Hour Photo he is the lead and offers a hauntingly powerful performance and conveys all sorts of emotion in an extremely convincing manner and really should off at least been nominated for an academy award and really should of won it!Mark Romanek creates an extremely uncomfortable portrait of life on the edge of madness. Romanek also wrote this impressive script which doesn't rely on shock value or an obscure out-of-context twist unfitting to time, culture or irrespective to sociological points of view which just attempt to bamboozle the audience, instead like Paul Schrader's amazing script of Taxi Driver it simply presents a more realistic view of life. A bit like Travis Bickle or Trevor Reznik in "The Machinist" he has a strong self -destruct mechanism and can be labelled as pathetic at his attempt to articulate to other people and interact with what could be considered as "normal" people. This intense drama which at the flaws of the society we live in this extremely captivating tale of loneliness and an in-depth character study of someone who on the edge who is ready to be pushed. Overall it's an immensely powerful drama which can be considered a cult classic and should be watched by any fan of films which tackle more difficult subjects such as observing how society is capable of rejection in Mark Romanek's stunning film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robin Williams develops an obsession and exposes his dark side.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zany comedic actor Robin Williams goes against type to star as slightly unhinged photo technician Seymour 'Sy' Parrish, who over the years has formed an unhealthy obsession with the seemingly perfect family of suburban wife and mother Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen), a regular customer at his lab.When Sy loses his job, and then discovers that Nina's husband Will (Michael Vartan) is sleeping with work colleague Maya Burson (Erin Daniels), the loner's fantasy of becoming part of a perfect family unit is shattered, and he embarks on a crusade to expose the affair and punish the guilty parties.A tense study of a fractured psyche brought about through severe childhood trauma and long term social inadequacy, One Hour Photo provides its talented star with the role of a lifetime, one that requires the usually madcap performer to be, at turns, likable, pitiable, creepy and absolutely chilling. The amazingly versatile Williams pulls off this trick with seeming ease, giving a thoroughly convincing performance throughout.Writer/director Mark Romanek also deserves much praise for his sharp script and stylish visuals, but should be particularly commended for not succumbing to Hollywood-itis: his main character isn't just another Hannibal Lector or Patrick Bateman, but rather a very real individual, deserving of compassion and understanding. This fact seems to bother some reviewers here on IMDb, who clearly wanted the guy to become a total monster and go on a killing spree at the end of the film, but I'm glad Romanek took the more subtle route?it makes the film a refreshingly different and more satisfying experience overall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most original thrillers in recent years.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Hour Photo" uses an original concept and has an original approach.The story is about real-life and real-life characters. The thriller elements in the movie don't really ever feel forced and the movie actually has a pretty realistic atmosphere and certain tension. It's mainly thanks to the actors that the movie works out this way.Guess that no one ever really thought about it but the guy who develops your photos for years, knows more about you and your personal life than you would really want to. This movie shows what can happen if a developer gets obsessed with your personal life and feels that he is- or at least should be a part of your 'normal' life.I'm probably making the movie sound more 'thriller-like' than it in fact is. Yes, "One Hour Photo" is a thriller but not one with constant suspension or an haunting atmosphere.This is probably due to the approach of the movie, that is original and refreshing but also is a killer for the much needed formulaic thriller ingredients. The main character of the movie is the 'psychophate' himself. Instead of seeing him as a monster, you can't help feeling compassion for him. Sy Parrish is a lonely guy but kind guy and everything that he has in the world is his job. He has never been married and is probably a single all his life and he has no family. His loneliness and sadness becomes very sensible in the movie and you really start to feel compassion for the character and want him to be happy. In that regard "One Hour Photo" is probably a better dramatic character movie than a thriller.It's absolutely thanks to Robin Williams that the main character works out so well in the movie. He's highly convincing in this serious role. Somewhat of course he very rarely ever plays. He really is the one that carries the movie and here is also were one of the problems of the movie lays. All of the other characters are pushed to the back. It doesn't make the story work out as powerful and tense as it could had been. The Yorkin's are a pretty good movie-family but their fears and their reactions toward the weird- and behavior of Sy at certain points of the movie gets highly underdeveloped. It's probably the reason why it isn't the most effective thriller around, though it's absolutely an original and great one to watch.The storytelling is for most part good. It takes its time to draw out the character and set up the situations. It shows how the character slowly slips from being obsessed, to being a dangerous and psychotic stalker, when things are turning against him. It's definitely true that the movie goes a bit overboard toward the ending when everything happens fast and there is build up to an ending that just can't life up to its build up.It's definitely a well directed movie with a good visual style and some great shot and effective sequences, though Mark Romanek obviously still has a lot of learning to do. But the basis is here already notable in the movie and the basis is real good, so that promises a lot for his future movies.Highly recommendable due to its originality and performances from the cast but just don't watch this movie expecting a tense stalker-thriller, that will bring you to the edge of the seat.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting take on the psycho</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We know how a psycho behaves. He stuffs his dead mother, he keeps his victims prisoners for months in a well, he has a creepy dungeon full of perverted stuff, he has an invisible friend, he invents deadly cat-and-mouse games. This is the psycho Hollywood has taught us about for decades. But the real psycho, the one you'd never notice, the one which can pass for normal for years and years, where is he in movies? In One Hour Photo.This movie and Insomnia is what i call "Robin Williams goes serious". Instead of his cheery, lovable characters he usually portrays, he comes off as a cool, slightly abnormal person living on the edge of insanity. While Kevin Spacey has the charisma of a person who'd kill his mother without a blink of an eye, Robin Williams is the guy who everybody thinks is normal and who in every way is, until he snaps. He was a lonely writer in Insomnia; here he's a lonely photo-lab worker.Williams is great in his role. Jack Nicholsson was suggested for the movie, and while I love Jack, I can't help feeling he would have ruined the tension and the subtle parts of Sy's character. Robin Williams is perfect in the role and you forget it's him ever so often.The movie is technically brilliant, it stays away from the clichés, the script is tight and the supporting cast is pretty good(except the child actor, but that's to be expected). The pacing is pretty slow but none the less gripping and engaging.Very few movies are like this. So be prepared to see something original when you watch this. It's always nice with a breeze of fresh air in movies today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent directing, VERY promising talent in Romanek.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a beauty, a very good piece of directing that will definitely be among my top films of 2000-2010. Romanek shows a CLEAR mastery of the visual form, stark colours, powerful acting and a screenplay that should have gotten more acclaim. The film follows Sy (Robin Williams). A lonely photo-processing-attendant, with no life outside the four walls of the supermarket in which he conforms to a drab existence involving grey uniforms, tedious elevator music... an atmosphere only made interesting by cheating couples amateur porn. His only other shred of a life is collecting photos of a customer, which he pins on a wall to his apartment. Sy becomes enraged when a detail to the customers life is discovered and he sets about fixing the problem in his own Sy the Psycho way. But be warned, the film is sometimes (once) terrifyingly scary and also (again once) terribly shocking. However with such a strong story and a great director behind it, this film explores emotions that not a lot of others films have managed.Inspired visually, ideologically and thematically by the master that was and forever will be Kubrick, any fan of the films he made will not be disappointed. So to SK fans out there, watch it, see if you recognise his style in this. WARNING: Opinion may be biased.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never doubt Robin Williams' sinister abilities in movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the sappy box office duds "Jakob the Liar" and "Bicentennial Man", Robin Williams probably decided that he needed to do some darker roles. Therefore, you might say that 2002 was his comeback year: he not only did his first tour in fifteen years (which I saw) - he also made some good movie choices, with "Death to Smoochy" and "One Hour Photo" (I still haven't seen "Insomnia"). In "One Hour Photo", he plays photo developer Sy Parrish. Sy seems like a pretty routine person. But beneath that nondescript exterior lies something totally different. Sy has been developing the Yorkins' pictures for a long time, to the point where he is getting very interested in them. And by "interested", I mean "a lot more interested that most people would prefer". By which I mean that he's starting to spy on them.Yes, it all sounds pretty creepy, but the movie does end on a good note. No matter how you interpret it, it just goes to show that no one truly knows anybody. And anyway, it was good to see Robin Williams doing a new kind of role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would you trust this guy with your photos?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Robin Williams' performance in One Hour Photo make you want to switch to a digital camera instead.Williams plays Sy Parrish, a photo operator at Sav-Mart (Think Wal Mart). He's the guy that develops the photos for the customers. Sure, he has a cheery smile and a sunny disposition, but his life is empty. He has no friends, no lovers, no real existence other than his job. He eats alone, sleeps alone, lives alone.He also has a temper that is downright scary (He goes off on a photo repair guy in the middle of the busy store). The one bright spot in his life is the Yorkin family. To him, Will (Michael Vartan), Nina (Connie Nielsen)and Jake (Dylan Smith) ARE the perfect family. He so much wants to be part of the "happy family" that he has YEARS of their photos covering his wall in his apartment! He fantasizes about being their "Uncle Sy," part of their "happy family.' As any person will tell you, the picture doesn't tell the whole story. Sy soon finds out that his "perfect family" is far from it. He gets into constant trouble with his boss (Gary Cole). With his life crashing down, Sy goes over the edge. The most disturbing scene involves what occurs between Sy and Will. It becomes a rape scene in the most disturbing way. It can leave you wanting to wash off the slime that's coating you.Mark Romanek, director of such videos as Johnny Cash's "Hurt," and various Madonna videos such as "Rain," makes his big screen debut here. He does a wonderful job and brings out the best performances out of his actors. Cool, haunting music by Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD Commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw One Hour Photo on DVD. I liked it a lot when it came out a couple years ago, so I saw it again on DVD with the commentary by the director Mark Romanek and Robin Williams turned on. Hearing what they said reveals a lot about the outtakes and the pranks that Robin did. He still is a funny man but just wants to challenge himself with acting roles that are not as comedic as his past work. Also, Robin Williams said that this is actually his first movie that he made a commentary on because it was his first role that he barely saw himself as the character he played (Sy Parrish) in real life. In his past work, he said that he would have trouble watching himself because he would be too critical on his acting since he could relate with a lot of the past characters and roles he did. Anyway, as Robin Williams requested in the commentary, when people ask about what One Hour Photo is about, say "It's inexplicable, just watch it." Definitely watch it. Just a precaution though that this film is rated R with some sexual content and adult language in it. If you can look past the dark scenes, it's a great story that is engaging and interactive with the audience. Enjoy a very well filmed movie. If you like it, watch it with the commentary on and you'll hear about a lot of stuff behind the scenes and thoughts on certain scenes that were pretty entertaining. Only wish that Robin Williams spoke louder or had the microphone closer to him during the commentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mark Romanek missed the chance of making a great movie. All elements to a good thriller were there, but Romanek seems to have lost inspiration half way to the end, or was he frightened by Robin William's character dimension? This is likely to be one those cases the creature threatens the creator thus forcing creator to cut its life short due to utter lack of handling a character with a life of its own. Needless to say Mr.Williams is able to conceive unthinkable countless different types, but in this first ground-breaking close to real psycho, he definitely stands on the edge of giving birth to an unlimited ever-disturbing classic social misfit ready to be displayed in the vast gallery of top psychos created by cinema along its history, by delivering a performance that outgrows Romanek's capacity to direct such complex performance. That's when he notices the character has to be let well enough alone; otherwise he is bound to demand much more from what the director had thought of.I was surely sold, up to the first half of the movie. I thought I was about to watch something that would over step the boundaries set by "Cape Fear", "Silence of the Lamb" or even "Taxi Driver", but I learned a lesson: A classic will be a classic, and pretentious efforts shall inevitably be condemned to oblivion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, in my opinion, is art. Everything, from the lighting (making the Yorkin's house warm and perfect, to making Sav-Mart cold and oppressive) to the performances of the actors is sensational. Robin Williams definitely gives one of the best, if not the best, performance of his life. His character goes from appearing obsessive and a social freak, to lonely and caring. We begin to sympathize with him.Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan as Will and Nina Yorkin are perfectly cast. They appear good looking, young, perfect, but not in the Pepsi advert sense. Even Vartan's line about his wife wanting their life to look like it came straight from a magazine seems real and gritty. It is not the self-effacing humor that it would have been in any other film.Eriq La Salle's performance of the Detective Van Der Zee perfectly contrasts Robin Williams's Sy in the film's beginning and end bookmark scenes, as well as the rest of the film, and Sy's comparison with his and Will Yorkin's versions of fatherhood seems accurate and in context.Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek's score sets such a fitting tone for the film, and perfectly captures the emotion we are witnessing.Once the film is finished, it lives on in thoughts inside the viewer's head. It provokes them.9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated gem of a movie. SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this movie was neither a huge box office success nor is one of Robin William's more popular films, I found it to be very well-made and realistic.Most thrillers nowadays are very far-fetched and often tend to portray the antagonist as a one-dimensional psycho. This movie was very believable and did a terrific job of portraying Robin William's character Sy Parrish as a sympathetic but very disturbed figure. It is really hard to hate his character who seemingly just wanted to have a family of his own.Throughout the movie, you learn that he is very lonely, has no family and loves his job as a photo tech. You also learn that has become obsessed with one of his customers and her family, has illegally amassed tons of their family photos and frequently stalks them outside their home. As the movie progresses, Sy becomes more disgruntled until he eventually snaps. Even when he ultimately snaps, you still kind of feel bad for him in a way.While it may be argued that nothing was really resolved in the ending, I thought it was very appropriate. I really liked the fact that neither Sy (nor anyone else for that matter) was killed in the end. A lot of other movies will usually kill the villain because it is generally believed that he deserved to die. But that wasn't the case here as Sy was a very complex character.Lastly I felt that this movie was not overly long and really flowed well. It's one of the few movies on home video that I can actually watch without hitting the stop or pause button at least once.</fullReview>

A department store photo lab would not develop pornographic snapshots as William's character claims, and also the fact Williams was double printing one clients' photos and only charging for singles probably wouldn't get him fired. It certainly would not add up to thousands of dollars in printing costs his manager claims.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the credits of this film go to Robin Williams. If it wasn't for the way he held up and made us believe in the character of Sy Parish, then this film has very little else.He really gives his acting skills everything to turn the vulnerable old photoshop man into a scary stalker. Unfortunately the plot didn't offer more opportunity for him to be a classic stalker as in some other movies. In fact the plot had a couple of BIG flaws:Why, when the family's husband was working in digital media, did the family not possess a DIGITAL camera of all things? HA!Second, if you are a fit (as in muscular) looking young man, in bed with another youthful person, how on earth can you tremble at the sight of a frail-looking Williams wielding a small army knife at the foot of your bed. I myself would have been quite ready to take on Williams had I been in such a position. The weakness of character totally defied belief!There were also things about the convincibility of some of the other details. What a stupid argument dialogue the wife and husband have about her spending too much money. It was like scripting out of high-school drama class. Also, the police caught Williams too disappointingly quickly for my liking. Really, not enough of split second timing thrills. But bless Williams for that dramatic pose he made when in the headlights of the police cars. A curious role for an aged Williams and better than I've seen before from him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film to be quite interesting. Yes, it is slow in the beginning,but it picks up pace . Robin Williams is excellent as Sy Parish , the photo tech for Sav-mart.He plays it so creepy and so opposite of his usual personality. It shows his true talent when the actor disappears in his character. Few actors can do that. Robin Williams is one , Russell Crowe another. Sy's world is one in which the Yorkin family is the ideal family . Something, I guess, he did not have. As he digs deeper, he starts to see the cracks in the fine veener. Especially the fact the Will Yorkin is having an affair with a co-worker. That shatters Sy's world. That and the fact that he gets fired because he is caught stealing from the company. Mainly extra prints of the Yorkin Family. Robin Williams is excellent. The actors who play the husband and wife ( Michael Vartan and Connie Nilsen) are good.The son is excellent. The argument scene between Will and his wife seemed forced and tacked on. This was a good film. Not for everyone's taste. It is also a departure for Robin Williams</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ugh, this was so disappointing. We spent the first twenty minutes waiting for it to get good, the next thirty thinking it had progressed a bit and might be worth sticking with, and the last thirty realizing we'd made the wrong decision. I can't think of one single moment I actually enjoyed, and there were plenty of moments I actively disliked. Don't waste your time on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******SPOILERS****** Sy Parrish, Robin Williams, working at the local SavMat as a film developer at it's One Hour Photo store besides developing film has developed a very strong attachment to one of his customers, the Yorkin family trying to fit into their world as Uncle Sy. Sy secretly duplicates every one of the Yorkin family photos for himself and in his apartment has an entire wall made up of those photos. To Sy the Yorkin's seem to be the family that he didn't have when he was growing up as a child and now living alone yearns for. There's times when Sy drives to the Yorkin home and sits in his car for hours fantasizing about living with them as their favorite Uncle Sy. One afternoon Sy is called into the SavMat managers Bill Owen's, Gary Cole, office and told that there hundreds of photos that he processed that are not accounted for and because of that he will have to let him go at the end of the week. Hurt over the loss of his job and not having the chance to have contact with the Yorkin's that night looking at all the photos of the Yorkin's that he has Sy sees in a photo of some kind of reunion and a woman in it that looks very familiar to him. The woman turns out to be one of Sy's customers, Erin Daniels, Maya Burson, at the Photo Mat. Checking on Erins photos Sy sees that she's having an affair with Mr. Yorkin, Michael Vartan behind Mrs. Yorkin's Connie Nielsen, back! Overnight Sy changes from a harmless eccentric into an unstable as well as dangerous individual. Sy's actions that are set off by what he found out about Mr. Yorkin's infidelities ends up landing him in the police station where we first saw him at the beginning of the movie. It's also here in the police station that you get the most revealing insight in what Sy is all about. Going into a long and emotional speech about broken families and child abuse at first you think that Sy is mindlessly blabbering. It's alter then it starts to dawn on you that Sy is talking about his own childhood and the suffering and abuse that he went through. You also see that his actions against Mr. Yorkin and Miss. Daniels was to shame them of what they were doing to Mrs. Yorkin and most of all their nine year old son Jake, Dylan Smith. As if it reminded Sy of his own troubled childhood and his attempt to avoid that from happened to Mrs. Yorkin and especially little Jake whom Sy has taken a very strong liking for. As well as Jake looking up to Sy as some kind of friend or big brother.You begin to understand that whatever Sy did was because of a kind of misplaced ethics that he developed in his own growing up and almost forgive, like detective Van Der Zee, Eriq La Salle whom he's being interrogated by, him for what he did. Just before Det. Van Der Zee is about to leave the interrogation room Sy tells him meekly if he can see the photos that he took during the actions that put him in the situation that he's in now.Det. Van Der Zee sympathetically and understandingly hands them over to Sy. As Sy opens the envelope that the photos are in and spreads them over on the table you can see that Sy not only lost his job and his freedom. You begin to realize that the poor and troubled man who did what he did in his convoluted self righteous actions may have lost his mind as well! or did he! Sy cleverly shamed the two adulterers into silence by making them think what he was doing not by what what he actually did! Robin Williams gives a performance in "One Hour Photo" of Sy Parrish that would be hard to top by any actor around today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not convincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 45 minutes or so are pretty slow. Half of that time could have been better spent getting to know the family that so fascinates Sy.What happens to Sy? What about the not-so-happy family? The looks in peoples' faces and the ambiguous way we leave them begged for at least a block of text on screen explaining "Sy was sentenced to 10 years..." or whatever. I guess that level of reality isn't *that* important, but it seemed lacking to me.But I'm not complaining. This is a good film that simply could have been more tightly wound. p.s.: The image of Robin Williams sitting on the can will not leave my mind any time soon, I'm sorry to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sad...As my title has already suggested, this is not a very uplifting movie. Its understated visuals strangely amplifies an over-whelming sense of dread and mourn. By intent of the film-maker, One Hour Photo's carefully constructed, surreally sanitised environment left us viewers with nowhere to hide. Which made it especially painful to watch when one realised that we are confronted with an ugly, seering truth; that we are indirectly responsible for our alienation of other people and our general apathy for things arounds us. Painful revelation indeed, but it is happening even as we speak...Sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAN, this could have been so much better! A great idea + inspired casting (a sedated Robin Williams) should have equaled a creepy psychodrama that actually works. But it doesn't. And the technical pedigree alone should have guaranteed some results. The work of Fincher favorite Jeff Cronenworth (cinematographer for "Fight Club" as well as decent camerawork on "The Game" &amp; "Se7en") plus a soundtrack by the guys responsible for the music in "Run Lola Run" should have added up to something more than this. But of course it doesn't. And it's really a shame. Because everyone knows there's really only a few choice movies made every year, movies that you'll actually spend your hard-earned cash on and more importantly, not feel bad about it. "One Hour Photo" was on my short list for 2002. I was truly looking forward to seeing it and came away mostly disappointed. Oh, believe me, I got the jokes. "Seymour and Parrish". Funny. Sy's reaction to Nina's non-committal response upon finding out a certain something about her husband. Very Funny. Great. But I didn't come to see Madcap Robin. And the narrative is weak. Why have the opening bit at all? And why have the ending, for that matter, if you're going to ruin it? The climax (or the lack of one, I should say) is transparent, heavy-handed, and ultimately, a letdown. Maybe they should have called this "One Hour Used Cars" because you end up feeling so cheated. In all fairness, I should say you can tell they tried, they really did. But the end result is a picture that looks beautiful, but not pretty enough to carry its' lackluster storyline. Better luck next time, kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although Robin Williams performance was worth watching, the storyline was ridiculous!!SPOILERS.... 1) Why did Williams' character develop the photos of his boss' kid, knowing that it would prompt an investigation? Shortly thereafter, the cops are looking for him knowing he might be dangerous. Why didn't he just go after the husband and his mistress without the threat to the boss? I guess it was needed to make the story work to its ending.2) Williams' character has been keeping prints of this family for nine years, yet it's just determined after this amount of time has elapsed that the count on the photo machine is off? You've got to be kidding!!! Again, his firing was needed to make the story work to its ending.I'll post more when I have more time.....</fullReview>

These cunning filmmakers has decided that the best way to do a thriller(Yes I'm not kidding,they actually have the sheer audacity of calling this dung pile of utter boredom a THRILLER!!)is to take the well used technique of building suspense just to let it all flush down the drain,which result in the biggest anti-climax ever put on screen.If it were comfortable wiping your ass with a DVD or a videocassette,then you would not have to look no further.The answer lies in this fecal abomination of a "film"!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You won't be developing your photos again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"One Hour Photo" is exactly what I expected. A very well made, entertaining chiller-thriller that is memorable and notable, but not altogether one of the best thrillers ever. It's one of those that people will be talking about for about a year, but will then vanish, much like the other thrillers about psychopathic psychos.Robin Williams is the psycho in this film, named Sy Parrish, a.k.a. Sy the Photo Guy, as he is called by the son of a family he develops photos for at SavMart, which the director described as a kind of "Target meets K-Mart." Though the obvious similarity is Wal-Mart.Sy takes his job at SavMart personally--very personally. He's the one hour photo technician. And, as he narrates to us in the beginning, most people do not realize that photo developers actually look at the pictures you have taken when they develop them. What if one of these onlookers was a complete oddball? Weirdo? Psycho? What if? Let's say the guy makes an extra copy of your photos, just for him to take home and study. Soon that guy starts to think he is actually part of your family. That's when things really start to go haywire. He comes into your life, doing bizarre things. This technique has been used before, but what makes "One Hour Photo" so much better is its main character, Sy. He has feelings, emotions, and thoughts. Most slasher-flicks are about little crazy guys that we can't relate to, but you feel for Sy, and, as he does a few things, you start to believe what he is doing--though odd--is kind of good.Robin Williams is getting critical acclaim for giving a "terrifying performance." For a moment, I'm going to pretend I know what that means. To me, Williams does not give a terrifying performance. He gives an excellent, scary, but deep performance; as I mentioned above, he's more than some shallow slasher with a knife going after everyone. He has emotions, feelings, thoughts, and we can see them on the surface.I thoroughly enjoyed "One Hour Photo." The directing is classic, the acting talent is superb, and I guess I'm probably the only one who thought Williams' character is actually kind of the good guy. He reminds me of Michael Douglas in "Falling Down": His bubble has burst, and he's serving up his own justice. What Williams' character, Sy, does at the end of the film, is actually kind of justified.And that's what makes this movie so different from all the other "psychological thrillers" out there.4/5 stars -John Ulmer</fullReview>

After reading a number of the reviews, lauding this film as one akin to some of Hitchcock's finest, I purchased the DVD, got some takeout food and settled down with anticipation to enjoy this movie. I kept waiting for things to improve and stuck it out all the way to the end, at which time I felt great disappointment and shame at having been bilked out of the $19.95 plus tax that I spent on the DVD. Except for the fact that Robin Williams convinced me that his character was a disturbed weirdo, there was never anything in the movie that got me nervous or excited. The thing just dragged through one boring scene after another, until the end finally arrived. Fortunately, I bought The Four Feathers the same day and was able to salvage the evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly one of the best films of the year so far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Romanek, usually a music video director, takes a jab at the feature film department and makes an uncannily (yet righteously) awkward, yet extremely well crafted dramatic thriller of a movie with One Hour Photo.Robin Williams gives what could be an Oscar nominated performance from my standpoint, as a lonely and obsessive photo shop worker who it seems is a bit 'head over heels' (in the crazy sense) over a family of three that has sent their pictures to his department for the past eleven years (and un-beknownst to them all of those pictures are glued onto his living room wall from eleven years). Williams tries to always think they are the perfect family, but when he begins to see different, his obsession goes another step.A very creepy sense of realism is brought to the whole tone of the film and it works splendidly when brought along side Williams' performance, which is at times observant (the keen narration), sympathetic and totally out of sync with the rest of the true world. And in the end I felt I had witnessed an original work that pumps with greatness in it's photo shop veins. Also stars Connie Nielson, Michael Vartan as the husband and wife, and Gary Cole as Williams' boss, all quite good supporting performances. Grade: between A+ and A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Premise, Bad Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILERS*I expected more from this film. The premise of a photo-lab techincian developing an unhealthy relationship with his customers was an intriguing one. However, this movie was dull, poorly-acted, and boring. There was not enough background on any of the characters to create sympathy, and Williams' character's behavior was not explained until an astoundingly trite (and insufficient) scene at the end of the film. This left me feeling annoyed and wondering why in the world he was doing all of these things, and why I was expected to care.Overall, the performances were stilted and the dialogue trite. The supposedly "shocking" hotel scene was incredibly lame--I actually laughed as I was watching it. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, and not because it was "shocking" and confrontational, but because it was so stupid and unnecessary. The grimaces of "shame" and "fear" on the characters' faces were ridiculous, and Williams' overacting was embarrassing.This is a bad, bad movie. I just watched it and I've already forgotten most of what I saw. The symbolism was overdone...the entire thing just seemed so contrived. In fact, this movie was so bland that I came away from it with the vague feeling that I'd seen it before. Unoriginal, boring, bland, bad.Ultimately, this one gets a 3/10 from me. Not worth the effort.</fullReview>

It invites the viewer to consider the emotional issues bothering the main characters as though they might matter later. What made this movie SUCK was it's superior attitude, demonstrated by it's refusal to give the viewer a climactic ending. Williams is always fun to watch, but he can't hold this one up. Anyone else in Cy's role would have immediately exposed this film as the stinker it is. He kept me watching 'til the lousy cop-out ending.

		<fullReview>Sy Parrish has been doing photo development for 20 years. He has a vast knowledge of modern photography and develops photos at a local department store for a living. But he lives a sad and lonely life and begins spying on the Yorkin family, his most regular customers who seem to have everything in the world. Sy begins to feel that he wants to be in the Yorkin's life, but when he discovers that the Yorkins are not as perfect as they seem.He becomes obsessed with exposing the imperfections of the Yorkin family that could tear them apart.....He won the Oscar for GWH, and he may have been suitably sinister in Insomnia, but here he does something so so special, that, in my opinion, it's his career best performance. We all know what Sy is doing is totally wrong and he has severe mental health problems, but the way Williams depict his persona, you cannot help but sympathise for him, thus making him appear to be the victim of the narrative structure.Of course the wonderful writing and direction helps a lot, but his performance is so unique, I'm sure if this had a bigger distribution, he would have had a lot more award recognition than he did.Its scary, and at the same time, quite sad to know that someone can be that lonely enough to make their obsession almost reality, but at the same time, thinking that he is doing it for the greater good.Very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why Robin Williams gone. Is that bad movies, alcohol problems or personal instability? This question is for those who like talk about celebrities in idealistic way. He was a reliable and sensitive person and star in those films who others calls a "comedy". But his acting is not comedy. It something more simple and unobtrusive. He never played a person who make something out of nowhere and in his failures only people behind the camera might be blamed. I've seen not many films with him in lead, but Mark Romanek's impulsive drama about a lonely man was Williams perfect moment. Here he embodies himself as a man without anything important in his life. He live alone in empty apartment with only a collage of photos on his wall. He dreams about a family, something that he never have. He wears an empty and big bag.But his soul is not empty. I don't want to spoiler story of this film. But emotions, they really deep inside and i can't spoiler them either. All awards and recognition are nothing compared with human insecurity within the roles people plays. Robin Williams always tried to hide his insecurity. But here he's honest and brave with the role that reveals that side of him which he fight 'til the end.</fullReview>

And I wish I had taken this lack of recommendation or appraisal as an indicator. I did not particularly enjoy this film. It looked clean, had some fine composition, and stylistically it had potential, but the characters were flat. They came off as two dimensional as the Ikea catalog they seemed to be taken from. I couldn't sympathize with the family, and it all seemed to be a glossy and neat style of cinematography trying to cover bad writing. Psychological thrillers come a lot better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robin Williams played a good role, but he was lacking any decent material to work with.One Hour photo is one of those movies where you are crying out for something good to happen.The movie does drag. There are scenes in this movie that you can tell are just time fillers, as there is no real plot or structure to this movie.I HATED the family. The parents were terrible actors, and were just pathetic. I did not care at all about any of them. The AGFA guy and Sy's boss were much better actors than the parents, even if the AGFA guy was a bit cliché. And the guy who plays Yoshi was such a drip, boring and nothing to him. You'd think if Yoshi and Sy had worked there for years together they would be chatting away all day about this and that, but all we see is Sy spending most of his time alone! Ridiculous.And the 'SavMart' they worked in is one of the phoniest, fake malls I've ever seen. It looks almost Ikea like. The whole place seemed spotless and dirt free also. In fact, throughout the whole movie everything is picture perfect, excuse the pun.And we have the cop from ER, who seems like he is on tranquilizers the whole time, like hes stoned through out the movie. His character is completely wooden also.Yet another good idea for a film wasted and ruined. i didn't hate One hour Photo, there just could of been so much more to it, but it remains on one level throughout.</fullReview>

All is going well for him until he makes one error, Do Not get too obsessed by your customers! I wish our supermarket where I work, had it's own photo lab. I would like to work there. I would of thought, that Sy's Boss would of known about the extra prints. When that young lady hands the films in to be processed, Sy puts in the number of prints coll om instead of only 1 he puts 3! Also he cut through a negative I wonder if Yoshee could of mended it! I also liked seeing what a camera sees inside it when he put the film in. I would also like to know where Savmart is Sy definitely knew about the affair between Maya and that lady's husband. I also think that scene where Sy's boss said to him "I 'm letting you go" very apt punishment for all those discrepancies. Also calling the Agfa man out was a total waste of his time.

		<fullReview>Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) is a lonely sociopathic one hour photo mat developer who has his eye on worming his way into the life of the Yorkin family (one of his regular customers), who are having some family problems of their own. But make no mistake, Williams is the star of the show here and his performance is phenomenal. And if you can get past the HUGE plot-hole that he could ever steal duplicates of the photos he makes for YEARS and never get caught (granted that IS a bit much to swallow), as where as a few other plot holes, none as glaring, you'll find that this is an enjoyable enough thriller. Robin brings it above average and if he weren't in the film it would've suffered greatly in his absence.Eye Candy: Erin Daniels bares all (if fleetingly), and an extra shows all in picture form My Grade: B-DVD Extras: Commentary by Director Mark Romanek and Actor Robin Williams; Cinemax Making Of; a 36 minute excerpt from "the Charlie Rose Show"; A "Sundance: Anatomy Of A Scene" episode on the film; 3 TV spots; Theatrical trailer ; and Trailer for "The Dancer Upstairs"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I felt sympathy for Cy. A lonely and lost man, he seemed pitiful. Why couldn't he have any meaningful relationships? So sad. But I recently watched the movie again and as each new scene unfolded, I realized what a despicable character he really is. Each time he humbly ingratiated himself to the Yorkin family members, his sickening behavior became more nauseating - the hidden manipulations, the deceit and the prying. I saw him as a clinging, destructive parasite and I wanted to hit him. And that's the creative talent of this film: it made me believe the story. Robin Williams is terrific in this role. He gives real depth to Cy, with many layers. Perhaps if I watch it one more time, I'll once again find some sympathy and understanding for "Cy, the Photo Guy". A very well-made film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of Recent Robin Williams ? 8 (Bright, clean, and nervous like a straight jacket)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I think of all the recent Robin Williams movies I've seen, I'm left with a peculiar aftertaste. He appears in stylish, well produced films that don't really leave a lasting impression. Foremost in my mind are What Good Things Will Come, Bicentennial Man, and Final Cut, none of which I would recommend. They're all too busy.One Hour Photo stands out from the rest because unlike the others it's simple and effective. Williams does a thoroughly convincing job as Cy the Photo Guy, a character who epitomizes the privately obsessive side of human nature. That side we strive to squash on a daily basis to appear presentable in public.The effectiveness of simplicity shines through in every aspect of ONE HOUR PHOTO. The score is creepy. The photo lab is antiseptic. Williams' strained mannerisms suggest that he has too many secrets brooding in the subconscious. And the plainness of the local retail store and soccer-mom-suburbia confirms the suspicion that the neighborhood is too comfortable. The undercurrent of psychosis lurks precisely where life appears so ordinary.I was lost on how such a widely known Robin Williams movie could affect me so deeply, but the background of the director provided some insight. Mark Romanek hasn't worked on too many feature-length films, and most of his work has been producing music videos. That makes sense, because ONE HOUR PHOTO features a lot of well placed color against sterilized white. I don't know how to put it. It's the silent kind of creepy when you're watching a mime. It's like watching a skilled surgeon operating on a patient's leg. Camera zooms out to reveal that he's working on his own leg! (credit arnold for that one)Here's a shortlist of music videos by Romanek you can find on his 2005 Director's Label DVD:JAY-Z - 99 Problems; RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS - Can't Stop; JOHNNY CASH - Hurt; AUDIOSLAVE - Cochise; NO DOUBT - Hella Good; NIN - Perfect Drug; BECK - Devil's Haircut; EELS - Novocaine for the Soul; MICHAEL &amp; JANET JACKSON - Scream; MADONNA - Bedtime Story; LENNY KRAVITZ - Are You Gonna Go My Way; EN VOGUE - Free Your Mind; KD LANG - Constant CravingWhile a noisy production could have driven you away, the simplicity of ONE HOUR PHOTO draws you in. Watch this movie if you're tired with THX explosions, if you're losing faith in Robin Williams, or if you're looking for some good old, quiet perversion.JYJimboduck-dot-com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad film, but not enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this film a failure. Not because of Robin Williams, who plays without fault an awkward little man - maybe because he is a little like the character - and not because the story, which is, after all, rather original for this kind of movie. I do consider that it did not succeed to make me feel surprised. Movies should do that. I saw the commercial, I saw the movie and , throughout the length of it, I knew what was going to happen, even if the end was less violent that anyone would have believed.I knew what the main character felt, I knew what the two married people must have felt like and they acted upon their respective situations and feelings. There was nothing to make the viewer change in any way, so watching the movie lost its point.Great performance by Robin Williams, but not a good movie. Boring, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am surprised this movie seems so under rated. The draw for me originally was seeing Robin Williams in a dramatic/potentially bad guy role. He's such a comedy icon, it's always interesting to see him out of that element and as always, he pulls the role off beautifully.I was pleasantly surprised by the cinematography, score and pacing of this film. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, no differently than a classic Hitchcock film. It also has no "fat", meaning it is clear, concise and free of Hollywood clutter that bogs down the vast majority of films today. That alone is very refreshing.Definitely worth a look for any suspense fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lovingly conceived and produced, what this picture lacks is a movie.The story is instantly intriguing and the performance by Robin Williams commands deep respect. The photography is intelligent and deliberate, punctuated by flashes of abstract brilliance.The director very cleverly avoids imbuing the viewer with a false sense of familiarity by keeping the characters at a distance, and shows commendable restraint by not turning the whole thing into a hack-and-slash.However despite all the craftsmanship and care that went into it, the movie ends up feeling underdeveloped and poorly framed. For some reason it just doesn't quite take you there.Still worth seeing and I rated it a 7 for effort if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Each time you go to a discount department store, you see familiar faces. There's the door greeter, the woman behind the snack bar, the usual cash register attendants. The movie One Hour Photo uses this idea, namely the man who processes the film at a one-hour photo lab in a Wal-Mart-esquire retail store in Suburbia, USA. Robin Williams in one of those roles that continues to tell audiences he's more than Mork in his acting ability plays Sy the Photo Guy, a harmless looking man who is painfully lonely and decides to adopt a family, whether they know it or not. The Yorkin family is a loving family of 3, with father Will (Michael Vartan) and Nina (Connie Neilsen), with son Jake (Dylan Smith). Every time pictures are taken, they take them to Sy to have them developed. Sy, while processing the film, makes copies for himself to take home and "live" life with the Yorkins. This movie is powerful in showing that creepy, despicable characters are sometimes the ones we have the most sympathy for. Robin Williams conveys a feeling pity when he is doing the most wrong. One Hour Photo, written and directed by Mark Romanek, makes a familiar guy in all of our lives and makes him a parent's worst nightmare. He's just a lonely guy trying to make it in this world, but he makes bad choices. The only character who sees the bad side of Sy early is his boss, Bill, played by Gary Cole of Lundbergh fame in Office Space--sadly, no TPS reports here in One Hour Photo, a much more serious and somber tone to the film. All of the actors are top notch, but it's Williams who performs the best, making a horrible human being a sympathetic creep by the end of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice tidy little thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a tightly constructed and well executed thriller with an outstanding performance from an actor who has often been in danger of being strangled by his own mannerisms. Lennon and McCartney asked the question: "All the lonely people ? where do they all come from?' Seymour Parrish (Sy) is a case in point; he seems to have come from nowhere, no family no friends, just his job as a photo finisher inside Save Mart, a massive discount store in a suburban shopping mall. He takes his work seriously and he cultivates his customers, particularly the Yorkins, an attractive young couple with a cute eight-year old son called Jake. Sy becomes obsessed by the Yorkins who seem to have the perfect family life he has been denied and he fantasises about becoming part of it. Then he discovers, in the line of duty so to speak, that Will Yorkin is having an affair with a workmate. Sy is sacked (dismissal has been looming for some time) and over the edge he goes.Robin Williams as Sy reminded me a little of Rod Steiger's Mr Joyboy, the mortician in "The Loved One", a pedantic minor functionary with a very well developed sense of his own importance. Unusually for Williams it's a very restrained performance, as it must be; Robin Williams would not have remained employed at the Mart for 11 minutes, let alone 11 years. Even when Sy cracks, it is more of an implosion than an explosion.Two less well-known actors with non-American backgrounds, Connie Nielsen and Michael Vartan play Nina and Will Yorkin (no doubt "your kin"). They put in fine performances, but their low profiles help emphasis their generic character ? they are ordinary anonymous suburbanites - they could be you or me. Bigger names would have found this harder to carry off. The other notable performance is from Gary Cole as Bill, Sy's boss, a typical nasty middle manager basically unconcerned about his staff.The "Save Mart" (read "Wal Mart") is monstrous, impersonal, bathed in fluorescent light and devoted to profit, and not a place anybody of sensitivity would want to work. For that matter the Los Angeles suburbs it was set in are pretty awful ? the crew had to go to Brentwood, near San Francisco to find the Yorkins' designer house. Strangely, until things fly apart Sy seems remarkably well adapted to the Mart, as if his very lack of other involvement makes it his home ? he is institutionalised. As to what is motivating him, he has a little rant towards the end that suggests he might be taking revenge for some earlier abuse he suffered, but it's not clear why the Yorkins were the target.I guess you could say the film deplores adultery, though for once the punishment is not death. In fact I appreciated the lack of gore. Lonely people aren't all serial killers, after all. As to where they come from, well we don't really care, do we?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a first time movie director(kormanek) he did an amazing job, and to get Robin Williams to star in it, wow. Robin is incredibly pathetic as Sy Parrish, don't get me wrong, that's a compliment. Sy is supposed to be pathetic, he is supposed to make us pity him. What is amazing however, Robin managed to be eerie as well, so he puts us in a spot, we want to sympathies with him, but we cant, not really, because he is so disturbingly scary. It just shows how good an actor, Robin is. The cinematography is great too, the colour combination for example, it's so detailed and it has a dreamlike quality to them.How each scene played out, its beautiful. Kudos to Kormanek. This is different from any other thriller because the 'pyscho' is really humane, we can understand why he did what he did, actually, in the last scene, i just want to go over and hug him, there's this desperation in him, a need to be loved just like any other human being, all this is so subtly shown in the film. The actors didn't say anything particularly revealing. It's just the looks in Sy's eyes, the way he speaks, the body languages, it's so cleverly subtle that's what makes it more disturbing. I thought this film is going to be scary, with lots of gore and blood, i was pleasantly surprised, in fact, i didn't find this movie all that scary at all, it's more unsettling than scary. This movie got me thinking long after it's finished.</fullReview>

It really gives incite into a lonely obsessive persons mind. Robin Williams is great like usual and he continues to expand his resume in this movie. This one will keep you guessing until the very end and will leave you in a cold sweat and a hanging jaw. Go see it if you don't mind movies having a little sexual content in them. I really would not let the kids see this film. It goes over the line several times, but that is life. That is the world we live in.

		<shortDescription>Picture perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The entire time I watched this movie, I felt as though I were looking at an endless series of snapshots. Everything was too perfect and clean, and the colours too crisp and pure, the store too vast and white and gleaming... but not enough to make the surreality of the setting obscure the story. Everything's just this side of reality--just like when, for example, you see the photos of someone that they want to show you, the best ones. None of the ones where their hair is messed-up, their expression silly, their rear shot at an unflattering angle can be found--there's nary a single shot in this masterpiece out of place. As Sy's voice-over says, if you look through a person's photo albums, you might come away with the impression that nothing bad ever happens to them. In addition to including the key colours of photo development and emphasizing Sy's sterile, lonely identity with the whites, beiges and taupes of his environments, we are placed artistically in a world that can only be described as picture-perfect.I could go on about the cinematography, but that's not all I want to rave about. Robin Williams' performance in Insomnia was like a dress rehearsal for this film--as Sy, he gives us even more of a subtle, spare view into an unstable character's world. With each troubled role he takes on, he performs better and better. True aficionados of character acting will not at all be disappointed by this film... and yes, it sounds strange to me, too, to place Robin Williams in that esteemed acting category. He lives up to the praise he has garnered for this movie, and then some.**SPOILERS BELOW**I've read criticisms of the tensions between Mr. and Mrs. Yorkin--they fight over money, but she spends all her time at the discount store, Savmart. I feel that those who espouse this notion are missing some serious subtleties in the Yorkins' relationship--she feels that he has emotionally distanced himself from the family, and he seems to be expressing misplaced frustration with himself and the situation when he argues with her over her spending. Multiple instances in the movie bear out both complaints--we find he is having an affair, and we discover that Mrs. Yorkin has 'some serious shopping to do' during the day at the mall, and is consistently dressed and coiffed like a model, somewhat out of the norm for your average Savmart customer. It's a very realistic fight between a husband and wife about... nothing that they're actually voicing at all.As to whether or not the nude, posed photos were actually ever taken... well, I, for one, am satisfied to be left without that question being definitively answered. Does it matter? Mr. Yorkin and Maya were both duly humiliated, which was part of the purpose of the exercise. Perhaps it's better if he didn't, if he took pictures of random objects in their room, in his own--it would make us even slightly more sympathetic to Sy. But regardless, the ending makes it fairly clear that whatever the reality of it, Sy was acting against the two of them with, as a previous reviewer so eloquently put it, the worst punishment in his world.It's a picture... act like you're enjoying it. Act like you're having fun. And at the end of it, you're left feeling guilty and dirty and ashamed and angry... somewhat like the way the movie lets you feel at the end. I can't tell you how much I enjoy movies that really live up to Traffic's tagline--"No one comes away clean." Requiem for a Dream was like that, Traffic itself is like that, and One Hour Photo is certainly like that. I think it's a good thing, having been a retail lackey, to have some people realize what it is like to be looked through, to be looked over. And likewise, it's a good thing for others to realize that beautiful people in perfect homes assure their children and themselves that everyone's fine, they have girlfriends and mommies and daddies who love them. Both sets of people could benefit from a viewing of this film, but no one's going to come away with a good and light-hearted feeling when the credits begin to roll.I respect that, in a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sy Parrish's life is dull. Now, we've all seen dull people before, but with Sy, it's painfully dull. Take the song, "I'm Blue" by Eiffel 65 and substitute the word "dull", and you have Sy's life. Dull, sad, and lonely.That is, Sy's life away from the one-hour photo stand at the SavMart. There he comes alive, and is truly master of his domain. And there we learn to love him.Mark's and Robin's work in creating this character is nothing short of brilliant. You truly feel for him, and, knowing that in the end he's going to do something the detective describes as "not pretty", all the way through the film you find yourself thinking, "Oh, come on, Sy! Don't do what I think you're going to do!"And the revelation at the end is absolutely spot-on. With those few sentences, the entire film, and Sy's entire life suddenly pop into focus, and we understand why Sy's life is dull, and why he's lonely, and even why he took the job he did. Absolutely, totally brilliant.I put off seeing this film for a long time, as I had seen "Insomnia" and didn't care for it, and thought this would be the same sort of character. Far from it!Oh, by the way, Mark -- I saw the riderless horse as symbolizing futility and pointlessness, like Sy's life. It's interesting, the different interpretations of things!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS!Can't believe there are so many good reviews for this film. The only thing worth watching is the brilliant performance by Robin Williams. If it had been written just a little better he would have been up for an Oscar.One of the major problems is that the only person you have any empathy with is the young boy and then only at the end of the film, as his family is falling apart. All the characters are so bland, including Williams as "Cy" who is, well, meant to be bland I guess, and, doesn't hack the lovers to bits at the end! Boring!The other major problem is that if someone came up to me in a department store and said "oh I know you, I process your pictures, you have a lovely son and I like your house", I'd be straight to the manager/police with grave concerns for his health and my safety - but not in this film - no, they say things like "Oh yea, err thanks". Is this set in paranoid middle America?!I continued to watch because I was wondering were Williams character was going and the pace does build well. Then the reward for your viewing is about as interesting as going around to your mother in laws to look through her family photos, which just about sums up this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot to learn in this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best all around movies I have ever seen.First the acting is superb with several actors. Williams is number one in this film; his abilities shine brightly in these more serious rolls. The young boy played by Dylan Smith is wonderful in the role. He acts just as one would react at that age to the situations he is thrown in. His remarks to his parents, his childish concern in strangers, and his shy confused fear to uncomfortable situations. Michael Vartan lacks somewhat though, his dry acting doesn't help very much in shining light on who this family really is.The mystery of the family can be viewed as annoying if you don't dig deep. The past and make up of this family isn't told to you through story. It is shown to you through how they act around each other and the rest of the world. You get a loose idea of who these people are and using your sleuthing skills you form your own idea of who this family is. This allows the story to effectively portray the more important things in this film.You will be sitting on the edge of your seat wanting to turn this movie off. It'll rip your stomach up and repulse you. This is all good thou. The strength of this story helps make it chilling and suspenseful, you feel as if you are the one being attacked, as if you are the family in this movie. It'll hurt and make you afraid. Fighting to not press the stop button is what made this movie enjoyable, it felt REAL.The director went one extra step in making the suspenseful atmosphere that more influencing on you. The camera work is amazing. One can notice that they selected each color specifically to match the mood of that scene and portray the feelings of each character. The bright light and white and blue color all over the store portrays mood of sterile and safe. It gives you the idea that this is a safe place to be, you would never expect anything to go wrong here. The dark green tint used in certain scenes gives this un easy feeling, portraying an under lying pain in Sy... a poison. Just take a look at the still picture at the end of the film and see the brilliant photography used for the shot. All the colors and lighting can describe exactly what kind of people these are.This is a thinking movie, a movie you have to just sit back and absorb every thing in it and figure out a lot on your own. To see where everyone is coming from. If you are into art films or thinking movies watch this. And I also believe if your a film student, you can learn a lot about how the camera tells another story then the script... the camera can talk too.</fullReview>

Here he play photo finishings worker Simon Parrish, a loner whom people make fun of. We find out early on in the movie that Simon is obsessed by a family whose photos he develops and when he loses his job of 11 years, he finds out some dirty secrets, cracks and then takes matters into his own hands. Williams is very watchable as a crackpot and a lot of the time I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, but the movie just fell a little short for me at the finale. The movie has a short running length for of around 85 mins...not a lot for a so-called 'thriller'.

		<shortDescription>3 Stars: Intelligent showcase for Robin Williams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***:The film is an intelligent but a more-or-less forgettable outing highlighted by Robin William's against-type performance as the creepy central character, Cy. Cy, a film developer at a one-hour photo department, has an obsession with his favorite clients, the Yorkins and for every roll of film they send in, he keeps an extra copy for his own personal use. Additionally, one of the walls of Cy's is decorated with a humongous mural of all the pictures the family has ever sent for development and Cy secretly spies on the family and takes pictures. Cy, however, is very passive and actually quite pleasant with his interactions to his coworkers, his boss, and the Yorkin family. On the other hand, however, he scares us to death, and that more than anything is a tribute to William's enormous range. That's the paradox of Williams' character: as opposed to the guy who cheats on his wife, Williams is really doing nothing wrong out of a cultural context for a society that values privacy so highly. A statement is also being made here about our society's premium on conformity and the hypocrisy of that. The Yorkins are hypocritical because they devote their time to producing images of themselves as a happy and loving family, which of course they are not, making Cy a sort of truth bringer, doing nothing but exposing the hypocrisy of that. Even more so, the hypocrisy comes to light within ourselves when we're watching Cy get fired and empathize with the guy doing the firing. Thus, the movie is thematically very clever and thanks to Robin Williams, genuinely convincing. I would've rated higher if the script might have upped the level of fear so the story could have moved at a more exciting pace</fullReview>

Being an elevator music fan, I did. And the during the one scene at the SavMart, an instrumental version of the DeBarge song "Someone" was playing in the background. During a later scene, a different day, etc., the same exact song was playing at the SavMart! LOL I guess the producers didn't want to have to give credit to an extra song. Anyway, that's just a side note. The movie was spectacular. Far better than I expected. Robin Williams plays a psycho. But a good-hearted psycho! Who could be mad at him when he goes on a vigilante tirade against a cocky, unloving, and unfulfilling husband with a nice family who goes fooling around with some bimbo? Nevertheless, we can't underestimate Sy's true intentions, though. But what are those intentions? Mere loneliness and the desire to have a family? Or something more?Classic flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Jonathan Harris! Yes, Dr. Smith from Lost in Space. A lot of people don't remember that earlier in his career the comic Harris specialized in sinister characters - one of his creepiest roles being as a doctor on a classic Twilight Zone episode.This is the Harris that Williams is channeling in One Hour Photo. The resemblance is uncanny: The widely-set, beady eyes and somewhat irregular mouth that can seem either emotionally urgent or blocked off depending on the situation. Both play characters who seem to be hiding something, and when they let it out, it's something pretty strong: blind rage, desperate need, terror, deep loneliness. The latter, of course, was the running subtheme of Lost in Space, followed closely by terror. Harris's relationship with the Robinson family, particularly the son Will, parallels Williams' relationship here with the Yorkins and especially the son, Jake. The overly bright, suggestively "alien" lighting of the various interiors in One Hour Photo also parallel the eerie lighting of the spaceship in Lost in Space.I'm not arguing here that Lost in Space was great TV, or that One Hour Photo is a satisfying film ("raises more questions than it answers," my significant other said after we saw it). But thanks to Williams and Harris, both expose a scary kind of needfulness that we've all felt, at least a little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsatisfying, but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robin Williams plays Sy, a photo developer at a Target/K-Mart type of store who becomes obsessed with a family whose film he has been developing for over a decade. The movie was fascinating to watch, often in its small details. It spends a lot of time looking like a photograph, and seeing itself from inside itself, if you know what I mean. One of the most fascinating scenes was a complete throwaway. The basic premise is that Sy is this totally invisible guy. He's no one, a nebbish, and no one ever notices him. From the vantage point of his non-existence, he builds a dangerous and terrifying obsession; he uses his invisibility to stalk a family that is happily "normal," living on the other side of the invisibility divide. Gradually you can realize that we meet "Sy" all the time, and in this one, telling scene, Sy stops for dinner at a restaurant. The waitress knows him, asks after his family (whom she thinks is depicted in the photos he obsesses over), and so on. And it is there for the viewer to know that this waitress, too, is Sy. She is invisible to him, he doesn't see or notice her, but she knows him. Unfortunately, the story goes on to depend on more and more coincidences, both of unlikely circumstance and of converged timing, rather than staying in the viewpoint of ordinariness it has created. As one thing leads to another, it looks more like a movie and less like Sy working at Sav Mart, and that weakens the movie. Still, worth seeing. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An artfully composed unsettling thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The art direction and cinematography of this film is fantastic, and that is not a 'back-handed' compliment. In fact, the way the film is shot and directed is symbolic of the photograph-based fantasy world Sy lives in. I found the overall look of the film to be very effective; this is a man who looks at snapshots all day long and daydreams about a beautiful, artfully arranged life complete with a photogenic family but has little to no actual interaction with real people in a real and meaningful way. A small but particularly effective scene is that in which Sy is crouched in a corner looking at the photographs taken by his 'fantasy nephew' - all are of inanimate objects, cartoonish objects with happy painted smiles but nonetheless inanimate, no real people; his 'nephew' also avoids actual human contact (in Sy's mind.) The actual plot of the film is thrilling if not unique or particularly spellbinding, but to me the the subtle and not so subtle portrayals of Sy's incredibly removed and sterile existence/environment were the real treat here. Many of the shots reminded me of the iconic scene in the supermarket in 'Repo Man' where all the items within were generic, white labels with black block printing. I almost think this film works more as an art piece than a movie. Which is again, not a backhanded compliment. (and a P.S. - as a former photo lab tech, I'm wondering why Sy didn't record a number of those photos as mistakes to hide his tracks. Or what store has a photo lab roughly the size of an entire 7-11 with no garishly colored advertisements or fliers or sideline products all over the counter....)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Feel Bad Movie of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alienated man lives vicariously though the family photos he processes as photo lab dude in a mall. I know, not the best idea you ever heard. Robin Williams, what can you say? When I'm watching him, I think he's great and thoroughly convincing, yet when I reflect on his movies I pretty much hate them all and can't distinguish the performances. Strange. I like him though as the heavy. He's a strange bird, and it's easier to accept him as a bad guy and he carries this off quite well. The movie though, I can't recommend. Its really bizarre and unnerving I think. Some interesting philosophical observations are sprinkled generously throughout, and prompt you at times to think if the theme isn't more important here, than the plot. Can you pull this off in a film? Probably, but it too often crashes and burns. Movie's main asset is its startling use of bright color. Oh and the Danish broad rocks!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shades of color</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Did anyone else notice how the movie used the different shades of color in different parts of the movie. The Sav-Mart was shaded white, his personal life yellow, the family scenes are shaded orange, and when he discovers the husbands affair he is in a darkroom with the red light. I figures this has to due with the different shades of color for developing film (remember the +3 cyan incident?) I also figure that different colors are used for different areas (see above), but I haven't got it down all the way. Anyways, I think the movie is great, if only for seeing Robin Williams in a role that goes beyond his normal characters. If anybody has any ideas about the colors, please post them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is worth watching. It is a very good movie with perfect acting and directing skill. The story is also unique. When you have finished watching the movie you might still find yourself thinking about the story of the movie.Robin Williams is a guy working in "One hour photo", a photo shop. He is obsessed with the perfect married life of one of his regular customer. But with a shock he finds his imagination of perfect life of that customer is false. He gets shocked and takes unusual revenge on husband of that customer.In the movie peoples seemed happy in their photos. It made the photo guy believe that, they are happy and having a beautiful life. But the truth is, "The best part of the beauty is what no picture can express." So when he went more close than the visual appearance of those people then he saw that the real beauty of their life is missing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this film I think a lot of people decided to buy digital cameras. That is the lasting impression you will have when you see this film. It definitely makes you question the person who develops your photos. That being said, Robin Williams' foray into a dramatic role is outstanding. His portrayal of 'Sy the Photo Guy' is disturbing yet enthralling. Connie Nielson's performance as Nina Yorkin seemed forced at times, as did Jake Yorkin, the son. And Michael Vartan's role as Will Yorkin seemed pointless, like he was just an extra. The film has an excellent score, wonderful cinematography, and is well-directed. You can't help but feel sorry for Sy because he is lonely, and Robin Williams is great in his role. This movie is best viewed by a mature audience (strong thematic elements and nudity). There are some disturbing scenes in the movie (nightmare sequence with blood gushing from Sy's eyes and the bedroom scene where Sy takes degrading photos of Will and his lover Maya) but overall it all works and makes for a terrifying ride through an obsessive man's mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS WITHINSpeaking as a long-time worker (three years) in a one-hour photo lab, I found the film accurately portrayed the lab setting, though maybe not as much in terms of the workers -- but that was the point. I could completely understand why he lapsed into wishing that the family was his, and though some of the sexuality seemed overdone (there were times when I questioned the simple "R" rating), overall the production was fine, the score was great, and the characters had me hooked. The plot was a little thin in places, however.And a side note about developing pornographic pictures, the policy where I work, and at least in some other labs that I know of, is that unlike one of the earlier comments, we ARE allowed to, and in fact must develop and sell, pictures of people who are simply naked -- it's only if actual sexually-explicit positions, whether two people or one, are provided, then we can't sell them (we still have to print them, though, because we have an older, antiquated machine). Pictures as shown by Sy when he mentions the "amateur porn photographer" would have to be printed, at least in my store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sav-Mart is scary...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something ugly and sterile, dehumanizing about places like the "Sav-mart" in this film (of which there are more and more every day back here in real life). I don't like stores like those. I'd rather go live on the streets than work in a place like that -- at least the streets still have color, a sense of humanity and I wouldn't have to turn up in a well lighted tomb every morning working with zombies for as little money as they can get away with paying. Against this cold, icy paragon of nightmarish 00's consumerism it's no surprise that Robin William's character would snap. Anybody could snap -- it's an apt place to go crazy in, as devoid of genuine human contact as a crypt. And when Williams meets Nielsen's character in a modern day mall (another such place) eating lunch and she says "Just fueling up to do more shopping..." (shudder).That's what this film is really about, in my opinion -- the alienation and cheap emptiness of today's consumer culture, and the lie of the "perfect" suburban family (whose beautiful looking house is made of cheap synthetic materials, no deeper or more real than the photos taken there). It's been done before, and certainly better than this... the script is mediocre to average, but the lighting, cinematography and acting are all well above average. A must-see for anyone who's felt lonely, alienated and set adrift in today's culture that turns you into a buying machine from cradle to grave... then it turns your relatives into coffin and funeral service consumers, and puts a supermall-bought set of clothes on your dead body and a copyrighted and trademarked quip on your headstone. Terrifying -- 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't throw out masterpiece to films unless I feel they have earned such a grand title,but this film satisfied me for such distinction. It is such a deep and sad film..a film that has the outer edges of a thriller(as shown to us purposely in commercials). But this this film is much more than that..it is a film about longing and not lusting. I thought that our "hero" desired to just be a part of this family,not in love with the wife as it appears. If you look deeper you see that this man wants badly to make a connection to some people and attach himself to the outside world that stays carefully away. This film takes strides,however,to have an overall eerieness..almost creepiness..in our hero's attachment to the family presented. When "his" family is threatened(the husband's supposed cheating),our hero does things to get the husband to realize what a mistake he bestowed upon "him." You realize how attached to this family his is in scenes where "he goes into their house"(there's a reason I have this in quotes)and samples their toilet and looks through the rooms and has pictures on the wall containing many of their family pictures. The job of photo operator is almost solice from such a detached existance and "frees" him to flow into the lives of people when his is so lost and haunted. The ending is the truly sad part when we realize why our hero is the way he is after doing something to the husband. This film is about a man who doesn't know how to link with human beings because of inner scars..this is a truly sad thing for a person to have to endure. *****/*****</fullReview>

I liked it a lot, but it got me to thinking, could this really happen? And not even at one hour photo, but any place you take your film like to the nearby, Safeway grocery store or something? I mean, the premise of this thing makes you really believe that Williams' character is just nuts, a little too much cheese has slid off his cracker, if you know what I mean. Michael V. (not even going to try to spell his last name...mainly 'cause I can't remember what it is), is good as usual in this piece, and I really enjoyed the woman who played his wife, I thought she was also really good. The ending of this movie had me guessing until I finally saw what he had actually taken pictures of, and to discover that he didn't really...well you know. Like I said I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't watched the film yet, but just in case they're still reading I'll stop right there.Otherwise, I really liked the film, but just a little too realistic for me. I give it a 9 out of 10 (10 being the highest), just because it creeped me out a little too much I'm not giving it a full 10.A great watch!End of my review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reflection on loyalty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A sad tale about a lonely man obsessed with one family (Robin Williams, more into Popeye's territory than Mrs. Doubtfire's) turns into a sensitive reflection on loyalty, solidarity and togetherness. It falls into the traps of clichéd psychological melodrama whenever it tries to explain the characters' motivations, but during the moments it touches delicate issues of commitment in love relationships, it becomes an intelligent movie. It is the more surprising because it shows a realization about being loyal to a partner done by a young director/scriptwriter, that most ordinary human beings like us realize in old age, sometimes too late. Not surprisingly this story has no blood, sexual molestation scenes or shootings, and it works most of the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good all things considered</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty satisfying thriller, and an excellent departure for Robin Williams.Williams was a very good choice for two reasons. He really does look the part for one, and secondly because people are probably a little tired of seeing Williams play himself in role after role, a 60 year old man who acts like a 6 year old. His performance is very good, he does makes a good villain (is Sy really a villain?) but admittedly, it's at least partially novelty value and would wear off if he played these roles too often.The rest of the cast doesn't really deserve a mention. Connie Neilson is, as always, completely unremarkable and invisible. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, it's much worse to play a role with limited requirements and look like you are trying to stand out.*** SPOILERS ***I really understood Sy completely. As a loner, you are deathly afraid of intruding into another person's life, but at the same time you desperately wish they would invite you into it of their own free will. But sadly, that never seems to happen, no matter how many opportunities you give them. The part where Sy is fired, you can really feel his pain and what the job means to him. It is all he has, and whether you think keeping private photos of others is so bad or not, you feel great sympathy for him. It's a very good piece of acting by Williams.I think the ending, while not being exactly predictable, was still pretty cliche. We learn Sy had been abused as a child and that his abusers had taken photographs of him being abused, and that was probably the catalyst for his obsession with photos of happy people. And that was why his punishment of Will was by ostensibly taking degrading pictures of him and the woman he cheated with.And speaking form Sy's perspective, there's really only one thing worse than seeing a man who has it all go and cheat. It's seeing his wife forgive him and take him back anyway. Having said that, I really find it hard to sympathise with women who marry men like Will. They really do want to have their cake and eat it too, meaning that they want a guy with the money and success to give them everything they want, and then complain that he's away working so much to provide those things. It's little wonder with that such men under these kinds of conflicting requirements end up seeking affection from a less demanding third party.One final thing I'd like to comment on was the score. The music tried too hard to manipulate the audience. It goes so brooding and dark when revealing Sy's wall of photos, as though it's a wall of kiddie porn or snuff or something. It's not, it's pictures of a happy family, the kind Sy always wished he could have for himself. Speaking of manipulation, I am not a big fan of scenes like the one where Sy is inside the Yorkin's house and about to be busted, but then we discover it was merely a fantasy. This kind of fake suspense and tension is really a cheap and tacky trick and has been used too often in movies lately. And it ruins what was a truly creepy and intense scene to discover none of it was real.Overall though, I enjoyed the movie and enjoyed William's performance. Definitely worth seeing.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kudos to Robin Williams for great acting as usual. He has again shown his versatility. The movie on the other hand...sigh.. Very slow moving, not my usual type of fare. Started getting disgusted with the thought of Sy (of course, I guess that was their intention). Several 'unexpecteds' occurred which did enhance the movie but, not until the end. I saw it on STARZ...supposedly on from 11pm to 12:45am. Come about 12:30am, I was anxious to know what could happen in the last 15 minutes. I was robbed! Right about 12:30am the credits started rolling so....if you're seeing it on TV, it's only 1.5 hours long, not 1.75. I suggest watching but, you may want to have friends over to play a game during the first hour....of course keeping one eye on the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ONE HOUR PHOTO **Robin Williams is cast out of his normal territory in this quite bizarre and somewhat interesting movie. He plays a character called Sy who is a photo developer at a local supermarket who has obsessed about some of his clients for a number of years. Cut off from society in general and with no close relatives his only solace in life is the people he serves and the dedication to his job. But one family in particular appeals to him more than any other, and he soon obsesses to the extent where he follows the families footsteps, has a constant record of their photographs and wanders around their property. But when he gets fired from his job for misuse of the equipment he fills his time by delving even deeper into the families life, uncovering deceit and turmoil. Williams' performance is deeply disturbing and harrowing, because of the isolation Sy feels in a world where he sees so many faces in photographs in a day. Williams is wonderful in his part. The problem comes in not where he takes the movie or the movie's choice of plot and direction. We are supposed to feel sorry and fearful for the family he obsesses about, and we are supposed to be left aghast at what will happen next. The problem is that the family is so wooden and lifeless that I did not care what happened to them. And that for me is where it fell down. We get snapshots of the family, and hints of where their problems lie. We know there's something not quite right when Sy's intuition tells us so. But not enough detail went into the family for us to appreciate them and get to know them. Therefore when Williams' character torments them through his problem with isolation, it's just a prelude to a weird ending. A shame really because the film showed a lot of potential.</fullReview>

No wonder companies like Kodak, Agra, and FujiFilm are having to scramble to grab the consumer's attention and point them in the `do-it-yourself' direction. If you can't trust Sy the Photo Guy to develop your pictures and leave you alone, who can you trust? Sy is played by Robin Williams with the same seriousness and stiffness he used as the animatronic `Bicentennial Man'. He puts the `C' in creepy this time. Connie Nielsen is great as a wife and mother whose family life is less than the glossy magazine picture perfect her family photos portray. All I can say is, you've got to have friends.

		<fullReview>Robin Williams is Sy Parish, a seemingly pleasant man who works at the photograph processing department of a large discount store. His favourite customers are Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) and her son Jake (Dylan Smith). Sy, however, has a rather unhealthy obsession with Nina and her family and often dreams of being a larger part of their world.?One Hour Photo' is an entertaining movie from director Mark Romanek. The movie avoids most common clichés and portrays Williams' character as a nice yet socially maladjusted man, rather than a sick stalker. Make no mistake, Sy Parish is a deeply disturbed man but the viewer is made to sympathise with him rather than detest him. Through some good storytelling we are able to see the development of Williams' unhealthy obsession and are made to question whether he is actually doing much wrong? It is certainly wrong to stalk someone the way he does, but at the end of the day he means little harm. Mark Romanek's screenplay does a rather good job of portraying this despite featuring quite a few moments of unnecessary and forced dialogue. ?One Hour Photo' is paced rather well, though it does seem to drag in places and more too quickly in others. However, the story that develops is an interesting one and stirring enough to keep the viewer watching.Williams is very credible in his role as the disturbed Sy Parish and performs up to a high-standard that we have come to expect from him. ?One Hour Photo' allows us to see the vastness of Robin's talent and his ability to fit into almost any role. While perhaps not his best role he is certainly the star of the show and delivers his lines surprisingly convincingly. I was wary of Robin Williams playing this sort of role but now realise that he is just as adept playing this type of character as any other. Connie Nielsen is also good as the unsuspecting Nina, though fails to really impress. Flaws with the script prevent Connie's character from really standing out. There is a noticeable lack of character-development in certain places and while most things are wrapped up at the end, some questions are left unanswered. The ending is very powerful and saves the few scenes before it which seemed to drag. When the reason and extent of Sy's sickness is unveiled the viewer is left with a compassionate and strangely hollow feeling.Apart from the final ten minutes there are few memorable moments (except a short but effective nightmare sequence), yet the movie is still rather fulfilling. Some proficient direction compensate for the intermittent flaws in the screenplay rather well. ?One Hour Photo' is an appealing and compelling thriller with few scares but a real psychological and unsettling edge. Williams, though not on top-form, really helps to make this movie and it was a role he desperately needed after a few years in obscurity. My only real complaints with 'One Hour Photo' are the lack of character development in places, the sporadic moments of unnecessary dialogue and infrequent screenplay flaws. I recommend this movie for at least one watch. My rating for ?One Hour Photo' ? 7/10.</fullReview>

Easily the most believable character in the entire movie is Yoshi, the shop assistant, who gets about 5 minutes of total screen time. The ending is wishy-washy and provides no sense of resolution.One Hour Photo fails to thrill or suspend. The plot is boring and dull, leaving me feeling like I've seen this movie before.

However, Robin Williams performance made up for it, and the last 25 minutes of the film"SPOILERS"Especially the scene in which the manager of Sav mart gets the photographs of his daughter that Sy has taken in such a way that they are like a flip bookand of course the scene with the husband and his lover in the hotel room.."END OF SPOILERS"I give it a 7 out of Ten.. not an buy.. but a very good rent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One more reason to abandon film and go to digital photography!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film explores the age-old question "does the end justify the means?" Sy the photo guy is a nice but lonely man, lives in a very sparse apartment and a hamster running in a cage. As the film opens we see him being photographed, just arrested by the stalking division. We wonder what Sy has done, how serious it is, and the rest of the film is a long flashback which explains how he got there. The critic Ebert has an accurate review. Good movie, one of Robin Williams' best roles, really good character study.SPOILERS follow - don't read until you've seen the movie, OK??Sy in his loneliness has been the photo tech at SavMart for 11 years, and during most of those has followed one family, essentially adopting them in his mind. The wife is one of his best customers, and he always makes an extra set of prints so he can keep a set, secretly of course. But his wall at home becomes his "family" photo album. He adores the wife and son, and when he meets up with the husband reacts almost like we might when accidentally coming across our favorite actor in the grocery store. He views them as the ideal family, and secretly fantasizes that he becomes part of their family, and is called "Uncle Sy."All that is shattered one day when he develops photos which shows the husband in romantic situations with a sexy female co-worker. Coincidentally, he is fired for overall suspicious performance, including several hundred unaccounted photos, and on his last day slips copies of the offending photos in the wife's set of prints. He further tracks down the husband at the hotel during one of his illicit trysts, and forces them to pose nude for photos of them in compromising positions. The police nab him and we get back to the scene which began the film. The film closes with a photo of Sy and his adopted family, everyone happy and smiling. On the DVD's director's commentary he said he hopes it is vague, so that you can interpret it either as a fantasy shot, or perhaps they really did mend fences and develop the relationship. However, it is clear from the same commentary track that Williams considers it just a fantasy in Sy's mind. That seems to me the best fit. In this role, Williams abandons all the acting quirks he is usually noted for, and adopts an entirely new persona for Sy. In this role he demonstrates why he is one of the overall best actors of his time. Good movie, good character study.The DVD is a good one, although the extras are rather ordinary. The sound track is especially good, setting the mood, and some of the deep bass literally is visceral.July 2012 edit: Just watched it again, still an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a major dissapointment!! Other than the superb acting of Williams, nothing else in this yawner is worth watching. The plot (what plot) leaves you scratching your head. I kept waiting, as did my entire family, for the suspense, it never happened. The next thing we all knew, the credits were rolling up the screen. We all looked at each other and said, "Huh?" Boy, I was really expecting a lot more. And, if I could reply to one person who wrote that some people need Vin Diesel and Ja Rule and a rap soundtrack to satisfy their action taste, even that would not have helped this one (didn't like F&amp;F either). Rent/buy at your own risk. There is no action or suspense in this clunker. If by chance you find this "chilling" or suspenseful, then let me recommend some other films, like "Bambi", "All Dogs Go To Heaven", etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, much of it is a voice over with Robin Williams that is incredibly obnoxious. Then there is the fact that I found William's character of Sy not to be a real person, but rather, a statistic. We know so little about him, and the sterile atmosphere only further gets on my nerves. It makes me want to tear my hair out, but then I'd look like Sy, and every time I glance in the mirror, I'd go mad, making me want to scratch my eyes out. Can you see how insane this film has made me already? And I haven't even mentioned the contrivances in the plot that got to me, mainly because I already did not like this film to begin with. But most importantly, if you do not enjoy watching Robin Williams in dramatic roles, do not watch this because he is just that...dramatic. I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said I hate this film. It upset me so much, I don't think I'll ever recover. And no, that is not a good thing. I give it a 4/10, but not because I enjoyed it. I give it a zero by that scale.</fullReview>

An unsatisfying flick, "OHP" is an obvious synthesis with a contrived and surreal hospital clean milieu, a heavy-handed score which overstates the substance, paper thin characters we're not given to care about, and an ambiguous conclusion which makes no clear statement of purpose. Nonetheless, "OHP" has scored decent marks and is probably a three star watch for those into weirdness for weirdnesses sake. (B-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller which is thrilling!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mark Romanek is absolutely a new name to be remembered among American directors and script writers. "One Hour Photo" is brilliant. Brilliant as a thriller AND as a film. Much is due to Robin Williams who has really started in the serious acting business and has got the tools. This ought to give him an academy award but probably it won't, because this movie doesn't sell enough. Williams however performs a character that you seldom see in American films. There is a complication in this photo guy, which is made very obvious. He is weird in the beginning, but it gets worse. Williams is making all this without overacting. He is quite impressing.The film is really a thriller and a very creepy one. You feel more and more nervous during the 96 minutes. Romanek knows the tricks, but he surprises you many times during the 1,5 hour. In all this, there's also criticism concerning the inhuman way of treating the "little" man in a cold society, who cares much much more about money than about people. Especially the little ones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, but the best thing about this film is the Simpsons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems people are all amazed by Robin Williams performance. And I agree it is good. But he has done serious movies before, we know he is capable of this. And there are another dozen actors who could have had equal if not superior performances. So the acting is good, I'll give you that. But good acting does not make a movie alone.  The characters are average. Si being the most interesting of those. The family was kind of weak if you ask me. They aren't interesting enough for me to take an interest to. I can't see what Si sees in them. The little boy is the only redeeming thing about them. I certainly wouldn't stalk that family. The writing was horrible. I won't say the plot is horrible, as it was interesting enough to get me into the movie. And the plot is good enough to build suspense near the end. But some of the dialogue and the entire ending is horrible. Also I don't agree with the opening scene of having Robin Williams sit down in the interrogation room. The plot was already pretty obvious, but this made it even worse. And the dream sequences seemed to be put there to add more suspense for a film that really isn't about suspense. Although I will add I liked the scenes where Si follows the family in his car.  But upon seeing the Simpsons in this film, I seriously wanted to see the rest of that great Simpsons episode. That is sad commentary on how good the film was.  In summary I feel this was a great idea for a film. Better writing, directing, and better actors for the family would have made this a great film. As is, I feel it is an above average film lacking good writing.</fullReview>

Although Robin Williams does give an adequate performance, that's the only worthwhile aspect to this film.

		<fullReview>ONE HOUR PHOTO (2002) **** Robin Williams, Connie Nielsen, Michael Vartan, Gary Cole, Dylan Smith, Eriq LaSalle, Erin Daniels, Clark Gregg. Williams (in one of his best roles to date showing his true range as an actor) stars as a lonely manager of a film development center in a convenience store who becomes obsessed with a family whose pictures prove to be more than a thousand words. Conveying the pain, desire and utter despair of a disturbed man wrestling with the inner demons of a depleted life, Williams makes Sy Parrish an indelibly remarkable cinematic character along the lines of Travis Bickle, Norman Bates and Harry Caul . Mixed with creepy awareness and an acute social commentary by writer/director Mark Romanek (in a notable debut) who knowingly captures genuine moments of unease and empathy in a particularly conceived concept: how does one live without human contact and the essential ingredient of love? A stunning achievement by all connected with one of the year's best films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The premise of One Hour Photo is original, intriguing, and creepy. In fact, that premise and the reports of Robin Williams's performance pulled me into the theater to see this movie. Unfortunately, the delicately creepy premise gets bogged down by the overblown production and the story never really gets off the ground (and ends up suffering from a couple of huge lapses of logic). From the beginning of the story's chronology, the movie keeps flashing neon signs that scream "creepy movie, creepy movie," such as the unnecessary and annoying bursts of suspenseful music during early expository scenes that are neither creepy nor suspenseful. It is as though the director is afraid the audience won't get it, or worse, can't pay attention to the movie long enough to come to that conclusion on their own. There is nothing subtle here, except perhaps the drowning of a promising storyline in a lot of fluff.</fullReview>

With very little evidence of any wrong doing, they have seemingly a whole force staking out a house, store, and a hotel. With this very flimsy evidence they get a search warrant when I know any judge would laugh at the evidence. The only bright spot was Robin Williams portrayal of this psycho.

		<fullReview>The worst film of 2002!! "One Hour Photo" tops my list of "Worst Films of 2002" right next to such duds as: "Signs", "The Four Feathers", "Star Wars 2", "The Panic Room &amp; "Changing Lanes", "Blue Crush" as some of the most over hyped, most over blown sillest films of 2002! I would define this year as the year of B-movies! "One Hour Photo" is the mother of all the worst films to come out of the 2002 film line up so far. I mean "The Four Feathers" was really bad, but "One Hour Photo" was really really bad! "One Hour Photo" was 100% over hyped, over promoted and under done. "One Hour Photo" was poorly written, poorly directed, with enough Z grade to come from not only Mr. Williams in years, but the entire cast as well! The characters were wooden, almost cardboard, the dialouge was wooden and broken, the acting was fair &amp; the ending was like leaving a can of pop open over night on the counter, flat and tasteless! I saw "One Hour Photo" the night it opened, and what a truely 100% waste of $8.00 to see. "One Hour Photo" is another fine example of how the Hollywood hype machine works in over drive to get there films noticed, and to sucker an unexpecting audeience into the film so it can make money. i think Hollywood knew that "One Hour Photo" was a bad film to begin with so that is why they over hyped it to the max! After seeing this film being promoted by Mr. Williams on every single talk show for over 7 months (&amp; in most of Mr. Robins interviews he mad an ass out of himself anyways &amp; he dosen't come off as an intelligent for that matter), a big fancy interview in EW magazine &amp; being wowed at the 2002 Sundance Film Fest (Which I can't figure out why I guess the cold freezes people thinking?). I was expecting a really tight, edge of your seat thriller, what I got instead was a lazy, silly, tepid, PG-13 made for Lifetime Orginial movie film that would have played better on HBO. This film was the biggest scam since "The Blair Witch Project"! Next to "Insomina" this was Mr. Williams worst role this year! The Rasberry Award for worst film for 2002 should have a tie bettween: "One Hour Photo" &amp; "The Four Feathers". But Mr. Williams should get the Raseberry Award for Wrost actor for both "Insomina" &amp; "One Hour Photo"! Some silly, over-paid &amp; very uneducated critic said: "One Hour Photo will do to snapshots what Psycho did for showers". What a crock!! This statement is the lowest, a truly tsteless thing to say about a classic film like "Psycho"! This critic and most directors in Hollywood today need to go bak to film school and learn how to make high quality films &amp; not some cheap thriller knock-off! What I'm confused about is why "One Hour Photo" was rated "R" in th first place? Ther was no sex or violence in this film to give it an "R" rating unless it was another ploy by Hollywood to hype this film up! Thr trailer for "Red Dragon" was alot more scary than "One Hour Photo". During "One Hour Photo" half the audince laughed at most of the converstaions taking place on screen, or simply the other half of the audience just walked out before the end. The ending was a truly let down, almost a silly joke. The film ended very cold as well, it felt like the director was too scared to to take a risk and make "One Hour Photo" more daring and bold, or even more of a thriller. It seemed the director wanted to make more of a family film than anything else! Wait for $1.00 dollar theater, or better yet 0.99 cents rental day at your local video store. If "One Hour Photo" is even considered for Oscar gold then I know Hollywood is going to hell in a hand basket, &amp; that most actors like Mr. Williams are in the film business for the money to pay there rent, &amp; that they are not in the business of film to make high quality art! For making such a bad film Mr. Williams should lose some of his high salary and start from the bottom and work his way back up! I haven't seen one Hollywood film this year that even qualifes for any great reviews or even something that would show Oscar Gold, or even something that is worth seeing again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Experiment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had written a negative review of ONE HOUR PHOTO a couple of years ago when it came out and then regretted writing it because I've since undertaken a more studied approach to films. So, I thought, I'll delete that comment and watch it again in the spirit of anticipating artistry. I'll be more charitable, I thought, see things that I missed before; I'll come out a fan. Of course, you know from my heavy-handed foreshadowing (borrowing one of the director's approaches) that it never happened. I like this film much less than I did the first time.To be fair, there are some successful aspects of this enterprise. At one point I noted that the film technique far surpasses the story. The movie is slick-looking, indeed. The use of color is rampant, albeit largely meaningless. The lighting is affective and needs desperately to be tied to a story and a character. The acting never caught my attention which is a good thing.But the movie is so painfully plodding that I thought at one point that the filmmaker must be a famous person's son who had a lot of money and a lot of Hollywood ties (look at the cast--even the day roles are names) and a nebulous idea that he ultimately couldn't pull off. I haven't yet investigated that theory but I did read that this is a former music video director. That explains a lot--visuals without meaning. This movie is contrived, manipulative, and follows all of the Hollywood clichés--it just LOOKS like it doesn't. One can only guess at the positive critical responses, but I'll bet you that none of the critics watched it a second time.This movie reminds me of smart people who want to write but who don't read. They're capable, perhaps, but nearly knowledge-free of the greatness in their chosen medium. As one IMDb user put it (and I'm sorry I can't remember who) "art isn't easy."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so incredably disturbing. I couldn't shut my eyes during the film. Robbin Williams delivers an awesome performance that he should've gotten nominated for. "One Hour Photo" is a great film, but like I said, disturbing. Robin Williams plays Sy, the photo guy. He has been developing photos for years, in particular for one family. He sees how happy they are in these photos. He wants to be part of their family. So, he starts to grow an obsession to keep them happy.The film is very interesting. I would recommend.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a spoiler review...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a real waste of time. It's supposed to be about how a lonely and deranged photo clerk at what we all know is a parody of Wal-Mart wants to insinuate himself into the family of his favourite customers as some kind of adopted uncle, and what goes wrong when he discovers the husband cheats on the wife. Fine, whatever, another standard movie about deranged people trying to get close, being rejected, and turning violent. The problem with this movie is in the incidentals: the son tells his mother he feels sorry for the photo clerk who appears to be lonely and mocked, and the mother trains him to "send good thoughts" to the clerk rather than act--we all know that this photo clerk is best avoided, but they don't know that, so basically the mother trains her son to do meaningless nothings rather than forge genuine friendships. Of course, she doesn't seem to care too much that her husband cheats and acknowledges that he is emotionally absent or whatever, so maybe she thinks to "send good thoughts" is normal. The only mildly amusing part of the film was when the photo clerk imagines himself living in the family's house, watching tv &amp;c., and there is a brief scene of him on their toilet with his pants down around his ankles--obviously the viewer is uncomfortable because his obsession is being shown, but it's also Robin Williams with a bad dye job sitting on a toilet. If anyone wants to see Robin Williams play a bad guy in a better film, watch "Insomnia". "One Hour Photo" was a stupid movie, but not as stupid as "Scooby Doo".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, THAT'S a new look for you, mr. williams........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Breaks my heart when an actor with the stature of Robin Williams puts in a creditable performance in a movie that doesn't quite make the cut. Williams plays much darker here than in "Insomnia" and the overarching sense of loneliness is reinforced by the Kubrick-homage cinematography. However, ya can't go home humming the lighting, as they say...and the story itself just falls flat. The ending is a shambles. I'm not exactly sure if it's supposed to be real or a product of the main character's imagination. Either way...the character isn't..you'll pardon the expression..developed, in any significant manner. The "chase" scene is a waste of time that would have been better spent inserting some meaningful dialogue into the interview scene with Eriq La Salle. (Tom Noonan in "Manhunter"--another psycho in a Fotomat---managed to flesh out his character much better with significantly less screen time---it's all about the writing and direction, kids.)Anyway...Kubrick aficianados will find much to admire, and it's worth watching if only to see Robin Williams as he's likely to look at the age of 83...but this ain't no "Psycho", this ain't no "Silence", this ain't no foolin' around.....(apologies to David Byrne)............</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was pretty mediocre. The acting was fine, but acting only helps when there is a good plot. I thought the first hour was really boring, and it was all pretty much explained in the trailer. When it finally started to pick up, I got more involved in the story, but ultimately the end was a let down. With so many other thrillers out at the video store I'm sure you can find something better. But if you are big Robin Williams fan, you might like it because he isn't "funny" (which isn't much of a reason to like this movie when you think about it, but it seems it is the popular reason listed on this website). In conclusion, can't say I liked it, but I can't say I hated it either, better then Bicentennial man as far as boring Robin Williams movies go.Zoopansick</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have Been a One Hour Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed Robin Williams as an actor and in particular like his dramatic work, such as his performance in "Good Will Hunting". Because of that, I was anxious to see his performance in "One Hour Photo".Unfortunately, this movie progresses at the pace of molasses. So much time passes without adding to the story. There was so much opportunity to learn how the character got to this place in his life, but we never find out. We have no idea what caused him to have the relationship with this particular customer out of all of his customers. Answers to these could have replaced other scenes that added nothing to the dramatic elements in the film.Robin's acting was good as expected, but the poor direction and editing prevent the performance from getting any traction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wimpering suspense-drama with variable performances and writing. Robin Williams is nearly unrecognizable as a friendless photo developer in a shopping center whose not-so-innocent obsession with a seemingly happy family leads to tragedy. I'm not sure why 'lonely' always equals 'sociopathic' in these kinds of movies--if it's for dramatic content, "One Hour Photo" comes up doubly short, as there isn't much substance in this script nor is there an emotional pay-off at the finale. Williams, his lips tightened into a grimace, displays a convincingly false happy-front; with his alert eyes and quick little movements, he gives this character more depth than writer-director Mark Romanek probably envisioned (it's certainly not there in the script). Romanek is very flashy, giving us canny snippets of character quirks, but he is neither interested in being enlightening (except for a brief treatise on the history of photography) nor entertaining, and the fantasies and dream sequences are poor excuses for narrative content. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.I dread the Robin Williams projects. Its not so much him, as long as he doesn't give us any more grieving husband retreads. No, it is all the fuss that is made around him to focus on an exaggerate his apparent quirkiness. The man does know a few things about energy and how it affects the engine of self. But most of what we get out of his characters comes from others: the lighting, makeup, design, strange notes in the script, even adaptive reactions by other actors. To see how powerful this effect is, pay attention to Williams' voiceover as narrator. See how ordinary it is, how inapt it is at conveying what is intended, how poor the rhythm. Now contrast that with his on-screen presence, where the world is engineered to support him. Striking.But in this case, the interesting thing isn't the story or the acting, nor any of that. It is the example, yet another one, of a growing acceptance in mainstream film of the notion of explicit self-reference. That's where we have a collection of images made about the making of a collection of images, usually film or photography. (Another thread are performances about performances.)In such self-reference, the voyeurism of the character is folded into our own voyeurism in watching what is going on. A clever writer will trick us into believing the character to be right until the end where he and us are revealed for what we are. And so we have here. I remark that the self-reference is particularly explicit, but in this case not particularly well done, because no moral ambiguity is introduced. I understand that such a thing was part of the original project, but as with all Hollywood efforts now, test audiences and `protect-the-investment' strategies washed it all out.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It probably looked good on paper but the screen result is pure boredom from the very outset. The story takes too long to get going and we are left with an hour of "character build-up" that leads to nothing other than some preachy words at the end. Unfortunately I was too bored to pay a lot of attention to the moralistic statement which closes the film but I do remember being some right-wing generalities with little or no philosophical, political or existential depth. Despite the attempt to make it a character-driven piece, no one is of any interest, as we don't learn much about them, including the lead "Seymour" or "Sy, the photo guy," played by Robin Williams. Many "plot points" feel forced and heavy handed signals for the audience to get ready for the next sequence. To make things worse, pivotal events are not believable because we know they do not happen that way in real life and we are already too bored to even consider buying them for the sake of "suspension of disbelief." To top it all, the cinematography is ugly to watch and the electronic music absolutely overbearing. If someone offers you the DVD or video for free, pass on it. Value your time.</fullReview>

The story believes to survive by the presence of Robin Williams only, who's character might be intriguing in the beginning, but seems to fade as soon as things and the film runs out of control.We jump from a family life to a family crises without any transitions. We see an old man with a knife in his one hand and a camera in the other threatening a young couple, making them suck each other off, get naked aso. I'm not to brave myself but there is no way I wouldn't try to change that situation. The soundtrack of the film is horrible, the actors remain to be merely puppets without character, the boy is so nice it makes you want to puke.

		<fullReview>This movie suffers from SO many problems that I don't know where to start, but I will focus (no pun) on the script and directing.First of all, the film attempts to be a character study and a thriller and it fails on both counts. The Sy character is never fully realized (not Williams' fault) as the screenplay doesn't do anything interesting with him until he becomes unhinged at the end. And that last tacked on scene that was supposed to add exposition did not ring true at all. Why not have flashbacks or delve deeper into Sy's psyche? That would have been so much more interesting than the cursory rant at the end.*SPOILER ALERT* And I am sure a 50-year-old man is suddenly going to go nuts after never having done that before?Other problems: no 9-year-old child is going to say to his mom: "I feel sad for Sy. He has no friends. I can just tell by looking at him." Yeah right, of course he can. And HOW sensitive of this 9-year-old.Why didn't the wife confront the husband?The real problem with this movie is that there isn't enough material here to sustain a feature length film. This would have made a really good 30-minute Tales from the Crypt of something like that. As it is, One-Hour Photo is one hour too long.</fullReview>

Yes, we do know that there is a point to that, but it is a very obvious point. In the first three minutes, you'll get all the symbolism, and then spend the rest of this movie waiting for some colour. The director/ writer has to realize that basing an entire movie around a boring character will likely lead to a boring movie. Only see it if you have a strong affinity for beige, wear adult running shoes with velcro, or go to baskin robbins and order vanilla ice cream. Not french vanilla, just vanilla. If this applies to you... go out and see this movie. I feel very sorry for you. If not, there is only one part of the movie you'll enjoy - the blood eyes.

And we are led to believe that Nina Yorkin ( Connie Neilson ) has no problem letting Sy the photo guy into her life so casually . Obviously anyone trying to insinuate himself into her life would be looked at with alarm . But instead the movie allows Sy to get closer and closer into a stranger's life . Thank heaven for Digital and Instant cameras . Even without the unwanted comments about my pictures I've always hated having my family's pictures scrutinized by strangers . I would like to say a few nice things about this film but unfortunately I can't . The shear unbelievability of the premise keeps me from appreciating the weird blue silence of this film . By the way , does anyone else think that Connie Neilson is probably the daughter of Julie Christie of Dr. Zhivago fame ?

He has been developing the photographs of the Yorkin family, from the films given by mother and wife Nina Yorkin (Connie Nielsen) since young Jake (Dylan Smith) was a baby. What they and everyone else doesn't know is that at his house his wall is covered with this family's photos! He basically wants to be part of this family, even though he knows he can't, so you can slightly sympathise with his loneliness. When the supermarket manager Bill Owens (Gary Cole) finds out fires him for theft, he has one more week at work, so he starts having a breakdown because he won't "see" the family anymore. But then it gets worse, in his last developing he discovers the father and husband of the family Will Yorkin (Michael Vartan) has been having an affair with Maya Burson (Erin Daniels), through some photos that he finds. So he exacts angry revenge by first slipping this affair photo in the family's photo envelope, and then he finds where the Dad and this other woman hang out. When he finds them at the hotel room, he threatens to stab them (with a stolen knife) if they do not pose in pornographic poses (and smile), this is the most uncomfortable scene. In the end, he gets arrested for stalking the manager's daughter and the final shot is him in a Yorkin family photo, but is it his imagination or reality? Also starring Paul Hansen Kim as Yoshi Araki, Eriq La Salle as Detective James Van Der Zee and Clark Gregg as Detective Paul Outerbridge. This is what I like to refer to as the nut-case film, like Falling Down, Fatal Attraction and Misery. Robin Williams was number 19 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is absolutely a waste of time and as someone in the discussion forum meant "simply AWFUL" I am really sorry for the people who thinks that there is a deeper interpretation of this film.. GUYS there IS NOT such a thing. The world is full of nerds and idiots and it is not "entertaining" watching them doin and thinking stupid things. This Film is just for people who are interested in `modern art' and think that a huge painting of a piece of rubbish very artistic and eye catching!!!!!!! it is not for normal people who just wanna have a good time.I have nothing against sophisticated or demanding films .. but there should be a story or an idea behind it and not simply a stupid and boring sequences of silent pics without any other dimension..</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The ONLY thing that kept me interested in this film was Robin Williams' performance. Other than that, this is really ONE BAD MOVIE! Glitches galore, not to mention they arrested him for taking pictures and putting them up on his wall.....entered his home without a search warrant, and a host of other really stupid ideas. The last time I checked, taking pictures was not illegal and certainly no reason to call a "Threat management" team in. This movie was really lousy! I'm very surprised that Robin lent his talents to such a glitch filled script!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Err, yeah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was utter toss. To expand on that for those not familiar with the term, it was undoubtedly similar to a heterosexual male getting a sudden and unwanted splash of non identifiable male semen on his lower lip. Not pleasant at all. After seeing some of the reviews which use terms like ' genuinely scary' or 'Williams at his best' I can only conclude that we need more hospital beds. And really really good psychiatrists. To make the ultimate statement, I'd rather watch an N'Sync on tour documentary. Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before going to see this movie, I'd not heard a single review. I saw it and hated it! Since then, it seems like I've heard nothing else on the TV &amp; radio but mentions of this movie and how good it's supposed to be from presenters have been quoting the critics but have not seen it themselves. How could the great Robin Williams possibly be in a bad movie? Well, he's done it this time!The film was dull, very slow and certainly not scary in the slightest (as it is advertised to be). Not one character impressed me, nor did the photography (of which I always take an interest). I saw this movie with four other people who were all similarly unimpressed and I got the feeling that the mood in the movie theatre was generally shared as the credits rolled.I would not recommend this movie.</fullReview>
