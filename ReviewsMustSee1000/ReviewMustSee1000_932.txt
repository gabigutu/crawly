		<shortDescription>Low budget masterpiece!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan's first feature film wowed critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot on a micro budget of $6,000 this is a student film with real class. The film is shot in black and white, and features people who you assume are friends of Nolan's appearing in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are quite good. You could see Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw appearing in other projects but unfortunately they haven't since this was made 6 years ago.Nolan's thriller, much like Memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes around much like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It is a great twisting thriller but because the temporal order of the film is shifted around it makes it even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything starts to become clear were excellent.For a film of such a small budget and with no recognizable names at all, this is so good. It is superior to most that Hollywood studios offer and Nolan after three films (this, the superior Memento and the not quite as good but still excellent Insomnia) has cemented himself as the most exciting new talent of recent times. I can't wait for Batman.This film is short and sweet and certainly a great watch. It is very professional and the twists are fantastic and completely surprising. I also thought that the score from David Julyan was also excellent, very atmospheric and had a chilly quality to it. He has gone on to compose Nolan's other films. Overall I would recommend this, I intend to get all of Nolan's films. This is a low budget gem. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nolan's Clever Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The debut that plucked from obscurity one of the brighter stars of contemporary noir is an assured, if limited, stab at the con game and obsession. Filmed for zero money, Nolan couldn't have chosen a better subject than the drab and seamy underside of London to ply his trade, given the lack of funds. This short (67 min) is at its best in playing with the audience's and protagonist's expectations about who is scamming whom, though the initial set-up does ring some alarm bells in the credibility dept. The muddy cinematography (he often used natural lighting due to budget) can be mostly chalked up to noir stylization, though the limitations do show at times.One can easily see Nolan's style developing in this fledgling effort; many of the same themes of blurred identity and expectation smashing recur in MEMENTO and INSOMNIA. Not a masterpiece but good and certainly worth a look for modern noir and Nolan fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christopher Nolan is The One to...follow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this on DVD three times - Once the 'normal' way, once with the scenes in consecutive order (in this doozy of a film noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story intertwine), and once with the director's commentary running. Quite amazing. A bare-bones tale, told with more flair, energy and substance than most big-budget overblown features being released today. I think this is an even more accomplished film than the subsequent Memento, which turned me on to Nolan in the first place. Can't wait to see what he does with a bigger budget (and bigger box-office stars) in his next film, Insomnia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating suspense film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort, a year before he did "Memento," and this is almost as brilliant as that classic. He uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story, and it's a very clever one.Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about. One day, he follows this man, Cobb, who turns the tables and confronts Bill, who breaks down and confesses what he's up to. Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes. Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them. But there's an ulterior motive for Cobb nurturing this relationship, and it all ties in very smartly at the end. No, I won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and I'm beginning to think Christopher Nolan is a genius.If you like suspense films with surprise endings, this one is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Blueprint for Memento</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching Following and I thought it was great. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan on watching it again with the director's commentary and then again in chronological order.I rented this movie because of my fascination of Christopher Nolan's more recent movie Memento. Following has some similarities; this movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar.Shooting the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feel. The story and dialogue is really good. The performance of the actors is believable.Christopher Nolan made this movie on a really low budget. I look forward to his next release Insomnia, a big budget movie with my favourite actor Al Pacino.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great film. No gratuitous gimmicks like in most Hollywood films. Everything supported the suspense of the plot. B&amp;w gave it a basic, no-frills feel also. In short, it was visceral in its simplicity of cinematography and cast.Following serves as an interesting contrast to Memento. Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively. In that sense, both reminded me somewhat of "In the Company of Men," also highly recommendable. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow, given that the b&amp;w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, and so do those in color. I don't think that was true of Following, where scenes seemed to be shown at random. If you have the choice between VCR and DVD, I'd highly recommend DVD, since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order, not just in the scrambled (albeit ingenuous) order presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier, upon a second viewing, to piece the order together for yourself, if you want to.As another viewer noted, one of the best things about both this movie and Memento is that none of the cast were famous. They were characters, not big-name actors who brought in personas developed in other movies.Given certain similarities in the plots, I wonder if Memento is sort of a remake of Following, but intended to reach a bigger audience, like Edward Burns made She's the One in the mold of -- and with largely the same cast as -- The Brothers McMullan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No budget? No problem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Memento one might well wonder how Christopher Nolan pulled off something that audacious, that brilliant, in what was his major directorial debut. Watch Following, the no-budget thriller which was Nolan's actual directorial debut, and you begin to understand. With no money, with an amateur cast and doing pretty much everything (writing, shooting, directing) himself Nolan created a little masterpiece. Whatever "it" is that enables someone to make great movies Nolan clearly has it. And had it right from the beginning.Fans of Memento will see a lot of similarities, hints of what was to come, in Following. The most obvious parallel is the nonlinear time structure as the story here unfolds completely out of order. Whereas the story in Memento proceeded more or less in a straight line which just happened to be moving backwards here there is no line at all. Scenes are placed in a seemingly random order. We're all over the place. At the end, in the beginning, somewhere in the middle, back to the end again...it really could have been a jumbled mess. But Nolan gives us a little assistance in orienting ourselves with the shifting appearance of his main character. He has three distinct looks to him and once you figure that out you can figure out where you are in the story. But there are still enough twists and turns to make your head spin, to keep you guessing right up to the end.The less said about the plot the better. Best to let you try to piece the puzzle together for yourself. Much like Memento you really have to see it all the way through to fully appreciate the true genius of it, to understand how any missteps from Nolan along the way could have unraveled his whole story. When the movie concludes you can't help but be amazed that Nolan could pull this off essentially by himself. At least with Memento he had a little help. Here it's just Nolan and his small cast. There are really only three roles of any significance in the film, maybe four if you're being generous. But this little troupe and their first-time director combined to create something really special. The acting may at times seem a bit amateurish but that has to be expected from performers who are certainly not acting pros. And any little quibbles with the performances do not detract at all from the overall movie-watching experience. The actors do more than well enough to get by, well enough in fact that you're surprised there were not bigger acting roles for them somewhere down the line if they wanted them. That the performers have a great story to work with certainly helped their cause.Things do get a little convoluted in the end as Nolan's story takes its final turns. You worry that things may be getting away from him a little bit. But he manages to ultimately pull it all together. You may have to really think about it after things are through but it all makes sense when you run it back in your mind. And it's nice every now and again to have a movie that actually requires you to think isn't it? Christopher Nolan seems to specialize in movies like that. He just makes great movies. Here he did it with no money, all on his own, never having made a movie before. It takes a special talent to pull that off. And among his many talents Nolan also apparently possesses the ability to see into his own future. When you watch Following note the Batman logo on the main character's apartment door.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bill, Jeremy Theobald, is an inspiring writer who hasn't gotten anything published as of yet. Bill also has an odd and strange habit, he likes to follow people.Bill picks out some stranger in the streets diner or on the subway, metro, and follows them as if he were their shadow. Maybe Bill does this to help him in inspiring himself to write the great novel that he's been dreaming about or get an article of his get printed in a major magazine? Maybe it's because it fills Bill's lonely life with a purpose and even makes the person of his curiosity a face in the crowd with meaning and substance by his paying attention to him or her? Or maybe it gives Bill someone to look after and care about and be responsible for besides himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone : after you follow him or her to their home or place of work you stop. One day Bill follows Cobb, Alex Haw, home and instead of following his rule of stopping he still keeps following Cobb. Bill will soon realize how right he was with that rule he set for himself in following people and at the same time how wrong he was by breaking it. Amazingly good low-budget movie made by Christopher Noland in 1998 before he hit it big in Hollywood with his ground-breaking and original motion picture classic "Momento" some two years later that has already become a major cult movie. "Following" is actually a much better movie then "Momento" because it's a conventional and easy to follow story. Compared to "Momento's" which was at first confusing and then when you realize what the movie is telling you in it's backward storyline very complicated. Whats makes "Following" so much better is just by it being simple but at the same time brainy in it's affect on those who watch it. The movie is far more direct as well as devastating and you don't have to see it over and over to get just what it was trying to tell them like "Momento" did. "Following" is a story within a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as simply manipulated ending, if you watch the movie again and notice the clues, that you'll ever see.Made with an unbelievably small budget of $6,000.00, thats less then what most Hollywood movies budgets out for coffee-breaks, with a no-name cast in black and white and just over one hour, 71 minutes, long. Hollywood as well as the motion picture industry outside of Hollywood can learn a lot from Chris Noland in how someone with nothing more then talent and imagination can achieve what millions of dollars in most cases can't; make an intelligent and at the same time penetrating film with next to nothing in money and no big name stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stalking as a hobby; burglary as a thrill</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this intriguing noir thriller (looking like the Forties, but with a psychology befitting the Nineties), Director Christopher Nolan employs a number of techniques he would perfect in his internationally acclaimed Memento (2000), most notably scenes presented out of time sequence for effect, and a naive protagonist taken advantage of by others. The film opens with "Bill, the Innocent" (as I might dub him), played by Jeremy Theobald, trying to explain to someone, perhaps a social worker, perhaps even a police inspector (John Nolan), why he took up following people just for the fun of it. He doesn't just follow women, he points out. He's not a stalker, as such. He's just curious. He's an intriguing and sympathetic character, a Brit writer with a lot of time on his hands who seems something of a throwback to an earlier age with his clanking manual typewriter and the photo of a pursed-lips Marilyn Monroe on the wall of his shabby apartment. Things began to go wrong for him, he further explains, when he broke some of his "following rules" and got too close to his prey. What he doesn't know and what we don't know yet, is that his clumsy following technique has allowed him to unwittingly become the followed himself. Enter a juicy blonde (Lucy Russell) walking down some steps from her apartment. (This scene is out of sequence as far as chronological time goes, but psychologically speaking, her appearance signals his entanglement). Enter now a scheming, sophisticated psychopathic thrill-seeker named Cobb (Alex Haw) who entices Bill with his (apparent) practice of burglary just for the powerful feeling one gets from invading the sanctity of another's life. Although justification for the temporal inversions here is not as clearly established as in Memento, nonetheless the technique works well, and Nolan provides us with a clever ending that sneaks up on us and makes in a few seconds all that went before clear. Or mostly clear. You might want to rewind and view the first few minutes of the film, and then everything should be clarity. This low-budget, black and white, deliciously ironic little film (71 minutes) marked the auspicious debut of a film maker who has already made quite a name for himself, not only with the aforementioned Memento, but with Insomnia (2002). It will be interesting to see what Nolan does next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a small shot of British neo-noir bliss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan had his goals set on Following in a very narrow direction, and in that direction he pulled off something that reminded me of the kind of great little 'poverty-row' movies the likes of Ullmer directed back in the 40s. Only this time, he's able to implement touches of homage- things like black and white photography (a given due to the shoe-string budget but also essential to the dark crevices these characters inhabit) and casting of the actors (the John Doe lead, the slick male counterpart, and the beautiful-in-a-gritty way femme fatale)- while keeping it in the realm of the 90s underground indie where for several thousand dollars and specific choices in locations and music and such anything could be possible. That, and as well in the film-noir mood Nolan also puts together a cunning web of a plot, maybe even more so than Memento. Where the latter was a work of a psychology unfolding by way of a plot enriched by looking to the past inch by inch, here the non-linear structure serves the purpose of showing how far someone like Bill can go through as dark a path as Cobb, only in an environment where keeping on your toes is not for someone who's not really twisted and into the deeper mind games Cobb is.Of course, the whole act of following someone becomes the main thrust of the story, and going into it I wasn't even sure where it would lead, if it might be some kind of stream of consciousness ala Slacker where Nolan would lead his character along to one urban British person to another. But the establishment of the ties of Bill to Cobb are done in a quick and excellent way, as we see right when Cobb approaches Bill at the café to ask what he's doing following him tells almost all we need to know about both- that, and the first robbery he brings him along for. What seems to soon be a good score on the horizon is really all one big set-up by Cobb and his lady (just called 'The Blonde', maybe a too-obvious homage to noir, but why carp). But this is revealed in a way that actually truly had me guessing, as the manipulation of the narrative worked all the more to arouse questions not so much of why but of how. The density is brought out all the greater due to the actors understanding of their essential points as characters, with Alex Haw being brilliant as a true sociopath who can barely mask his 'deep' ideas about what it is to really take pleasure in a burglary, and Theobald with that demeanor of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does, but is more intelligent in that naive way that stands no chance in the dank environment such as this; Russell almost makes it too easy, even with a face that would send Ana Savage shaking her head.Meanwhile, Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman, keeping nothing in that doesn't add to ambiance and suspense, with the fade-in/fade-outs not too quick to leave a lasting impression, but enough to add to the 'this-could-lead-anywhere' logic of the script. He follows it in hand-held form as if he knows where his limitations lie, and yet is fantastic at keeping the essentials: close-ups when need be (one I loved is Russell's face in a small mirror), and a fairly simple techno track that never detracts. Sometimes, as mentioned, the line between seeing something in 'present-day' and seeing something that is as everlasting as a solid pulp story of low-level criminals with mind-games and moral ambiguity is always never totally clear, which for me is practically irresistible in its dark way. Simply put, this is one of the great calling cards I've seen from a filmmaker in recent years, and should hopefully be something that future fans of Nolan's other work can look forward to to discovering. Or even to those who think that noir has gone to the rapid-editing and big-gun-firing dogs of the mainstream (even in independent films) it's a bright little 71 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People seem to love this film. Reviews talk about its ingenious twists and turns. Well, maybe if I'd never seen "House Of Games" or even "The Usual Suspects" I might have been a bit more surprised. But as it was, I figured out who was pulling the wool over whose eyes pretty much from the word go. Perhaps I've just watched too many double-(or triple-)cross thrillers.This is basically apprentice work. Nolan wrote a film he could shoot for peanuts. In that respect, there's no denying he's done a great job. Despite the fact you can hear the camera running in most shots, he's put together a well directed film that manages to rise above its zero budget. But the script needs so much more work - it really could've done with a couple of more drafts. It falls into some very basic traps, like characters constantly "explaining" the plot to other characters for the benefit of the audience. The acting is okay, though funnily enough the best performance comes from someone who never had any intention of becoming a professional actor (he's now an architect).I thought all the twists and turns a bit tiresome. Very much hand-me-down Mamet. The actual idea of "following" complete strangers is quite intriguing. Too bad the movie doesn't bother to pursue it after the first few minutes.Still, Nolan designed this as a calling card movie. Like an eye-catching student movie, it got him noticed, and he's now working in Hollywood. And I wish him well. In fact, his Director's Commentary on the DVD of "Following" is much more interesting than the film itself.Watch it if you're a bit curious. But, really, it's no great shakes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan is a sick man. I say this with all due respect, after witnessing his almost-legendary first feature, "Following". This is not a normal film. Even if its narrative were presented in strict chronological order it would still not be normal. Its stark monochrome cinematography, weird music, bizarre performances (which range from the subtle to the wooden, often in the same sentence) and disturbingly warped plot all serve to instill a deep sense of unease in the hapless viewer. Why do we watch films like this? Certainly, part of the pleasure comes from seeing characters with whom we can identify and empathise, carrying out acts most of us will never do: burgling, beating, safe-cracking, you know the sort of thing. Oh, and breaking people's fingers with hammers. This is not a "nice" film. I would recommend it to anyone, with the warning that they may not enjoy it, but they should definitely see it. It's seedier than "Memento" (Nolan's recent cult classic) and cuts up the narrative for no real reason other than because it can. This has the mind-bending effect of, for example, showing someone's beaten-up face long before we find out who provided the beating. Why does Nolan do this? Because he can. Because it's cool. Because it all adds to the menace and unease and perverse pleasure of this strange, strange movie. The follower becomes the followed. Victim becomes assailant. Telling the truth lands you in prison. Lover becomes victim. Movie audience becomes deeply impressed. Christopher Nolan, you are a sick man, and I applaud you and wait with baited breath for your next excursion into mind-f*ck cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most good directors make few low budget or few normal budget movies or some T.V shows before they make a great influential movie because some afraid to take risks, some need to prosper and many don't have what it takes, Christopher Nolan wasn't one of those directors because he made a great movie right at the beginning with so little money and this movie proves that what I am saying is right. I've seen many good directors' first movies so I know what to expect from a good director's first movie and this movie exceeded my expectations. I knew that it is just 69 minutes long before I start seeing it but it is so well directed and written that during and after seeing it I find hard to believe that it's just 69 minutes long because it gave me a good 2 hours movie experience in just 69 minutes.The actors did a great job in it, they acted like they are good professional actors. Its a shame that Jeremy Theobald and the charming Alex Haw didn't go far after this movie and its a shame that Lucy Russell didn't go as far as she should be.Only geniuses like Christopher Nolan himself can make great extremely low budget movies like Following.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The structure and plot covers the weaknesses in characters and performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bill is unemployed but aspires to be a writer. Some time ago he took to randomly following people around, just to see where they go and how they act. He never did anything to the person or followed the same person twice, but he just did it. However on one occasion he breaks his own rules and follows a man more than once. The man is the strangely enigmatic Cobb, who twigs that Bill is following him and confronts him. It transpires that Cobb is a burglar but that he shares Bill's interest in people ? seeming to give his victims an "experience" as much as trying to make a living stealing from them. Bill joins Cobb on these emotional break-ins but soon he again breaks the rules and engineers a barroom meeting with a woman he has robbed, getting close to her and agreeing to do a job for her.Weather-wise, 2007 was one of the worst summers I think I have ever experienced in the UK; endless gloom, hardly a period of sun that lasted longer than an hour and none of the heat-waves that normally lift spirits generally. However one of the positives of the summer was that the BBC launched a season of British films from across many decades. Rather than wheel out the Bank Holiday classics though, the season screened many films that I had never even heard of and are rarely shown. This is not to say that all are that good but at least many of them were interesting. With Following I must admit that it took me a while to get into it because it does move slowly at first and the slightly disjointed timeline did break up the flow.As the film goes on this becomes less distracting and it started to get my interest. After this we hit the final third where the twists start to happen and suddenly the reasons for Nolan's delivery becomes clear in the way where, with some of his other films, everything falls into place all at once. Despite the slow start, the writing is strong and makes for a satisfying story that ends on a strong note. Nolan plays the script well and this part of his work is good. He doesn't do quite as well with the cast though and the performances are more a necessary evil rather than something where it feels like a lot of effort has been put in. Theobald was OK in the lead role but I wasn't convinced by him as he didn't really change across the film. Haw was much better; OK he plays like Rupert Everett but he at least fits his character and remains a slight enigma throughout. James is OK as indeed are many of the supporting cast but nobody is anything special or memorable. I can understand why things turned out this way but it does leave the film open to accusations of the reveal being the all.Overall though, this is an interesting and engaging film that starts slow and is hard to get into but falls into place the longer it goes on. The total delivery doesn't get even effort put into it across the board and the performances and characters are weaker than I would have liked but the plot and structure carries it, making it more than a curio from Nolan's career.</fullReview>

Seeing this predecessor disappoints, as does reading the comments that think these films are in any way similar.Oh, this has some time shuffling. But it has nothing whatever to do with the story, which is a relatively standard triplecross surprise. Here, it is an aid to the storytelling.

		<shortDescription>A Look Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan's reputation continues to grow, especially when we consider the success of his revamped attempt at DC's Batman. And if the calibre of your cast reflects your importance in cinema, then Nolan's experience with the likes of Pacino, Johansson and the continued use of Bale, stamps credit on his achievements. However, looking back at Nolan's budgeted and auteurish feature debut, Following, it might be difficult to understand how such an English filmmaker is enabled to make such huge leaps into the Hollywood mainstream. On first impressions - Nolan's deconstruction of the linear narrative is admirable and has since become a recurring technique for the director, most notably in his critically praised follow-up Memento. We are constantly on the edge of our seats with Following, with the film revealing future scenes that seem unclear until Nolan is ready to clarify them. Despite always knowing more than the protagonist, the audience are presented with a puzzle to solve, though naturally we reach the conclusion at the same time as our man (Jeremy Theobald) - the end. On a stripped down viewing, Following rarely veers from classical conventions - it begins with an introductory voice-over, a man enters a life of crime, the thriller-style music peaks where it ought to, there is a love interest/femme fatale (Lucy Russell), the same man receives his punishment, and the film is even shot in a contrasting black and white (no doubt a financial conclusion). Nolan also makes a predictable nod to Hitchcock with a string of voyeuristic shots as well as a perfect-crime plot with the character Cobb (Alex Haw). In conclusion, it's a clever way of presenting a somewhat dull plot and, given Nolan's growing success, a proved way of grabbing the attention of the mass audience. The film also provides an interesting social commentary with Cobb. His ability to read the robotic of the average person shows a disturbing side to comfortable living.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Been a fan of Christopher Nolan's and decided to check out some of his older work. My impression of this film was that it was pretty average and even though it is relatively short, some parts seem to drag on and/or be repetitive. Despite this, the film had an interesting story and was well written, the acting was also quite solid as was the movie as a whole. The ending was also quite good but by now I've come to expect that from Nolan. Several times during the film i caught myself thinking that certain parts were a little cheesy. Not something I would watch again and i do not strongly recommend it but it may be worth your time to see it once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If You Loved Memento You Will Love This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie after I saw Memento. I was very impressed with Memento so when I saw this at the local video store, I decided to check it out. I was equally impressed with this little film. I like black and white films so that was bonus, especially for a noir film. I thought the acting was very good by actors I have never noticed in other films. It is short and makes you think, which you can't state about many films. I loved to guess where a film is going and 90% of the time I know the general outline of the film and where it is going in the first 10 minutes. Nolan's films are never that easy to decipher at first glance. I won't spoil the film other than to state the protagonist of the film is not talking to his shrink after he has taken his stalking too far at the beginning of the film as I originally surmised. This movie is basically a rough draft for some of the ideas and themes Nolan would later explore and exploit in Memento. It works on its own and if Nolan had never done anything afterwards would still be a major talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent, flawed first feature.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At 70 minutes long, "Following" is Christopher Nolan's shortest feature though it certainly isn't his best. But you've got to hand it to him just for popping the fantastic story idea. "Following" juggles quite a lot of story ideas in its runtime of 70 minutes but somehow the puzzle still remains incomplete by the end of it.A young writer (Jeremy Theobald) follows people around London to find inspiration for the characters for his first novel. He follows specific people and never the same person again, just to see where they go and what they do but decides never to obsess about or get curious as to why they do what they do. Those are the rules he abides by. One day, he decides to follow a clean cut, smart-looking fellow who goes by the name Cobb (Alex Haw). Cobb quickly figures out that he is being followed and confronts the young writer. Cobb introduces himself as a thief, who burgles the houses of people he finds interesting and asks the young writer to accompany him on his burglaries. The young writer becomes infatuated with a young woman (Lucy Russell) whose house he burgles along with Cobb and then things start to go wrong for him.With a budget so low, a film with a story as gutsy as this deserves high praise. To be honest, "Following" starts off spectacularly, skimming the streets of London with inspiring cleverness that makes the city look as tempting as it makes it look dangerous, and Nolan slowly builds the tense atmosphere that the narrative requires. The writing in the first few sequences is outstanding, and Nolan delves into the story as soon as the film begins. The two lead characters, the young man and Cobb, are meticulously written so that the viewer gets a useful insight of what they are thinking. And that's one very important aspect of the film : You need to guess what the characters are thinking even though they don't voice it out loud. And those are pretty much all the positives I have to say about the film.Somewhere in the midst of the narrative, the film cripples. And that's very unfortunate because Nolan's got some great ideas up his sleeve, and he makes a big flaw of letting one on too soon. After that, the film turns into a drama instead of a mystery for the plot continues to unfold in a frustratingly predictable manner. What's left to enjoy is some kind of twist that unfurls in the last sequence, managing a graceful conclusion to a decent feature. But the plot does not attempt to avert what's about to happen and the conclusion does not differ much from the one you might've guessed sometime during the film.Of the performances, Theobald and Haw are convincing. Haw, who plays the cunning Cobb, certainly looks the part and delivers well. The same goes for Theobald. Russell, on the other hand, lacks the urgency that her character was required to throw up in a traumatic situation. Playing the role of a seductress, she comes off as wooden instead of charming, thus remains totally unconvincing in her performance. "Following" has compelling wit and diabolical cleverness stashed up somewhere in its stupendously structured plot. The non-linear narrative is slightly soporific though the style and writing are exemplary. It is a film that won't disappoint you though when the plot concerns a mystery, I expect it to keep me guessing till the very end. Sadly, "Following" fails there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A precursor....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This British thriller is a complete journey at a brief 69 minutes, with no skimping on substance, and no wasted time. A black-and-white noir, Christopher Nolan's "Following" is a no-budget picture that feels seamless and utilizes elements of deception and shifting time frames. Jeremy Theobald (Bill) likes to pick strangers out of a crowd and follow them around the streets of London, learning what he can about the details of their lives. Bill's voyeurism becomes dangerous when he starts tailing a thief. Mr. Cobb (Alex Haw), a smooth-talking cat-burglar who also likes to peek inside people's lives, through his m.o. leans to breaking and entering."Following" has an interesting narrative strategy. It leaps forward into the future and doubles back to show the past. It's a strategy that one would not expect to find in such a low-budget film. It means that the director, who didn't have money to shoot every little thing he could think of, had to conceive of the strategy and trust that it would work once he put the film together. There are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo, where loose ends begin to come together, and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine through.Nolan is involved in every stage of production, from writing to shooting, producing and directing. Brief, but intelligent--and his precursor to "Momento"--gives us just a sampling of things to come, and he has yet to misfire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Following (1998)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A noir-esque tale with abrupt leaps in chronology. In other words, a warm-up for MEMENTO. The later film succeeds both because of and despite its gimmick. The earlier film (Nolan's first feature) ultimately feels nothing but gimmick. The theme of invading other people's lives is shrugged off after a few weak Tyler Durden-isms and never explored in depth. The performances are mediocre. The photography and other technical aspects show promise, but it's not especially impressive craftsmanship. It all just seems to revolve around the cleverness of the script, and I found the gotcha twists a bit tedious. Not bad as a first effort, but not a very fulfilling or even entertaining experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Following random people out of curiosity can get you into some tight spots.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan wrote and directed this small, black and white film which came out just two years before his acclaimed "Memento." I found it interesting to compare the two, as they both use a non-linear story-telling method. Memento famously started at the end and the film tells the story backwards. "Following" isn't quite like that, but uses some of the same editing techniques.For example, after we are introduced to the main characters and the basic premise of the story, we see a scene where the main protagonist looks different, has bruises, is on the ground, and a latex glove is partially out of his mouth. This shot is a jolt because nothing we had seen to that point would lead to that. But then later scenes build up to it an we have our explanation. It is actually a very useful editing technique, it works very well.The man in this story is an aspiring author but in reality an unemployed young man living in a seedy apartment and with lots of time on his hands. He is a curious sort of guy and one day decides to follow someone, chosen relatively randomly, just to see where they go, what they do, just a glimpse into their lives. He sets up his own rules, and one of them is never to follow the same person more than once.But he breaks his own rule and therein generates the drama of the story. He follows a man who sits next to him at a café and calls him on it. The man takes him into his confidence and soon they are robbing residences together, ostensibly for sport.But all is not as it seems and the man eventually gets the very short end of the stick, so to speak. A somewhat interesting movie.SPOILERS: The man he follows and meets weaves an elaborate plan, involving a woman, to set him up, have him steal some money, then have him exposed to the police. He gets blamed for the theft and a murder, and the man he followed disappears.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Voyeuristic Courisoity Darkness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Following" by Christopher Nolan is a stark black and white film that seeks to create a claustrophobic 40's type film noir atmosphere?it certainly succeeds if the viewer has patience. "The young man", as the credits call the protagonist of the film, is a would-be writer who is between jobs living close to the bone ? his name is Bill. Bill, a luckless loaner, perhaps, indulges subdued voyeuristic desires as he believes following certain subjects will help him find a muse for something, anything, to provide subject matter for writing. He is undisciplined and even the loosest of ground rules he believes suitable, such as never following the same subject more than once, he breaks when he follows the wrong person who notices and confronts him. Unknown to Bill he is now blindly following without any thought to how he may be falling into a trap himself. An elaborate double-cross that eventually turns into a triple-cross ensues. As I mentioned earlier to get to a pay-off where it all gels as a quite excellent example of neo-film-noir requires some dedication on the viewers part. The film moves slowly and with somewhat dull action until the bombshell of an ending. The ending is what it's all about, and, though, you can see it coming it still surprises in the form of a smart triple-cross."Following" taken as a low-budget crime movie shows economical brilliance. We now know Christopher Nolan is quite a "jugernaught" of a director, but the elements are on display here in a bleak stripped-down form. This film is actually quite amazing for a first timer and if you like classic film-noir this late 90's movie is for you, recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupendous modern noir, the brilliant debut film of Christopher Nolan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly brilliant film, and all the more remarkable for being the first film of director Christopher Nolan (director of MEMENTO and INSOMNIA), made on a tiny budget. It is a triumph of genius over money, as there was almost no money but plenty of genius sploshing around all over the place. Everybody is good, every aspect is good. The film totally 'clicked'. The lead actors are perfectly cast and are superb in their roles. Jeremy Theobald (any relation to Theobald's Road in London?) plays a hangdog would-be writer who lives alone in his leather jacket, lean and unshaven, and with an old manual typewriter, on which he types things occasionally. He munches on the odd bit of food from time to time like a stray dog who has come across a bone in the street, and is not someone who has ever acted on the suggestion: 'Get a life!' He develops a strange habit of following strangers in the street 'just to see where they are going' and understand more about people. He generally stops the pursuit when they enter their homes, and then he goes off and finds another stranger and never follows anyone twice. Sounds harmless, but like all habits, it develops tentacles. What he does not realize is that one peculiar man whom he follows, played with brilliant and sinister force by Alex Haw, is cannier than he could imagine. Haw has noticed that he is being followed and ends up following Theobald, who is unaware that the tables have been turned on him. This has catastrophic consequences, which are slow to dawn upon Theobald. Haw is involved in the criminal world and decides to set up Theobald and frame him. In this, he is complicit with a mysterious woman played by Lucy Russell with a droll and languid manner which is just right for the part. The ultimate payoff of this film is the fantastically bizarre twists of plot which keep emerging from the sinuous coils of this writhing serpent of a story. The script is also by Christopher Nolan, and is thoroughly brilliant. In addition, Nolan also did the spectacular cinematography and the inspired editing. That is what I mean by lots of genius sploshing around. How can a guy that clever live with himself? (Nolan and Theobald were also co-producers with Emma Thomas.) Is there anything Christopher Nolan cannot do? Scratch his own back in the bath? I bet he can do that too. One thing which astonishes me about this film is that the talented Alex Haw, who made his film debut in it, seems never to have appeared in another film. Did he fall through a hole in the earth? I would have expected him to have been in a dozen other movies by this time. This was also Lucy Russell's film debut (as 'The Blonde'), but she has since worked non-stop in films and television. So why not Alex Haw? For those who do not know, by the way, the word 'haw' is the name of the fruit of the hawthorn tree, also known as the May Tree. Maybe Haw will break forth into blossom again next May, along with all his namesakes in the hedgerows. This superlative film has all the excellent qualities of the best of the old-time Hollywood film noir pictures, even though it was made in London with wholly British people, including Nolan himself. But then Alfred Hitchcock was British, let us not forget. It also has a kind of Wim Wenders 'quality feel' about it, as if the writer-director were a deep thinker, and the wanderings through the streets of the 'follower' are a bit random, like a road movie, but a road movie that all takes place in one city. I think Nolan must have been trying to portray the world of quantum physics on the screen, with people as his electrons and positrons. Watching this eerie film is like staring at a moving version of one of those photos from a Wilson Cloud Chamber showing all of the tracks of the invisible atomic particles. Watch them jump and swirl! Watch them suffer! Watch them kill! Watch them be killed! But above all, watch them be hopelessly trapped and entangled in a larger scheme which they do not understand! Flies enter webs, and so sometimes do people who unwisely try 'following'. The ending cannot be revealed, but is even more extraordinary than the rest of the story, so that everything we thought we knew and had figured out now takes on another and even more sinister shape entirely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw "Following." It was the first movie that Christopher Nolan (director of Memento) did. It's a black and white British film noir. Only 69 minutes, but VERY good. If you like movies with twists, this is it, folks. Similar to Momento, but not the same. It tells its story out of chronological sequence. It, however, does not tell it backward like Momento. It skips around, flashing forward then falling back. It takes a wee bit to get used to, but it well worth it.If you're a David Mamet fan, by the end of the movie, you just may just be reminded of one of his films -- "The Spanish Prisoner."Trust me, go out and rent this!Oh yes, if you rent the DVD as opposed to the video, a special feature allows you to watch the movie chronologically.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nolan's foundation into solid film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Following' describes the tale of an out-of-work writer who seeks inspiration from the people he follows on a daily basis. He continuously follows random people, until he is followed by someone else, a burglar, whom he learns the profession from and becomes very intrigued.The movie has it's film-noir setting already deep-fried into the screen, with extra elements to boot. This, being Nolan's first piece of professional work, had his ideas written all over it. If you had seen his other movies (Memento and Insomnia), you would know that he follows along the same story lines as the others (and quite well, I might add). 'Following,' although a slightly chilling tale if you're the type who always looks behind them every 5-10 seconds whilst walking down a busy downtown street, gives you the idea of what it would be like to dig into someone else's life. Even though the main character follows a person to wherever they may go, he does not continuously follow them around the city afterwards. The only problem is that the main character, credited as "Bill," falls deeply and dangerously into one's secret profession.Overall, 'Following' uses film-noir, minute suspense, and a twist-at-the-end plot to give you an idea of what might happen if you pass the red line that defines your profession.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Retrospect,not much of a Following</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because style should not trump substance,especially when the content is so overwhelmingly dry.This movie is basically an unemotional display of lead character's need to fill in the void of his meaningless life {struggling writer,of sorts}by spending time on streets following other's for the fun of it.But we never get that opportunity,instead he quickly gets caught up in one person's world and is taken in to small time burgulary,by way of first person who caught him peeping.I was hoping for a voyeuristic journey like "Peeping Tom" the 1960's gem that portrayed an indepth character study on that social disorder with emotion and great photography.But instead was put on hold for very unemotional and ordinary display of character analysis.Basically the scenes were just rehashed attempts,one after another ,mimacking and cloned together lacking any real difference or insights as to importance of lead character.I knew little more about his personality and inner self ,halfway thru tham i did in beginning.And not too much more towards the end.A screen writer could put this together and add or delete scenes with ease as to the undefined quality of the characters and their dispirited nature.This movie is tailor-made for GenX'ers,who grew up on similac,instead of real thing and aren't discerning enough to comprehend style vs. substance.These same bottle-fed babies are also beholden to "Memmento" for same reason,Oh,Boy that's cool,to have surprise ending and shoot in retrospect.I guess when a movie lacks any real surprises during beginning and middle,it needs an uplift for ending.Virtually nothing about this movie stands out and grabs one.It lacks any qualified sounds,the camera work is one-dimentional and good overall use of shadows but not enough too make up for shallow cinematography.Low budget all around.The street scenes could have been more dynamic {it looked as if shot in same neighborhood block throughout}.I am increasingly becoming dismayed at latest Avante Garde movement within film community to herald films such as Memento and this one as great leaps forward in filmdom.That is a great lie and urban myth.Any film aficionado worth his salt knows by now what stands the test of time and what will not,crystal ball or no.I personally don't need this film or Memento to explain the merits of good drama,thriller or Noir to satisfy by dilettante interpretation of such.Gen X'ers have managed to screw up music and are now about to do such with film.But not in my world.I calls em as I see's em.Good is good,great as such and lackluster is much downgraded good for certain film morons bent on surprises in the theatre box.With that cracker jack mentality,hopefully things can only get better and go upward.But I wouldn't bank on anytime soon.This lackluster film that is neither too dramatic,urban sprawled or noirish enough to call anything other than ordinary attempt to capitalize on an uninitiated audience's attention span for crafty and well choreographed thrillers that develop character and scene with plausible deniability.Any other explanation for success of flat,one note harmony is beyond my understanding. 2 out of 5 star or 4/10 for very ordinary and unsung hero being sung over,regardless.Dig Daddio's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Curious but Shallow Little Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following was a nifty, little noir-ish film. Nothing more, nothing less. The acting was pleasantly good across the board. The lack of big name actors/actresses is icing on the cake; no alter egos from other films are unintentionally commingled. The characters are truly the characters. The film is shot in black and white. Combined with the photography, the film clearly suggests a noir influence. While this is somewhat suiting for the circumstances of the main character, it leaves the cinematography feeling rather uncreative. (Nolan actually admitted to using black and white initially because of his limited equipment. He worked with it, and headed in a noir direction for an unconfused look. Due to the circumstances, I won't hold it against him.)Unfortunately, this movie falls short in the writing. This is a Nolan film and is pieced together in Nolan's trademark style: simultaneously presented sequences of a central plot that differ with respect to time and converge at some point in the movie. Nolan used the same kind of video editing in Memento, but in a way that's much more clear cut and purposeful. Following is no more than the presentation of a brilliant concept, not yet made to work. Yes, Following was very low budget. Yes, it's Nolan's first real movie. You'll want to hold back on the harsh criticism you'd give movies of a higher budget or more experienced director, but frankly; these factors don't really play into the film's conspicuous flaws. The directing was excellent, but the story (after it's untangled) is nothing more than just that: a story.See this film if you're a die-hard Nolan fan, it's nothing special otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christopher Nolan's Best Work So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No kidding. I'm from 2014 and so far this has been Christopher Nolan's best work. So yes, better than TDK, Memento or Inception.The story was excellent. Some might find it similar to Fight Club. Initially it's about a young writer who follows stranger for his writing things. Then he met this devil may care burglar, who took the young writer under his wing. First I thought I'm learning some sort of life lessons. Then Christopher Nolan fooled me several times. In the end it's just a plain crime thriller.The unknown actors' performances were way above a lot of today's so called big names. And when you look at the Following's title page in IMDb, you'll notice that the two main actors Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw don't have any profile pictures. Such a shame.I my opinion the low budget helped the film to be better. The black and white fits perfectly with the everything else. Nolan didn't take any advantage of London, he could have shot the film anywhere in the world and it would work. David Julyan did usual excellency with the score to describe the environment.Lastly I'd rather watch more movies like this than Oscar winners or Box Office successes.</fullReview>

These sorts of jumps in the narrative arc of the character occur frequently throughout the film. Begging one to ask how did these future events occur and why?

		<shortDescription>Brilliant directorial debut by Nolan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan's directorial debut is a memorable one. The film was very well received and help land contracts for making 'Memento' and quite rightfully so. Following is an exquisite example of how films should be made. No fancy effects or blood-dripping gore...just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages to captivate us once again with his writing. The actors, all unknowns to me and I suppose most people, did a good job bringing the characters to live. They were all believable and that's all they need to be. The film is confusing because it plays with chronology a lot but it's very rewarding in the end. The film's a little short to be a full-length feature but any additional length would've ruined the style of the movie and the brilliance of the writing would've been diminished. Though short, the film has every aspect that makes a film attractive (IMO): an intriguing beginning, an exciting middle and a surprising end. I dare say Following is almost as good as Memento, his best film by far. The scrambled chronology is equally masterful used in both films, the amazing plot twists are present and the acting is very good.This film was made with a mere $6000 but the quality is much higher than most( almost all) million dollar box-office hits. The use of b&amp;w may be a hard pill to swallow for the big audience, following is primarily Nolan showing off his skills to the studio bosses :-). And what skills they are...rarely have I enjoyed writing so much as in 'Following'. Even Pi doesn't even come close IMO, though it's also very good.This is a film surely not to be missed by any self-respecting movie-lover. If you liked Memento, 'Following' is definitely for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An untidy man, known as Bill, lives in a small dreary flat, with a poster of Marilyn Monroe on the wall, and his typewriter for company. Only the man can't think of anything to write. He wanders around the streets following people, just to see where they go. Maybe this will give him some inspiration to write. He begins to follow a well dressed man holding a bag. He follows him for a few days. While in a cafe, the well dressed man sits down at a table on the opposite side of Bill, and inquires why Bill is following him. The well dressed man says his name is Cobb. Cobb then surprisingly informs Bill that he is a burglar, and even starts to take Bill with him into houses to steal things; although Cobb insists he doesn't go into other people's homes to just steal. He says he likes to let people know he has been there, and interrupted the things they take for granted. He puts knickers from another burglary into a man's trousers, for example.The film is told in flashbacks at times too. The director used this technique in greater abundance in his recent feature Memento. Bill eventually decides to cut his hair and dress in a suit, on the advice of Cobb. He meets a Blonde lady in a club, who used to date the owner, a bald man, who is very dangerous, she says. We see a scene where a hammer is used by the bald man's hence men on a man's fingers in the Blonde lady's flat. These are some of the many pieces of the puzzle that the director shows us, and they will all fit into place when we arrive at the surprising conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Budget film-making at it's absolute finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even with only 6,000 bucks and a cast of part-time actors, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is in my opinion, the next great and our first taste of Nolan doesn't contradict that.None of the problems that constantly plaque and discredit the low budget independent picture haunt Nolan and crew. Our actors are inexperienced and young but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Following is Nolan's best screenplay because it is the one he had the most control over. It's a beautifully imagined film. It takes us into a world where we don't feel limited by the constraints of budget. The dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligent.Nolan's trademark method of telling the story out of continuity is applied for the first time here and here it is done in a way that throws the story full out at you. With Memento and The Prestige you have to think a bit to truly get a complete grasp on the genius but Nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype film. We can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is both creative and engaging. I am Glad that Nolan has had so much success with it because his films become more than what they could be with this method. The pay offs in the Prestige and Memento would not have been thrilling at all if the movie was told in a conventional format. This idea has been done with moderate success before but Nolan has truly made it his own.The script here is Nolan's finest. I had some doubts about his writing abilities, I all ways imagined that his brother Jonathon was the writing talent but he proves me wrong with Following. It is a thought provoking story which makes interesting observations of people and how they function. Cobb's assessments about burglarizing and how it can lead you to discover what makes people tick actually sounds plausible.My only real complaint is the camera work gets shaky at times but it doesn't take away anything from the story or the acting.Following is the first film of the man who will personify 21st century film-making at it's finest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CAUTION! There's kind of a spoiler in here. I don't think it'll ruin the movie, but if you want to really watch the film with no expectations, I would stop reading now I don't want to take too long here, as most of the other comments have documented the strengths of this film quite well (and it does have many strengths). Overall, I found this to be a solid, interesting movie, but my major complaint is that the entire plot seemed way too silly. I don't see any reason why Cobb would create such an elaborate plan to do what he did. It seemed to me that Nolan just set up this story as a way to show off his directorial/writing talents rather than to really tell a story. This wasn't nearly as interesting or emotionally-appealing as Memento. I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Proof that quality will win the day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the unparalleled filmmaking that the Nolan's have shown us so far this century, I was quite eager to go back and watch this, their first film. This is something that every aspiring filmmaker, particularly writers, should see. A budget that could have been funded by a few years worth of saved tips produced an engaging and interesting 70 minute film that surpasses the quality of some films with budgets exponentially bigger than its own. We have three actors that nobody has ever heard of, a shaky camera, and no marketing whatsoever, but the idea and the quality of work put into the film turn out a great product. Certainly it could have done with some better technical execution, but the story is there and 10 years later, the Nolan's are producing some of the biggest and best movies of all time.It's a very interesting narrative. You can tell pretty quickly that it bounces around, but it's not too hard to follow. I didn't get everything down, and don't remember exactly how the story all works, but most of it made sense at end. The black and white was definitely the right choice. It gave it a slightly dull atmosphere as grayscale tends to, but this was a small price to pay for the serious and gritty feel that came with it. Although color would have been nicer to look at, it would have thrown off the mood. The same goes for the strident music score. It sounds kind of ugly, but it's spot on for the mood. We get some pretty good acting as well. The Blonde gets easily the worst performance, but it's better than some of what we get from Hollywood actresses. Cobb and Bill's actors are both great. Alex Haw in particular is very natural as Cobb. The performances aren't outstanding, but they are impressive.Bill makes for a decent protagonist. We can see that he's smart, but Cobb is much smarter. What's more, Cobb is confident and doesn't have any hesitation, which gives him a distinct edge over Bill, whose intelligence is more of a strong curiosity. This curiosity is what drives the story and eventually leads to Bill's disaster. Once he realizes that the entire situation is much bigger than he understands, he panics. It's actually rather sad how helpless he is. It's kind of fun to think about whether the Cobb here is the same Cobb played by DiCaprio in Inception, but if they are then there must have been a lot that went on to change him from mean-spirited crimes to constructive ones in the twelve year hiatus.I think this is still on Netflix, so watch it now while you can. If not, it's free to watch on YouTube. If you like thrillers, particularly interesting ones, it should satisfy, though it's no Silence of the Lambs. It's a movie that's good to watch alone in one night. It's quite short, but feels longer than it is. You might get bored at times, but I would encourage you to watch the whole thing. Overall Rating: 8.4/10.</fullReview>

A well deserved ten rating and another fine example of the perfect Neo Noir. Even Hitchcock would be impressed. A struggling writer becomes obsessed with the obvious which leads him toward a dark path. Will the young man be able to break free from following before it is too late? Or Will his obsession becoming a twisted game of cat and mouse? Definitely check this gem out, especially if you can resist the spoiler reviews.

		<shortDescription>Remarkable indie cult film rife with Nolan DNA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see, in his first production, exactly why Christopher Nolan is one of the best modern directors. Like with what we would eventually see in Memento, this is an out-of-order complex confusing psychological thriller with plot twists galore. Stylized in black-and-white and stripped of 90's technology, it could pass for an old school noir-film.While not as intricate and lavish as his later films, Nolan does a tremendous amount of good with practically no budget and a cast of competent actors. The fact the cast plays their roles like regular people instead of the Hollywood cliché acting we'd expect from a drama is sort of refreshing. At 70 minutes, it's short but definitely not short-changed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeremy Theobald joins Alex Haw in burglaries and pursues Lucy Russell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Following" (1998) is a good neo-noir. Theobald plays a young man without a strong sense of stability, purpose or drive. He's playing at being a writer, trying to get into it, but not yet tapping into whatever creative potential he has. He and the film convey a strong feeling of being uprooted, of not yet having found himself, of searching, of being susceptible to outside influences. Acting on impulse or the intuition that he can progress if he follows people around and sees what sorts of characters that people are, he follows Alex Haw. Haw turns out to be a burglar. When Haw discovers that Theobald is following him, he takes him under his wing.The film looks good in black and white and pursues a noir plot with several layers, making it interesting. The film deliberately mixes up the time sequence of events, and this contributes to the feeling of basic instability. And it gives a feeling of really not knowing what might occur next to someone (here, Theobald) because the differences in his appearance and status take leaps that are, for the moment, unexplained. The film feels like something out of 60s London.At times the story has too much talking, which I take to be a common characteristic of British cinema. The film has fewer noir visual devices or aspects than one might expect. By way of comparison, early Kubrick films like "Killer's Kiss" (1955) contain more. Many of the setups here are conventional. Kubrick also fractionated time, as in "The Killing" (1956) but with a narrative reason. "Following" relies much more heavily on re-ordering time as a means of suspense or at least holding viewer interest, as opposed to generating suspense by other means and linear story-telling. The tradeoff is that it creates some confusion and the constant thinking about what's going on undermines suspense and emotional involvement.I thought that Alex Haw did a great job with his character, and that Theobald suitably conveyed his character's lack of place in the world and sense of self. Lucy Russell did a nice job as a kind of moll, but her part and character were not fully fleshed out.Overall, this is a good neo-noir but not exceptional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The jobless protagonist recounts his story to an older man. He has been Shadowing or Following random strangers. One of his biggest rule is never follow the same person twice. He breaks that rule causing him his problem. Cobb confronts him for following him thinking initially he's a cop. Cobb is a burglar and soon, he pulls him into his voyeuristic world. They break into The Blonde's apartment and he becomes fascinated with her. He chats her up at her possessive boyfriend's bar. She tells him that her gangster boyfriend is blackmailing her with incriminating photos and he agrees to break into his safe to retrieve the photos. Unbeknownst to him, Cobb and The Blonde actually know each other.This is Christopher Nolan's low budget black-and-white indie. It has an interesting premise of a guy who follows people around. It intrigued me and so does Cobb. He's a weird magnetic character. Nolan is also playing with flash-forwards which actually distracts from the story. He figures out how to separate the timelines in Memento with color and black-and-white. In this movie, it confuses matters and disrupts the flow. The ending has a few convenient unlikely turns to make Cobb's scheme work. The movie starts off very well but gets a bit problematic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Small But Great Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an interesting little movie. This was feature debut of now famous director Christopher Nolan, and was made on the budget of only six thousand dollars. So as you can imagine, this was a small movie, but I feel it is genuinely impressive what they made with so little of a budget.Like most Nolan films, Following has a very interesting and tight story. The story has many signature Nolan moments where a scene will cut in between two or three different times and places, and its up to the viewer to try to bring together in the end. The story isn't as complicated as Memento or Inception but it still has some complexity to it.Another thing is that the acting is surprisingly great, for a cast that was just Nolan's friends at the time. The cinematography was also surprisingly good and the fact that there budget was so low makes some shots pretty impressive. My only gripe is that there are some shots that are somewhat amateur, but they are few and far between.In the long run, Following is an impressive first film and has many aspects of it you will probably notice in later Nolan films. It isn't anything mind blowing, but is a well made and interesting neo-noirFinal Score: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I followed anybody. I just wanted to see where they went and what they did"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Following is a 1998 film directed by Christopher Nolan starring Jeremy Theobald, Alex Haw, and Lucy Russell. It's about a writer (played by Jeremy Theobald) who after getting a case of writer's block starts stalking people to base characters off of them. As he says himself at the start of the film, "It wasn't a sex thing. I followed anybody. I just wanted to see where they went and what they did". After following a couple of people, he meets a thief named Cobb (played by Alex Haw) and they start robbing people's homes together. The film does a great job at making you feel uncomfortable. Especially the robberies, you feel like you are exploring a place you aren't supposed to be in. There are also scenes where the camera follows people from on top of a roof or across the street. It really makes you feel like a stalker.As I said before, the robberies make you feel a sense of adrenaline. The characters can get caught at any moment and it really keeps you on the edge of your seat. But, after a couple of times it does start to get a bit stale. You lose that suspense and it becomes just two guys looking through an apartment. It's like when you go on a roller coaster, after the first drop nothing else is scary anymore. But, I did like how Jeremy never really robs the apartments for money but to learn more about others. I'm glad they didn't pull a Breaking Bad and make him slowly become addicted to robbing for the rush. Instead, the robbing is only fueling his addiction of stalking, not replacing it. I also like how they use Jeremy as a looking glass for us, a bit like Dredd. I thought that the film being in black and white was kinda pointless. I understand that it's a noir film but unlike Sin City, it feels unnecessary. It doesn't make the movie worse but it doesn't need to be there. I like black and white as much as the next guy; I just thought it was worth mentioning.Lucy's character is also not very interesting and just feels like she has no personality sometimes. Also, the movie did move a bit slowly sometimes but quickly picked itself back up again before it became too boring.7.5/10 -- Good. If after reading this review, the movie sounds interesting to you. Watch it and you will probably really enjoy it. Otherwise, unless it's showing on TV or something you aren't missing out on much by not watching it.Go to http://bryansfilmreviews.blogspot.com/ for more reviews</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Low Budget Thriller!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following is the directorial debut of Christopher Nolan. As it was made on almost no budget with unprofessional actors, I was not expecting much. The protagonist is a young writer who has resorted to stalking people that he finds interesting so as to pass his time. On one particular day, the guy that he was stalking confronted him and questioned the reason for why he was stalking. Both of them begin to break into other people's home and just try to guess the type of people that lived there.Despite the lack of professional actors, it never feels as if the acting is poor due to the well rehearsed scenes. According to Nolan, all of them had rehearsed every scene so well that the majority of the movie had scenes which were filmed in the first or second take.To make a movie without any distributor is courageous and a bit of a gamble. However, Nolan took the risk and today he is among the most well known directors in the world. Do not go into this movie for viewing a technical masterpiece because it isn't. However, if you are looking for a compelling story with a stellar ending, this movie is right for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nolan Begins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film. Just calm, simple, strong filmmaking.Truth is that not many directors can make such a good movie with such a small budget. The story is original. The deeper you go in the movie, the more you start to recognize Nolans' signature. And while it may not be that spectacular, it is engaging and if you invest in it, you'll win. It surely captures the spirit of a less noisy, silent noir-film, than the great set-pieces of blockbusters. It's a confident and self-realized script executed really well.I guess that finding and watching this movie alone is a proof that you are probably a Nolan fan, so I trust that you'll enjoy it. But the man who is behind this picture is today one of the finest directors and screenwriters, so even if you are not a fan of these types of films, you have a reason to give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all in the ending...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filmed all in black and white, maintaining a constant psychological thrill throughout the movie although it is slow paced, and above average performances from unknown actors, I thought that Nolan was trying to distinct his debut and establish himself already as one of the very the unique directors of his time.The movie starts off brilliantly with a very intriguing premise which I have to admit does not continue much long. It then gets very slow and I hoped that the ending would save the day, and I thought it did.This movie hugely depends on the mood that you see it with. If you want to like it then you will find the plot, although a bit outstretched, quite believable and you will be able to find a justification for every improbable event that happens.However, if you do not want to like it you will find yourself fixating on every detail and saying "But that can never actually happen". Thankfully, I belong to the first category and I really liked the movie.All in all, I believe it should be seen and even if you do not like it, at least you would appreciate seeing something different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting precursor to Nolan's other films, stylistic and intelligent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nolan's movies seem to often involve two rival men playing cat and mouse with each-other (most obviously The Prestige but also the Batman films and Insomnia, the rest not as literally but still thematically). It becomes ambiguous as to who is chasing who. They push each-other to extremes and end up going in circles, forget what they cared about so much, wonder where their morals have gone. They eventually realise they're kind of just chasing themselves. What have they become? How did they end up in this mess? There are always twists and lies. They often end up being quite self-destructive and are left wondering how they got this way. The characters reflect back on what's happened and see things in a whole different light. Ultimately we find where the two men differ, some small indestructible principle they each carry with them.His movies always probe the mind, human nature. They're about trust, memories, manipulation, guilt and anger, the way our decisions affect us over time, the way we lie to ourselves and try to keep our belief system intact. He questions why we do things, why we feel so certain about ourselves and then keeps showing us things that make it clear how little we really know. It's like with magic, we only get tricked because of our own incorrect assumptions and we make them all the time, automatically. Is that really a normal pack of cards? Has he swapped it at any stage? Is this person really my friend? Can I believe anything they say?There are interesting similarities to Memento, particularly the fact that the story has a non-linear timeline (a technique made famous in Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs and The Usual Suspects). It's also in black and white and the main character is a bit neurotic and we hear his inner monologue. There are physical changes that make it clear where we are in time although following it all (accidental pun) can be tricky. And it's presented in a logical order that increases the tension as we gradually learn more about who did what and why.It's short but engaging and satisfying nevertheless. For $6000, it's pretty impressive. The acting is fine but could be better. The characters only focus on each-other, like they know they're in a movie. You don't sense as much of an outside world - there's not much reference to family or friends or the past. Maybe that's deliberate but it feels slightly limiting and unrealistic.Cobb in Inception is probably named after the character identically named here. They are both thieves and invade people's privacy, possibly with indirectly benevolent intentions. They are analytical, for them the human mind is a machine with curious habits on which they are experts.By the end, we can make multiple interpretations, it's left quite open. If you have no evidence of something, did it really exist? It also shows the danger of curiosity. We think we have control but we can easily get addicted. We're immediately vulnerable if we're fascinated by something. It can be used against us. Like a mouse going for cheese not realising what awaits him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.Following was Christopher Nolan's first feature as a director and man could you start off on a better foot? It's a quick 70 minute neo-noir drama thriller that, like every other Nolan film, will keep you on the edge of your seat till the very end. It follows a man who quickly becomes obsessed with Following other people around town and as it always does, chaos ensues.Another man, ironically named Cobb, finds him one day and asks him to join him in robbing homes. Nolan does a great job of creating likable characters who don't necessarily do likable things. We are fascinated by the ease that goes with every burglary and cant wait to see what comes next. Of course they think by stealing things from people you are "showing them what they have and why they care about it". Already in his first film you can see the brilliance behind a Nolan written screenplay. Also did anybody catch the Batman logo in one of the apartments? Easter Egg? You don't want to go into this film with any prior knowledge, much like all of his other films. So without spoiling anything lets just say the film takes its fair share of twists and turns along the way. Even with this film being low budgeted and cheap looking it's easily one of the best of the 90's. It's not easy to find, but it's worth it if you look.+Nolan's script and directing +Low Budget? doesn't matter +Engaging and intelligent script +Likable characters who do unlikable things 9.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The birth of an intelligent film-maker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saucy, eh ? If at all you're familiar with Christopher Nolan's style of film-making, watching this will at once make you realize where it all started. Its also of course possible that it began much before this but since much of that material isn't accessible to the public (save Doodlebug), we'll never really know. For all purposes, Following remains Nolan's feature film debut and it surely is a remarkable achievement.The story follows Bill, a struggling unemployed writer who takes a liking to following people in hopes of finding material to write about. This liking soon turns into addiction forcing Bill to set rules to allow him to restrain his activities. One of the rules which he ends up breaking, is following the same person twice. The person with whom this rule is broken is Cobb, who soon confronts Bill about being followed. As it turns out, Cobb is a burglar who enjoys robbing people, not for the money, but rather for the sheer pleasure in taking away things that people took for granted; his belief being that it would make them realize what they had. Taken away by Cobb's lifestyle, Bill becomes a partner in his burglaries which is where the trouble begins.Digging any more into the plot would serve to spoil the complex mystery that Following is. Following has a lot of those narrative structures that would become trademarks of Nolan's directorial style (intercuts, close-up inserts, non-linear editing, multiple chronologies, and so on). Nolan and crew were forced to make certain hard choices to obscure the severely limited budget, one of which was shooting the film in black and white. Of course, the plot was such that these decisions worked the film's favor. The film's incredible naturalism repeatedly comes to mind while watching the film. This is due largely in part to the film being shot hand-held, with scenes filmed in a take or two to save on film stock. The behind the scenes material with the film reveals this and other fascinating details about the film's production such as the crew shooting over weekends due to their jobs on weekdays as a result of which the film took a year to complete.Despite the low budget, you're always hooked on to Following and that is due largely in part to the film's plot and tight writing (another of Nolan's strengths). Unlike many filmmakers who use lavish editing styles and gimmicky display effects, Nolan's films rely primarily on story and screenplay to get the viewers attention (with the occasional non-linear editing thrown in to really keep the audience alert at all times). Add to it, the intriguing characters which have personalities so distinct it appears Nolan himself followed a handful of people to get the traits right. Jeremy Theobald is as natural as the gullible Bill as Alex Haw is suave in the role of Cobb. And the chemistry between the two is so natural, it makes most of the dialogues they say seem improvised, as though real people were conversing.Following is a great start for Nolan who has now moved on to bigger, elaborate and definitely better projects. It is a lesson for aspiring filmmakers that even with a limited budget, it is possible to make a feature as interesting, riveting and thrilling as some of the best noirs of the early 40s. While it may not be perfect, most of the limitations it suffers from are largely due to production values rather than plotting and pacing. It is nevertheless, a must watch for anyone who has even the slightest of respect for Christopher Nolan's film-making.Overall Score: 7.0 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hooo Hoo....saw it for 4th time in my life and its still such a revealing experience. Nolan with this script unleashed the potential of him and what a good screenplay can do even to a straight forward story.The story is of a man who is tangled by his own deed of following people and then from a culprit becomes a witness and a victim too. The progression is so non linear till the very end its hard to realize what is actually happening and when did it happen. Like in the beginning, the protagonist falls on the ground and a cloth comes out of his mouth, we wonder what would have happened and this is revealed in the climax. There are many scenes that come and go but have a lot of meaning later and just keep us hanging in delirium.It's a tough one to decipher or construe the whole story happenings in a linear way so that would just take out the fun, its better to be watched and enjoyed the wau it is. The acting is fine but there are not many emotions displayed and mostly they are told with a straight face and a bland expression. Had it been done with professional actors, it would have been much more joyful. But, this movie has to be acclaimed hugely for it's all newcomers approach.The cost is minimal because of no remuneration to actors, it's all done in natural lighting and now additional lighting used. Its done on a 16mm film camera as against a 35mm so to reduce cost and the best part, this movie was shot all in all within 6000$ and the shooting was done only on weekends as actors were working on week days. Nolan has to be appreciated for his patience and perseverance and the actors for giving their time and making it what it is today.Great thanks to Nolan for making every aspiring film maker believe that if we have the content right, the budget or the lighting or the camera do not matter, what matters is how we shall present it at the end of the day.Nolan rocks with his first movie and though his other movies made him bigger, this was the firm beginning of a great director. It's 5/5 for the best independent and the lowest budget movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've enjoyed most of Christopher Nolan's movies and this one isn't really an exception. It certainly isn't as good as his later stuff, but for one of his first endeavors and, what looks like a shoestring budget, I am kind of impressed. The plot is pretty simple, but an interesting concept and the script is pretty intelligent. I like the interaction between the two main characters. It's quirky. An artist with a weird need to follow people around bumps into a thief and they form an interesting bond that goes a little wrong. It's got little twist, nothing jaw dropping, but I was surprised. It's black and white, I think more for effect than the budget because I think, and these days color film is probably as cheap as black and white. It's got a bit of this 90's hipster retro beatnik feel to it and the black and white film adds to that. I don't recognize any of the actors in it. It's all nobodies.

		<shortDescription>Following is a microcosm of the sophisticated movie memento</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following is definitely a representation of a low-budget movie. Without a sophisticated movie casts and over-complicated story-line, the selling point is the sequential order the story is presented. Similar to his later masterpiece, memento, Christopher Nolan didn't portrayed the movie in a chronological order, instead it is displayed in a "well-planned" random manner. Although, the movie may seem to be hard to grasp( it seems to me that is shifts more randomly than memento), Nolan leaves ample puzzles and traces for audience to figure out what is happening after-all. The last 10 minutes of the movie is the essence where bits and pieces in the first 50 minutes build up to the explosion of excitement,events follow one by one , leaving you no time to digest the rich context. The climax is outstanding, especially the twist at the end. Nolan also cleverly uses the conservation between the police officer and the protagonist in the beginning that corresponds with the ending where the young man finally walks out of the mist of "truth". This movie probably sets up the definition of a "though-provoking" movie. The crime scenes are well set up, giving you a sense that you are fooled around throughout the movie despite your effort to figure out what is going on. I see the villain, Cobb, as Nolan who wants to set up the audience to a " thought experience", leaving us spellbound in the cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story, but told a little strangely (no storyline spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story is about a man who follows people to learn more about them, and stumbles into the world of break-ins and robberies. It is told in a really fragmented storyline which makes it kind of like you are solving a crime, and following these people, putting it all together. It is clever, and a great premise, but it got hard to follow, especially when both men had the same haircuts, did strange things, and didn't fully introduce plot-twists. It is a good story, and a good movie. I really do suggest you watch it, if you have 70 minutes to spare.Also, it is only rated R because of f-bombs and a couple fight scenes. No sex scenes or anything.Worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes with that small budget Nolan delivered a HIGH CLASS Movie Experience to everyone. The important thing that made this movie so good is the NON LINEAR STORY TELLING of Nolan. Though the story is normal one, he filmed that in a different manner or filmed it at his best. That's the special thing about Nolan. Making the droplet into a flood The cast is really good. All of them performed very well even though the film is shot for a year. Yes the film is very short but you wont realize it at all.. The music is also good.. The film beautifully portrayed some great quotes My Favorite is You take it away and show them what they really have. overall it's a film that should be watched as many times as you like</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deep down, this is quintessential Nolan, bending the mind of the viewer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In recent years, Christopher Nolan has made a name for himself through big-budget, all star cast features like "The Dark Knight" or "Inception", which manage to make you think while also being visually spectacular. "Following", Nolan's feature debut, is where all of that came from, setting up many of the themes and ideas that he would later work with. On the outside, it's very unlike him. It's a black and white film, with a minuscule budget and a cast made up of unknowns. Deep down, it's quintessential Nolan, bending the mind of the viewer with its non- linear narrative and 'noirish' feel.The film tells the story of an unnamed "Young Man", a writer who follows people for inspiration. He is one day confronted by Cobb, whom he has been following, and is lead into a strange world of crime, breaking into people's houses and stealing their personal possessions. The Young Man is changed by Cobb, and even ends up changing his appearance (which makes the non-linear narrative a lot easier to follow, much like "Sliding Doors") to be more like him. The characters are fantastically written, and we never know how much we can trust Cobb, despite The Young Man's constant trust for him. The plot twists and turns, becoming almost unfollowable at times, but is all explained in the ingenious ending, where we discover Cobb's, and therefore Nolan's own brilliance. It's a technique which Nolan uses later in "The Prestige", perhaps with even more skill, by setting up a story, giving us the climax, and then offering the real show at the very end.The use of black and white harks back to old Noir thrillers, and also makes it more claustrophobic and personal, connecting you with the thoughts of The Young Man. Part of the fun of the film is trying to piece it together, figuring out where everything happens relatively. We are introduced to locations one by one, such as The Young Man's own flat, and learn more about their nature through the different strands of time. Despite the fact that the majority of the cast are unknowns giving debut performances, many of them are extremely convincing and gripping.It's undoubtable that "Following" has floors. It's occasionally stretched out, and feels slightly overcomplicated in the middle-third, but it's ultimately rewarding, and a great precursor to many of the fantastic movies which Nolan has gone on to make.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply an amazing maiden piece by Nolan that uses London streets and first-time or part-time actors. Its achronological pacing tells the story with an almost perfect 69 minutes on the screen with black-and-white starkness that fits both budgeting and plot.At first, I wanted to see this film's would-be author follow multiple stories and people, but the young man's act of tailing strangers introduces Nolan's true purpose that viewers can follow to and piece together at the end.I highly recommend this picture, especially as a sign of his directing to come.

Things go along fine until he starts following a man named Cobb, who turns the tables on him, and enlists him to take his hobby a step further and break into the apartments of those he follows, since he knows they are away. Little does the young man know that Cobb has sinister plans for him, and the attractive blonde woman he befriends...Unique and unpredictable film tells its story in a matter-of-fact way, yet unfolds its story carefully, building to a surprise twist ending.

He was born to be a filmmaking genius.

That satisfaction....That climax...(The film was inspired by Nolan's experience of living in London and having his flat burgled: "There is an interesting connection between a stranger going through your possessions and the concept of following people at random through a crowd ? both take you beyond the boundaries of ordinary social relations")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awesome first movie for a young director!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just shocked when i saw this movie and i think about that this made by an 28 years old director for his first movie with 6000$ budget only!!! Following serves as an interesting contrast to Memento. Characters in both used manipulation and subterfuge extensively. In that sense, both reminded me somewhat of "In the Company of Men," also highly recommendable. One difference between Nolan's two films is that Memento was a little easier for me to follow, given that the b&amp;w scenes progress in a constant chronological direction, and so do those in color. I don't think that was true of Following, where scenes seemed to be shown at random. If you have the choice between VCR and DVD, I'd highly recommend DVD, since that gives you the option of watching the movie a second time in chronological order, not just in the scrambled (albeit ingenuous) order presented by Nolan. It also makes it easier, upon a second viewing, to piece the order together for yourself, if you want to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is Christopher Nolan's first feature film (budget around ?3,000 and shot it on weekends), depicting an unemployed young writer who trails strangers through London in order to get inspiration for his first novel, but ends up being drawn into criminal activities and suspicious acquaintances... All main characters (nicely played by still little known British actors) are odd and enigmatic, with inclination to reasoning and justifications. The scenes run smoothly, although it is difficult to follow-up at times and some characters provide no value to the course of events. Mystics is stressed by black-and-white frames and lack of light, but ending scenes give viewers sophisticated explanation how and why all this web was woven... The 80 minutes pass in a catchy manner and if you like Nolan's later mind-twisting works (e.g. Memento and Insomnia), you will like this as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Everyone has a box.' A must see for Chris Nolan fans, This Neo-noir film is his first, shot with a small budget in black and white with a run time of 70 minutes.The style used in this film, Nolan uses in his next film 'Memento', if you're a fan of Memento then you will like this. The basis of the plot is that our protagonist(The young man) likes to follow people, not for any reason other then to see where they go, he sets himself rules such as; never follow people for too long, never follow people more than once and never follow women down dark alleys. It's all going fine until one day he follows a young handsome man (Cobb) whom realises he is being followed and confronts the protagonist, Cobb it turns out is a burglar, but he is not your typical burglar and invites our protagonist to accompany him on his burglaries and this ladies and gentlemen is where it gets interesting.....Overall the movie has an intriguing plot, solid acting and not once becomes tedious or prolonged. Although I found the film to have plot holes, it doesn't ruin the viewing experience. A solid film and a brilliant first effort from Chris Nolan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nolan's First Foray is Smart, Enveloping and Surprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan's extremely low-budget, high-concept debut is one nasty character. Cerebral and verbose, it lulled me into a trance with long, casual chats about the practice of breaking and entering as a social experiment, then suddenly smacked me with a sharp jerk of the wheel that skewed everything. Appropriate, effective use of hand-held cameras give the screen a disheveled, voyeuristic look and feel that had me averting my eyes out of guilt and embarrassment once or twice. A very small, casual cast seemed to know that's what Nolan was after, and played it up beautifully, with sudden piercing glares that often shot straight through the lens. The concept of non-linear narration may be starting to feel a bit played out at the moment, but when used with care and efficiency it can still be a powerful, effective means to a surprise end - and this is a great example of that. An unusually brief run time (70 minutes) may seem short at a glance; worry not, it'll stay with you for days.</fullReview>

I do find this movie interesting, while shot in a low budget, it seemed like Nolan could've done better. The story is interesting but suddenly falls. Why?

The last 15 minutes were great, but up until then, they were just breaking into houses and stuff.The movie is like Memento. In that way, it's a little mixed up in the way that it doesn't play chronologically. But it's very enjoyable and we can certainly see where Nolan came from with this film.</fullReview>

I'm not sure, but i think this is either Christopher Nolan's 2nd or 3rd film and even if this was his 5th i would still be astounded.

It is a wonderful twist on what can happen to you when you think you are in control. Christopher gives us a glimpse of what is going on but, keeps us guessing by showing us the sequence of events in flash backs. How did he get where he is now? What is really going on? These are the questions that hold your attention. This is a film that is cerebral and finally acknowledges that film goers need something more than heavy pyro and big car crashes. It is a breathe of fresh air for the film industry. If Hollywood is looking for some innovative thinking Christopher Nolan is the man to bring it.</fullReview>

It was unlike anything that I have ever seen before, so I had to see Following.It was a very intriguing film because you can definitely see how it influenced Memento with its similiar film style. It was shot in black and white which adds so much to the film, its has a scary erie style to it that I highly appreciate. The dialogue is very slick and smooth, the characters carry their amazing lines with honor. The acting is great and the screenplay keeps you interested.If you haven't seen either film, check this one out before Memento.

You really get the feel of the main character through all the flashbacks, how confused he gets and how he gets used. And it's a relief to see a relatively short film again for a change. These days, two hours seems to have become the standard. It's nice to see that a good story does not necessarily need a very long time to evolve.

The two lead characters are definitely interesting and their dialogue intriguing, but the story somehow fizzles out as it goes along.

		<shortDescription>Memento's lesser-known and long lost sibling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people now know Christopher Nolan's name from his involvement with the Batman reboot. Others may remember him from Inception or Memento, where his scripts bent minds with their wonderful weirdness.Following is his first ever effort at proper film-making. It features amateur actors who filmed their scenes while not at their day jobs, black and white footage and all filmed, written and directed by Christopher Nolan. In short, it comes across a bit like an 'art house' flick when you put it like that. But is it any good? Yes.Considering its minimal budget and lack of film-making expertise, it's pretty damn amazing. If you can forgive the lack of Hollywood glitz and grainy, student-like footage, it's a very compelling story which exhibits many traits which Christopher Nolan has used again (and expanded on) in his upcoming features.It's about a man who, needing inspiration for characters he's writing about, starts following random strangers around London in order to get some idea what 'normal' people do. However, what he doesn't bank on is when a suave thief who he follows catches him in the act and confronts him about it. Together they form an uneasy alliance and things take more than one turn for the worse. I'll keep the plot vague as it's one of those films that you can only really watch once and enjoy not knowing where it's going. I'll leave the surprises a surprise.If you can put up with a film that's very raw and rugged, devoid of anything vaguely Hollywood, plus you like a bit of a mind-bender which will have you guessing until the end, give this a go. Even if you completely hate it, it's pretty short, weighing in at just over an hour.Also, note the coincidental Batman logo on a flat door - a prediction of things to come? http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you'll indulge me. The year is 2012, Christoper Nolan launches the third installment of the most lucrative batman series in the history of motion pictures with "The dark knight rises" The movie is well executed but for me something was missing. The movie was big but it outgrew its own story.No, I didn't forget which movie I'm commenting on, I am merely saying what you and Nolan already know. A movie might benefit from A list actors or lavish CGI but it has to have a great idea. Someone who is short of a great idea is "The young men", an "aspiring" writer. His dull existence render his stories unwritten. In his despair, he stoops to stalking random strangers. After a brief research, he stumbles on Cobb, a burglar who looks like a suave businessman but enjoys the thrill of violating the holy privacy of complete strangers.His quirky observations lure The young man to a series of break-ins that are pointless and hopelessly addictive. The young men gets ideas and adrenaline rushes, Cobb sketches mental drawings of his victims by rummaging in their belongings. We soon find out that Cobb analyzes first and foremost his new companion. brimming with newly found confidence, The young man starts to date a stand-offish (Lucy Russell) who is never clear about her past and almost always reluctant to talk about it. Her agenda, we later learn, has ulterior motives. The young man is about to find out what is the game he serves as a pawn in and decides to take actions. I can't tell much more than I already have but I could point out that there's a reason why none of the pieces in chess is capable of moving itself. Nolan, who wrote, shot and directed "Following" back in 1998, could have made over 35,000 "Following" movies with the budget it took him to do just one "The dark knight rises" and I'd choose the former over the latter any day of the week. Those who are familiar with Nolan's work, can already recognize time- galloping narrative, the shrewd analysis of everyday life and the multi layered stories that above anything else, show how much effort and thought were put by Nolan. This movie has fewer actors, less lavish settings and even less colors (black and white, mostly) than every single movie he made since, but the story is there and all the rest become technicalities.One of these technicalities will be the acting. aside from Alex Haw (the Cobb), the actors didn't leave a lasting impression, the fighting scenes are clumsily edited and the the demented love triangle is, well, out of shape. Nolan always had a flair for well constructed story telling but, if I may be a little vein and make outrageous assumptions, Nolan is not the kind of director who will never let an actor adhere from the character envisioned by Nolan himself and this movie, like many more of his works, suffered (slightly) for that.More than it is an indicator to any of my traits, this overly-analyzing movie review is proof of the one common quality in all great movies have: It makes you think about them long after the credits. Probably more than anything else, this movie is a display of raw brilliance of a fledgling British director that will become the icon of highly acclaimed and unfathomably lucrative Hollywood movies. I think the kid's got potential. 9 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter</fullReview>

When does a "new" innovation in Movie-Making become clichéd? These are the types of questions one might ask about the work of Christopher Nolan.He now uses this time-shifting Editing technique quite often and is the centerpiece of his Cult Film Memento (2000). In His first attempt at a feature length Film it is obvious that he not only liked this off beat way of delivering a Story but actually fell in love with it later on.Some might find this kind of indulgence pretentious and unnecessary and yes, a gimmick. That's a cheap shot, but it is a cheap way of manipulating the Audience with a shake up of continuity and is quite awkward and one could say it breaks the fourth wall.This very low budget Movie is quite impressive and it is engaging, well Acted, and the on the job training Camera-Work is excellent.

		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan is one of the most popular and celebrated director, making films like Memento, Inception and of course The Dark Knight Trilogy. But every director has to start someone and Nolan was with the very low budget, but very well made Following.In London, a young man, Lee (Jeremy Theobald) is a struggling writer who follows random people just to see where they go, doing it for research for his book. But one well-dressed person he follows, Cobb (Alex Haw), turns out to be a burglar and Lee becomes his partner in crime. But Lee slowly gets sucked up into the London underworld when he befriends one of his victims (Lucy Russell).Following is a very low budget film; it was made on a budget of ?6000 and it Nolan over a year to make it. Following was still a very well made, taut affair, running in at trim 70 minute and is a film that never drags at any moment. It is compelling film, both as a thriller and early on as a psychological piece, looking at obsession, voyeurism and finding out and creating your own stories about people.Nolan uses a non-linear narrative, similar to Quentin Tarantino films and Memento. The non-linear can be annoying but Nolan uses it to his advantage and allowed for the film to keep the twists and turns coming. If I had to be critical the grand plan is a little convoluted, but Nolan was make the pieces fit with his writing and direction.For a low budget film Following looks good: Nolan uses black and white 16mm film giving the film a distractive look. It is a film that accepts its noir influence but still gives it a more modern, British look, accepting the bleaker landscapes of London like the abandoned building. When music was used it had techno, pumping beat, adding to the tension on the screen.Following is an excellent start to Nolan's career, doing a lot with the limits of his budget. Some of the acting is not as convincing as in his later films, but Following showed what Nolan was capable of and it is his most distinctively British film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the first film of one the best young directors around Christopher Nolan. The Following is a must see if you are a fan of suspense films. The story is fanatically intense. The ending takes all the gaping strands and pulls them together in a way that may really surprise you. You don't know what to expect from the end. That makes all the Nolan' films that great. It's clearly seen that man's mind is powerful. Capable of doing some great things as future as shown.This movie is black and white. There are no well-known actors. It lasts only 70 minutes. Nevertheless, it is well worth watching if you want have a good one-hour entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nolan lays the groundwork for time-bending mystery thrillers and his career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no way to watch "Following" and not conclude that Christopher Nolan would become something special. Someone who can weave that much complexity into a film with a cast of few and in the course of just 69 minutes clearly has a knack for the film-making thing."Following" might not amount to a whole lot other than being the evidence necessary to secure financial backing for Nolan's even more chronologically elaborate follow-up, "Memento," but it holds its own. If "Memento" is Clue than "Following" is Clue Jr. There are fewer characters, fewer loose ends to tie up, but the same desired effect is achieved.The story begins with a young man (Jeremy Theobald) explaining to someone how he began following people. An aspiring writer, he's fascinated by people-watching (and to some extent we all are), yet he admits he broke a few of his personal rules and therefore got caught up in the ensuing story.One of the men he follows too far is Cobb (Alex Haw), who confronts him in a coffee shop. Before the young man knows it, he's beings swooped up by Cobb, who has a knack for trespassing and "robbing" houses (he doesn't take much). A total loner, the young man becomes his sidekick of sorts.From this point on the film jumps out of order. Scenes from the end of the story are jumbled in with scenes from the beginning and scenes from the middle, with our only visual clue being the length of the young man's hair. This is where the noir-style thriller comes in and justifies Nolan's choice to shoot in black-and-white. The film seems like it will be a social experiment gone wrong, but "Following" evolves into a thick mystery.After a thorough brain-scrambling, Nolan delivers the pay off by revealing twists one at a time. There are even twists on twists, quite the skill and daring for a first feature film. An amateur without a true gift would fail to dupe or impress anyone, but Nolan does both.In order to make this climax work, Nolan does sacrifice a bit. Scenes we should have been paying attention to have no other compelling reason to keep our interest even though we'll wish we had kept it when the credits role. Part of this is because he only had amateur actors, part is because the scenes only exist so that the ending makes sense and leaves no margin for error.It's easy to see why Nolan has risen to elite filmmaker status in just 12 years of feature film-making (to this point), and there's no doubt cinephiles will be following him for many years to come.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Following</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given Christopher Nolan's string of successful films, it's a no brainer for me to want to check out his filmography watch his debut feature, which is shot in black and white back in England, running less than 70 minutes long, done with little budget, but containing all the hallmarks that has made him a master filmmaker and storyteller.Though short, the film is no less gripping with its meandering plot that will leave you guessing, because the premise doesn't even scratch the surface of this tale, which is pretty amazing considering the depth in the narrative's structure and characterization. As told, we follow a writer wannabe called Bill (Jeremy Theobald) who starts a habitual obsession with following random people he fancies on the streets in a voyeuristic manner, which at first could be conceived as research, before he starts to make up his own rules, and break them.He meets up with charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw) who turns out to be a robber with peculiar sensibilities and modus operandi, and soon finds himself hooked with hanging out with him as they go about breaking and entering and speculating about their victim's livelihood, as does the pursuit of a femme fatale blond (Lucy Russell), a mobster's moll who rejects his every advance.Told in a non-linear fashion which comes with scenes that don't quite add up in the beginning, this sets the film up for multiple viewings as you study just how Nolan sustains that suspense and intrigue with you as the audience expecting and wanting more, which gets duly delivered. There are enough twists here which spins the film into a dizzying crescendo, where loose ends begin to come together, and the brilliance of the stellar story start to shine through.It's also amazing how, as a first feature shot on the cheap, that something that clever and sophisticated can be conceived from his own experience in being burgled, with Nolan involved in every stage of production, from writing to shooting, producing and directing, having worked on the project for a year since shoots can only happen on weekends. I guess here's an example of a successful filmmaker's humble roots, which should serve as inspiration and spur new filmmakers out there. Now I'll patiently wait for Christopher Nolan's Inception due out later this year, whose trailer is already such a tease.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An interesting showcase for a lot of the ideas and themes that would permeate a lot of Nolan's later films, but this low budget affair reeks of "first film," right down to the casting of people who don't actually appear to be actors at all and are likely just friends of the director/investors. This does all work to make Theobald's performance stand out, though.The plot is a mite unrealistic and convoluted but keeps you hooked throughout with some great twists and turns.An interesting but imperfect effort. A lot of the ideas on screen would see much better realisation in the later Memento.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before "Memento" There Was...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chris Nolan's labyrinth like noir about voyeurism and identity is amazing from start to finish. A first film is as complex as "Memento" or "The Prestige", though maybe a little harder to get a handle on. Still it smacks of originality and creative drive, and has a "twist" as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp. Few film makers have made as good of use of their editors and attention to narrative that Nolan has. The story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers down the street, until he follows someone, whose noticed him following others, and has been following him in tern, from there the complexity escalates and identities begin to rearrange. More naturalistic and realist than Nolan's later work but just as razor sharp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great British director Christopher Nolan (Momento, Insomnia), directs this odd film about a struggling writer obsessed with following people. This proves harmless at first but soon turns dangerous after taking the game a step further after meeting a like-minded man who shows him the ins and outs of breaking and entering. The two men soon get in over their heads in a strange world involving the mafia and prostitution. Jeremy Theobald plays the writer and Alex Haw the like-minded friend. Both are great performances. This low budget movie was shot total guerrilla-style with no permits for any locations and no big stars but has what a lot of huge budget films don't have which is a clever script and creative direction. An impressive debut by one of todays best directors. Good Stuff!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like it successor Memento, Following chops up its storyline and feeds it to us out of sequence. Designed to fire the imagination as the plot proper unfolds, the trick is not to confuse the audience in the process.Nolan gets it right first time with this film. Like the story itself, Following starts in a moderate temperament but slowly constricts the viewer. The non-linear (implictly flashback) narrative acts as a series of twists which keep coming right up to the end. It's almost gripping.Almost. The acting is very perfunctory and lets the project down somewhat. No doubt it must have been hard on the cast given the peripatetic manner in which the impecunious Nolan put it all together.That said the acting is simply symptomatic of Nolan's will to produce the movie in his head. The cast are clearly contributing for love not money and the flaws in lighting, sound and set pieces are the scars of successful struggle rather than errors of judgement. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cluastrophobic and beguiling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America, and a reputation for making movies both popular and critically acclaimed; but this small film was where he started. And it certainly showcased his talent, with its striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological storytelling that prefigures his later 'Momento', albeit in a less extreme way. Thematically and mechanistically, the plot reminded me of David Mamet's 'House of Games', but the film still feels fresh and sharp, right up to the final twist of the ending whose flavour was expected, but whose pointedness is unexpectedly delicious. The acting, on the other hand, is not quite in the same class - the film has a stylised quality, and possibly to a greater extent than the director intended. But it's still a fine debut, simultaneously claustrophobic and beguiling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan's first film is a 'no budget' black and white film about a unemployed writer who begins following strangers, which in turn leads to robbery and also violence. It is very good.Like in his later film 'Memento' he doesn't present the story in a linear way. Instead it jumps around somewhat so you end up really sucked in trying to piece it all together and early, apparently random, shots take on significance as the film progresses. This style also means the twists are much more effective.Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance (especially if you like his later work and/or Film Noir)</fullReview>

As soon as Cole finds it he says, "The box. Everyone's got a box". A minute later, just before he dumps the contents on the floor he says, "We're actually very fortunate. You don't see these often".Observation #2 (Spoiler Alert!)I had to watch the thing three times, I couldn't figure a couple of things out. Then I watched the Chronological version and saw that they were having flash backs from the latter to the previous during the time changes. So at some points we were actually watching three different times in about 1 min of wall time.That was a good thing because I don't know how many more times I could watch it before returning it to Netflix.Color me obsessive.</fullReview>

THe film is shot in black and white which I was a bit annoyed with at first but once into the film you understand black and white is the best way for the film to be seen. It is extremely gripping and reasonably easy to understand even though the way it is made is extremely clever. Elements of the storyline i think are a bit daft but the film is definitely worthy of a second viewing. To conculde the film has a clever plot, clever twists and turns, very good acting and bearing in mind the budget of the film I have to say that it is pretty amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood. The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology. The event sequence complicates following Following. If you are willing to pay attention, it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks. With the running time at 70 minutes, there is a lot to take in, but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralled.Bill is a lonely, untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they go-what they do. He is a bit too conspicuous, however, and eventually gets caught by a well dressed, clean-cut bloke named Cobb. Cobb entangles Bill in a world the poor boy is not prepared to live in. Cobb is a smart rogue who seems to have complete control over the other characters. By the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly. The film is an excellent first effort from the talented Christoper Nolan, who would go on to make Memento, one of the most original movies of our time.</fullReview>

To be honest - when this movie ended my knee-jerk reaction was that this movie is better than Memento. After the euphoria of the fabulous ending wore off, I concluded that they are equal in their excellence. I am just confused about why its not in the Top 50 along with Memento. I'm going to venture a guess that (sadly) it's because it's in black and white or because (again sadly)that the characters all have British accents ...sadly because that is no reason to not appreciate a great movie like this.I'm telling you that if you loved Memento, you will love Following as well.

		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN.The movie opens with dialogue between the main character and a police detective. The main character, identified as "the young man" makes the following statements: "I've been on my own for awhile and getting kind of lonely and bored. Nothing to do all day. And that's when I started shadowing."The main character, in a warped and infringing state of mind, begins to follow people only to find out that he is likewise being followed, set up, and framed. Like attracts like, unfortunate for him in this case. His original motives were not harmful, only loneliness, boredom, and overinterest in other peoples' lives; infringement. He used the fact that he aspired to become a writer as an excuse for his behaviours.The movie is presented in non-linear time movement sequences cognitive-wise and there are many similarities between this film, Christopher Nolan's first work released in 1998, and Memento released in 2001.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously not very solid debut, but the b/w (mostly hand held) cinematography is good enough to complement the acting. Not that the actors are bad, but the film can't build on their performance and it's not always clear where Nolan wants to go. I like to see it as a twisted plot, not as twisted as Memento, but still. Fortunately he concentrates on the style in Memento with success.Following is a contemporary film-noir and feels like a mockumentary sometimes, but has a lot of potential (easy to say that after the success of Memento, isn't it?), especially as a psycho-thriller. As in Memento, the most interesting thing about the movie is the structure of the story and the unraveling of the information. Slightly reminiscent of Suture (McGehee/Siegel, 1993). Concluding: Nolan has more potential and subtlety than Hitchcock (IMHO :-).8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very well put together film. The chronology is played around with, leaving you aware of future situations but unsure of the events which lead to them. In Following, as with Memento, illusions are suggested which lure you away from guessing what could happen next. This is done quite well, and often creates a nervous atmosphere, much like you might expect a cat-burglar (as is in the story) to experience. Clever twists, a sharp plot, cannily shot in black and white, which was a very good choice, this has a lot going for it; especially for a cheap first picture for Christopher Nolan. However, in spells it's a little dull. The momentum sags and once it's clear what's going on, the eventual ending is logical but perfunctory.Worth a watch, but could've been cut down to about an hour dead or less and been much better. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best film about London since LONDON. (possible spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Proof that a micro-budget is no limitation to the production of a good film - all you need is ideas and verve, a truism that more tyros might heed. Even those elements here that might be considered flawed by 'budgetary limitations' - the sometimes uncertain camerawork, the limited locations, the lack of extras etc. - on the contrary add to this thriller, give it a dream feel where the lead character has no control over his actions, keeps returning to the same places, trapped in someone design, both literally, in space, and in terms of fiendishly conceived plot.Heavily influenced by THE USUAL SUSPECTS, the first signal of breach is the voiceover, which begins with the usual, voice-of-god, this-is-what-really-happened, honest-guv authority, but is broken by a second voice, which questions it, undermines it. Already, the lead character's voice is undermined, and, as everything we see proceeds from his voice, so is the narrative. The plot therefore works on three levels - on the level of the story as the Young Man tells it; on the more Proustian level, where chronological order is not observed, like you would tell a story to friend, leaping all over the shop; the 'real' level, where the master puppeteer finally reveals his strings.Before the thriller proper starts, there is a welcome prologue that places FOLLOWING in a different mode altogether, , one more indebted to Hitchcock, Powell, Poe, Benjamin, Baudelaire, Marker, Keiller. The Young Man, ostensibly a writer gathering material, or 'between jobs' as Cobb notes with cruel accuracy, takes to following random people, not for sexual kicks, just to see what they do, where they live. This opens up a fascinating series of questions about alienation, voyeurism, urban solitude, decentring, the attempt to connect. The invading of people's lives, the assuming of identities, all of which are ingeniously put into practice in the crime narrative. There is a Benjaminian concern with dead urban spaces, those places, apartments, abandoned restaurants etc., that dot London (and presumably other large cities), uninhabited , transitory stopovers for flaneurs, malevolent ghosts.Because in one way this is a ghost story, about people inhabiting other people's spaces, identities, minds, leaving unfathomable marks, traces. There is an obsession with objects, trinkets, rememberances, as if all this will somehow make substantial the transitory. This extends to the Young Man, who inhabits a plot that doesn't exist, and absorbs traces of Cobb, his personality, his look, even his girlfriend, until he literally ceases to be himself, an empty receptacle waiting to be used, someone outside society about to be hung for someone else's traces.One shouldn't forget that the film is brilliantly plotted as a thriller, and the chronological leaps are hilarious (in that what 'follows' clears up what went before, though technically after, not always as we'd expect, but also undermining characters' sense of agency, and creating a sense of menace, of not being grounded, not being in control that extends to the audience as well as the Young Man. The idea of a master 'author' writing the fiction, juggling his unwitting characters, brings to mind Welles, and there is the extraordinary central set-piece, blackly comic, where the Young Man goes to get the photographs; this is troublingly Wellesian, as he enters a realm with objects which seem to dissolve before him into an engulfing heart of darkness. In one way, the film is an anti-detective film, full of clues, 'following' and incidents to interpret, but rather than solving the crime or conspiracy, the detective becomes fatally enmeshed.As I suggested, the film is liberated, rather than constrained, by budget. So if it has flaws, than they are a result of conception. The first isn't really serious - the likeable actors become increasingly monotonous - when characters who aren't really expressive, but try to be, it can get a bit tiresome - surely Bressonian passivity is more appropriate. There is perhaps a misogyny in the character of the Blonde, in keeping with the old film noir triangle structure, although the deliberate framing and lighting of her as a 40s siren with an arch London accent suggests parody. More serious is the resolution, which ultimately backs away from the ambiguity of THE USUAL SUSPECTS, providing a clear-cut, if clever, denouement, having worked so hard at enigma. Never mind, this is still a remarkable debut, showing there's life in the old genre yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The not-so-humble beginnings of the time-traveler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an interesting exercise to witness the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that hindsight offers you can see the cogs and wheels that make these people what they are. Following is one such look into the past of Christopher Nolan, one of the great time-warping story-teller of today.Christopher Nolan's style of film-making puts a great deal of emphasis on the delivery of the story. Although people might complain it relies too much on the back-and-forth shifting of time, I still find it fascinating to see how he uses that one technique differently each time. Memento was probably the most convoluted piece of story-telling I have ever seen. Discount the hardened cynics who say it is an old piece of meat wrapped in fancy dressing. Memento shows how even the simplest of stories can be turned into a mind-bender. The Prestige, which was considerably stripped down in comparison, still showed creativity in how its three stories were interwoven. Even in a jaded enterprise like the Batman series did Christopher Nolan sprinkle some of his outstanding yarn-weaving tricks, breathing new life into the dark knight.Following is an intense tale of intrigue and mystery, where we see a dilettante writer, who becomes a reluctant voyeur, who becomes an unknowing accomplice to a variety of petty crimes, and finally sees an end no one could have expected. Having never heard of Following before, I had no idea what I was to expect. At every point the film kept me guessing as to where it was leading me. Since the mystery angle was clear, I was constantly trying to figure out what was going to happen next. And that is where I think the film succeeds so well. The film has many elements that led me off on many wild goose chases.The film is entirely in black and white and told in multiple timelines, both of which are considered gimmicky these days. Following does all of this in the least formulaic or contrived way possible. There doesn't seem to be a reason why the story is told in the way it is, but you don't feel like you are being taken for a ride. The lack of pretension or self-aware arrogance is what makes this style of story-telling work. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the slowest films I've seen. I get the idea that this was intentional. It was? Oh. O.K. then. I'll take your word for it. Shot in Black and white. Yeh that was clever. Well not really. This was always a black and white flick. Suspense ! What suspense? I must have missed that, Was it when he was messing about with the time shift? The ending? Great. But does the ending justify the means. Almost. But not quite. Great for a first movie. This guy will get better. He does? Oh yeah. Memento. Really weird, but better. Insomnia? Yeah, now he's cooking. I await his next film. Batman Begins, is it? Wow, there'll be no " Holy haberdashery, Batman! "in that one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>English Writer - Director Christopher Nolan is a talent to be celebrated. The evidence is there to behold in this, his breathtaking debut feature length film. Filmed on a micro budget over the course of a year, `Following' is a guerilla filmaking masterpiece. However, the foundations for such a masterpiece were laid even before Nolan took to the camera. The complex, non - linear plot, borne in a well crafted scripted, is truly remarkable. I have come to expect this from Nolan, after seeing his second film, `Memento'. It is not hard to understand why independent film companies and actors Pearce, Pantoliano, and Moss signed up for `Memento' after Nolan made this. He weaves a complex, thoughtful and provocative tale in an accomplished manner that demonstrates perfect timing and a natural masterful control of the medium of film. `Following' is too deep and has too many twists to describe the plot in much detail. The central character is Bill, a lonely, unemployed, would be writer in his mid ? twenties, living in Greater London. Part of his strange lifestyle is his `Following' ? whereby he picks a person out from a crowd at random and follows them. The film starts with a montage showing him doing so, edited with him being interviewed by what we later learn is a police officer, and Bill explains how he has rules that he keeps to, whilst he was shadowing, such as the fact that he will only follow each person once. Obviously, things take a dramatic turn when he breaks this rule, and is confronted by the party concerned, Cobb. Bill tells himself he does this as research for a book he will eventually get around to writing. It is obvious that he has an interest in people, like an outsider looking in, and Cobb seemingly is the same. As Cobb gets him into breaking into houses, and Bill gets to know a woman, events occur in a non ? linear way. We see Bill at three different stages in the story, which intrigue us because of a different in hair cut and clothes at times, and the fact that he has obviously been beaten up. Here, Nolan encourages audience to ask questions about what has happened to make these changes and in what order, but he cleverly times the answers so that the format of three different periods in time never becomes redundant or boring. It is always effective, and the three threads come together towards the end in that truly masterful way that Nolan loves to write and direct. I have studied short stories where it is important that not a word, never mind a sentence is wasted ? everything is there for a very relevant and direct reason, and this is the case with Nolan's film. Everything you see and hear will be important in some way, though you don't realise it at first. A film like that is truly great. `Following' is. This being a micro budget film, in black and white, with fairly drab and unsavoury locations, the picture and sound is not brilliant, even on DVD, but it really does not matter, and I actually think it adds to the atmosphere of a film. It feels gritty, it feels like art rather than pure entertainment, it feels like true film making at its rawest, purest form. And in any case the genius of this film does not lie in a blatant visuality, it lies in the plot, the script, the acting and the general narrative, in terms of editing and camera work ,which tell the story and capture the moment, without being the focus of it. Like all great films, this bears hallmarks of influence by earlier classics ? the idea of a lonely guy, living in a run down apartment, in the middle of a not ? to desirable place ? who seeks a way to consolidate his loneliness is something that those who have seen `Taxi Driver' will know about. I would bet that Nolan saw `Taxi Driver', and was impressed by it. But, like all great films, whilst there is evidence of influence, this is far outweighed by the originality and freshness of this particular film. `Following' is maybe not as mind ? blowingly original as Memento, but it is very fresh, and very interesting, and very much Nolan's film. `Following' is low key and had a low key release, mainly travelling festival circuits, but thanks to the success of `Memento' and `Insomnia', it has been limitedly re ? released on an interesting DVD, and is slowly becoming noticed. So it should be. All those involved in the film deserve some recognition. Jeremy Theobald, also a producer, gives a fascinating and absorbing turn as the central role, Bill. Alex Haw brings a great intensity to the role of the deep and deceptive `Cobb'. Lucy Russell is solid and understated in her first film role, as the blonde model that Bill falls in love with. David Julyan composed an atmospheric, well accompanying score. Like `Memento', this is the type of film that you will marvel at because of its refreshing, complex subject matter, its' originality, its' intelligence, its' masterful direction. As one British newspaper reviewer was quoted as saying about `Memento', this, likewise, is `One of those films that you immediately want to see again'. It keeps you enthralled throughout, and you walk away from it with a firm impression left on you. I took ten quiet minutes after watching it to mull it over and work it out completely, then watched the last ten minutes again to fully take it in. It maybe doesn't have the kind of message that you can take away into the world that `Memento' does, though there are inner messages. Most importantly, you can't just switch off after watching this ? it keeps you thinking so that you make sure you know exactly how everything happened and in what order, and demands repeat viewings. If you appreciate the art of great film making, watching this film is fun ? not because it is one long adrenaline rush, though they are fun too, - but because it is just an amazingly good film and it will captivate you as such. ***** out of ***** and a round of applause for Christopher Nolan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the rest of us only went once in the line for brains, Christopher Nolan got seconds. Maybe even thirds. It's unfair if you ask me. The guy is brilliant. His films should be textbook examples for what a smart movie should be. FOLLOWING, his first contribution to cinema, wouldn't let up on the details. Nolan just had to show us what a genius he is, didn't he?FOLLOWING is a short, black-and-white noir picture. It's about a lonely writer who innocently stalks people. One day, he follows a burglar named Cobb who brings him into his world. The story is all jumbled up but, ultimately, coherent. My favorite example goes like this: Bill takes "the Blonde" to his flat and talks to her. We can tell it's his place from the broken little wooden doll on the dresser. The next scene is a flashback and shows Bill when he was with Cobb (the expert burglar). Bill shows Cobb the apartment without telling Cobb it belongs to him. Bill does this in order to find out what kind of person Cobb thinks Bill is. Cobb said before that he could tell a lot about a person from their stuff. Cobb breaks the doll, which was broken in the scene preceding it. I know this probably doesn't make sense but, Nolan did it perfectly.To me, not very many directors put as much thought into their films as Christopher Nolan. FOLLOWING has many, many, many ways of keeping your eyes glued to the screen. The last few minutes of it will give you chills. The hairs on your arms will stand up and say, "Who is this fascinating filmmaker?" Christopher Nolan, that's who.</fullReview>

I don't object to the portrayal of events, but the buildup to the "surprise" ending made the end not worth watching. I think I'll skip Momento.

		<fullReview>It's utterly irrelevant to me whether this movie had a budget of 6 thousand, 6 million, or 600 million dollars. I only care about the end-result, what I get on the screen. "Following", despite its ultra-short length of 70 minutes, required me to watch it in 3 sittings (sleepings) - that's how dull it was in parts. Not badly made, but after the interesting first several minutes, the movie goes nowhere i.e. it turns into a mere run-of-the-mill noir drama. Who cares if it's written and presented in broken form? I've seen so many films done that way, it doesn't get me excited anymore at all. It's still just another double-cross crime film, the kind of cliché crap one could have expected from a Huston/Bogart team-up. Yawn. I had expected something more unique to develop out of the initial premise of the central character following people. I wouldn't have even viewed this film had I known its plot was so standard.The twists and the story are not only not interesting, but quite far-fetched. The woman's character isn't properly fleshed out. "Memento" was considerably better. This was just a solid little early effort, nothing more. No need to get ecstatic, people...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Christopher Nolan made Inception or The Dark Knight trilogy, he made Following. The story is of a young writer named Bill (Jeremy Theobald) who follows strangers for material. When one of his subjects, a thief named Cobb (Alex Haw) confronts him, Bill starts robbing apartments with Cobb. When Bill meets a girl (Lucy Russell) he starts getting involved in her life as well. Although not quite as complicated as Inception or Interstellar, Nolan's future traits are here, such as his non-linear story telling, and it's still a complicated story. It's a very well put together film noir. Nolan certainly benefited from beginner's luck. Although it's not as good as Inception, The Dark Knight, or Batman begins, I like it better then The Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar. It's an interesting movie and it's very well made for as small as the budget it. If you like Nolan's work, you'll find this pretty interesting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first indication of Christopher Nolan's genius for filmmaking.An unemployed young man has a strange pastime - following people. Nothing illegal or voyeuristic though. Then one day the person he is following, Cobb, catches him and confronts him. Cobb then introduces him to his strange hobby - burglary...Incredibly original, clever and intriguing. Starts fairly innocently enough but the tension ramps up the further you go. Great twists towards the end.Writer-director Christopher Nolan, directing his first feature film, shows an amazing confidence in his screenplay and direction, despite the limited resources at his disposal (apparently the film cost only $6,000 to make). Great use of back-and-forth time jumps, so that you get leaked the backstory, rather than spoon-fed it. He would take the time-jump technique to the extreme in his next movie (see later).The low budget does show up in the production values, but this doesn't hurt the movie much.Performances are mostly okay. I found Alex Haw a bit stiff as Cobb but the others are fine. While Nolan's debut film was intelligent and original, his next movie was even better. It was mind-blowingly brilliant - original beyond comparison with scenes in reverse order. That movie would be Nolan's finest and one of the greatest movies of all time (#2 on my all-time list) - Memento.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have recently watched Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' and wasn't very impressed. The film was innovative and 'intelligent',I agree, but I just couldn't enjoy it. There were too many unanswered questions, too many loose ends.Or maybe I was just not 'smart enough' to appreciate it :P And when i watched 'The Dark Knight', I felt it was overrated. It's a decent movie, yes, but I just couldn't understand what the hype was all about. Man of Steel was fine. Those were my experiences with Nolan's movies and I was very very close to considering Nolan, an overrated director. But I still didn't want to give up. I wanted to see why people say his movies are a work of genius and I really wanted to know what is it in Nolan's movies that actually make them tick. I decided to give Mr.Nolan one last chance :p I decided to watch a Nolan's movie, just one more of his movies, to see if it could blow my mind. And if it fails to do so, I decided not to watch a Christopher Nolan's movie ever. And then I watched 'Following' . And I am glad I did.Boy, did it blow my mind. It was brilliant. It was better than Memento or any other Nolan's movie i have seen so far. A clever movie in black and white. There weren't any loose ends as in the Memento and everything was so perfectly fabricated. Go ahead. You won't regret watching this.</fullReview>

The movie has characters and storyline straight out of a Dostoevsky title. You may like the movie if you have a taste for such movies.The movie keeps moving between the present, the past and the future. And well you can't actually miss any scene, since it is pretty tightly packed. It would have done even better with some soundtrack. but i guess most debutant directors generally make movies minus music.

		<shortDescription>Ask six people exactly what Following is about, and you will get six different answers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sometimes dream of waking to a completely dark world, a world with no sunlight and minimal artificial light. My vision is blurred, but there is nothing to see. The streets are virtually empty, and my friends and family are lifeless; sitting, standing or even walking, but with nothing to do or say, and nowhere to go. No questions are asked because there is nothing to learn, nothing is discussed because nothing is interesting. And it is this dismal reality I am faced with, only partially aware that there is anything better.The existence I dream of is somewhat reminiscent of the world of Jeremy Theobald, the main character in Following, who becomes father to a hideously deformed baby. That's what the film is about at face value, but the very style in which it is portrayed is the real beauty of it. The setting and scenery makes the film one of the most desperately depressing I have ever seen. And although Jeremy seems to be devoid of any spark of personality, we can't help but sympathise with him throughout the film.Similar to my dream, the only form of light is artificial, the streets are virtually empty, and the only person in the entire film who has any personality is the father-in-law, and the only thing he has to talk about is his poor health. He also seems to be the only one with any link to better times. ("I've watched this city turn from pastures to the hell-hole it is now.") The city they live in is completely industrialized, and the only plant life seen is dead, and in a pile of soil on Jeremy's bedside table.Some have suggested it is based after a nuclear holocaust, but nothing is explained to any conclusion. One of the beauties of this film is that it practically begs the viewer to decide for themselves what any of it means, and there are many theories. I warn you not to read the message board of Following before you see the film, as it is so much more powerful and chilling to experience it first-hand.The first time I saw Following, I was completely confused. It is possible that Christopher Nolan just put a load of random imagery together and called it a film. Maybe he wanted the viewers to put it all together and make their own sense of it (or not). On the other hand, there might actually be a set formula behind it and only the very open-minded and discerning audience can properly decipher it.One viewing of Following is enough to raise about a dozen questions, and to leave you gasping for answers. Two viewings are probably enough to give you theories about some of the cryptic depictions hauntingly portrayed. Three viewings might be enough to give you a completely different set of theories, battling persistently against your previous conceptions, but still leaving just a few details that don't quite seem to fit in. The truth is that there may be parts that don't make sense in one interpretation, but fit in perfectly to another. You could probably watch Following several times, and each time see a slightly different story. Or if you were to ask six different people exactly what Following is about, you would get six different answers, each equally correct in their own right, and each equally confused.That being said, this definitely isn't a film for everyone. This is the first Christopher Nolan film I have seen, and it certainly won't be the last. But there will no doubt be many who see this purely as a lot of clever mind tricks and special effects (for its time, anyway.) There will be those who don't like much to think about, and want it all explained bit by bit in perfect detail. Well, Following is an epitome of everything such moviegoers will hate. I will say this for certain: If your favourite films are 'Love Actually' or 'Dude, Where's My Car?', you probably won't get much out of Following. But for those who like their concepts challenged once in a while, this film will probably be one to watch again and again until you understand. This is also not a film to be forgotten easily. Love it or hate it, Following will stay with you for a very long time.</fullReview>

I have to watch this again, because by the time I saw what was going on, I missed the train. This is simple and well done. Of course, one needs to have some motivations for actions. I suppose power and cruelty are at the center. Perhaps even mental illness is a factor. I felt a bit voyeuristic as these men went into apartments and thought about some of my possessions and how people would just me if they started sifting through things. Anyway, for an hour or so, it captivates and pulls one along. I would have liked to see a little more exposition at the opening and allow us to get to know the central figure a bit more, his obsessions, and his activities.

		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan's feature film debut presents the now esteemed filmmaker experimenting with the narrative structure of this story along with other aspects of filmmaking to carve out his own trademarks which over the next few years ended up playing a key role in his rise from an independent filmmaker to one of the most revered directors in the film industry today.Filmed on a shoestring budget, making use of only available light, captured in black n white, shot in limited locations &amp; featuring an entirely inexperienced cast, Following tells the story of a struggling young writer who starts following strangers around the streets of London to find inspirations for his next novel &amp; the film covers his descent into the criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance.Written, produced, directed, photographed &amp; co-edited by Nolan himself, the story is structured in a non-chronological order &amp; is narrated in 3 overlapping plot lines which come together in the end to provide a fitting conclusion to this impressive tale of twists &amp; turns. The performances by its amateur cast is poor as expected but the rest of its filmmaking aspects are effectively carried out, considering its budget.On an overall scale, Following is a mesmerising neo-noir drama that's a must for aspiring filmmakers as well as for Christopher Nolan's fans. It's one of the least expensive films in cinema history yet the experience it provides is much more fulfilling than many big-budget productions. You may have seen the breathtaking wonders of Nolan's cinematic vision in his later films but this is where it all started. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a great movie for being only 67 minutes long. There was an aspect of film-noir contained in this movie and I am glad that Nolan picked to film it in black and white. The plot is simple yet entertaining that keeps you engaged. Even the dialogue was good along with the acting. It reminded me of what was to come in Memento by not being in chronological order. I liked how the main character tried to use what Cobb taught him for example saying "everyone has a box" which he put his personal things into. Also, on the writer's door was the batman logo which seemed ironic because Christopher Nolan would later direct Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, two other great movies. There is a great twist in the end which I'm not going to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen it, even though I kind of figured what would happen when Cobb gave the young man D Lloyds credit card. I also liked how the writer had a copy of The Republic by Plato one of my favorite philosophical books. This is definitely a movie you need to watch more than once to get the full aspect of it, plus it only being an hour long. There is also a circular aspect to it by ending where it began which I thought was pretty brilliant.</fullReview>

Those one who liked "Memento" would love this work. The subtle narrative style is similar and also different. You can follow the plot easier but it's still confusing, too. Hints who are given guide you in a blind alley or put you off the scent. The story of the unemployed author who spy on other people become a great atmosphere because of the black-and-white filming. This style especially helped Nolan to fog the character of the disingenuous Cobb. Nolan also adumbrate his talent to make the audience get a feeling with the protagonist without letting him get to close to the character. But also work out a difficult personality. This movie about the fantasy of voyeurism and the unforeseeable results is a must-see both the interested viewer and the film-noir-fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan's directorial debut Following is an engrossing film noir and watching it as I did a couple of days ago makes me even appreciate it more after seeing Nolan become one of the best filmmakers that are working today. The film was made for only $6,000 and it took a whole year to shoot because all of the people involved had full-time occupations. It's incredible to think that this movie is where Nolan started and ten years later he made one of the most successful blockbusters ever in The Dark Knight. Another interesting note about this film is that it bears a striking resemblance to Nolan's next work Memento, with the non-chronological story line and the black and white photography.The movie follows a struggling writer, played perfectly by Jeremy Theobald, as he starts to follow strangers through the streets of London looking for literary inspiration. However, he becomes sidetracked after he is confronted by a man he is following. The man calls himself Cobb and Cobb quickly introduces Theobald's character into the world of burglary. The interesting thing about Cobb is that he doesn't necessarily go through houses for money; he does it because he is fascinated by affecting the lives of random people. He enjoys the thought of his victims re-evaluate their lives as a result of his actions. At first hesitant, the young writer eventually is taken with Cobb and he begins robbing regularly himself. The new friendship is blossoming perfectly until Theobald's character risks everything by starting to chase after a young blonde woman played by Lucy Russell. I will not reveal any more of the plot because I do not want to spoil the movie in this review. The acting in this film is surprisingly good considering these actors were mostly likely paid close to nothing. Theobald, Haw, and Russell don't try to do too much with their performances. The script is so good that they don't need to do too much here, they just need to bring the script to life, and they all do a great job.Many short (this one is only 70 minutes), low-budget films suffer not only due to lack of character development, but also because they fail to be emotionally resonant. Following succeeds on both accounts because the characters are well introduced and they all show change throughout the story. We also find ourselves caring for this young writer, even though we constantly see him going through the items of strangers and making less than chivalrous decisions. We sense he isn't a criminal, he's just a broken man looking for guidance. When he meets Cobb and they rob their first house together, it's as if Theobald's character receives an oxygen boost, a new sense of life. But that doesn't mean he is a bad person; if anything, it proves just how desperate he is to have a path in life.I would recommend any Nolan fan to check this film out if they haven't already. There is something that is really intriguing in watching the film now after Nolan has become a major success. People might forget how great of a storyteller he is after some of his recent big-budget productions, but in this film, his ability to weave a fascinating story is in full display.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cobb's tips for home-burgling (from the film FOLLOWING)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1)Always wear a tie, and preferably, make the rounds with another guy. That way, you can casually use the bottom end of the tie to press the doorbell, without leaving a traceable fingerprint. (What about the second guy? I cannot remember if this was an implicit or explicit tip, but two young guys in ties are the universally recognized symbol of religious proselytizers. The addendum to this rule, which Cobb's protégé "the young man," aka Bill, aka Danny, ignores at first, is to always be clean-shaven.) 2)Always carry latex gloves in your pocket. If your tie does not bring anyone to the door--and if no neighbors are around--you put the gloves on OUTSIDE the to-be-burgled home, PRIOR to entry.3)Look for the homeowner's "hidden" key before picking their lock with a credit card. (Finding and using the key is usually faster.)4)"Everyone has a (keepsake) box." Find and rifle through that first, as burglars should "take things away to show (victims) what they HAD" (not the least of which was their pre-burglary peace-of-mind).P.S.--Perhaps there are other burglary tips that could be derived from real-life burglary victim\FOLLOWING director Christopher Nolan's film, but these are the ones that stood out for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A definitive film-noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Following', the first full-length movie by Christopher Nolan, blows away the viewer completely, and by the end of this just-over-an-hour movie, you are completely convinced that this director is over-flowing with talent. The movie proves that one does not need to have an extravagant budget or a famous celebrity to create an intelligent and entertaining movie. Astonishingly clever, and very sadistic in nature, the film gets full marks for the gripping use of fragmented story-telling and a flawless script. The director puts the black-and-white effect to his full advantage, and delivers a film noir which surprises the audience with its intelligence. Also mention-worthy is the music score, which fits in at all the right moments, and give an essential sense of suspense to the film. Kudos to the music director for the innovative background music. The only minus point, as I see it, is in the acting department. Jeremy Theobald and Alex Haw's acting is acceptable, but not entirely mesmerizing. At some places, the dialog delivery is just not natural. Lucy Russell also falls just fine. Overall, this movie is a visual treat for suspense-seeking gluttons and those who like intelligent and sophisticated thrillers. Go for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When film started i did not think i was going to like it, but i held in there and kept watching. It started to grow on me and then i looked at my Netflix Package and saw that it was Christopher Nolan directing. I had no idea, but then all of a sudden I was watching the film from a different perspective. Isn't that funny. All of a sudden I liked it much better. I feel bad for being so easily persuaded, but nevertheless this was a well made and I am to assume low budget film for Mr. Nolan. Very similar to his Momento" editing back and forth, forth and back cutting style. I had to watch a few parts over again to understand, but once I did I was glad I watched it over. The acting is okay, the directing is simple. It is nicely shot in black and white, some of it seems over blown but maybe it was ny television. There is a very interesting score as well. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Following</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently seen Following, both the original version and the chronological one, both of which available on the DVD. This movie is an amazing achievement for a guy who didn't go to film school. Nolan is a great talent and maybe he becomes our time's Hitch. Well, obviously Nolan enjoys messing around with the audience. The non-linear version of the film seems like an intelligent thriller - it's exiting to the bitter end. But, it' s only a way of editing. This editing style gives the film an elegant touch, as well as covering holes in the story. You really have to concentrate to follow the main plot, so then you easily accept holes in the sub-plots. Well, when watching the chronological version you find numerous logical errors. Additionally there are scenes that should be added to the film. The core of the film is this: Cobb is afraid of being accused of a murder so he makes Bill look like the guilty one. Well, the crime which is the most important event has been left out of the film. Probably they didn't shoot this scene at all. In cinematic terms this is bad storytelling. The answer to all the missing material in the film is of course all the limits this production had, as well as Nolan's lack of experience. I guess his idea was to make a linear film and, when editing, discovered this didn't work. Instead of re-shooting he played with his material in the editing period. Like other great directors, he understood that cinema is a way manipulating the audience. Other great films with non linear structure: Memento (of course) and L'Appartement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know what kind of director Christopher Nolan is now since most movie lovers have seen Memento, Batman Begins or The Prestige. However, like any great director, his amateur, low-budget indie films are just as interesting. Following, a 70-minute story about two men in London that break and enter into people's houses, plays more like a TV episode than a movie. Nevertheless, it packs more into it than any TV show could do. Despite being shot in grainy black and white, the film still has a nice look to it, giving the surroundings and characters a sense of gloom and doom in this neo-noir story. The acting is pretty good, despite all the actors being amateurs as well. Still, Nolan maintains serious suspense by borrowing a page from Quentin Tarantino and telling this story completely out of chronological order. Doing this increases suspense as well as keeps the audience interested. So, if you are interested in seeing a low-budget, well-made suspense movie, Following is a good place to start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan uses his signature fragmented story telling skills to tell a gripping tale. The film is intriguing when viewed the first time. Like most of Nolan's movie, the cards fall in place in the end to complete the picture. While this works well for complex plots, the plot at the heart of this film is straightforward. Hence the fragmented narrative, especially on second viewing, seems as a forced attempt by the director to complicate a simple story. That said,the movie is well-directed and you can see glimpses of the genius that Nolan would eventually show in Memento and The Prestige. The movie is an engaging watch and with its short running time, the first viewing is breezily exciting. And since the plot is simple, there aren't many alternate theories that need to thought of to understand the intelligence of the movie. Overall, a delightful when first viewed. Repeat viewings may not be that pleasing.</fullReview>

I was lucky enough to see an add in the paper for "Following" playing at the local College and I didn't want to miss it. Nolan tells the story of a struggling writer who finds himself in a world of trouble when he tries a new style of creating characters. The movie uses the same technique as in "Memento" where the same story is told at different times and all the stories come together at the end for a brilliant ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's odd how many similarities I can draw between the feature film debuts of some of today's most gifted directors. Take for example Darren Arrenofsky, Quentin Tarantino, and of course Christopher Nolan. Each of their respective features was shot in black and white (Tarantino originally intended to shoot `Reservoir Dogs' in b&amp;w but things changed when he got a real budget for the film by attracting talents like Harvey Keitel, but still maintained his high contrast palette of Black, White and Red), which is something they do in order to save time and money in setting up the scenes to have the right colors and contrast. Also, black and white film is cheaper. What they manage to do is concentrate on telling the best story in their respective genres, getting the best performances they possibly can out what is usually friends and acquaintances. They show at this early stage that they what counts, that being a fantastic script, the finest performances they can get out of their actors, and the best cinematography their visions can get from their tiny budgets. Not surprising that I find myself greatly enjoying these first time features, sometimes even more than the great films they make afterwards (Tarantino = Pulp Fiction, Nolan = Memento, Arrenofsky = Requiem for a Dream), which, by a hair, is the case with this one. `Following' tells the story of a writer whose hobby is to follow strangers around simply to see what they do in a day. Things suddenly change when he is confronted by one of the people he is following, a thief by the name of Cobb who convinces him to break into an apartment without the intention of stealing but rather to rearrange certain things in such a way as to affect their lives. If I go any further I may spoil to surprises to come, and there are many. This movie only gets better as time passes, almost transforming into something else by the time it is done. I was so shocked by the ending that I desperately rewound to see what I had missed. Should have known, what I saw here was the early development of the technique he used in `Memento' telling its story from different points in time. Both these films are different, so don't think he just re-made `Memento' from this. He's obviously got more tricks up his sleeve. Another plus about this movie is in not knowing who the actors are, and watching them simply be these characters. In no way did I second guess their performance, instead I believed they were who I saw on my screen, watching as people stab each other in the back, wondering the whole time how things will add up and who's going to do what. Playing at a tad over an hour you will not believe just how much they manage to fit into this story, a perfect example of a well labored script, not wasting anytime on useless filler nor rushing us in and out of important scenes. Visually I found `Following' to be gorgeous. It is not over ambitious in its appearance, knowing at all times that its substance is much more important than its style, yet it perfectly captures the scenes moods and the feeling of its characters. I loved the editing, which combined with the overlapping voice-overs completely had me entranced, pulling me deeper into this tale of deceit. I leaned forward towards the t.v. many times throughout this picture, almost wanting to look harder even though I knew that would only get me in more trouble. With films such as this that has always been the case, the harder you try to figure things out the harder it is to follow.  Do yourself a favor and rent this if you're able to find it. Knowing that most of you out there enjoyed `Memento' then you should definitely give `Following' a chance, and you might find yourself liking this film as much as that one. Again great praise to Mr. Nolan for giving us all something to aspire to as storytellers and for keeping me guessing, now having managed to do it 3 times. (`Following', `Memento', and `Insomnia'? seems like he enjoys using one word disorders as titles).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I was very impressed with this movie. After watching this movie, I can now say with confidence that Christopher Nolan is a genius. At first, I didn't know what to expect with this movie. Of course I had read the back's description... but that didn't prepare me for what turned out to be such an amazing movie. The black and white gives the movie a feel of coldness. One thing I especially enjoyed about this movie was Cobb's dialogue, when they first break into the apartment. It is simply brilliant. It provided so much insight into how we live our lives. I can't recall how many times I thought to myself, "ya, that's true". The way the story was structured was great. At first, I didn't expect this so I was really confused. Luckily, I caught on soon enough. Being a fan of Nolan's other masterpiece Memento (where are all the nominations?!), I really love the way he uses time to distort what we perceive. A great feature on the DVD was to play the story in chronological order. I wish this was also done on the Memento DVD. All in all, this was a great movie. If you were a fan of Memento, you definitely need to check this out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, I have not had the fortune of ever writing a comment on IMDB before, but I plan to start today by writing a commentary on the great movie, Following, by Christopher Nolan. Having seen Memento before this movie, I had very high expectations, and I am glad to say that these expectations were thoroughly met with this 61 minute film noir. No review quite accurately describes Following. Imagine, if you will, Memento filmed completely in black and white. Much lower budget, but still not completely shabby style. The film is similar in many ways to Memento, building the foundation which led to the excellent film which has been added to many critics' (not that that means anything special)top 100 movies of all time lists. The plot line is not really all that important, but it is the characters, dialogue, and overall atmosphere of the film that makes it what it is. It's very unique, and shows a great deal about the human mind, if you can believe that, and is a very entertaining film. Although thoroughly surpassed by Christopher Nolan's later work, Memento, Following is definitely worth looking into if you are in the mood for a great film that requires little time, but much insight.</fullReview>

The B&amp;W shots in this film beautifully depict the simplicity of the character and story, and yet with Nolan's ingenious style he is able to weave you into the web of evil that falls upon our main character.

He is the perfect mix of intelligence, flash, and violence for such a film.Scenes appear out of sequence, and can be confusing at times, but after you've been watching a while, everything comes together. The surprise ending is one of the best I've ever encountered. Not one person who views the film will ever guess it.Whereas "Memento" was overly long and had a number of dull parts interpsersed throughout, "Following" is gripping the entire time. It's also just about an hour in length.It could not have cot much to film this at all, as it is simply made in a series of plain London apartments and out on the street. It's just more evidence that expensive and gaudy special effects are no substitute for sharp acting, strong writing and directing, and thoughtful input.</fullReview>

The story is difficult to understand and gets clear only in the last few minutes of the movie, just like in Nolan's other masterpiece Memento. Of course, I saw Memento first or else I probably wouldn't have noticed Following. Even while some parts of the scripts are alike, like flashbacks and flashforwards these are two absolute different movies.Christopher Nolan shows that he is a brilliant Thriller-director and writer, because he keeps the viewer on the edge of his or her seat for the entire movie and then surprises the viewer with a superb climax.Like Memento I gave Following 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impressive British noir-type debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am probably in the minority but I enjoyed and liked this more than Nolan's much more lauded ?follow-up' ?Memento'. The plot is fiendishly well organised with the loner-figure of Bill, a struggling writer, slowly drawn into the oddball world of Cobb, a respectable-looking burglar, but whose eventual intentions are far from genteel. Gradually, the emotionally vulnerable Bill is drawn to one of Cobb's victims, merely titled the Blonde (a suitably sexy Lucy Russell) who soon appears to be far more involved in matters than at first suggested. The ex-girlfriend of a criminal figure, she makes an intriguing femme fatale. A theme common to both of Nolan's films is about how people deceive one another and use one another, quite ruthlessly, for their own ends. As the plot strands come together, Bill is obviously the unwitting victim of the much more cunning Cobb, but I don't wish to spoil the ending for others and will only say that it has another well worked twist. Set in London, most of the locations are interiors or on crowded streets and rooftops. In fact, it shies away from the stereotype London settings of many British films, and deserves praise for that. As a thriller with noirish pretensions, it makes the work of another British director Guy Ritchie look like someone in short-trousers.I am surprised 'Following' didn't receive a wider general release or more coverage on its debut. I think its video release is more to do with the director's recent success, which is a shame, because it's an interesting film in its own right.As many here have already stated, Nolan's the kind of director whose career is going to be interesting to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Indie Noir Ever!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>******SPOILERS******I was lucky enough to view "Following" as a midnite movie at the Uptown Theatre in Minneapolis. Free admission thanks to a "friend of a friend" was great, but I would have happily paid full price for this tight little indie-noir thriller. There is no mistaking this for a Christopher Nolan film--solid writing, ingenious plot twists, inventive time dilation effects, and an ending that leaves you wishing the projectionist would start us over from frame one. Anyone who loved "Memento" (Nolan's latest) will need to see this as well. In some ways, this film was a testing ground for Nolan's oft-used "Memento" technique of building suspense by revealing a specific EFFECT scene and then forcing you into tense speculation as he slowly reveals the CAUSE scene(s). Nolan subverts the traditional thriller technique of building suspense, turning it completely on it's head by revealing what happens right away! Brilliant...Like Fight Club, Sixth Sense, Usual Suspects, Memento, etc., this is a film that f---'s with your perceptions from the opening shot to the close. Once the veil is lifted and the plot twists become clear (think Tyler Durden's identity, Bruce Willis the ghost, Kaiser Sose's identity, Leonard's John G., etc.), then you are let in on the secret that has been right in front of your eyes the whole time. All of these films leave you wanting a second viewing, and "Following" is no exception. Hopefully, Nolan's debut film will get a DVD release OR maybe even be included on a special two-disk "Memento" Special Edition!? We can only hope...Great film -- great filmmaker -- looking forward to his third film ("Insomnia" in 2002 with Al Pacino).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Done in BW, this modern tale is disconcerting in its erratic time sequences. It appears to start with a young, unemployed writer telling his plight to a counselor. Then maybe he really isn't a writer but just a bum justifying laziness. Then a male subject he is studying turns the tables on him. A female sex object appears from several entry points at once. Crimes start happening, but who is the criminal and who the victim? Is the club owner/gangster the chief villain? Is the finale really the end? If you want to tie it up neater than that you can, but the ends keep coming loose.Fair entertainment for a rainy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Following" tells of a struggling writer who shadows people as research for his work and in the process falls in with a burglar and finds himself inextricably embroiled in a scheme which could lead to his own end. A Brit flick in black and white, this austere production lacks the usual Hollywoodish tinsel but makes up for the deficit with a solid story line which will keep you guessing to the end....and, unfortunately, beyond. Good stuff for those into UK indie films where the focus is more on intricately woven story complexities than budget and baubles. (B-)Note - The DVD I watched, which came from Netflix.com, had an annoying icon in the corner, would jump a scene at a time in fast forward and fast reverse, and pixelated periodically. However, it did have extra features including script pages sync'd with the dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Following; an obsession.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan makes his first full film directorial debut with this quirky Indy film about a young Brit(Jeremy Thebold), who has an odd obsession of following people. He just picks out strangers and shadows them. Curious about where they go, and relatively harmless...at first. He picks out a sharp dressed young man named Cobb(Alex Haw)that actually has the same "hobby". The two like-minded men graduate to breaking and entering; taking what they want and leaving odd, but obvious things out of place just to play with their victim's mind. As the story seems to jump to and fro, you don't actually have a good time line. Some clever scenes will hold your interest; but things get real good when a gritty blonde(Lucy Russell)lets the two men know they have met their match. My favorite scene is when you watch one of these "followers" duct tape a ton of money to himself. Nolan not only directs;he writes just as well. Keep on your mind that he moves on to MEMENTO and THE DARK KNIGHT. Nolan proves to deserve his following.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nolan's weakest Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following has some interesting ideas, and it certainly isn't a bad film, but it is my least favorite Christopher Nolan film to date. Nolan is a great director who would go on to direct some great movies (Memento, Inception, The Dark Knight), but his first movie just didn't do much for me personally.I actually just finished watching this movie for a second time earlier today, and I've already forgotten it. That's the big problem with this movie, it's very boring at times and almost completely forgettable. It has the same non-coherent style of storytelling that Nolan would use on Momento, but for me it just felt unneeded.To be fair, the acting is good, it has some neat ideas, and I really loved the twist ending, but for the most part I just sat there uninterested.Following isn't a bad movie, it's just forgettable. It's my least favorite Nolan movie to date, and while I applaud him for making this movie on a shoestring budget, the final product left me disappointed.5.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Following - Which Made me follow Nolan aka intelligent director of our times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have a $6000, 16mm camera in your hand. What will you do to turn the world towards you?Nolan did "Following" and the rest as they say is history.I searched the web umpteen times to get this flick but many a times all in vain. However eventually i got this and when i complete watching this I made my mind that Christopher Nolan is the best contemporary director we have alive in the planet. Such a genius he is! Following is a piece of art shot by Nolan himself for months since they had to shoot only during the weekends because whoever acted( or lived? ) in this flick had other jobs to do. However Following delivers with its sheer brilliance and pure cinematic awesomeness the director created! Following looks like a precursor to Memento with different story but with same execution and its narration style. A wannabe writer who runs out of ideas starts following random people for creating interesting characters for his writing. He has certain rules not to get into trouble while shadowing somebody. When he breaks his own rules things get nasty and movie ends with a fine twist which i can bet you, you cant think of.The story is in non chronological order as per Nolan's classic style.The dialogs are simply brilliant. I can see Nolan's literature degree helping him highly here. "Everyone has a box ," "You steal them and show them what they got" will be remembered for years to come by his fans. But not without any reason. Every word each character utter has a reason and a deep underlying meaning to it. The scenes just flow in random without any linear structure which makes us engrosses all the time. The background score is minimal and its best when used. The editing is slick with the flick running over just over an hour. Photography is again brilliant. How many brilliance in one movie? :( Shot using a 16mm camera the whole flick is in black and white hinting its budget, but never compromises in its quality.Nolan shows the world a phenomenal and a path breaking flick can be made with his knack for making movies even when given a constraint of budget. After seeing this somehow Kubrick's quote came to my mind which says " If its written, it can be definitely made into a movie". Similarly as the movies famous dialog says "You steal them and show them what they got", Nolan here steals our heart and shows us what he has got. Needless to say its sheer brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved 'Memento', and was excited to see the release of Nolan's first film, 'Following'. I wasn't sure what to expect, and I think that is the best way to approach this movie. I will say it is very confusing, but has a very satisfying ending where all your questions are answered. Imagine watching 'Memento' and knowing exactly what was going on at the end. That is 'Following'. Is it better to know the answers? Stop reading reviews. Go in blind. Watch this movie, find out for yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a frame wasted!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When everything in the theaters seems to have the word "epic" attached to its tagline (not to mention a 3-hour running time) it becomes easy to appreciate a film as tightly constructed as FOLLOWING. Christopher Nolan continues to mess around with everything conventional from narration and pacing, to a cognitive time frame (think Harold Pinter), and to great effect. Crisp dialogue, appropriately dry acting, and tight editing. It's kind of a training ground for MEMENTO (lots of recycled ideas), but definitely worth seeing on its own. Nolan takes a little more intellectual approach towards his characters than someone like Paul Thomas Anderson, but comparisons to Hitchcock are, for once, apt. The Master of Suspense knew how to manipulate his audience, and Christopher Nolan is certainly not lacking in that department.8/10Dan</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Nolan is God!!!!!!!!!. Hands Down this is the best suspense movie of the 90's. Mind you Nolan made Memento in 2000 and that even beats this. But oh my god, the movie is stunning and narration is excellent.A writer has a very weird habit of following people, but frames rules for himself so that he does not get into trouble (as rules are meant to be broken), he gets into trouble.Unlike Memento where the full story was told in the reverse, here the movie is told in 2 parts with consecutive scenes in each. So the viewer can relate what happens now to see what had happened before.The last 30 Min's have some of the finest moments and the last scene which happens to be the start of the movie leaves you staggering.the guy who wrote the script for the movie whoever it is "he is too good"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Following: 7/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Christopher Nolan had made Memento before Following, then all of the flaws in Following would have been corrected. In Memento, Nolan constructed the switches in time perfectly. We were able to tell when it was the past, when it's current, etc. However, Nolan experimented with it a little, and it just doesn't work. Although he had a small budget and couldn't use color (which is one way Memento worked), it was just too hard to distinguish between time. On the DVD is a feature that allows you to play the scenes in chronological order. I intended to write my review after watching it, so hopefully it would make more sense, but, of course, it wasn't working.You can't blame Nolan for not coming up with original ideas. A young man, Bill (Jeremy Theobald), is bored, so he decides to follow random people on the street. He finds one, Cobb (Alex Haw), that particularly interests him. Soon, Bill becomes friends with Cobb and goes with him as he breaks into houses and robs them. Then, a saucy young blond (Lucy Russell) enters, and the movie becomes even weirder from there.The ending of Following is one of the most shocking endings I've seen. Sure, Fight Club had an amazing ending, but the way that Following's ending played out was amazing. I felt like someone had smacked me on the head and given me a concussion. Nolan has a thing for making good endings (well, maybe not, I could guess Insomnia's from a mile away), and can really construct a great story. Following may not be the easiest to follow or look at, but it's such a finely crafted, original story with a shocker ending that you'll probably want to watch all of its 70 minutes again.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language and some violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No-budget film noir lacks a following</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhere I saw this movie described as a "no-budget film noir". Making a film on a small budget and having it come out a success is not without precedent. However, the roughness around the edges of this movie got in the way of me really enjoying it. One example is the ending credits screen, which could have been of higher quality. Black-and-white photography works well here as a story-telling tool, but shaking and jittery movements that are apparently a result of hand-held camera-work distracts the viewer's attention (unlike the Blair Witch Project, where jittery camera movements are to be expected).This film would be great as something used in a film class to show individuality in style; however, as a commercial venture it fails to hold a candle to Memento (where Nolan really got things right) or Blood Simple.My review: 6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nolan Nails It On The First Try</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young writer who follows strangers for material meets a thief who takes him under his wing.This is a film that one has to watch carefully. Not unlike Nolan's other early film ("Memento"), the plot is not revealed in order. While everywhere will make sense when you are finished, you may want to watch it again to be sure you followed. And, like "Memento", the film works best like this. Could Nolan have showed us the story in order? Absolutely. But then we would not have the twists -- we would know them too early.This film may be called neo-noir, and it does have the black and white in distinct fashion to support that characterization. How much the plot is noir is a matter of debate. There is a certain "underworld" element to it, but there is also a strong psychological angle. This may be called a thriller. But whatever you call it, it is a fine piece of work, and Nolan really shows his talents in this short (70 minute) experiment.</fullReview>

This film presents some really interesting ideas and interesting story, but I didn't find it to be particularly well-ended. It was black and white, it was short and low budget, but from the middle of this movie I felt it is going to shakeup! and it did. The acting doesn't match the audacity of the script. The script doesn't stand up in a court of logic. The promise fails to fulfill the idea.</fullReview>

In many ways it reminds me of the cult movie PI , a film I disliked , and I can`t get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be writer following people around . Wouldn`t it be more logical for someone wanting to be a writer to sit in front of a keyboard and write ? Oh well I guess FOLLOWING gives indie film makers hope that just because they made a no budget movie costing $6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and over five hundred members will comment on it , but you have to wonder if this movie would be so well regarded if it wasn`t made by the director of MEMENTO ?</fullReview>
