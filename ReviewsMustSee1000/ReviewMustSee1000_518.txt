		<shortDescription>Cheech and Chong see the Millenium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been done before in "Friday", and "Up in Smoke." There's no great plot line. There's no moral plea. There's no character development, cool graphics, intense cinematography or internal conflict. And yet. This movie defies all the rules of story writing and film making. The absolute preposterousness of the storyline alone is intellectually offensive. And yet.It was hilarious. From beginning to end, I laughed. Warning: This is what my mother would call "ignorant humor". The things that in the opinion of the majority degrade and offend, but for some reason are funny. Rappers Method Man (Wu Tang Clan) and Redman play two "potheads" (for lack of a better term) who through the use of a magical herb attain brilliance and gain acceptance to Harvard University. There is a scene that spoofs the old Reese's Peanut Butter Cup commercial where Method's character Silas sits in his car with a bag of contraband and no blunt. In the next car Redman's character Jamal sits in his car with blunt and no contraband. And thus a friendship is born. The two Ivy Leaguers wreak havoc along the Eastern Seaboard Cheech and Chong style. You can tell by watching his MTV Cribs special that he has a funny bone. But who knew Redman was a bonafide comedian. Method Man was more or less the straight man but the rest of the ensemble cast provided enough laughs to split your sides. Especially notable was Mike Epps who portrayed Babypowder the Pimp. Can you imagine a pimp at Harvard? The alumni will no doubt write many letters. Parents: The subject matter of this film is questionable. This film may not be suitable for children. Unless you smoked a lot of "grass" back in the 70's. Then you can't trip because you'll be hypocrite if you do. There's more marijuana in this film than "Friday" and "Next Friday" put together. If that's a turn on for you then by all means see the film. If it's a turn off for you go see it anyway. The Harvard Pimp is worth it.Don't tell my mother I laughed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great comedy, but not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly I want to say: I have to comment this film as reaction to negative commentaries. I found that people who have written attacking commentary must have a bad experience with drugs (I mean light, I count alcohol in this group), or are hypocritical and never taste it. Most people are enjoying talking (and writing) about things that they don't know and that they don't understand. I vote 9 because it is great comedy even I know that most people will not understand 90 percent of jokes. But every voting is subjective, isn't it? So for people who did not see this film ever and maybe they will: don't expect anything, because expectation will make deformation of your feelings and understanding. And If you are apriori of anti-drugs intence: do not see it rather. It is very easy to give it bad evaluation but it is very difficult to make good comedy. Keep it in mind and vote if you like it. And if you liked it, watch it again: you will find another jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Highly' underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a proud fan of lowbrow humor and a fan of Method Man and Redman, "How High" seemed like a no-brainer comedy, and I was right! This movie can only do harm to people who get offended easily at racial stereotypes, pot smoking and more pot smoking. The movie pokes fun at everyone; class and race. One glance at How High would make you think they're trying to make another "Animal House". Well, I think it's up there. It's got everything except the fraternities. From childish pranks to goofy humor, Meth and Red carry the movie to its predictable conclusion. Many people will write this off as another "Black comedy", but it really is a comedy for everyone. It just "happens" to star two charismatic rap artists. Director Jesse Dylan (yes, Bob's son) knows how to set up a joke and pull the punchline. This film is far funnier than the last two "Friday" films combined (Yes, let's just compare it to other pothead comedies). The supporting cast is terrific as well, including the clueless Fred Willard and uptight Obba Babatunde. The only downside is Mike Epps' pimp character, done much better by Eddie Griffin in "Deuce Bigalow." The bottom line: Rent it, have a few beers and some good laughs without taking it too seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allow me to explain why it's Hilarious!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand the fact that everyone has got their own taste when it comes to a movie genre and therefore some might feel that a "comedy" is based on a particular set of principles, essentially going into humour. But there are different ways in which many people perceive humour, some believe it's all about the jokes, some enjoy the swearing involved and others might love the typical Woody Allen script.This movie isn't set to achieve an Oscar or any kind of prestigious award. I am pretty sure that that was the last thing that came through the writer's and director's minds. The only thing they intended to do was to make a film that could be enjoyed by the audience that loves the stereo-typing comedy films, which to be honest is growing faster and faster. And they nailed it.The story is hilarious, the acting, well method and redman are hilarious at what they do best, which is fool around. Don't expect any intelligent sophisticated humour or satire. I'm not implying that the movie is full of dumb humour, on the contrary, its loaded with brilliant funny situations and loads of jokes. If you liked soul plane, then you're going to love this one.So don't vote negatively just because it wasn't your cup of tea and try to understand that there's a different generation out there that really appreciates a good fun entertaining movie to watch as they also appreciate the other styles of "comedy".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bible for Weed Smokers!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For everyone who doesn't like movies about weed,stop reading this is not your movie. Some non pod smokers will think the movie is OK. But this is the 'CULT' movie of smoking weed. From the 1st scene till the last scene,this movie does not stop. There are none not funny scenes to built up the story. You could see is as one funny sketch after the other. The story basically is a guy Silas, who grows weed,and one day his friend dies. He puts his ash in his next plant,that he names after him(The Ivory,still want to smoke that one day). He meets another pod head at THC's(test for higher learning) and with the help of Ivory they get the highest score. And they choose the Ivy League atmosphere of Harvard. They turn Harvard up side down. You have to smoke one before you watch this movie,it's still funny if you don't,but its meant to be seen stoned!!!! I've seen this movie about 20 times,and I'm from the country where the realest smokers be(Holland) and we all dig this movie,you HEARD,this is the smokers bible!!!! What are you doing get some grass and watch this movie!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the funniest comedies of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jesse Dylan's (yes son of Bob Dylan if that's and indication) How High is a concoction of weed, more weed, college and sheer belly laughs. There is something about marijuana used in comedies that makes the comedy better, though it depends on if the jokes are delivered right and with the right zing. Cheech and Chong had that to a T and comedies like Half Baked and Friday got pretty close to that tradition, as does this movie which is surprising since this is Method Man and Redman's first comedy together and is co-produced by Danny DeVito.Method Man here is a mass weed grower who grinds the ashes of his departed friend into his plant which helps him and his new friend played by Redman, score high on exams that get them excepted into Harvard university. This kicks off the usual lot of characters you would expect in a college comedy- the losers, the jock, the overly harsh teachers and dean, the nice girl the lead gets and other girls. From the looks of that plotline it looks pretty standard and it is if you take the film as seriously as you would Up In Smoke and Animal House, but the film's big kick comes from the charm (did I just say that?) and humor from the two stars, the gags they encounter and the supporting characters input as well. In other words, if you mind the grass, this isn't for you, but for people who are fans of the stars or just want a high comedy time, this is for you. Hector Elizondo, Jeffrey Jones have small parts; Cypress Hill appears unbilled. A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How High is just what Amercia needed in this year, a funny flick that doesn't take itself seriously. The plot is good and the acting by Method Man whose always good is great. Redman and Mike Epps both steal every scene their in as does I Need Money. My only problem with the film was the lack of nudity. But I still give it a 5/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even if you're a partier, if your IQ is over 85 skip this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pathetic when a stoner movie sucks even when you've been partying. The biggest problem I had with this was the rampant racism. If this movie was made by two whites and showed such awful stereotypes of blacks the cries of racism would be heard all over. Except for some reason blacks are allowed to do this? The white people in this movie are all portrayed as dumb, stuck-up, prudish, etc. Of course our brothers are the cool ones who turn everyone around, right? The problem with this movie compared to say Animal House, is that they aren't the innocent party being picked on by the system. Instead, they are a couple of complete @$$#0!3s who are the antagonists and start their own battles. They instigate the animosity by being a bunch of loud-mouth, ignorant, aggressive jerks. However I guess for the viewer we're suppose to think it's funny, otherwise we're racists ourselves cuz that's 'their way'. The part with digging up the corpse while dragging their whining fat white roommate along just revolted me. In the real world their fat white roommate would have turned them in and the two would have been arrested - but then that would have been racism, right? Aside from that the jokes are stupid and there's a lot of inaccuracies (maybe the film makers could use a semester at a college themselves). For instance, the Chinese kid whose the "youngest Harvard freshman ever" looks like he's 22. Also when Silo or whatever his name is picks a bud off his pot plant &amp; smokes it, the bud is hanging whereas buds grow upright. Nor does he dry and cure it first. Not very smart for the smart grower he's suppose to be. I wish Hollywood would produce an intelligent stoner movie for once that caters to people with an IQ over 85.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Method Man and Redman go to Harvard in a phat dope comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be biased here: I love Meth and Redman's music. Whether it's solo, in collaborations with others, or when they do an album together. these two are among the premier rappers in the industry. So despite the films heavy emphasis of promoting marijuana use, which I'm not sold on, I had to see this movie, because I'm a big fan of rap music and would rather see these guys in films over the likes of Britney and Mariah any day.How High is hilariously funny, but it's not for everybody. You have to be fans of these fine gentlemen or have a crazy sense of humour. The rappers play Silas and Jamal, two young men who live for their pot and sexing. One day, after a friend of Silas was killed in a hilarious accident, Silas and Jamal are smoking a potent type of pot that gives them a high that allows them to "see dead people", namely Ivory, the man who was killed in the accident. He is able to give them the answers to all the questions on their SATs and that allows them to go to any college they want, and so they pick Harvard.The film has them doing their thing, turning Harvard upside down with their decidedly different attitude and angering the dean (Obba Babatunde, with his name as Dean Cain, after the actor from Superman:The Series).There are some crazy scenes in this film, such as when they run out of the special pot and they go to a graveyard to dig up the body of President John Quincy Adams, hoping that his brain could help them pass the courses or that weirdo who passes out tickets reacts to seeing his bicycle being destroyed. This film is so out there!The acting is actually good and the characters have vibrancy. Also in the film are another great rap group, Cypress Hill, and former NBC alums Anna-Marie Horsford (Amen), Fred Willard (DC Follies), and yes, Lisa from Saved By The Bell (Lark Voorhies).The DVD contains a lot of stuff, from the usual documentaries, music videos, commentary, etc to neat things like the "Hide The Stash" game where you have to find Meth and Red's pot by clicking on the correct 420 and there's even a preview of Eminem's "8 Mile" film. All in all, a lot of fun; if you're like me in my mind frame, see it. This film might be a cult rental like Showgirls and The Doors are for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Toke on mediocre film makers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How High knows it is simply a vanity project to give a couple rappers a day job and an IMDb credit. The two being: Method Man as Silas: A smart cookie and renowned local weed-chemist who would rather be developing new strains of powerful weed than furthering his education.Redman as Jamal: A street smart but not very book smart young guy who wants to get into college only because his Mum demands it.When the ghost of Silas's deceased friend helps them ace the entrance exam with perfect scores ? yep it's that easy folks ? they decide Harvard is the place for their further education.Both guys nab hotties in quicktime, Meth the cute egghead and Red the crazy skank from esteemed parentage.The usual "cool but frankly inappropriate guys getting up to stuff while the squares gasp" ensues.Fred Willard is the oblivious old white guy in a senior role who thinks these two guys are just super. Hector Elizondo is the old white guy in a senior role who suddenly thinks he is black and ends up acting thusly, and the film ends with a formal gathering in which the boys get everyone stoned and the staid old white people getting fonkay in impromptu fashion. (If you're a stoner and fret that this will ruin your enjoyment thanks to the spoiler don't worry, you'll forget in just a minute anyway.) In between are various parties, pranks, white people not understanding and such. In answer to the obvious question of How High? The two guys are perpetually stoned and therefore very high, the movie unfortunately never scales any such heights.Final Rating ? 5 / 10. About what you think it will be. A couple of charismatic guys spouting slang and cracking wise at those in the "establishment" (Damn You Establishment!).The moral of the story here is that stoner comedies are made for stoners. In 20 years of watching films I can recall only one that made me laugh, Harold and Kumar go to White Castle? and even that wasn't great.But who am I to hate: Toke on mediocre film makers!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Making a comedy based around pot-smoking, for an appropriate audience that certainly doesn't want to have to concentrate too much, should not usually pose much of a problem for film-makers. But for the producers of this movie they sure have proved that this was a challenge they were willing to not only take on and accept, but then monumentally lose at. Production-value wise it comes across as a quite polished and adequately accomplished piece, mostly on the whole. The only problem being, and it's a biggy.... is that the predicaments, scenes, and jokes just aren't all that funny. And that is even though they are unquestionably coming from the almost bottomless source-material pit known as "base-humour". Having seen the fantastic "I'm Gonna Git You Sucka" and the absolutely superb and unmatched "Don't Be A Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood" i know how good African-American base-humour comedies can be. In fact, Juice in the Hood is easily one of the best comedies i have ever seen. But this movie pales into absolute insignificance when compared to the non-stop bellylaugh quality humour of either of those. And therefore, with such high expectations, it only added to my eventual disappointment when i watched this film of mostly monotonous and largely childish fodder. Terrible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...this movie is not. I'm actually watching this movie right now, a painful scene where a Harvard university student's bicycle is stolen and smashed by our nice stars, Jamal &amp; Silas.The movie kicks off with a load of racial stereo types jokes, the obnoxious rich white kids in the rowing team, the "down with it" stoner characters.But I digress, this is obviously a stoner flick, if you're after a high school comedy try... well just about anything else. If like stoner movies and you want to spend an hour and a half watching two rappers harassing the annoying Bart, while flirting with every chick on the campus, then this will sit well with your expectations.If you like movies with true humour, which don't make you feel dumber after watching it, then you would be well advised to avoid this movie. I could back up my view that this is a bad movie, but that would require me sitting through more of this "Police Academy on Pot" movie. (switches movie off).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my cup of tea, though it had its moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never indulged in any kind of illegal substance in my life, so this may explain why for the most part I didn't find "How High" to be terribly funny. Maybe those who are into weed (and who smoke weed while watching the movie) may be able to relate to it on some level and find it more amusing than I did. Anyway, I didn't care for the lead characters, not only because of their obsession for weed, but that they were exceedingly foul-mouthed and mocking of others. Indeed, the message seemed to be that those who work hard for success at studies or in other ventures are somehow inferior. However, I will admit that the movie wasn't completely terrible. There are a number of bizarre touches that took me off guard, moments that were so strange that they kept me watching. Some of these moments I admit I did find lightly amusing. Had the movie had gone more for the bizarre, there's a chance that I might had found the enterprise offbeat enough to recommend. But as it is, I would only recommend it to its target audience.

		<fullReview>?What is that stench?" ?Oh, that's my cologne, cannabis for men." How High is a must see for all people all over the world who like movies about weed. The movie is very innovative and funny and you won't be bored one minute while watching it. It's about two young, black men, called Silas and Jamal, who don't have any prospects in their lives until Silas' best friend Ivory dies. Silas uses his ashes as a fertilizer for some of his new cannabis plants. Smoking Silas' marijuana called "Ivory", Silas and Jamal get to know each other in front of the building they are going to do the entrance exam for college. They soon realize that Ivory appears as a ghost as soon as they start smoking "Ivory". Both of them pass the exam with perfect scores and they decide to go to college...The main roles of Silas and Jamal are played by two famous rappers called Method Man and Redman, who have got lots of good feedbacks for their excellent acting. Soundtracks were taken from their current album, which has the same name as the movie. Camera doesn't switch a lot what makes the movie very slow.To sum up, there has never been a movie like "How High" before what makes it very revolutionary. It gives you another, humorous view of how life on campus could be.</fullReview>

I suppose the premise was funny, that is, if you haven't ever watched Up in Smoke. Just think of it like an Up in Smoke crossed with a "hey look, I'm black...and you're not" movie (boy, I can't wait for Steve Martin's Bringing Down the House), and throw in a very generous dash of your stereotypical college movie (such as Van Wilder). Mix all parts, strain the worst parts from each, cut out any funny dialogue, then make sure the sections are poorly edited.I am very glad that I didn't pay money to see this movie. If you're thinking about renting it - don't. Unless you're very VERY high. In which case you should rent Up in Smoke instead.As side note, this movie doesn't end. It stops. Why does it just stop? I mean literally, the last few seconds of the movie are a frozen frame of nothing in particular, then the credits start rolling. There is no sense of conclusion, or even a final laugh.

		<fullReview>These doper movies play a game, a delicate game. The idea is primarily to make fun of stereotypes while at the same time exploiting them. They satisfy the relatively dumb viewers (like me) while making fun of them.That's a long tradition in humor and especially ethnic and black humor directly derived from self-deprecating Yiddish vaudeville.The story container is the same as in all sorts of similar projects: a collection of skits, some of which extend far to one side of this balance or another. Some are laughing with you, some at you.So how you receive this has something to with whether you are the targeted demographic and the rest to do with your mood at the time. Since the nature of the audience, its edge, changes so quickly, the balance in the humor goes out of date soon after release, so these movies are poor rentals.But I have to say that this one hit me right in the center. I liked it.Here's an indicator. Early in the movie a stoner dies and becomes a ghost who can only be seen when his buddies are stoned on pot grown in his ashes. Perhaps an ordinary movie would just stop there.The setup is that this guy rents Kevin Costner movies as a ploy to get sex. He is rebuffed so has to watch them alone, stoned of course. He sees himself in the movie, in the field of dreams in a baseball suit.Cool folding there. Tells us we are with a writer or filmmaker who knows what folding is about. This is straight Bob Dylan.There's some dialog about this folding. Then he passes out, catches fire, falls out a high window. Wait, he survives, stands up then gets creamed by a bus.Remember that scene in "Something About Mary" when the dog was electrocuted then thrown out the window. Same space, friends. You laugh, then laugh at yourself for laughing taunted by something behind the actors.It is a nearly perfect scene. See it just for that one risk.Much of the rest is dumb.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anybody who likes Red &amp; Meth has an idea of how great they work together on albums. This is an opportunity for us to see their co-existence on the big screen! The friendship they have in the real world is wonderfully portrayed when they become friends in this movie. Anyone who says this has been done before in movies like the "Friday" series, have no clue what either movie was about. I feel this movie is Half-Baked meets Animal House! As far as a moral theme, they touched on the discrimination of high class toward the lower class. The preppy captain of the rowing team, the Dean of the school both looked down on these two from lower class families. Yes, the main characters were able to get to Harvard by cheating, but when Silas put his mind to work, he made a great botanist. No matter where we come from in life, we all have the ability to great things. When we have people who believe in &amp; support us, we excel greatly!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>potheads are smart...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>at least that is what this movie wants you to believe. It was very offensive, from all the pot smoking to the scene where a dead president is dug up and put in a blender. I do believe pot is still illegal, and I really don't find a movie that glamourizes it to be that funny. This movie would have you believe druggies can make it at Harvard.FINAL VERDICT: How High, yeah, I would have to believe all the actors and writers involved with this were high when they put it all together. You'll probably get a couple of laughs from it, but that is because it is so silly and revolting. I can't recommend it because it is just too offensive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"How High" is my new definition of Insanely Terrible. After loving so many fun black/pot movies like "Half Baked" and "Friday", it seemed we would be destined that something like this would come and take all of my faith in humanity away."How High" is essentially three things: 1, it's a stereotypical black pot movie, starring Methodman and Redman as two stoner retards who, through smoking their death friend Ivory, get into Harvard and then cause havok. 2, it's a film that tries to offend everyone, much like better films South Park: BLU and Freddy Got Fingered. And 3, it's an absolute atrocity of a film, a totally worthless bit of junk that not even toddlers could enjoy.The film's biggest problem seems to be that it can't find its sense of humor - this is because it has none. It's all about smoking weed, bangin' hoes, destroying stuff and smoking weed. And also bangin' hoes. Trying to take the "offend everyone" path, it falls painfully short: while it includes major anti-white racist jokes (which aren't funny) and also abuses every other subculture and pop subculture EXCEPT Blacks - none of which is at all amusing - it then misses all of the actual opportunties to poke offensive fun, like the Women's Studies scene which is just immature instead of offensively funny. It's bland, appalling crap. The only scene which is clever is when the two losers decide to dig up a corpse to smoke, in which the film almost reaches it's aim - but it still falls flat, while basically any of the audience who hasn't gone outside to throw up is still left unamused.Redman and Methodman are terrible at acting and should never be allowed near a camera again. Scratch that - they should never be allowed in public again. While proving that their acting is (amazingly)worse than their rapping, they stand around looking stupid with a bunch of other acting rejects who can't use what little material there is in this stupidity to make a laugh. The final word on this heinous monstrocity is to avoid at all cost. How's this for comparison - we watched both this film and a Leslie Nielson hunk'o'junk called 2001: A Space Travesty - a film which was barely about space AND featured a parrot in soup - and the Space Travesty was better. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Would Recommend This Movie To Absolutely Nobody,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How High is an brutal movie with an extremely stupid storyline a lot of really bad jokes,there was no part in this stupid comedy that made me laugh.Going into this movie I didn't really think it was going to be good,but it was even worse than I thought.I only watched it because me and my friend both have Netflix and he said I should check this out,I really don't understand how he liked it.When I was looking at the opening credits,I knew none of the cast,apart from Fred Willard,but I don't like him,but then I saw that Danny DeVito was a producer,so then I thought it myth not be that bad,but it was terrible.I hope he got paid well for being part of this disaster.This movie is stupid,not funny,a big depressing,and at times very racist,I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.One of my least favourite movies ever.Two potheads trying to get into Harvard smoke the ashes of their dead friend which makes them very intelligent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hilarious comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yet another weed-movie. And I like those, having loved weed in my younger years. Basically, Method Man and Redman have to take their SATs, and they meet spontaneously right in the parking lot. They roll up a blunt, and smoke it. However, this is no ordinary weed. Method Man grew this weed with the ashes of his dead friend "Ivory". As they are smoking, Ivory's ghost appears in the back seat. Turns out, he knows all the answers to everything, and he gets them both a perfect score, which lands them in Harvard. Many hilarious antics follow.This movie accomplishes perfectly what it is meant to accomplish. It makes me laugh. Sure, its silly, sure, its "stupid", there's not much thinking involved, but its a comedy! And a great one. The way that Red and Meth are so out of place at Harvard is hilarious. Bart, one of the "villains" is one of the funniest, corniest characters I have ever seen. The dean is hilarious as well. And the part where they dig up the dead president is just plain nasty.The only reason I gave this movie a 7 and not higher is the ending. The movie doesn't really end, it just sort of abruptly "stops". After watching the commentary, I found out that the reason for this was because they didn't really HAVE an ending. They were just sort of floating along and seeing what happens from the ball-scene on. Which explains the abrupt ending. Overall, if you want to have some simple-minded fun, and if you are in the mood to laugh, watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supposedly a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, if you wanna see jokes that are made by deranged kiddos, bad sitcoms, they want them to be funny, to enjoy the under-educated humour and gross infantile dialogues, not to mention the bad-behaviour promoting stuff, please go and watch it. I didn't graduate a fancy college, but I keep wondering why do they keep making this kind of movies, when traditional schools and universities are victims to cheap mockery? As if everybody could go there (there was a superficial girl - I don't care about her gender and shiny hair colour - that took legal studies, right? - but that's another movie), as if you were a drunk and a junkie you could go just like that and take a Harvard scholarship. I understand the politics, and I understand that we should discourage elitism and racism, but what has this got tot do with showing a couple of MJ consumers (and all they did was that!) as successful (after all) Harvard students? Again, the name of the University doesn't count. I wonder if somebody's frustration (I don't know, writer, director, marketing manager, who cares) is all that is all about. I wanted a comedy, couldn't you give me one?</fullReview>

A classy presentation with considerable less classy humor, this flick has a much more clever premise than plot and plot than story. Okay stuff for those into raunchy outrageousness which crosses the black/white divide.Note - The DVD I watched had no closed captioning but did have subtitles were all over the screen and so large they must have been intended for the visually impaired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw how high, this film could possibly be the worst movie ever made. It had no redeeming value whatsoever. Method man is a horrible actor, redman is even worse. It was clear that this movie was trying to make, something close to half baked or animal house or trying to find a midpoint in between them and it fails miserably on all fronts. The script was horrendous, it played out like a second rate student film. Every little thing in the movie was a complete cliche. everything from the hot smart girl, to the evil dean who must be stopped. There was simply not a single funny moment during this entire movie. I recommend this to know one not even, hardcore fans of Method man and Red man. Guys stick to the Wu Tang Clan.</fullReview>

Fortunately, fart and puke jokes were kept to a minimum (about two of the former, and just one of the latter); otherwise it was pretty intelligent and tasteful, all things considered. Lotta funny racial stuff. A bit of stereotyping, yeah, but most of it was intentional and for comedic effect (like the pimps, which weren't that funny, though). There were a lot of interesting and relevant social points in there, too. I think.The thing about digging up the dead president and blending his hand was some fun sh!t, man! Too bad it didn't work (it was supposed to conjure up the guy's ghost).Hot damn, Lark Voorhies is one mouthwateringly sweet babe.

There they start to make fun of all the people (especially "crackers" and Asians). I don't even remember how the movie ends...

Now I'm not saying that they are superb actors or that they deserve an Oscar or anything like that, but they know how to act.How High is a funny stoner/hip hop flick about two guys who meet and go to college together, it's really hilarious, the jokes are simple but very humorous. Sure there's a lot of "unneccesary" profanity in this movie but it works like a charm. The plot although fairly generic is good, this movie really stands out, it's easily one of the best stoner flicks ever and is on up there with Cheech &amp; ChongRedman, Method Man, hiphop, marijuana.

		<fullReview>How High is a film that lends nothing, I repeat, nothing to the film community at large. I have read some critics that say that this film introduced a whole new generation to the Cheech &amp; Chong of the new millennium with the Redman/Method Man pairing. While most seem to agree that this is a horrible film, very few of them mention how utterly racist the overall experience happens to be. When I use the word racist, I mean that it builds upon the degenerate clichés that African Americans struggle with on a daily basis with our society. While there were elements in this film that seemed like there was some reverse racism occurring, what struck me hardest in the face was how embarrassing Method Man and Redman must be to both the film community, but also to their own culture. I have a very open mind when it comes to social issues as well as films, but this one left my jaw on the floor several times. The blatant swings at African American stereotypes were meant to be a source of humor for director Jesse Dylan, but instead fell flat on their embarrassed face. Humor was in very short supply in this film due to the ethnic stereotype clichés that seemed to be used nearly every second of this film. Nothing was original. Nothing was exciting.Was the pairing of Redman and Method Man an idea of comedic proportions? I think not. As you can tell from their short lived series after the release of this film, the corporate world wanted to cash in on these two rappers, but soon realized that they were not as bankable as they thought. Why? Method Man and Redman, who completely different people, were nothing more than the same character in this film. With the very subtle hints of Method Man being smarter, nothing could separate the equality of these two characters. That is why they failed as a comic team. Think of Matthau and Lemmon or the above example of Cheech &amp; Chong, what made these teams work while the How High team crashed and burned? What worked the best were the differences that uniquely drew the pair together. Their differences made us laugh and sympathetically brought them together, but with Method Man and Redman, they were the same. I was watching the same two characters fight through the same two challenges in this film. What tried to be funny instead transformed into repetitive. What Dylan did to counter the similarity between Redman/Method Man was bring in obscure secondary characters that added nothing to the flimsy plot or helped us feel emotion for our two main characters. The cliché jock, the cliché frat boy, the cliché Asian (which was again another racist moment), and the cliché rich white boy, just felt and were old. Watch college films from the 70s and you will see these same combinations, but what makes the films from the 70s different is that they used them with originality. How High, from beginning to end, was anything but original.I must admit, after watching this film of which Harvard was willing to loan their name to, I don't want to go to Harvard. They should have pondered the effects this film would have upon their prestige heritage. How High is a dark spot in Harvard's history. Do you know what makes it even worse? This film wasn't even created at or anywhere near Harvard. Again, Dylan was cutting corners to create a false sense of realism that continued to hurt this film. How High has no redeeming qualities. Ooops, I stand corrected. The only smile that was ever created on my face during this film was when Spalding Gray spoke. How did they get him and Fred Willard to do this film? I have said it once, I will say it again, some actors just need their bills paid. Inconsistency, incompetence, and aggravation seemed to be the hidden themes of this dud. What destroyed this film further is that if you take the actors away and look at the story in general, it is nothing. There is no original story at all with How High. Going to college, working for your grades, winning over the heart of the President right at the last minute ? this was nothing short of a "cut and paste" film that had no backbone and horrid acting! I do not like Jesse Dylan's style of directing. While I think Kicking and Screaming is his prized film (due greatly to Will Ferrell), all of his films seem to be extremely choppy with the editing and are randomly interjected with an overdose of unnecessary scenes. The John Adams scene in How High is a prime example. The Benjamin Franklin moments is another. The unconcluded "Truth Serum" can be considered another. How High was just scene after scene of inconsistency. Lumpy oatmeal would win first place before this film would ever be congratulated! I blame a majority of the issues with this film on Jesse Dylan. If he would have tightened the script, created unique and "cult-like" characters, and eliminated the racism, he may have had the quintessential "weed" film in Hollywood.Overall, this was one of the worst films that I have witnessed. Never have I been so emotionally charged about the racist moments in this film as I have with How High. The actors, all around, were horrible. The story had no legs to stand on and it became very obvious after the opening credits that unless you were either 10 to 15 years of age, this film would never be considered a comedy. Nothing was funny. Nothing will make you laugh. The only part worth enjoying in this film is the ending credits. The ending credits give you a chance to walk away and forget this part of your cinematic life.Grade: * out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can enjoy some silly stoner movies, when they're done right without taking it too serious in all, but in this case this movie fails. Its not that bad but not really that great either. And people compare this to Friday, but Friday is much better. Now, it seems like a pretty funny and original idea but the direction went off. The movie was pretty watchable, good and funny in its 1st half, but towards the middle and going to the end, it got boring and I lost interest. The first half was good because Method Man (Silas) &amp; Redman (Jamal) weer the main focus, they were funny and they were interacting with each other. They were both great in this, especially Method Man, his character was funny and smart. Towards the middle, there were more subplots and characters (Mike Epps) that randomly came in. It would have been better had they made some connections to Mike Epps character with Method or Redman and introduced him in the beginning. Also towards the end they focused more on the other characters somewhat, and it lost the same energy. It was basically from the Halloween party scene- IMO that dragged on too long. Though many people liked this movie for what it is. It could have been better but also could have been worse</fullReview>

Two guys from the hood who meet and become roommates at a prestigious university, Harvard. Once they move in on campus, the school will never be the same. They smoke a lot of pot that was grown in soil composed of ashes from Method Man's cremated friend, Ivory. Now, every time they smoke it they get visited by Ivory. There are many practical jokes and very funny stuff going on in this movie. Very entertaining. I also disagree with the previous user's comment about Mike Epps' character "Baby Powder".

The 5.3 rating (seems low in retrospect) made me think that this would be a tough-to-watch buddy comedy misfire in the vein of White Chicks or any of the American Pie sequels (movies which I despised.) Instead, what I got was consistently funny and oddly poignant comedy on the level of Half Baked and the first Harold and Kumar movie (which I thought were quite funny.) It's definitely formulaic, but I think it does well within these constraints. The leads are amusing as are their foils. Overall, it was excellent. I find it interesting the number of reviews that reference the unlikeliness of weed enthusiasts at Harvard. Ha, you'd be surprised. Also references to people who smoke weed being stupid carry little weight when one considers that world-beaters like Carl Sagan and Robert Altman spent quite a bit of time ... on weed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How High... How Funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To call How High a "stoner comedy" isn't too-far off the mark but it does a good job on the proverbial "fish-out-of-water" scenario, with a Hip-Hop aesthetic and mentality thrown in for good measure. Hip-Hop artists, Method Man and Redmans' chemistry is quite genuine. As platinum selling Rap Artists who work with each other in the music world, their mutual admiration shows in this film and it works quite well. Meth plays "Silas". A neighborhood "Weed Specialst" who has the skill (but not the drive or proper equipment), to build on his talent for creating different strains of cannabis, until the (comical) death of a close friend motivates him to take his knowledge and put it to good use towards higher education. Meanwhile, "Jamal" (played by Redman), motivation comes in the form of his well-meaning, but verbally abusive mother urging him to get his degree so she can place it on the wall by his brothers' "Prison-issued Barber Certificate" and his sisters' "Weave-Masters Degree". Through a turn or events (of course involving weed), the two find themselves as freshmen at Harvard and then the fun begins. From pranks on the freshmen class Dean (involving Pigeons) to a hilarious Pimp (played to the hilt by Mike Epps), with only TWO WOMEN in his stable, the laughs are are never ending! Meth &amp; Red may not win any awards from this movie but I would cast my vote for them as the next candidates for "Best Buddy Movie combination". In the tradition of Cheech &amp; Chong, Lewis and Martin, Pryor &amp; Wilder, Harrelson &amp; Snipes... These guys Definitely have that potential. (Also, be on the look out for cameos from Saturay Night Live alumnus Garrett Morris and Tracey Morgan for a fictitious commercial that will have you reciting the tag line over and over again!)</fullReview>

The whole thing is a lark that the "highly" charismatic Method Man and Redman somehow pull off. Their easy camaraderie anchors the film and allows a cast of character actors to get jiggy with it. 'How High' is chock-full of non-PC behavior, yet to the film's credit, there's a comforting lack of moralizing at the conclusion. (There's nothing worse than a gross-out comedy that gets maudlin and preachy at the end. Yes, I'm talking to you, Adam Sandler.) Lots of plot lines that go nowhere, but the bevy of colorful characters keeps you from caring too much. So just give in to the premise and let yourself laugh.

I hope to see Red and Meth do a couple more flix in the future, they crack me up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When 'Animal House' met 'Friday'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was first told about 'How High' my mate said it was better then Half Baked (blasphemous!) but when I heard who was in it, I gowned. It had all the ingredients of being an awful, third rate film trying to grab cash from the whole 'teen' college movie market. Rappers in the starring roles? Usually a big no no! But there was something about How High that made it a worthwhile and very a underrated comedy.The film didn't take itself seriously and got away with a flimsy storyline by delivering the jokes well (the use of cut scenes were excellent) and being first rate on a technical and directorial level. The production value could be seen by the choice of producers such as Danny De Vito &amp; Stacy 'Pulp Fiction' Sher.Other 'comedies' such as 'The Wash' used famous names to get away with a shoddy film, however, How High in my opinion could be the 'Friday' or the 'Animal House' of this decade.Which leaves me with only one thing to say...'wheremabitches'?!****(4) out of *****(5)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a blast. It definitely deserves better than the community here at IMDb has given it. No its not a masterpiece but its got a lightness that smooves over any of its problems. Method Man is just insanely funny and he's got a certain character that really carries the movie. You can tell everyone was having a lot of fun when they made this movie and that comes across on the screen in a purely infectious way. It should go without saying that some trees make a nice substitue for popcorn when watching this flic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has become my favorite movie of it's genre...surpassing Happy Gilmore, Half Baked and the Friday series. It takes a while to grasp the pace and style, but it is hands down the best pot movie I've seen. Tears were rolling down my face. The characters all have their own charm. Method Man &amp; Redman play off eachother so well. I purchased it right away and have been peddling this movie to all my friends (even non-smokers). I can't wait for these guys to do another one. I can't imagine how anyone who likes this genre would ever give this a bad review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bottom Line: NOT FUNNY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was incredibly dumb, and I can see why it got such a low user-rating. It is another film that attempts to be entirely about a duo of dumb potheads getting into trouble (copying off the much-better films of Cheech and Chong, Friday, and Half-Baked). In this one, Method Man and Redman, who can't act worth $#!*, cheat on their SAT/ACT tests and get into Harvard University. They pull off a bunch of wacky/stupid/dumb pranks while they are there, including putting a plate of pot-brownies on the porch of one of their professors, who then eats them and goes crazy. The whole movie the two rappers are smoking pot and acting like what they truly are in real life: two idiotic young thug-wannabes who cannot do anything good besides rap. DO NOT SEE THIS AWFUL FILM. This was terrible, and even if you are a total stoner and want to see this just because it is about weed (like many people I know), don't. Rent "Up In Smoke" or "Half-Baked" instead, for they are actually funny and are worth the rental fee. Feel free to email me with any questions or comments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only Works because Redman is funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not as good as one might think it is. The only reason why this movie worked was because Redman's character was pretty funny in the movie, otherwise this movie really isn't that great. Jesse Dylan the son of legendary Bob Dylan directed this movie, which exlains the name, but he also directed American Wedding, which in my opinion is much more of a solid movie compared to this. Mike Epps from Next Friday &amp; All About the Benjamins is rather funny in the little appearances he makes throughout the movie. Also Lark Voorhies better known as Lisa from "Saved by the bell" makes an appearance as the girl Method Man falls for. This isn't one of those college movies where you would like to see over &amp; over again, even once is probably more than enough. Lets get back to some positives, i thought Redman was funny as hell he seems naturally funny, he should definitely do more movies. I give this movie a 5 / 10. I gave it 5 mainly because Redman made the movie work.</fullReview>

You'd think a rapper would know more words then that and be able to express himself in more ways then one! Comedy? Now "House party" was a comedy. This ain't.

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Creative and Dark Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many other people, I expected a stereotypical "black" movie or a "pot" movie. And sure, you have many black jokes and many pot jokes in this film, but it's done in a surprisingly intelligent way that was both funny and incredibly original. Too many drug movies are simply rehashed (pun intended) but this was not one of them.The movie has Method Man and Redman entering Harvard where they teach others to stop being so uptight. Again, it sounds over like you've seen it before, but certain things here you won't see elsewhere. Things I can't say without giving away later parts of the film. But I can say it crosses a line where if you are easily offended or are very patriotic, you might get a little steamed.The acting? Fine, for a comedy. The plot, decent. The writing, quite good. The music was surprisingly good. There was, of course, a great deal of rap music. But other kinds of music were incorporated to round the feel of the movie out. I even heard Rammstein, which would seem out of place but really wasn't.Oh, and Lark Voorhies ("Saved by the Bell") co-stars, which would make this the second greatest college film to star a SBTB alumnus (the best being "Dead Man on Campus").I would recommend this film. I went in to it expecting some horrible trash, but left with a smile on my face and a new appreciation for Method Man and Redman.</fullReview>

You can't get a more ridiculous plot than two stoners smoking their dead friend's ashes and then being able to see him.Even though Method Man and Redman aren't the best actors in the world, the movie fit their abilities. It was a silly movie that couldn't be taken slightly serious, so what's the big deal of having two rappers with mediocre acting abilities playing the lead roles? The movie was actually quite hilarious, and it got funnier the more times I saw it.</fullReview>

Great humor runs through the entire film (no wonder with Redman and Method Man, and Danny de Vito as a producer) You don't have to constantly think about whats gonna happen or like thrillers "who's the killer etc.". The movie is simple and just out for some laughs kind of like "Half Baked" with Dave Chapelle. Besides, it's great for treatin' a hangover...</fullReview>

With the help of a recently deceased buddy, and political need for more campus diversity, they get accepted to Harvard where they turn things upside down for their snooty classmates and uptight, deeply conservative dean of administration. Watchable but forgettable comedy has an enthusiastic cast, and some really solid laughs, but some of the gags are pretty weak and it runs out of energy surprisingly early. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your a weed smoking hip hop fan then you will love this movie. Probably the best stoner comedy I've seen. Method Man and Redman make a great combo and Redman is a natural comedian. The supporting cast is good and all provide entertainment. Mike Epps is great as an unsuccessful pimp. The plot is simple and the story line is unique. Its a different take to the usual college teen movies. Having seen all the other stoner comedies (Harold and Kumar, Half Baked, Cheech and Chong etc.) this is by far the best. The second half of the films is maybe not as strong as the first. But you will be laughing all the way through. Lots of weed, plenty of women, funny jokes and a fantastic soundtrack. Plus a special appearance from Cypress Hill. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect when this movie showed up on my screen. I had only heard one song by Redman and Method Man and figured this would be some rap-centric movie about two gang bangers trying to get through college.I was wrong. It's actually two slackers smoking their way through college. It's pretty funny despite the fact there are way too many pot jokes and racial stereotypes. There is a scene where the very Anglo sounding black dean gets some pot filled brownies and starts acting like a ghetto boy. And there is a little Asian kid who acts like Eminem. Those are two examples of cheap jokes that just don't quite get pulled off the ground.However, Method and Red do a credible job of acting like a couple of potheads (wonder why?). None of the acting is first rate and Jeffrey Jones appearance as the Vice President on the heels of his child pornography charges is weak. Some of the acting is over the top, but that's what we come to expect from low brow, toilet humor based movies.Kathy Wagner is absolutely stellar in this movie and may be the best reason to see it. All in all the film is a 'feel good' movie with a happy ending. There's enough plot and humor to make it viewable and I would definitely consider watching another Method/Red movie.</fullReview>

I was wrong because as soon as i saw the opening scene of how high, i realized that i was in for 2 hours of straight up bathroom humor. How High was an energetic and silly as all hell stoner movie, with many scenes that would almost only make sense to one of baked, but is also humorous to anyone else. In a generation of hip hop, this movie seems to sum up everything that Method man and Redman Rap about on their albums....pimps, hoes, money, weed, and a harvard education. When i saw that this movie was going to be on video and Pay per view soon, i knew i had to see it again with my friends, its definatley one to lift the spirits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dear readers, are you worn out from Oscar Season? Has the weighty subject matter of films like "A Beautiful Mind" and "Ali" got you down? Has the emphasis on making the world a better place gotten on your damn nerves already? I can think of no better remedy than "How High." No real story, no real moral, and no one comes out of this a better person, but dear sweet Lord is it funny.Redman and Method Man star as losers from the projects who, through contrivances so funny I cannot reveal them here, have grown a magical Marijuana plant. This plant makes them smarter and they get into Harvard, where hilarity ensues. That's pretty much it. "How High" is juvenile and structureless with characters who have no arc, but that doesn't matter. This film's duty to the audience, first and foremost, is to make them laugh. And indeed it does. This is the first movie I've seen in a long while in this Farrelly Brothers wasteland that knows how to do gross-out comedy successfully. Movies like "Freddy Got Fingered" and "Not Another Teen Movie" remember the gross-out, but not the comedy.There will be some who say that this is vulgar and tasteless and has no redeeming social value. You will get no argument from me, but therein lies its charm. "How High" takes nothing sacred and doesn't play it safe, as opposed to the Adam Sandler movies where he feels the need to redeem himself.And there will be a few more who say, in this post "Bamboozled" era, that this film caters to the absolute worst in a predominantly African-American audience. There I will disagree, for "How High" is a movie about pot, which gets the same response out of everyone. The race of the main characters, I believe, is incidental. This could be about two white guys and the results would look roughly the same.I could talk about the political response to this film for ages, but this film doesn't really warrant such a discussion. It's a comedy, which by definition is designed to make you laugh, and it's successful if it meets that end. Besides, how foolish would you look if you got into a discussion of the social ramifications of a movie like this?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was the funniest movie that I have seen in a long time! It had me laughing so hard, I was crying!!! Methodman and Redman make a great team. The acting was better than I thought it would be. If you liked Half Baked, Up in Smoke, and Friday you are going to LOVE this movie!!! It's the ultimate pothead movie!! In short...It was hilarious...I LOVED IT!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The next "Half Baked?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A weed smokin' movie, done with professionalism. Hearing that Danny Devito was a producer I put the movie on a higher scale than I probably should have. Though Method Man and Redman show better acting skill than most rappers out there to day: better than Ice Cube, better than Dre and Snoop combined, better than LL Cool J, doubtful if better than Eminem, but we're yet to see his performance in "8-Mile", the movie still doesn't hold up against "Friday" or "Half Baked." It had some very good jokes, but it didn't get much farther than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like movies like "Friday", you'll love this one. Very Funny Movie!Both MethodMan and Redman have managed very humorous roles, while not tarnishing their hip-hop images... If you are in the mood for deep-thinking, see another film and save this movie for when you are in a light-hearted mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I previewed this movie on my college campus at New Mexico State and I have to say that this movie was very, very funny. I had a lot of good chuckles while viewing. I give it a grade of B+ and will probably see it again in theaters. I am a big fan of Method Man and Redman on the hip-hop tip but I am very critical when it comes to movies and the acting chops of hip hop artists. If I forget that you have a record deal when I am watching your movie, then you are doing a good job. Meth and Red did very well and I feel that they could do more movies together. As far as the ratings on this website go, I give this film an 8. If you don't like a great deal of raunchiness and drug use this movie isn't for you. But if that stuff doesn't bother you then you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw How High on my college campus at an advanced screening. I must admit, it was one of the funniest movies I've seen in awhile-probably the funniest weed smoking movie ever made. Better than Half-Baked and Friday, go see it for yourself. Good hour and a half of hilarious stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great idea, disappointing finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i saw the first half of this movie a few times, and kept getting interrupted. i thought it was really good and couldn't wait to finally watch the last half, as the first half has a great buildup of plot and is absolutely hilarious. when i finally did watch the movie the whole way through i realised this was a mistake. from the last scene i remember seeing, the movie crashed and burned like most Adam Sandler movies. i think what happened is they followed a well written script for half of the movie, then got stoned and forgot where they put it. if this movie had an ending that did justice to its beginning it would be a 9/10 easily, and better than other weed movies like Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Ali G Indahouse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>its not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The guy that bashes this so much has no clue what its about. He claims its another black/pot movie? He has no culture. Don't be naive and "white"...it has a different cultural look at weed. It's not stereotypical, of course it is in ways...you can never avoid stereotypes.Redman and Methodman are entertaining. It's not the best.I just wanted to defend a decent movie from that silly attack. He categorizes it and stereotypes it where it doesn't have a chance.It's worth a watch if you get the chance. But check my other reviews for some other good suggestions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented How High last weekend from Blockbuster. It really was a funny movie. As I sat through it I realized a lot of the stuff that went on in the movie really wasn't advertised or didn't make any sense! It didn't make sense at all but it was a good movie. I was hysterical. I truly recommend How High for people like myself that laughs at silly things. How High receives a 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough great scenes mixed in to other stuff to make it worth watching.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for free at the theater where I work, and it was definately worth the time I spent watching it. I dunno if I would have paid $7 to see it, but I'd probably rent it for $3. It is one of the funnier recent weed movies. It is better than half-baked, if for no other reason, it doesnt end with the characters giving up weed. Of course it did seem to scream the fact that its main audience would be black, and overuses the black-hating white guy skits a bit. I don't see how they get away with portraying harvard teachers and faculty as racist dumbasses, but apparently it isnt considered slander in any way. I laughed a lot during this movie, the funny scenes are really funny, the rest of the movie just seems to be filler, scenes with characters reminding the target black audience that they are black too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How High was an excellent film. It starred Redman and Method Man as two potheads who get into Harvard. To me, this is the best movie of the year. If the people who voted for the Academy Awards had a sense of humor, movies like this and previous funny movies like "American Pie" and "Scary Movie" would be nominated for those awards. Personally, I think that the Academy only cares about dumb dramas that are just boring. They should get a sense of humor so that they can enjoy masterpieces like "How High."</fullReview>
