		<shortDescription>Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent courtroom drama with a unique twist. Instead of following the trial itself, the viewer has a unique chance to observe the events behind the closed doors of a jury room. The film begins with the end of the trial. The jurors retire to deliberate the case. A preliminary vote is taken and the result is 11:1 in favour of the guilty verdict. Eleven jurors have raised their hands to convict a young man of killing his father. Only Juror #8 has doubts. At first even he does not truly believe the young man to be innocent but notes (rightfully) that the case for the defence might have been presented in a more convincing manner and that the boy might be given the benefit of a doubt. Since the boy is to be executed if found guilty his life is now in the hands of the jury and juror #8 reasons that the least they could do is talk about the case a bit. As time goes on some of the jurors change their minds and find that there is perhaps enough reasonable doubt not to convict the young man after all. But not everyone is easy to convince.Although the plot of the film is excellent and it is fascinating to see what little things can influence which way a verdict goes, where this film really succeeds is in presenting the characters of the 12 jurors. The character of each of the jurors emerges through a wonderful mix of perfect casting, excellent dialogue and near-flawless acting.Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case. He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - "this is not an exact science") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said "Its the bees' knees". The film captivates the audience from the beginning. Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start. We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not. We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case. But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters. This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.How a film should be made. Modern directors take note(thats ur telling off for the day) 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'12 Angry Men' is an outstanding film. It is proof that, for a film to be great, it does not need extensive scenery, elaborate costumes or expensive special effects - just superlative acting.The twelve angry men are the twelve jurors of a murder case. An eighteen-year-old boy from a slum background is accused of stabbing his father to death and faces the electric chair if convicted. Eleven of the men believe the boy to be guilty; only one (Henry Fonda) has doubts. Can he manage to convince the others?The court case provides only a framework, however. The film's greatness lies in its bringing-together of twelve different men who have never met each other before and the interaction of their characters as each man brings his own background and life experiences into the case. Thus, we have the hesitant football coach (Martin Balsam), the shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler), the aggressive call company director (Lee J. Cobb), the authoritative broker (E.G. Marshall), the self-conscious slum dweller (Jack Klugman), the solid, dependable painter (Edward Binns), the selfish salesman (Jack Warden), the calm, collected architect (Fonda), the thoughtful, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney), the racially bigoted garage owner (Ed Begley), the East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) and the beefcake advertising agent (Robert Webber) who has plenty of chat and little else.Almost the entire film takes place in just one room, the jury room, where the men have retired to consider their verdict. The viewer finds him or herself sweating it out with the jury as the heat rises, literally and metaphorically, among the men as they make their way towards their final verdict. Interestingly, the jurors (apart from two at the end) are never named. They do not need to be. Their characters speak for them.Henry Fonda is eminently suitable and excellently believable as the dissenter who brings home the importance of a jury's duty to examine evidence thoroughly and without prejudice. Joseph Sweeney is delightful as Juror No. 9, the quiet but shrewd old man who misses nothing, whilst E.G. Marshall brings his usual firmness and authority to the role of Juror No. 4. All the actors shine but perhaps the best performance is that of Lee J. Cobb as Juror No. 3, the hard, stubborn, aggressive, vindictive avenger who is reduced to breaking down when forced to confront the failure of his relationship with his own son.Several of the stars of '12 Angry Men' became household names. Henry Fonda continued his distinguished career until his death in 1982, as well as fathering Jane and Peter. Lee J. Cobb landed the major role of Judge Henry Garth in 'The Virginian'. E.G. Marshall enjoyed a long, reputable career on film and t.v., including playing Joseph P. Kennedy in the 'Kennedy' mini-series. Jack Klugman was 'Quincy' whilst John Fiedler voiced Piglet in the 'Winnie The Pooh' films and cartoons.Of the twelve, only John Fiedler, Jack Klugman and Jack Warden* are still alive. Although around the eighty mark, they are all still acting. The film was still available on video last year and it is shown on t.v. fairly frequently. I cannot recommend it too highly!(*John Fiedler died June 2005. Jack Warden died July 2006.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>........Films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant. I cannot think of the last time I was so intrigued by the flawless plot, dialogue and acting since 12 Angry Men. For such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments, 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty, is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty, only one jury man (Henry Fonda) doesn't put his hand up. Trial and Character revelations, doubts, and possibilities follow.So masterfully crafted is this film, that every time I watch it, only gets better. It includes some of the best character development I've ever seen. Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history - one of the most important contributions to world cinema. However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb who really made this film legendary, with their incredibly realistic performances. Casting was genius. And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. Black and White made the film all the more powerful. And the music was minimal, which gave the film a more atmospheric experience, like you were their in the jury room with them - and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds.This inexpensive film, with such a simple setting had the world talking, the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form. I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film - 'Lawrence Of Arabia' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' are other ones that come to mind. This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. It sums up everything I love about film. Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story, it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time - bar none! A statue should be erected in Sydney Lumet's honor......"Is it possible?" - Juror #8/Henry Fonda</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you only ever see one Black and White movie, make this it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time, when it was shown at about 1 o'clock in the morning. I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old "classics". This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I haven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one man, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet. I urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please do so now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good script, great dialogs and a set of actors who would be the envy of the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word "go". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The over-used term "classic movie" really comes into its own here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This once-in-a-generation masterpiece simply has no equal. The late 90's TV remake was quite adequate though totally unnecessary and in the upshot proved simply that updating a film for updating's sake is really an exercise in futility. Even had it BEEN as good - so what?There could be few, if ANY film-goers reading this who are unaware of the plotline and in any event many others have re-hashed this for you. The brilliance of the film is evident in so many aspects. To begin with, the ability to not only sustain interest but to command the viewer's attention for basically its entire running time within a setting of principally just one room, borders on the inspired. Whether or not that would actually work with TODAY'S audiences is another discussion! What we have here are twelve everyday Mr Joe Blows, summoned together on a jury panel to decide a defendant's guilt or innocence with regards to a murder charge. If you were to gather unto yourselves ANY twelve jurors at random, you would most likely be able to pinpoint the Henry Fonda, Lee Cobb, E. G. Marshall, Jack Warden etc etc amongst them! Their very "ordinariness" is where the film succeeded. Everyone can identify with at least ONE of those characters. Whether or not he may WANT to is a different matter. The thinker, the sensitive man, the arrogant bully, the opportunist, the mentally challenged loudmouth, the slimeball, the emotionally withdrawn, the sheep etc - they're all here! Welcome to society folks! I dislike society in the main - doubtless a reason I found this film to be such a revelation..even when I was barely into my teens!12 ANGRY MEN also pinpoints the shortcomings of the law, how "truth" can be so intrinsically left-field and unintentionally flawed. Lumet, working within a minimal budget here, delivers unstinting brilliance in both direction, character portrayal and script interpretation. He had of course superb acting talent at his disposal although some of the most memorable performances are from the lesser players. Some have denounced Fonda's role as being acceptable rather than awesome. I think however he was to a great degree playing himself here, not to an audience. His, is a study in deliberation and logic not show-pony stuff, but hell that never WAS Fonda was it?This is a great great movie, as is evidenced by the extremely high user-vote worldwide. IF you haven't seen it - you really should do something about that!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic not to be Missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits. This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Character-Study Is Meant to Be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males, struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G. Marshall and John Fiedler are among the other individuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the surface. An excellent character-study that should be studied and embraced by all present and future film-makers. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave your prejudices outside the door</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the finest ensemble pieces of film ever made. 12 jurors debate, argue and sweat it out to decide the guilt or innocence of a teenager accused of murdering his father. This was Sidney Lumet's directorial debut. This film is almost entirely set in one room for 90 or so minutes, as the valiant dozen play cat and mouse with the accused's life. To 11 jurors it's an open and shut case - guilty. The defendant's life lays in the hands of one liberal juror (Henry Fonda). The film meticulously examines the facts of the case, as each juror provides reasons for their decisions. Fonda struggles to convince his fellow jurors that there is room for reasonable doubt, but he's working against dubious priorities and deeply-ingrained prejudices. Within the confines of a hot and angry room Fonda fights his corner, whilst highlighting both his open-minded and fair beliefs with the frailties and failures of his fellow defendants. Although unconvincing in detail, the film is absorbing, and made the more remarkable as it is almost entirely set in one room and yet holds the viewers attention. The acting is magnificent; the 12 actors are essentially the movie. A classic film, not using fancy plots or effects, but the talents of actors. A great piece of film making and one of the best films coming out of the US. Worth watching, if not just for analysing human weaknesses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific drama with some of the greatest actors in cinematic history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of "reasonable doubts", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NOTE: Apparently, some fan of "Lord of the Rings" reported my review to the IMDb Admin because I said "12 Angry Men" is (and I quote) "...better than LotR." And for some reason, IMDb actually deleted my review - even though it had over 20 helpful reviews (out of about 26).So, to please that angry little insecure fan, I've decided to remove all LotR references in this review from here onwards. Enjoy, scumball.--"My Review of 12 Angry Men" or "WHY THIS MOVIE IS 10x BETTER THAN THE LORD OF THE RINGS.""12 Angry Men" is pure, unadulterated American courtroom classic that has been shown in schools across America for decades. I'm not Sidney Lumet's biggest fan ("Serpico" is overrated), but he is masterful behind the camera here.It's classic, to say the least. But it's also a wonderful motion picture.It saddens me that this is number twenty-one on the Internet Movie Database's top 250, yet the three "Lord of the Rings" movies are somewhere in the top ten. Disgraceful, how far culture has sloped downwards over the year. A UK list of the best musicals of all time was recently completed. Guess what was ahead of "Singin' in the Rain" and "My Fair Lady"? "Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Musical." Mmm-hmm...I'm sure.I recommend this to anyone who thinks classic cinema is boring.Here's a classic, and here's one of many films that is put to disgrace by these newer-age lists of "best movies." I believe many of the people voting otherwise should take into account the fact that they might enjoy "X2" very much (as I did!) but that doesn't necessarily mean it is the 120th best film of all time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Film Reflecting American Cultural Changes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a "stubborn, pig-headed" conservative versus "righteous, just" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The All-Time Great Liberal Agenda Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I defy anyone to watch this movie and not be completely absorbed in the group dynamics on display. I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from "The Grapes of Wrath." E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.An important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it, put it at the top of your list.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From guilty to no guilty,,,,,,,this movie is true masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies are not for certain period of time but are eternal because of there perpetual topic. Murder is one of the oldest crimes in this world but murder of your own father is something astonishing. The movie is about a teenager accused of murdering his own father in an open case where all the indictments and witnesses are against him. The jury is called for verdict, and all of them are unanimously agreed on conviction. But one of the juror thinks to contemplate a bit on witnesses before giving a verdict as a life of teenager is on line, and from there the true brilliance of this movie begins as the way juror # 8 (Henry Fonda) unfolds all the witnesses are based on assumptions and anticipations . The way he demonstrates the happening of incident based on accusation is one of the true essence of this movie and in the end all jurors are convinced that "No guilty" is right verdict to be passed. The way story moves is marvelous ostentation of director Sidney Lumet's true brilliance. The movie is nicely written by Reginald Rose and is beautifully portrayed by all the actors especially Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobbs. This movie is truly a masterpiece and its impression will not be easy to diminish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Benefit of Hindsight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Spoilers) I really liked the message of the movie: A lot of times things that look crystal clear at first glance, upon deeper inspection, aren't so clear. The acting was top-notch all-around, especially with Juror #9. The product ends up being not very preachy, which is a considerable achievement given that it's built entirely around a simple parable.With the benefit of hindsight, though, one can see a few things about this that I personally find really disturbing.The question that drives the movie is whether the jurors have properly awarded the defendant the benefit of any reasonable doubt, and as the climax approaches, the attention given to this reaches a fevered pitch. Left behind in the dust, is the equally critical question of whether the defendant is really guilty. There's a scene early on when Jack Warden, the juror who just wants to get the voting over with so he can watch a ball game, meets Henry Fonda in the washroom. The last two lines in that scene discuss the possibility that the boy may be acquitted, even though he is guilty. Fonda says something to the effect of "that very well may be" or some such, and to my recollection this is the last time this possibility is even considered.The jury may have released a murderer onto the streets. You can make the argument that with the presence of reasonable doubt, this was their job. I agree. But as Henry Fonda walks down the courthouse steps to resume his everyday life as an architect, would it really then be fitting to have the happy "a wrong has been righted" swelling-orchestra music, as our hero walks proudly among his fellow citizens with his head held high? Doubt or no, conviction or no, this kind of peace-of-mind is not lying in wait for you after your last day on a real jury. There are jurors who want it anyway, and because of that, will not convict anyone. They have seen this movie, and want to be Henry Fonda. I've served with them. It's a pretty serious problem.There is a short speech given by Fonda shortly after he is revealed to be the one juror who wants to acquit. Several times in the speech he makes the point that the defendant is poor, has had a rough background, and has been beaten up a lot. It is not entirely clear where he is going with this, since the movie is supposed to be about what is reasonable doubt, and how the doubt applies regardless of economic class. There is at least one other juror who wants to convict because the defendant is poor; does Fonda mean to say with a defendant who was wealthier, he himself would have voted to convict? That doesn't seem likely at all. But then why bring it up? It means something to other jurors, but it isn't supposed to mean anything to Fonda. The only way it could support any of Fonda's arguments, is if he was making decisions based on the way those decisions made him feel about himself, rather than based on the evidence. This is something jurors aren't supposed to do.Four years after this movie was made, the Supreme Court defined the Exclusionary Rule in Mapp v. Ohio. So by this time, you weren't supposed to convict anyone unless you knew they were guilty beyond any reasonable doubt, and in addition to that, if you knew too much, then you still couldn't convict. During the sixties, conviction became such an unlikely goal even when the evidence seemed compelling, that a lot of District Attorneys refused to make arrests even though they knew a suspect posed a significant danger to society.By the seventies, Americans were so fed-up with the "justice system failing us" that they began turning politicians out of office in bulk, hoping against hope they could fix what was broken before their own children were murdered or their wives were raped. Between Vietnam and Watergate, this was a third salvo against our fragile faith in government, and it was an erosion of our trust that we don't talk about too much today.What really concerns me is that a little while after this film was made, with the poorest Americans being forced to live among violent people and thus becoming increasingly interested in vigilantism, suddenly we had a huge surge in movies about "Taking the law into your own hands." Dirty Harry, Death Wish, and countless made-for-TV projects. In summary, the pendulum swung in one direction, then a few years later, the other. Hollywood got to make money both times.I have trouble getting completely behind this film because it's a concentrated effort, ultimately a successful one, to get that pendulum swinging wildly. If we spent that relatively short amount of time, just fifteen years or so, leaving "revolution" out of it and reforming our justice system in baby steps, the mistakes of the past could have been avoided. I do not know if it was possible to fix what was broken back then, by doing this -- convictions weren't always carefully considered back in the 1950's &amp; earlier. But a lot of innocent people would be alive today if all those violent felons, in subsequent years, were arrested like they should have been.I would say, if you're going to serve on a jury, by all means rent this because it's a very meticulous and passionate reminder of your civil duty, it makes some great points, and everything in this movie is highest-quality. But also on your required-viewing list would be Primal Fear, the Richard Gere movie. Better yet, watch that one last, so the final scene really sticks in your mind.Nobody should be serving on a jury, if they can't seriously consider the consequences of releasing people who are really guilty of violent crimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a tight ball of male-dominated classic cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is. It's a nifty movie that has deservedly stayed firm through the decades, not showing its age bad at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond a reasonable doubt</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the film before, we decided to take another look recently when it showed up on a cable channel. This Sidney Lumet 1957 film still packs a lot of power, even though times have changed in the way our justice system works. The screen play by Reginald Rose shows his brilliant insight into human beings that are called to sit as jurors in a murder case.If you haven't seen the film, perhaps you don't want to read any further.It's 1957 when this case goes to court. We watch the accused man staring toward the panel in whose hands his fate rests. The jury is all male. We get to know that a public defendant was appointed to defend the accused man. We realize he hasn't done a great job, as most of the men in the jury room are convinced this boy is guilty before he has been proved innocent.We watch as the men are settling into their chairs around the deliberating table, and how a juror is standing by the window looking toward the streets below, lost in thought. It's stifling in the room. Those were the days of not having air conditioned all over, so these men are sweating in the uncomfortable room during one of the worst days of the summer.As the men proceed to have a preliminary vote, juror number eight casts a 'not guilty' vote that shocks the room. How dare he go against the majority? Who is he to stand in the way of what seems to be an open and shut case? This guy is guilty! Thus begins the deliberations in which all these men bring their own prejudices and biases to determine if the boy will go to the electric chair, which by all appearances, seems to be the case here. It's because of one decent man that doesn't mind facing the rest that we get to know why the accused couldn't have done the murder the authorities say he committed. In the process the jurors will get to understand the meaning of justice.This drama owes Henry Fonda a debt of gratitude. We can't think of any other actor playing this juror. Mr. Fonda exudes kindness and he is the only person in the room that is not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt the boy has killed his own father. Not only did he make a contribution as an actor, but also helped produced the movie.Lee J. Cobb, one of the great American actors of the last century, is seen as a juror that sees in the accused young man his own estranged son, who he hasn't seen in a couple of years, having left home because of the conflict with the old man. Mr. Cobb is just the opposite of Mr. Fonda, and he gives an intense performance to show us this man in turmoil. The rest of the cast is wonderful. Each one has his own moment to shine.There is not a single moment that rings false in the movie. In reading a couple of comments about "12 Angry Men", some people marvel there were no women in the jury, or that the accused man's case hasn't been presented by the defense attorney in a more effective way. We have to remember first of all, the times in which the action takes place, and the fact that being a poor man, the accused man has been given an attorney who was obviously not interested in his defense. The young man being from a minority migrant group didn't elicit sympathy from these jurors, at all, which might have been the prosecution's goal in going along with the selection.This is a movie that should be seen by anyone serving in a jury in a court of justice. Mr. Lumet and Mr. Rose have created a timeless film that will be the standard in which everything else is judged.</fullReview>

I wouldn`t have touched this script with a barge pole if I was a producer which just goes to show why - Only very very occasionally - some people deserve to be film producers while - Only very very occasionally - people like myself don`t . 12 ANGRY MEN is a masterpiece , maybe not in the way APOCALYPSE NOW or FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are cinematic masterpieces , but it`s still a masterpiece of high dramaDespite being based on a play Lumet does bring some outstanding directorial flourishes to the film . Look at he scene where the camera cuts from one raised hand to another to an empty space that has a raised hand gingerly creeping into the frame , or the scene where the characters become more and more disgusted with Ed " Know what I mean " Begley`s reactionary diatribe . Please forgive Reginald Rose`s ever so slightly bleeding heart liberal subtext or a couple of unlikely occurances like the scene with the knife , or the fact that jury discussions are nothing like this in real life because even more thought went into this script as went into MEMENTO . This is a classic film and one of the few ones I`ve awarded 10 points to One last point: If you have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN how on earth can you describe yourself as a film fan ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute must for anyone who considers themselves a film buff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films ever made...period. Much of this can be attributed to the exceptional writing and much of this can be attributed to the amazing performances in one of the best ensemble casts in film history. In fact, anyone who considers themselves a film buff or a serious student of film cannot say so unless they have seen this film. I also wish all young directors and writers were forced to watch the film as it demonstrates the power of excellent writing and acting. Imagine...a film that is great that does NOT have special effects, was filmed in black and white, and 99% of which takes place in one small room.Aside from Henry Fonda, all the other actors are a virtual "who's who" of supporting character actors from the 1950s--and all were at the top of their game in this film. Unfortunately, the film has been parodied and copied so many times that the film's originality has been blunted. Oddly, one of the parodies of this plot came from the TV show "The Odd Couple"--which starred Jack Klugman who was ALSO in 12 ANGRY MEN! See this film. And, if it turns out you don't like it, then I suggest you see a psychiatrist!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is "12 Angry Men" a GREAT or NON GREAT movie? Gentlemen of the jury, your verdict ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Juror #1, the foreman (Martin Balsam, football coach): "Well, I won't be too technical, or make a long speech ? it's just that it's a one-set film, so it's new and risky, because you know, dialogs are not enough, we need ?uh ? the thrills ? and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively, it's like the jury room becomes smaller, and the faces bigger. I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax, I could hardly breathe ? I know it's strange, but the direction, well, the movie is one hell of a thriller ? I, well, my verdict is clear: GREAT MOVIE" Juror #2 (John Fiedler, bank clerk): "I don't know. It's an excellent film, served by great performances. Every character was convincing, so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw, for me, there's nothing to add, and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE" Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb, businessman): "I told you why this movie is great, it's just ? thought provoking, everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good-hearted hero and simple-minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which, even at the end, makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment, it's about justice ... without any prejudice, and that deserves respect, yes sir! No doubt for me ? GREAT MOVIE"Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall, stockbroker): "First of all, it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography, played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add: respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence: "12 Angry Men" delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE"Juror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum): "What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization, and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is: GREAT MOVIE"Juror #6 (Edward Binns, painter): "A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects, no big-star cast, no big explosions, no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest, simple movie featuring ordinary men, but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover, regardless of his or her age. Anyway, GREAT MOVIE"Juror #7 (Jack Warden, salesman): "Come on, everyone is using big words and noble concepts, but for me, this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it, the dialogs, the way opposite characters interact, create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch, sometimes, well ? I think you can say anything, but without entertainment, a film is worthless, and the movie could've been a bore, just all talk and no walk, but it wasn't, it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIE"Juror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect): "This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. "12 Angry Men" is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIE"Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired): "This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching "12 Angry Men" I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIE"Juror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner): "I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button ? you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIE"Juror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker): "No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIE"Juror #12 (Robert Webber, advertising executive): "Wow, what I can say, it's not an exact science you know ? you can find a reason A to appreciate it, a reason B or C ? let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons, explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said, why "12 Angry Men" is a GREAT MOVIE"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Flawed classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was younger I thought 12 Angry Men was a near perfect ensemble film with a great group of male players. At that time in those sexist fifties women had an automatic out from jury duty. It was not unusual to have all male juries as we have here.Then I served on a few juries and my concepts changed. One of the key scenes of the film is when Henry Fonda produces a switchblade knife exactly like the weapon the young perpetrator allegedly used in the stabbing death of his father. The second that Fonda produced that knife, someone should have yelled for a mistrial.In all 50 states of the United States of America, a standard jury instruction is that the jury is to decide the guilt or innocence of a defendent on the evidence presented at trial. Jurors are free to come and go until they are sequestered for the verdict. But they are instructed not to go near the crime scene or gather ANY independent evidence. I remember being on jury duty and assigned on a case where the crime took place in an apartment that was one block away from one of two routes to a BMT subway stop that took me to work. And those same subways also took me to downtown Brooklyn and the court house. I made it a point to take the IRT to court for the next two weeks while the trial went on to avoid the temptation of going over to the crime scene.It was a great dramatic effect, but totally at odds with our legal system. I can't believe that something that elementary was left in a film that was purported to be a realistic look at jury deliberations.The juries I was on did debate and in some cases quibble over all the points of the trial. They were a good cross section of the breed Brooklynus Americanus just as in 12 Angry Men. If you watch Law and Order you know how hard the prosecutors job is to get 12 people to convict.Still it's a wonderful group of players that participated here. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are the biggest names in the cast. But others like Robert Webber, John Fiedler, Martin Balsam, and Jack Klugman got their first real notice in this film.Jack Klugman's portrayal was a particular favorite of mine among the group. He's from the same slum background as the defendent and some of the knowledge he has from that environment makes for the most compelling argument for the defendent's innocence. We should be thankful that Sidney Lumet assembled and directed the find cast he did.</fullReview>

But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.The dialogue is realistic and so sharp with a brilliant acting from Henry Fonda and Lee J.Cobb, I feel this film is still underrated even in IMDb rankings.And that line "well, so long" stayed with me ever since I saw the film as on of the greatest lines ever.This film is a symbol of simple but great film-making that suggests a man should always return to his senses every time and every where.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(January,2006) I'll start by saying that if there's anyone who rates this film as "hated it",they obviously don't know hard hitting / good drama when they see it. These 12 actors performances are so alive, vital and powerful, it's amazing to think this film didn't win Best Picture that year. Henry Fonda gives a simplistic yet very deep performance in the way his character says "not guilty" but wisely does not say,"I know he's not". that would've undermined the whole of his performance.Lee J. Cobb is fantastic as not just prejudiced like the other older male juror but just angry inside at everything. Especially when Fonda calls him a "sadist". John Fielder always great as the meek yet outspoken kind. Jack Warden as a guy who'd rather be at the ballgame than having his life interrupted for something he could care less about.E.G. Marshall gives a quiet yet strong performance as well. A man who is so "sure and certain" about everything. Only to be proved wrong later. The rest are fantastic in their own ways as well.Since most of us here are familiar with the story, I wont go into it but I will say I really love how Henry Fonda finally breaks the last two hold-outs into voting "not guilty" for the right reasons.10 stars because it is justifiably so. Anything less would be a crime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The material is slightly forced for dramatic purposes but the delivery is perfect across the board</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one "not guilty" in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.I'm not a massive fan of the "Movie You Must See" podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this "mates in a pub" approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out "films you should see" is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a "classic" but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out ? not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled "racist", "old", "na?ve", "angry" and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has "top-billing" but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the "MYMS" group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Simple, So Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.One of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.Yet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.As sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.12 ANGRY MEN is often cited as one of the greatest films ever. It's a verdict that is well deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I find this movie guilty of being a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With "12 Angry Men", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of "closing in" feeling that he brought to movies like "Network". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision. This may be THE perfect movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest movie ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deceptively complex courtroom drama enthrals for the duration as one man opposes eleven others in a battle of argument, reason, and logic.Starring Henry Fonda as Juror #8, 12 Angry Men is a very claustrophobic drama which conveys the deliberation room of a trial where the defendant is accused of first-degree murder. On the surface the case seems open and shut, with 11 of the 12 jurors entirely convinced by the prosecution's case. Only one dissenter remains, and that is Henry Fonda's Juror #8. Specifically he is not certain that the boy is definitely innocent, just that he doesn't know, and that for him is enough to qualify as reasonable doubt.12 Angry Men certainly is a moralistic tale, of the right to a fair trial and trying to give someone every chance, but it has many more strings to its bow than just this. Indeed, above all else it prides itself in endeavouring to portray a true sense of reasoned and rational argument which tries to overcome steadfast beliefs as possessed by the seemingly unshakable. Initially it may seem that Fonda's Juror is simply playing devil's advocate, but it becomes clear that it is more about standing up for what you believe despite what the facts seem to tell you. The more you scrutinise so-called unshakable evidence, the more you find holes in it, and the more that logical analysis seems to provide the real answers.Obviously, Juror #8 has to persuade those others who seem to have their own agenda, and pre-conceived notions of what truth equals, but nevertheless it is absolutely fascinating seeing how simply he probes the case and reveals the flaws.The whole movie's pace is absolutely perfect, and given its almost exclusive setting of inside the deliberation room it is a testament to the genius of the script and the brilliance of the acting that the duration of the film seems so short. The cinematography is also surprisingly excellent given the lack of scope necessary, with sharp imagery and clever camera-work which gives the whole picture a real amount of life.To detail the jurors themselves; Juror #1 reluctantly appoints himself foreman. He appears to lack esteem, and the chance to boss the table by being the 'leader' perversely appeals greatly to him as he lacks significant contribution to make about the case. He does not want to be useless, so is forced to take charge.Juror #2 is a slight man who is clearly used to being wrapped in his own cocoon, never deviating, so when he ends up as a juror in a murder trial, he is actually thrilled at his fish out of water status. He does not really have much to say about the case, taking it at face value.Juror #3 is the enduring Messenger Service owner. May have an ulterior motive for being so steadfastly sure the accused is guilty, given his first scene depicts ambivalence over the courtroom procedure given to him it is 'open and shut'. As time goes on, and evidence starts to suggest more than meets the eye, he begins to show emotional stress as his hardwired opinion looks flimsier. But he refuses to cave.Juror #4 has more emotional attachment to the trial than most, as he shares the same kind of background to the defendant and takes criticism of 'that kind of person' extremely personally. Experiences inner conflict between head and heart.Juror #5 is a cold and methodical thinker who has an elevated opinion of himself. Emerges more as the deliberations wear on, he is convinced by the evidence that the boy is guilty, and systematically sets about conveying this to the others.Juror #6 is the common working man with very little input, and whose two significant moments are to defend another juror who is being harassed, and to suggest another juror is badly wrong about his opinion.Juror #7 is more interested in the ball game at 8pm than the case. Doesn't want to be there, and while he details a little about the boy's background to start off with, his regular sarcastic quips throughout the story suggest he is simply desperate to be out of there as quickly as possible, with no care about the wheels of justice.Juror #8 is the only juror who does not immediately join the others with their guilty verdict. He has a lot of thought about the case eating at him, and wishes to explore it. He meets much opposition.Juror #9 is a wise, wiley old man who is sharper than anyone else and observed events in the courtroom closer than the others. Makes some smart observations which unearth vital truths.Juror #10 is an old school racist whose opinion is based on prejudice and not facts. A vile and odious creature, he has no interest in 'people like that' roaming the streets, and is offended at having to live in the same city as them.Juror #11 is an intelligent and interested spectator who listens to the facts and analyses them before reaching a conclusion. His European accent draws derision from some others, as does his general nationality, but he rises above it and provides some sensible comments, rarely saying anything which lacks thought.Juror #12 is a good-natured man but not a terribly strong thinker. He does not have much of an independent opinion on the case, often following others, and is often more interested in playing naughts and crosses or boring fellow jurors about his job.Overall, 12 Angry Men is simply as good as cinema can get. Incredible script, amazing performances, and captivating direction.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit overwrought, over-directed, but compelling nonetheless...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twelve-man jury decides the fate of a young man on trial for murder; eleven think the kid is guilty, the twelfth isn't so sure. Director Sidney Lumet makes his directorial debut here, and he's overly fond of riled-up actors shouting at the camera, but he doesn't stray from the proved path of this celebrated play by Reginald Rose, and that's a plus (the material stands quite well on its own). The claustrophobic, muggy atmosphere is rife with tension, and Henry Fonda is a tower of sanity as the only voice of reason. The film attempts to substitute the electricity of a live performance with too many tight shots of angry, sweaty faces, spitting and yelling, however this ensemble cast has a rich anti-camaraderie that puts the film across. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>We Die, But Hey, They Feel Better About Being Rich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:First, like you, I adored this movie as a young man. What a deification of the jury system and how inside of every man is a hidden genius of reasoning. Well, after 40 years of philosophy, though this be voted to the back, I follow our credo: Speak the Truth even though it lead to your death. The scene that tells you all you need to know is the revelation that Cobb, Fonda's nemesis, is voting guilty because he wishes to revenge himself upon his estranged son. There is no reason within his arguments: he is just an executioner. Well, friends, in philosophy this is a logical fallacy called Ad Hominem: To The Person. If you cannot defeat someone's argument call them names or slander their character. See, inside of each one of us, including your author, are predilections to convict or acquit. Ergo, we can turn his argument right upon him with equal facility: Fonda's liberal guilt over his wealth causes him to release dangerous poor murderers, who kill people, so Henry can feel better about being wealthy in the midst of millions of poor and suffering people. This, by the way, is easier than doing the righteous thing and giving his wealth away to relieve the boundless suffering he beholds about him. This boy is his sacrificial lamb of atonement on the altar of his guilt.The movie implies that those who wish to protect the innocent, not Fonda's words punish, no, we seek to save the blood of the innocent we stand in front of and answer to God for. The Ad Hominem logical fallacy, as we are trained to understand, is the last refuge of someone who cannot win an argument. The second premise of the movie is that no matter how overwhelming the mountain of evidence if we but took the requisite time, why it would fall apart like fall's leaves upon the ground. Trust me, if you are in a case like this and the evidence remotely approaches this level, you could ratiocinate over it until the end of our sun: he will still be guilty. You see the synthesis of the liberals Fonda and Lumet? All those who vote guilty are filled with personal demons, they are irrational: please, do not investigate our antithetical predilections to acquit! If the evidence be piled to Alpha Centauri, never mind, if we took the time we would find it is all erroneous. Look, I once thought as you do, it is only after decades of thought living as an ascetic philosopher ruminating over the movie, I see it, finally, as the liberal mind control it has always been.Whatever you think of this review, when you are called for jury duty remember inclinations to acquit are just as strong as to convict. Think always of the helpless ones who stand behind you that count on you to be as dispassionate and objective as you can. If we eliminated everyone with bias, there would be no jury system. Those who believe in God, as I do, believe we answer to Him for our actions. When you hear the heartbreaking music that Lumet and Fonda play as the accused teenager sits there looking sad, remember the blood of the innocent victims that will be upon your hands. Look, I am sorry Fonda feels bad for being rich, there is such a simple solution; let go of your greed and give it to the poor. Do not put us in danger by brainwashing people into believing that those that wish to convict have private demons that bias us from being objective: how childish! As if we could not turn your argument, with equal adroitness, upon you.Look, I know you will vote this to the back, who gives a crap? What I want you to do is think about what I have said to you when you are on a jury. That is why I wrote this, for the innocents who die so white, rich liberals do not have to give their money to the poor. He atones by releasing a token poor person, for his expiation, who cares how many of us die? Q.E.D.And Jesus Said To Zacharias, "one thing more, give all that you have to the poor and follow me." Zacharius turned away and wept for he was a rich man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is as simple as it is profound, and as bare-boned as it is a showcase of true camera-work and directional complexity. It is as much a film about the justice system in America as it is a film about people; a film that lets the viewer into a single room for 90 minutes (the film moves forward quicker than real time) and examines the quirks, insecurities, prejudices and glaring background differences of twelve different characters.The film begins in a courtroom as a murder case is coming to a close. The judge informs the twelve jurors of their duty as though it were just another day in his life, as though the defendant (an 18-year old street kid) has already been proved guilty. In general, nobody in the film expects the potential (and probable) difficulties that the viewer anticipates externally. It is an "open and shut case" as the remarkable, unnamed juror (played by Lee J. Cobb) states in the first ten minutes.Of course it isn't, otherwise 12 Angry Men would be an "open-and-shut" film. Opening credits play over an empty room which gradually fills up as the jurors takes their seats and prepare for the ballot. Over this time, we see windows being opened, negotiations taking place and pleasantries exchanged. If these 12 men agree that the c12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung Filmsase presents enough evidence to show that the crime had in fact been committed, then the verdict will be guilty. But if there is any room for what the judge calls "reasonable doubt", then the verdict changes.Each character in this film is entirely different. It almost feels as though each has been handpicked to take part in a sort of experiment ? and it very much feels like we are watching one unfold. Each man represents something unalike. With one man's decision not to conform, or at least not to believe everything that was discussed in the courtroom, 12 Angry Men erupts. Gradually, we start to understand these men; first, we are let it on some of their social backgrounds ? one is an immigrant (possibly Greek or French) and one admits to have grown up in the same conditions as the young defendant. Both men should be able to relate to the defendant in many ways ? for a moment, we are afforded a glimpse at the defendant's face, an immigrant from an anonymous ghetto. Strangely, both men vote "guilty" without hesitation.12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung FilmsHenry Fonda lets us in on his reason for disputing ? he simply does not want to decide on a person's life in the space of five minutes. This is understandable; the viewer takes his side and so, it seems, does the filmmaker. But some of the jurors argue as though it were personal; as though the young man had slaughtered their own sons, daughters and wives. Some of the men, and most noticeably Cobb as juror no. 3, work themselves up into a blind fury.As the film goes on, it becomes evident that the case was never as clear as the jurors had announced at the beginning. For some, the more reasonable and likable characters, it had simply been a case of accepting the evidence provided without questions. For others, assumptions had been made as a result of deep-rooted prejudices and massive complexes. While many change their minds with the influence of rational thought, some characters simply get angrier and more aggressive; two characters give away their racist views and the powerful scene that runs over the final ten minutes, works to reveal so much about the most moving and brilliant character portrayal in the film.The happenings described in court unfold for a second time over the duration of 12 Angry Men. By the end, it as though we possess the same knowledge of what happened in the courtroom over the days of the trial, as the twelve men in the film. Helmed by Fonda, juror no. 8, the situation is played out again with incredible detail; every argument and theory presented to us is done so with such extreme care and passion. This is one of the film's that stay with you for a lifetime because its simplicity allows itself to be engraved in the mind, while the complexity of it demands that you make sure it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched this movie many times. I finally bought the DVD the other day and watched it again! The level of acting and the intensity of all the performances have, without exception, always taken my breath away. It is a movie that I love and never tire of watching.You forget, as you watch the movie, that pretty much the entire movie takes place in one room. Movies today, actors today, would not be able to maintain the level of suspense that this movie created and hold your attention for the entire hour and 36 minutes. It starts off slowly, and you become part of the jury stuck in that "jury room", frustrated as one man holds out because "he is not sure". Henry Fonda gives an amazing performance as the one-man holdout but all the actors give tour de force performances, and you sit mesmerized as one by one they are all converted. But it is Fonda and Lee J Cobbs, as they fight for the hearts and minds of the other jurors that keeps the tension going. The movie was a good social commentary of the times, regarding the racial intolerance, prejudices and biases that governed people in that era. And watching it again today, I would say not much has really changed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men" is a fascinating but uncomfortably close examination of the workings of constitutional law and the fact that a person's life can be in the hands of 12 people who are themselves full of faults, failings and doubts. The film makes it graphically clear that the people who enforce law are all too human and that there are calm, decent people like Juror #8 (Fonda) who are willing to weigh the evidence and look for innocence rather than rush toward the verdict of guilt..........This is undoubtedly one of the top 3 movies i have seen and i give it a Ten on Ten.........

		<shortDescription>Finely tuned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, what a cast! Fonda doesn't seem like much of a New Yorker, but the rest of the cast reads like a Who's Who in New York movies. All of them except Sweeney and Voscovek went on to lengthy careers in character and support roles.The plot comes from a TV show and is very tightly written. There's hardly a wasted word or an unnecessary gesture. This has its drawbacks because it imposes a dramatic frame on the characters and the development. There's not much sense of "real life" here. Everything fits together too neatly for that. But if events follow earlier events with a logic that is a bit obvious, it's forgivable because the screenplay is done so well. Like "Stagecoach," it may be mechanical but it's as finely tuned as a good wristwatch.Also more or less unavoidable in a short movie dealing with a dozen often conflicting characters is the reduction in their complexity. Each is a stereotype. They practically wear sweatshirts with logos on them. "I AM A SHALLOW AD MAN." "BORED MARMALADE SALESMAN HERE." "KICK ME, I AM AN IGNORANT RACIST." They are capable of changing their opinions but they show only one side of their characters.A third unfortunate quality in the script is that it is imbued with what Tom Wolfe referred to as "nostalgie de la bou" -- a kind of admiration for the lowbrow. Pauline Kael made the same observation back in the early 60s in an essay called "Fantasies of the Art House Audience." What it boils down to is a dislike of the middle-class. Fonda is an architect, a professional. The other good guys in the movie are members of minority groups or ordinary working stiffs with slum backgrounds. The two most repulsive villains (Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb) are self-made men who run their own successful businesses. The rufescent Begley has a line, something like, "I got ten factories going to pot while we're talking' here." Cobb brags about how he built up his delivery business starting out with nothing. A third dummy is a SALESMAN -- of marmalade! (Yukk.)Okay. That gets pretty much all of the weaknesses out of the way. The pluses outweigh the minuses by exactly two short tons. The acting is almost impossible to improve upon, not surprisingly. It's unfair to single out Jack Warden and Martin Balsam for their performances but I'll do it anyway.The photography, by Boris Kaufman, is perceptive and adds to the tension, the feeling of claustrophobia. Especially memorable is the scene in which most of the jurors are standing together, there is a rumble of thunder, and a shadow falls gloomily over the group. It's a small touch but palpable.Lumet manages to suggest New York City effectively in this crowded room, practically the only set. (There is a shot at the end that is done on the steps of the real Courthouse.) Lumet's direction makes the most of his actors' talents. The pauses in their arguments last just long enough for us to take a few breaths.Rose's script avoids an easy ending. Yes, there is reasonable doubt enough for the verdict to turn out as it does, but there is no dramatic introduction of crucial evidence to demonstrate that the defendant is innocent. Did he do it? We don't know. Suppose the kid actually did it and gets away with it? Fonda is twice challenged on that point -- once at the table and once in the men's room -- and in neither instance does he have a reply.Overall, it's a marvelous movie, a lesson in acting, directing, writing, and shooting. The recent updated version has been made politically correct but is not an improvement over this original. See it if you have the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Formula, Colossal Result</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time a few months ago and i was automatically annoyed with myself for having not done so long before. To put short, this film is one of the best ever made and rightfully deserves its position on IMDBs top 250 list. To be honest, there's not a lot that one can comment about the film. There are no special effects, dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that's what makes this film the phenomenon that it is. It is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors, in particular Henry Fonda, that defines the film. The way in which each different aspect of the court case is re-evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions. If you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes (or whatever), i would have kindly asked you if we could watch Die Hard instead, but oh what an ignorant error that would have been. 12 Angry Men is magnificent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pure, simple, undeniable classic. This movie is a thoughtful, well shot, amazingly scripted, fantastically acted masterpiece. Even though the word masterpiece is often over-used (like genius) it certainly, and without dispute applies in this case. Sidney Lumet's directing is top-notch, and Henry Fonda is the still turning point of this small, microcosmic little world - his role has to be one of the most finely acted ever committed to film.Set in an actual New York jury room, it's a claustrophobic, tightly confined set, where 12 very different men deliberate over the guilt of a young boy. Their prejudices, morals and personalities are thrown together and, sometimes violently, clash. Along with a great parallel commentary from the weather (at the beginning of the film, it's a stuffy, oppressive sweatbox, which becomes sidelined by a dark, stormy maelstrom outside the jury room) this is a fantastic film. You'd never think there were so many angles you could get from one single, uncomfortably confining room. Sidney Lumet's directing is amazing, as Fonda's chain-smkoing, softly spoken moralistic character could have been played so much darker; he manages to turn everyone around, slowly but surely, almost effortlessly converting even the most staunchly opposed and stoic juror - but he's not manipulative, sly or underhanded about it. He simply presents what is - he's the pure voice of reason, and he has some cracking lines. The other jurors are great, too. I'm sure we all know someone who fidgets through something important because they've got a football game starting in ten minutes - they all highlight broad generalisations of very human characters. I defy anyone not to find a character that illustrates someone they know in this motley crue. Except maybe Fonda - I don't know anyone cooler than this guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Take a classic film and strip it down to its bare necessities. Gone are the extravagant sets and sweeping camera-work; removed are the lavish visual effects and epic story lines. What we are left with is cinema in its purest form, where acting is the sole driving-force of the narrative, and our attention is retained through the director's thorough exploitation of a bare-bones scenario. Sidney Lumet's debut feature-length film, '12 Angry Men (1957),' is quite simply one of the most arresting motion pictures I have ever seen, a veritable melting pot of gripping performances and impassioned monologues. With the exception of its bookends, and a brief scene in an adjacent washroom, the entire film unfolds exclusively within the one stifling, increasingly-claustrophobic jury room, as a group of twelve jurors {all male, mostly middle-aged and middle-class}, with vastly differing attitudes and prejudices, debate the innocence or guilt of a young Hispanic man charged with the premeditated stabbing murder of his father.Prior to 1957, director Sidney Lumet had already acquired some experience in television, though it wasn't until he released his first feature film, a low-budget offering shot in only 17 days, that he began to attract the attention of critics. Though '12 Angry Men' was commercially unsuccessful {in an age of lavish, technicolour adventures, David Lean's magnificent 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' was more to the taste of audiences of the day}, the film received three Oscar nominations, for Best Writing, Best Director and Best Picture. Of course, it was Lean's epic that won each of these categories, among numerous others. Lumet's film, adapted by Reginald Rose from his own 1954 Studio One teleplay, explores the fairness and infallibility of the American judicial system, and the ways by which personal prejudice may affect the outcome of a criminal case. Though the film opens at the conclusion of the hearing, as the apparently-bored judge (Rudy Bond) offers his final instructions to the jury members, the events of the trial are later recreated through dialogue, without ever resorting to cumbersome flashbacks or heavy-handed narration.What ultimately makes '12 Angry Men' such an electrifying viewing experience are the incredible performances of the twelve main actors, each player delivering a distinct, perfectly-pitched characterisation that contributes richly towards their jury's deliberations on the court-case. Central to the story, of course, is Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), the lone dissenting member, whose unwillingness to send a conceivably-innocent man to the electric chair forces the other jurors to reconsider their stance on what had initially seemed an "open-and-shut case." Fonda, who also co-produced the film, gives a sincere and righteous performance, his actions assuredly heroic, despite the very real possibility that he has helped a guilty criminal escape from justice. The remaining players (in clock-wise order around the juror's table: Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber) each contribute with faultless performances, though some play a more significant role in the proceedings than do others.It would be plain na?ve to label any one of the twelve jurors a "villain," but the man who clashes most frequently with the Fonda's well-meaning dissenter is Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a loud-mouthed and temperamental bully, whose failed relationship with his own adult son has given him an overwhelming prejudice towards young people. Rather than deciding the murder trial based on the evidence, Juror #3 subconsciously relies on his own tremendous bias to settle the eventual fate of the accused man. Equally bigoted is Juror #10 (Ed Begley), whose astonishing partiality is fully revealed in his final manic tirade against lower-class citizens. In one of the film's most brutally powerful sequences, the remaining jurors callously rise from their tables in response to Juror #10's deplorable outburst, his confidence shattering as he realises that he is alone in his narrow-minded views. Also interesting is Jack Warden's Juror #7, an impatient salesman, whose complete indifference to the fate of the Accused prompts him to alter his vote in favour of the majority.Despite working in an extremely confined space, Lumet certainly makes the most of his minimalist setting, and cinematographer Boris Kaufman {who also worked on 'On the Waterfront (1954)'} employed lenses with gradually-increasing focal lengths to make it seem as though the walls were closing in on the characters, heightening the ever-present sense of claustrophobia. Lumet is a master of creating mood, as he also demonstrated in his finest film, 'Fail-Safe (1964),' and there's a certain, illogical urgency in the jurors' proceedings, as though Fonda's character is continually fighting a losing battle. Though some of events of the jury room would technically not be allowed {Juror #8's extra investigations ? purchasing the knife, pacing the old witness' journey to the door ? would undoubtedly have resulted in a mistrial}, the discussions in the film work merely to prove a single, all-too-significant moral: according to the Constitution, the Accused can only be convicted if there exists no reasonable doubt of his guilt. Ultimately, whether he actually committed the murder or not is almost beside the point, particularly when the life of a potentially-innocent man is hanging in the balance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lonely Juror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One does not expect an ordinary black and white movie like "Twelve Angry Men" to set the foundation for great drama. Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber. The honor of Classic fits this film like a velvet glove. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a powerful film that explores: Race, discrimination, prejudice, morals, personal issues and unresolved anger.The film was released in 1957 and is one of the highest rated films on www.IMDb.com which is one reason I've always wanted to see it. However, the main reason is because it's a film that has always been mentioned throughout my Psychology lectures relating to the power of the minority vote and also the psychology behind the jury.Quick summary: The film is based on a murder trial; the accused, if found guilty, will be sentenced to death. The verdict is to be decided by 12 men who are on the jury. 11 of the men believe the accused is guilty, one does not.The film is over one hour and a half and is mainly filmed in the deciding room of the 12 jurors, yet I was transfixed throughout. The film may be in black and white, but do not let this put you off from watching it. It makes you question everything you believe in; what would you do in that situation? Would you have initially voted guilty? Would you have been prejudiced towards the accused? Would you have stood for what you believed in?The ending was brilliant and a pinnacle moment in film history; I believe the entire film proves that one person can question what you believe in and make you reevaluate your life and your morals.Please watch this, I think it's a film that explores so many issues; even if you are interested in subjects such as Psychology, Sociology or even Law itself I think you will find it interesting.Angelica</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never has a film this simple been so damn entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple plot, 12 Jurors deciding the fate of a young man that has been tried for murder.So this film only has one set (with exception to a few minutes) for 1 1/2 hours, yet the writer and director use this to their advantage. The screenplay by Reginald Rose features some of the best dialogue ever expertly delivered in accomplished performances from very talented actors.Henry Fonda leads the cast of these skilfully selected actors and all are just as important as each other... They all have different personalities which makes this film seem even more genuine. It's not just the inability for the men to come up with decision that is making them angry, it's little quirks in the story such as the air conditioning being broke, one man is waiting to go to a sporting event, it is raining outside... All of these things make the time pass by quickly and make you admire even more that a film can be fantastic without car chases, explosions and gunfights. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances fantastic dialogue and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time.10/10 A movie that holds a spot in my top 5 films of all time list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect movie with interesting and mysterious story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First when I decided to see 12 Angry Men, I was kind of surprised how a movie could be so high rated, because i heard everything was happening in one room and it lasted only for 90 minutes. fortunately i was wrong about it.When i first saw it i was shocked. the story is so interesting, that i couldn't miss even a second of the movie. The ending was very good also. this movie shows than majority isn't always right. very often people don't listen to the part of society, which is in minority and sometimes that leads to the disasters.From the middle of the movie, i could already guess that The man, who thought the boy was innocent, would convince others in fact that he was right, but the way to his truth was very interesting and mysterious.90 minutes is just the time movie of that kind needs. there are no extra scenes or something like that, everything is just perfect. Henry Fonda is acting quite well and others play well to so it's pleasant to watch a movie.The movie shows that everyone should listen to others and foresee each other's opinions. i think no one will be unsatisfied of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>+++++ POSSIBLE SPOILERS +++++"Twelve Angry Men" is the perfect demonstration that when you have a good script, an intelligent director an a well selected cast a film doesn't have to be expensive or spectacular to be a real good one. This film is all about dialogues and acting and is set 95% in a small room yet its most entertaining and has a lot of tension.When I said it had a well selected cast I didn't mean an all star cast; Henry Fonda was the only major star; Lee Cobb, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall where very talented supporting actors but not stars; Jack Warden and Jack Klugman weren't even known much in films yet. But a simple direction by Sidney Lumet leaving the development to the script and actors performances worked well and the film is tense, intriguing and most entertaining from beginning to end."Twelve Angry Men" is a "trail film" but with a very original focusing since by following the jury's debate the whole case is clearly revealed up to the verdict. It's also interesting that the verdict is not based in a not guilty conviction by the jurors but for the benefit of the doubt, which means that perhaps the boy actually killed his father.One of the best movies I've ever seen in its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterpiece Nearing Perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been described as "flawless", "immaculate" and "supreme" -and for good reason. '12 Angry Men' is an old Swiss golden clock in the age of Japanese digital watches, a Flemish renaissance mahogany armchair in the era of prefabricated furniture, a handcrafted motion picture at a time of processed film-making. Henry Fonda is the sole dissenting juror in a murder case, who utilizes rational methodology to convince the remaining eleven jurors that the accused is not guilty as charged. Filming almost exclusively in a small, nondescript jury deliberation room, director Sidney Lumet produces a masterpiece of American film-making, reaching the limits of structured cinematic delivery. The opening segment, which rolls uncut for over 10 minutes, is unparalleled, as is the dramatic sequence of the murder recreation. Assisted by an outstanding theatrical script, the film's cast members literally forget to act, allowing their roles as jurors to inhabit their conscience as they perform. Notably, E.G. Marshall (juror #4) splendidly captures the essence of his role as a prudent financier, while Lee J. Cobb (juror #3) writes cinematic history with his phenomenal portrayal of Fonda's leading adversary among the jury. Last but not least, the film's didactic quality is multifaceted, on the one hand illustrating how educated citizens can guide, rather than endure, the democratic process, and on the other hand illuminating how moral purpose and artistic dedication can guide a film's production in ways Hollywood creators often choose to neglect. Overall, a solid film that has earned the respect of successive generations of movie audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE classic jury drama, compelling but not without flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is surely the most famous film jury drama, quite riveting in its dialogue, its claustrophobic jury deliberation room setting, its brilliantly depicted characters, its atmosphere of oppressive heat and tension between these jurors. The twelve angry men are admittedly largely one dimensional stereotypes but they are brought vividly to life by a star studded cast including Henry Fonda, E.G. Marshall, Leo J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman.The jurors include an arrogant stockbroker, a stressed out man from a poor social background, a wise and endearing old gentleman, a quiet and respectful immigrant, an extreme bigot, a loud and pushy businessman with son issues, an advertising executive who sees everything in terms of sales, and a sports fan interested only in getting out in time to see his ballgame. The jury foreman tries to keep the group organized but isn't a particularly bright or thoughtful man himself and seems in over his depth. The (supposed at least) hero of the piece is the intelligent juror number 8, an architect, who appears to take his responsibilities seriously. He encourages full discussion of the evidence when others seem happy to return an immediate Guilty verdict for a young Hispanic defendant accused of fatally stabbing his abusive father. As a result of this juror's persuasive powers, the vote changes from 11-1 for Guilty to a unanimous final Not Guilty verdict.No one would be interested in watching a movie about twelve calm jurors politely and rationally debating the evidence. Thus we have this drama which makes for compelling viewing but isn't for those preferring some degree of subtlety. The case itself is ultra dramatic 'all or nothing', acquittal or the death penalty with no possibility of life imprisonment. Juror 8 has illegally purchased a duplicate knife to the murder weapon and slams it dramatically on the table. These jurors are constantly bickering. One juror threatens to kill another. Eventually the other jurors all turn their backs one by one on the bigot. Surely this must be a textbook example of everything a jury should NOT be! While real life jurors do bring their prejudices and life experiences into the jury room, some of these jurors were simply too unbelievable. For example, 'the bigot' seemed to flaunt his bigotry at every turn rather than, as would be much more realistic, making some effort to conceal it. I believe one would need to look far and wide to find a juror with so little regard for human life that he would happily send a possibly innocent kid off to the electric chair rather than miss his ballgame.As for juror number 8, at first I admired his sense of responsibility and calm, reasoned questioning. However, by the end of the movie, after he had raised doubts (whether reasonable or not is up to individual interpretation) about every single piece of evidence and testimony, I no longer saw him as the heroic champion of justice we're manipulated into believing, but almost felt as though he had some agenda of his own to acquit and would never convict anyone of any crime, whatever the evidence! This jury didn't rationally debate the case at all but as juror 8 would raise some 'doubt', one or other juror would suddenly change his vote, ignoring all the other evidence. A good case could be made that this jury let a murderer go free because they lost sight of the cumulative nature of the evidence as a whole.While this movie is often classed as a character study, a psychological drama, or a study in small group dynamics, it's also considered a commentary on the American jury system. As such, I feel that the writers should have 'done their homework' and had these jurors follow standard jury instructions rather than the gross jury misconduct they displayed -- juror 8 doing his own independent research by purchasing that knife, their questionable little experiment with the old man's rate of walking, their improper acceptance of one of their number as a switchblade 'expert' and taking his opinion of stabbing techniques as gospel. If all this had become known to court officials in real life, this grievous misconduct would almost certainly have resulted in a mistrial.I also felt the movie quite manipulative in casting a defendant who could hardly be more sympathetic, a young kid with poor social opportunities, the victim of bigotry and paternal abuse. What viewer would ever want this boy to receive the death penalty? This film would have packed a greater punch for me if the defendant had been a rather despicable character (or at least neutral in terms of sympathy factor), yet the jury been able to acquit him anyway due to finding reasonable doubt.Therefore, while this film is a 'must see' classic, a thoroughly engaging way to spend an hour and a half, and a masterpiece by comparison with most modern movies, I don't consider it flawless. At least in my case, it hasn't held up well during subsequent viewings and further scrutiny. Entertaining, yes, but I have a big problem with its clearly intended message that this jury, which I see as a lynch mob-turned-group of pushovers, has ultimately served the cause of justice.</fullReview>

But a single person's calm perspective and will for justice now and then help us to rise above our own prejudice. This movie is a bridge across an eternal boundary; has flaws, no doubt, like any bridge, but stands magnificently for 50 years and brings together people of all kinds.

		<shortDescription>This is what the art and craft of fine film making is all about.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film plays so well because of the confining space of the set, the choice to film in black and white, which itself becomes an element of the action, but most of all because of the impressive cast led by the ever magnificent Henry Fonda. It was once said that two actors epitomized the average American and they were Jimmy Stewart and Henry Fonda. Here he is the lone juror in a murder trial that is unsure that the defendant is guilty. He slowly and logically begins to change the minds of the other jurors as they swelter and suffer together in the miserable Jury room. With the exception of the first few minutes of the film the entire action takes place in that confining space as the men behind the masks begin to show their true selves. This is, hands down, a powerhouse film of the first order. This is what film drama is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsurpassed Character Study &amp; Very Good Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The unsurpassed character studies of the "12 Angry Men" would almost make a movie worth seeing even if it had little else to offer. This is also a very good drama that uses everything it has to good advantage. The cast and director Sidney Lumet all do a fine job of sketching each character efficiently and memorably. Every character is important, and almost every line serves a purpose.One interesting thing about the story is that the trial per se is almost not even particularly important. The jury setting is really just a stylized way of high-lighting many aspects of human nature and human interaction, and in particular, the varied ways that different persons respond in situations where their options are limited. The characters have a wide and well-chosen diversity of personalities and opinions, and each one's temperament and attitudes are developed as things proceed.In performing this kind of material, it's important for the actors not to overdo it, or else the believability suffers. It's also a challenge to keep things interesting when the settings and props are so limited. But everything works very well here, and it is a credit to everyone involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>true administration of justice is the firmest pillar of good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I loved this movie. It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is "reasonable doubt" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.The movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. I am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, I frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. That's why I only give this movie 8/10.If this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work I pray to god that I will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter.Regards Simon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1000 Words Is Not Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has been more influential than any other in the way I see the world. Any person who watches it and is later called to jury service cannot help but have visions of themselves fighting for justice. A true ensemble piece, each actor has a chance to truly shine in what must be considered one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made. It is certainly the finest courtroom drama ever made where we only see the courtroom for a minute and a half.Each of the jury members is almost a stereotype. Each of them is an aspect of ourselves: Juror number one. He seems to let his duties preoccupy him somewhat, and in fact puts more interest into them than in the actual reason he is there, blinded by the system.Juror number two is mild mannered and good natured. However he is unlikely to ever make a stand himself. He is the everyman.Juror number three is an emotionally damaged father. He has become a revenger, seeking to punish the defendant because of the anger he has towards his son.Juror number four is rational and logical. However his devotion to logic is pointless, as he has not been passionate enough to discover all of the facts. Rather than questioning, he accepts.Juror number five comes from a violent background. A young man, he reminds us that just because a person lives in a certain neighbourhood that is no excuse for breaking the law or violent behaviour.Juror number six is a working man. He is strong, but respectful and also highly principled. This character is the 'Working Joe', the people who just get on with their jobs and do them.Juror number seven is ambivalence personified. One might almost call him the id. Continually throughout the movie he makes jokes, at the beginning his wise-cracking nature is amusing but it soon begins to grate. He is more interested in satisfying his own petty desires than doing a good job.Juror number eight is decency. The lone dissenter. The only person who initially questions all that they have been told. Throughout the movie he pushes his fellow jurors to see past what has been so easily presented and to search for the deeper possible truth.Juror number nine can be summoned up in one word: Understanding. While number eight may be the first person who questions, without number nines support he would have failed. It is nine that, more than anybody else, truly empathises with the witnesses. It is his initial insight into the human condition that sways a number of jurors, including juror number four.Juror number ten is blinded by his bigotry. Unlike any other jury member he seems to have no real endearing qualities, having an annoying way of speaking, a rude manner, even an intrusive cough.Juror number eleven is an immigrant. He has come to America because of all that it represents. Because of this it is ironic that he is the one who seems to remind others of what it means to be part of a democracy.Juror number twelve represents hesitant behaviour. He is the only jury member to change his mind more than once.Within these twelve characters there is a lot of symbolism involved. Juror number eight falters only once. When talking with six he is forced to question the full implications of allowing a guilty man to go free. Despite all of the passion and and reasoned arguments given by other jurors, it is this simple man who is the only person who makes number eight question himself. Juror number twelve, the unsure character, actually works in advertising. Though he can tell others what to want he is unsure himself. Juror number nine, who supports number eight more than any other, is also seated next to him. The most symbolic figure is, of course, number eight.Unlike any other jury member he does not offer a single piece of personal information about himself throughout the entire movie. Anything we do learn about his personal life or background we learn because other jury members have asked him. He is concerned only with finding out what is relevant to the case. He is an architect. He is a man who helps others realise their dreams, helps other build something great. Of course he is also dressed in white, like a lone paladin, a night in shining armour slaying the evil dragon. Fonda played Wyatt Earp in My Darling Clementine, a role he was deservedly famous for. Who better than a mythological law man to fight for justice now? We know right is on his side.However it is not just the acting that shines. The direction is superb. Initially Lumet cleverly places the camera above eye level, using a wide angled lense. Throughout the movie this gradually changes until we are finally seeing the action from low down with the focal length of the lens having been increased. This leads to a greater feeling of claustrophobia, with tight zoom-ins causing sweaty, angry faces to fill the screen. The most notable exception to this is the scene where all of the jury distance themselves from the racist views of number ten. Here we see him isolated and alone, and indeed it is the one time we see the entire room on the screen, further enhancing the feeling of his loneliness.In the end only juror number three is left voting guilty. He is put in the same situation as number eight was earlier. However, unlike number eight he does not have the conviction of his beliefs and so quickly crumbles, unable to stand against the other eleven.12 Angry Men remains an important, much beloved movie. It shows us many facets of humanity, the highs and lows, and also what one man can do if he truly believes he is right.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How being different can make a Difference (Spoiler Alert)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's often that many movies or readings have multiple themes, but the one I would like to focus on in this film is acceptance of being different. The term different is described as "not the same as another or each other; unlike in nature, form, or quality". For me growing up was a bit difficult I grew up in a straight Mexican home, I was the only mixed child (Black and Mexican) so I was forced to be different. As reflected in the movie when one juror decides to stand for a cause (voting not guilty) and in result of being different he was greeted with unpleasant responses. He more courageous than I because he had a choice, and he stood for more than himself. He was the starting factor for a movement that changed and maybe saved a life. Remember in High School, when everyone was picking their dream job and careers so many people dreamed differently then others and it was okay some wanted to be; Doctors, Lawyers, Business Owners and so fourth, in return before even accomplishing their desire they were respected. On the other hand you had the real dreamers like me, aspiring actor, models, entertainers courageously choosing a different unguided path to accomplish their dreams. In response for being different and not working a nine to five like most; We faced some of the same challenges as the juror who said not guilty did. However, this movie messages was to send its okay to be different; as long as you stand up for what you believe in thats when the quality of ones character is revealed. If we take a look history all the greats had mentors Phil Jackson to Micheal Jordan, Andy Grove to Steve Jobs, Benjamin Graham to Warren Buffet. So if you're out there being different whatever the case may be in. Keep being different, because it was the difference that will make you stand out above the rest.(MLK, Rosa Parks, John Brown, Lincoln) There might not be ribbons or awards that can show value for the qualities of leadership in that matter but there are student out there like me hungry to learn from someone like you and in the real world that is what makes a difference.</fullReview>

The mystery slowly progresses with details coming out every 10 minutes. It is a punch on the judicious system and shows beautifully how a persons life is dependent on 12 random jurors who do not care at all about him. Acting is superb. Character development is astounding because by the end i knew everything about every character. Overall the mystery is not as great as I had expected it to be,but the story brilliantly shows human nature which has made it one of the greatest movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest of All Time - Beyond a Reasonable Doubt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a distance, 12 Angry Men might look like your customary courtroom drama that Hollywood churns out every couple of years. Look closer and you will find that Sidney Lumet's debut turn as a director is an exemplary study in characterization and a crash course in pure filmmaking.Most of the action takes place within the confines of a single room on what is supposedly "the hottest day of the year". A jury made up of 12 men has to decide the fate of a teenage boy who is accused of a gruesome murder. The defendant has everything going against him - a couple of witnesses, a murder weapon, a sloppy public attorney and the fact that he is from a less privileged class of the society. Over the next 95 minutes, 12 Angry Man watches as 11 jurors, first convinced of the suspect's guilt overcome their less than democratic prejudices and are slowly won over to the side of reasonable doubt by one man's doubts about the accused's guilt.Sidney Lumet creates energy and movement through quick editing and varying camera angles, which makes the film pulse with power and emotion despite its one set location. Operating within the constrictions of a limited budget, Lumet tightens the noose by accentuating the excruciating pulse of the ceiling fan and slowly narrowing his shots on his characters as the film approaches its climax. A special mention should be made here of ace cameraman Boris Kaufman, who ratchets up the claustrophobia with every close-up and ably heightens the drama, despite the confining setting. The actors ? all 12 of them ? are top notch as the '12 Angry Men' in what is to date one of the best ensemble casts to have graced the silver screen.The drama plays out at an engaging pace making this brilliant war of words an entrancing cinematic experience. Lumet gives us an incisive and gripping film that is as relevant today as it was almost 60 years back. If you love movies, you owe it to yourself to see this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a quiet afternoon here in Nicosia so i decided to sip on my coffee and watch the old time classic 12 Angry Men, I won't go into deep details because i'm still amazed by the performances in the movie. A movie with a minimum budget and filming on the same location it's an exceptional thing to do in the 50's where the film critics and movie people where expecting the 'getaway' film look where they could express themselves and not just watching some guys talking in the same room. But guess what? This is a movie about 12 guys just talking in the same room for 1 and a half hours and that's what makes this movie a complete masterpiece, A jury of 12 man deciding on the fate of an 18 year old boy whether he is innocent or guilty. It's a must watch, this movie will be remembered for some a good amount of centuries to go. Recommended for all audiences. I will write a full review of the movie soon as well as i rewatch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 men unknown to each other come together for one day and leave at the end of the say, perhaps never to see each other again, but what they learn about the accused and themselves makes for one of the greatest films ever seen.The dialog, the facial expressions, the backgrounds of these people and how it affects their thinking is fantastic.If you've never seen it and you call yourself a movie buff, you don't know what you're missing.Most of these actors went on to great thing in their professions and it takes a very simple yet effective movie like this to showcase their acting talents.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes it is very hard to describe something you like specially when it is so simple. The whole movie took place in a single room and the characters just kept on talking! If someone invites you to such a movie the first thing that will come to your mind would be "Boring"! Well its not even close to that.The movie is extremely entertaining and uplifting. The story is very well written and keeps you tight to your chair to the end.I read some reviews about the movie criticizing the absence of female characters also having all the jury as white men, I trust that would be understood taking in consideration it was made back in 1957.To me it is a MUST see and deserves it rank in IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing 12 Angry Men about 10 years ago and really enjoyed it, but I watched it a bit closer last week, and realize what a great movie it really is. I love the movies of the 40's and 50's and I would have to say that 12 Angry Men is up there as one of the best 5 movies of that era for me. There are some many things happening in this movie, that it takes more than one viewing to pick it all up. The camera work is first class, starting off with full view of all 12 jurors, and as the movie progresses and the jurors re-asses their decisions, the camera show the jurors looking straight down the lens, giving the impression they are talking straight to the audience. No names are given till the very end of the movie and then it is only 2 jurors, apart from a quick scene in the courtroom and outside at the end, the rest of the movie is filmed in the jurors room on a hot stinky summers days. Although not a long movie, the emotional turmoil felt by the jurors is explosive and the audience are drawn into the same gut wrenching feel. I highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of those classic black and white films that has to be seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a film that deals with a number of issues including racism, justice, and standing up for what we believe is right. The acting is amazing and the story is even a better. The main conflict is the decision 12 men must make about the fate of a young African American man who has been accused of murdering his father in cold blood with a knife. It seems to be quite obvious to the majority of the jurors that the kid is guilty, except for one man. When the men vote on the guilt of the buy, it is 11 guilty, 1 not guilty.As the film moves forward, we see the one man (juror #8) fight as hard as he can for what he believes to be right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men may just be a perfect movie and if it isn't, then it's pretty damn close. I can't think of another film that was simply people in a room arguing for an hour and a half that captured my attention as much as this one did. If you can write a script that keeps people entertained by simply listening to what you wrote then you deserve limitless praise. Watching these men slowly examine every detail of the case they're given and watching them internally and externally debate whether or not the accused kid is guilty is some of the most riveting pieces of cinema that has ever been filmed. This very well could be in my top 10 favorite movies list and I cannot praise it enough. This film needs to be a required viewing for all film fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely say a film is perfect, but this one just might. If you haven't seen it yet, turn off your laptop or whatever, go to the nearest store that sells DVDs (I have no idea if it exists in BluRay) and buy it (downloading is bad !). Then, sit on your freaking couch and watch the darn film ! (Or whatever, just see it ASAP).This "huis-clos" is absolutely brilliant ! The acting's great, the plot is smart, the characters' portraits throughout the movie are very interesting (mostly because they're all different).I have waited a long time before seeing it, never quite finding the motivation to do so. I really can't explain why ! Maybe partly because I was afraid it would have aged too much... but I was entirely wrong.I had seen a play with the same plot, and loved it as well. I'm glad I finally watched the film, and I invite you to do the same !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazingly Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few movies that make you go speechless, remain awestruck due to their sheer concept and execution. This is one such movie.12 men, each from a different background, different views and opinions, strangers to one another, come together, along with their personal prejudices, to reach a decision acceptable to all. This line itself shows the magnitude of complexity involved, and to make a movie out of it is a work of true genius and a one that leaves you spellbound.Right from the first shot, till the final one, you are so engrossed that you would even forget to breathe. If the background sound track, screenplay, script, direction are the cake, then the roles enacted by the characters (I say characters here, not the actors, because you believe they are truly the 12 angry men) are the icing on top of the cake.Surprisingly it was only after the movie, did I realize that it was a black and white movie. The movie shows that to make a good movie, you don't need exotic locations or high drama, or superstars. All you need is a good story and good actors who make you forget they are merely playing their parts in the play.The movie teaches you how an analytical mind and logical thinking can make a difference of life and death. It teaches you to be the most responsible when you have a person's life at stake. It shows how our personal prejudices and upbringing can affect our reasoning, how our senses play with our sense of judgment, how we let our emotions take over, at a time when it is required to be fair and impartial, how we tend to be a part of the crowd because we scared to be the odd ? man-out. How one man, one true, sensible and empathetic man, it takes to make a difference. How important it is to have an objective and open mind, at any point of decision-making - in life/ death matters. How we are so stuck upon the facts and what we see, that we forget to use our mind, the ultimate powerful tool that we have. And that all it takes is sense and reason to convince someone, not decibels.There are movies that make you laugh, or cry. There are movies that make you wonder and then there are movies that make you think, force you to ponder upon it, understand it, and learn from it (if possible). This is one such movie and a must ? watch for one and all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other reviews pretty much sums it up. It's a great movie, that really proves that 12 good actors is all you need to make a top notch movie. It might be old, slow and sometimes really predictable; but for a movie from 1957 it might be the first movie to ever do anything like this. If not the first; it's the first one to nail it.If you are going to sit down and watch this movie, do not expect a movie with a lot of cool movie effects, because it doesn't have any. People nowadays seem to think that a movie is slow and not good if it goes more than 2 minutes without any action. In this movie they, as mentioned earlier, proves that if the movie has a good lineup of actors, and a good manuscript/director; and set your mind to it, you start putting yourself into the mind of the actors as real people and not actors.That alone makes this better than most movies I've ever watched. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry man, you will be the 13th, Yes I am true. One man stands against the rest and argues that the boy may not be guilty.Henry Fonda plays one of juror who does not feel the boy was guilty with the evidence provided. The movie revolves around the scenario of his reasonable doubts with the evidences and that makes other jurors to get convinced. At first the other men were demanding, impatient and rude. But Henry stands still with his doubts and put them on to the other jurors.12 Angry Man is one of the greatest films ever made. It will grab your attention from the start and make you sit down and think long after you finish watching.My rating 10/10. Will appear in my Top 100.Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

That kind of argument which was the movies main platform is the perfect entertainment. Solving something with logical explanation. That movie remained us that we just don't have to saw a bunch of fact which was discovered, may be there is something which is still unknown. we always make mistake and for that many people have to suffer. keeping calm and solving something is the coolest thing. I personally like that movie because of the store. I don't think so that anyone is going to give it less rating. that movie was pure entertainment. i never felled bore when i was watching even the movie was only in a room. every line was interesting, which cant be ignored.

		<shortDescription>The Best Courtroom-Drama Ever Made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To Kill a Mockingbird garner the reputation as the best courtroom drama as it ranks the highest on most lists. It is a great film, I'll admit, but 12 Angry Men blows it out of the water. Funny thing is, this takes place in one room for 98% of the whole movie. There's about one minute in the actual courtroom in the beginning and one minute outside the building at the end. The rest is in the room where the jurors decide whether or not the defendant is guilty. When a movie takes place inside one room throughout the whole movie, the script has to be extremely strong and exciting. 12 Angry Men's script is those. It follows 12 very distinctive jurors who know that a Spanish-American youth murdered his father. All evidence gathered points to him, so all think that they can reach a guilty verdict right away. But Juror #8 (Fonda) is the only one that thinks the kid is innocent. One by one, Juror #8 convinces the eleven others that the young man is not guilty as they carefully analyze the evidence they were given. Each piece of evidence that is turned around is sheer genius and very thrilling. I actually consider this to be a courtroom- thriller because of how exciting it is. I found my heart rate rising at the site of each piece f the puzzle being put together. I could only imagine how this movie would have turned out if Alfred Hitchcock directed it. Fun fact: only two jurors' names are revealed at the very end, with the audience forgetting they do not know anybody else's names. Aside from this being very thrilling and educational, and having a great script and characters, it deals with themes of racism and family, as both play important roles on why the Jurors vote "guilty" in the first place. Scale of 1-10: 11/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back when Dialogue Mattered...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nowadays, it's hard to find a screenplay that's based solely on dialogue. The mere suggestion of locking 12 men in a room, having them debate with each other and making a movie out of it in the 21st century would be unheard of - God forbid people might actually like it!I'll be honest, that was my initial reaction upon reading a brief summary of this movie. But being a fan of classics, I knew that somehow this would work. There is no need for a visualization of the crime; there is no need for fancy props (save for a knife and a diagram), there is no need for special effects. The powerful acting and emotional dialogue in this film are enough to sell its message, and it is a meaningful message at that.This film is a must-see, for lovers of classic films and great acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot of (12 Angry Men) is incredibly splendid. And also the choosing of this subject generally and this specific case. Even though this movie is very simple from production wise, such kind of dialog is almost impossible to do it perfectly. I mean writing an ideal script of 12 people in one scene in this way is amazing by all of these people who are from very different backgrounds and don't know each other. Also they not just chatting or hanging out, they are working in very difficult conflict which they have to solve in in one season. The several transitions and changes in this long scene is so flawless and smooth in a way that you would definitely believe it is all logical and so reasonable. Furthermore, the performance of the main character who is (Juror #12) is perfect and I like so much because of is ability of convincing other people and how he used a careful plan to clarify his opinion and the required tools for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is my favorite classic movie that has great plot that really makes you think. Taking place in a courthouse for the entire movie, 12 jury men discuss whether or not a man is guilty of murder. 11 of the men think he is guilty, mainly because they just want to go home. But one man thinks he may be innocent. They discuss the murder throughout the entirety of the movie. I believe classic movies are generally looked down upon by my generation (teens) just because it is old, this angers me that people are that ignorant, this movie is truly impressive and timeless. It is very engaging that kept me glued to the screen. The dialogue is really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Not-So-Angry Convert</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I decided to give it a few days after watching this film before writing my review, including enough time to watch several other top-rated films from this time period just to get some further perspective.The film was simply fantastic, an absolute intellectual orgasm. Never did I dream it possible that a film over 50 years old could make me physically jump out of my chair, leaping and punching the air with glee, after the end credits rolled. I felt an enormous sense of justification in taking the time to watch this very old film.At the beginning of the film we're presented with 12 indistinct men of no-particular defining characteristics, but by the end of the film we can clearly recall the decisions and personalities of each individual and how they arrived at their conclusions.Except for very brief opening and ending scenes, the entire film takes place in a single room with nothing else going for it other than the script, acting and camera work. It made me refocus on what film really is; a visual story presented to us by a film-making crew and various actors, but in modern times, sometimes consisting of a much weaker script clouded by heaps of visual effects and the use of technology.You've really got to see this film to understand why it's so good, currently rated no.6 of all-time on IMDb for a very good reason.I'd like to delve deeper into the jury's decision, but I can't, without adding spoilers to my modest review. I'll leave it at that then. Reward your intellect by giving this master work a chance to unfold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie of it's kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I did not expected a lot from this movie. I knew that it was in the top 250 and that it was a cult classic. However, a lot of the top 250 movies were boring for me so this was not a strong indicator of quality.The only boring portion of the movie were the first 30 seconds. Afterwards you are thrown in a room where you can observe and understand human nature better than in 4 years as a psychology major.This is a movie about how our past, our jobs, our social, emotional, mental, economic contexts determine who we are. We have the guy who simply doesn't care. We have the shy guy who is very smart but influenced and by the end of the movie, gains confidence and courage. We have the passive aggressive guy. We have the wise guy. We have the aristocrat.We have 12 different personalities, thrown in a room trying to reach a single conclusion. And how they do that, each on their own is art. This movie is amazing, not only as artistic value but from what it can teach you. It is paced so well, not a moment longer, not a moment sooner. The actors are generally amazing and Henry Fonda played his role very, very well. Without trying to insult this masterpiece, it's like Big Brother but with a strong, very strong intellectual and maybe even philosophical background.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the film opens we see the inside of a court room; the evidence has already been put to the jurors and the judge is reminding them of their solemn duty... the twelve of them must reach a unanimous verdict and a guilty verdict will mean an automatic death sentence for the accused. The way the jurors talk as they enter the jury room it sounds like an open and shut case; they call for a quick vote before any discussions take place; eleven men say he is guilty, but one dissents. Juror Eight explains that he doesn't necessarily believe that the accused, an eighteen year old slum boy, is innocent but he won't allow him to be executed without the jurors even discussing the evidence. On the face of it the evidence is compelling; the accused bought a knife just like the murder weapon a couple of weeks previously, the woman across the railway line says she looked out of the window and saw the killing, the man below says he heard the accused shout 'I'm going to kill you' before hearing the body fall and seeing the accused leave the building. Gradually they look at each piece of evidence in turn and as doubts are raised the number of 'not guilties' increases but some jurors are adamant that they just know he did it; to get an acquittal prejudices must be overcome too.Set almost entirely within the confines of the jury room this film is rightfully considered a classic; it may not contain any action but it is taut from start to finish. The fact that we haven't seen any of the trial means the viewer must rely on what the jurors say to decide whether or not they think the accused is guilty and for the whole time they are deliberating we don't even know their names. The cast of twelve do a great job playing each of the very different characters; obviously Henry Fonda stands out as he is the best known actor and plays the man arguing against the majority but each of the others also put in fine performances; especially Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley who play the two jurors most determined to bring in a guilty verdict. The way some of the evidence is questioned in the jury room in a way that it was never questioned in court may be a little unlikely... especially the incident with the second knife but it isn't too far fetched and that particular moment is a brilliant piece of theatre that anybody who watches the film will remember for years afterwards. This is one of those films that everybody should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best film I've ever seen. Adding a bit of personal touch, I can say this is the only film I've seen more than 3 times (5 times). I even created this account on IMDb just to review this film.Being accustomed to color films, initially I thought that this film would be quite dull and boring. But I still decided to give try, considering the high rating given to it in most of the movie rating sites.Initially, at least for the first 10 minutes, it was boring. The jurors were chatting among themselves, going to washrooms, cursing the heat... But as the actual arguments began, it became interesting; I mean really interesting. Of course, it was obvious what the final verdict would be: the boy was to be acquitted. But the way the arguments were presented was fabulous. It never appeared like a film. Instead, it appeared to be a real debate- with jurors showing emotions, ego and prejudice- just like in real life. The acting was fantastic with almost all actors performing extremely well( 8 of twelve were very good. Rest four were good enough, though slight improvements were possible. I forgot their numbers so I'm cant point 'em out)There isn't much of a plot to this film. Almost whole of this film is made up of dialogues. In fact the plot is so small that it can be written in less than 50 words( movie is about 100mins long).The entire filming(90%) takes place in just one room (including attached bathroom). Basically, its the arguments that makes this film an all time masterpiece. Traditions may change, style may change, but logic and rationality doesn't.In my opinion this movie is a "must watch".P.S.: DON'T WATCH THE REMAKE AT ANY COST. It is terrible. I mean really hopeless. Yes, it is in colour, but the acting is so bad that I couldn't watch it for even 10 minutes. It appears like a sham. The dialogues are almost the same as the original film but lacks the charm. I would prefer watching the old movie again over watching the remake. The jurors appear to be anxiously waiting for their turn to speak out the dialogues they have memorised. The main character appears weak and fragile. The other jurors appear like students acting in school plays: only thinking of when their turn comes, stiff, lacking spontaneity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It as been a while, that I wanted to see this movie, but I never was brave enough to see it, since it is a 90 minute movie, where the movie it's all concentrated on a 12 men deliberation. Otherwise, this movie actually surprised my ideas, indeed. This movie is surprisingly brilliant, it is very simple but wonderful at the same time, it just shows how can a simple movie without any special effects can be turn to a real masterpiece. The whole cast is amazing, specially Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb which made this film even more incredible, thanks to their powerful performances. The characters are impressive, there is a wonderful job on that department, all jury's are different from each other, in personality and class terms, which in my opinion made a very good character extension. The dialog was genius, very original and creative. Filmography was beautiful, the camera focusing the juror's faces was really impressive with the black and white picture as well. What also impressed me was the impact that this all discussion between the 12 men can make a perfect impression of our society of today, even though this film was made in 1957.This is really an outstanding classic movie, which is really worth to see, and that I really wasn't expecting for its marvelous success.</fullReview>

It is also in my view, Henry Fonda's best role.I think what I liked more than anything else in this film, is Henry Fonda sticking his neck out from the crowd, standing for what is right and what is just, against the ridicule of others.Directed by Sidney Lumet in 1957, and produced by Henry Fonda himself, this is a masterpiece of cinema and acting. Any half decent bloke watching Fonda play his part, will likely as not relate to Fonda 100 per cent.If you only ever get the chance to watch one more movie your whole life, watch 12 Angry Men starring Henry Fonda, made in 1957.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 angry men - masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows how you can make a film on the lowest budget possible, with only one or two scene sets and 12 good actors. Basically the whole movie takes place in one room where a jury of 12 men discuss their verdict for a young man suspected of killing his father. Reading the lines above you might think this is a boring movie, but the plot unfolds, as only one man of the jury is not convinced that the boy is guilty and slowly begins to convince the other members of the jury of his doubt. The story becomes at times a detective story, the jury trying to put together missing pieces of the murder puzzle. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. It stresses out the importance of declaring someone "not guilty" if there is a reasonable doubt in your mind about his guilt. It shows that you should always ask questions and not accept everything on first hand.Besides these simple, yet profound ideas, there is a solid acting from everyone of those 12 jury members. Each is unique in his way, with his own personality,history and background. There is the typical immigrant, the wise guy cracking up jokes, the mediator, the wise old man, the educated man with stiff views of the world, the geek, the self-made man who did not forget where he came from, the choleric, the prejudiced man, the stupid guy who does not give a damn about this trial but only about getting to his football game in time. They don't have names, in fact there is no name mentioned until the very last scene in the movie, each jury member just has a number, yet you distinguish them very easily just by their personality. Some are given more screen time, some less, but they all do some marvelous acting. Last, but not least, the camera and directing! Can I just say, for a movie taking place in one room, it's really amazing...stressing out gestures, faces of people, objects to give depth to the scenes. I'll never forget the scene where one jury member just tries to convince the others of the young boy's guilt, because "these people (living in slums) are born this way and they do these things, they're violent, they're animals" and one by one, the jury members leave the table, the place of dialog and go to other corners of the room, signaling that they do not wish to continue this conversation. Or the scene where they do a re-enactment of an old man trudging along to reach his front door. Truly, a masterpiece, I recommend it to anyone anytime! 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unlikely, but it is possible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is directed by Sidney Lumet and adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. The cast is headed by Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or innocence of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. Except for two short scenes at the beginning and end of the film, it's filmed entirely on one set, that of the jury deliberation room.Sweaty, gritty, claustrophobic-all words that sit snugly in the context of Lumet's excellently crafted deconstruction of 12 men trying to arrive at one verdict in the case of a Puerto Rican youth on trial for the murder of his father. The evidence appears overwhelming, there's witnesses, a murder weapon and motive, the boy is surely on his way to the electric chair. 11 of the men are convinced he's guilty, only one man stands alone, Henry Fonda's juror number 8, who refuses to turn in a vote of guilty until the evidence and facts are discussed at length. As the others rail against him and tempers get frayed, juror number 8 prompts the others to examine their own prejudices and commitment to justice.A lesson in tight direction and editing, and with performances to match, 12 Angry Men is quite simply not to be missed by those seeking to venture into classic cinema. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest victories of human over ignorance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"12 angry man" is one of those legendary movies that can be watched at any time in human history. I am sure this movie will still be in the top 10 of the greatest movies of all times. It is a simple but complex movie. It has a perfect content - great and different characters, intriguing plot, climax and so on.Maybe the end is a little bit predictable but luckily it doesn't make this movie boring. What makes this film great is the plot. 12 men have to decide if a man is guilty or not. The man's life is at stake. One man, who cares for life is up to make things clear. He doesn't want to let the young man be sent to die so easily. He openly questions his guilt of the crime, and therefore saves him from gallows. Victory over ignorance and dumb obstinacy is important in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Compact, vivid, progressive--not a civics lesson, but a study of human nature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men (1957)What makes a movie shot almost entirely in a single room so compelling? It isn't the built-in civics lesson, even though it does make you glad for the jury system. Even more than the apparent plot about twelve men and their deliberations about a crime, there is a plot about human nature. The men are all etched just enough to become types--not stereotypes in a bad sense, miraculously, but kinds of people we recognize. And with amazing economy, the strengths and flaws of those kinds of people, simplified too much for reality but compressed just perfectly for the movies, become the guts of this play of passion.It doesn't hurt that the editing is supremely crisp, the continuity is spot-on, and the casting is brilliant, if color-blind (see below). It also doesn't hurt one bit that the cinematography by Boris Kaufman (see On the Waterfront), is that really clear, dramatic black and white photography of post-noir 1950s. It's beautiful and startling, showing at times the interactions of the group in the room as a whole in a kind of walking ballet, and at other times close-ups of hot faces straining to come to terms with the other eleven people in the room. In other words, this is a technically virtuosic ensemble piece, cast and crew, top to bottom.As viewers, it is this coming to understand people that makes us part of the scenario. We might see ourselves or our friends in these people, but even if they are strangers, if they seem a full half-century away from our own types, they are still people we are curious about. Sitting on a jury, being locked together in a room, and having to decide about the execution of the accused, all of this makes you grapple with personalities and motives quickly. There is not getting around deciding--both on the verdict, of course, but also on what kind of men are in the room. Why are they voting one way or the other? What makes them stubborn, or wise, or clever? Or funny, annoying, selfish?The all white male jury is potentially a problem. It should have been a problem back then, when planning the movie, and it becomes one now because the movie represents history, whether or not it likes it. After the Civil War (by amending the Constitution, and with a Civil Rights Act in 1875) it was illegal to exclude blacks from juries, and this was tested in court many times (often in the South). New York City could easily end up with an all white jury (and downtown Manhattan it isn't unlikely) but it is surely conspicuous for a movie trying to represent the sweep of humanity in a single room. Likewise with women, who by the 1930s were regularly part of New York City juries. In the 1950s, white men might have been more clearly enrolled on the lists used to select jurors (such as voting lists), so again, an all-male white jury isn't so unlikely, just conspicuous.Having said all that, I think the movie works partly because on some simple level, the jurors are all the same! To have made them more clearly diverse would have changed the way we saw them get to know each other. Having one guy be from a "slum" and know about knives is revealed slowly, and we can't really outwardly distinguish that man from any other. Even the one clear immigrant has assimilated. So 12 Angry Men isn't an accurate capsule or a documentary exercise, but a study in types and countertypes, reactions and resistance to action.Director Sidney Lumet cut his teeth for a decade with early t.v. and when he ventured into movies (this was his first success) he did so with a visual reaction against the flatness and static cameras of much of that medium, back then especially. He and Fonda worked together notably in Fail-Safe, another politically charged drama in black and white (and one where Fonda is again trapped in a small room). And later, in Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico (both starring a young and amazing Al Pacino) he again uses a highly charged external problem to deal with psychological responses that are even more intense. I want to live long enough to see this movie in 2057, just to see if it holds water once that period is looking quaint and distant (the way 1909 does to us from here). Already, as much as this is a fabulous, inspiring, vivid movie, it is also showing its seams, its contrivance, and its agenda too clearly. For now it's a concise dramatic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I don't know what the truth is. I don't suppose anybody will ever really know"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally the premise of twelve middle aged men locked into a room arguing would hardly be considered the basis for particularly riveting or dramatic cinema, with theatrical potential at best, but hardly dynamic or visual enough to appeal to a mass audience. It can only be considered merciful that such an attitude was not one shared by television director Sidney Lumet, who instead seized advantage of a myriad of factors which could have resulted in a catastrophic film (a solitary location, a hasty shoot, budget constraints) and somehow extracted from them an effort to which the billing of 'one of the greatest motion pictures of all time' would be a title hardly disputed by the general public. Lumet's persistence in the face of adversity suggests he may have scented something great in the making, and the raw energy and crackling intensity 12 Angry Men generates is a testament that such dedication was entirely justified. While the legal thriller is always a precarious genre, walking an uncertain line between being plausible in a real life context while avoiding being too slow and talky to appeal to an audience, Lumet centers in upon the inherent drama in the court setting, while consciously shying away from the tendency to approach such cases in black and white terms. What makes Fonda's Juror #8's solitary quest to sway his fellow jurors all the more compelling is the moral ambiguity of the situation. Fonda is not a white knight crusader unflappably convinced of the righteousness of his actions or the accused party's innocence - in fact, he openly admits that his actions may be resulting in the release of a guilty murderer. Instead, Fonda becomes a crusader for the ideal of truth and plausible evidence, notions that Lumet's film toys with throughout as its Rashomon-style construction of past events through various uncertain accounts becomes a more philosophical meditation on society's constant yearning for information and knowledge. Taking similar notes from Hitchcock's Rear Window, the film addresses the voyeuristic insatiable desire to be a privileged spectator, but crucially, just like the jurors, the audience is continually kept in the dark despite similar desperation to piece together a definitive account of the crime committed. Eventually the conclusion can be drawn that it scarcely matters in the end, as the facts of the case have become so twisted and warped by human preconceptions that only gut instinct and an earnest lust for honesty and justice can hope to prop up a system so reliant on fallible misconstructions. And although Lumet draws out the tension surrounding the eventual verdict to uncomfortably taut levels, by the end, the crux of the film appears to scarcely center around the court case itself anymore, the focus subtly shifting instead towards the men deliberating it. The jury's cross section of middle aged men serves as a microcosm for 1950s variations on masculine identity, slowly but surely sweating away their polished exteriors to reveal the flaws, prejudices and hatreds concealed underneath. Masterfully tackling sensitive thematic issues such as class and age discrimination (while the teenaged suspect is initially dismissed as being a dangerous youth, the elderly woman witness' testimony is similarly scrutinized due to her age) the film dares to expose the dark secrets lurking beyond the wholesome exteriors of 1950s society without ever coming across as excessively heavy handed or moralistic. Indeed, the film could hardly be farther from it, as Lumet's remarkable deftness of touch makes the picture riveting as much through its subtlety as its heated emotional grandstanding, using slyly inconspicuous zooms and tensely circling camera-work to unobtrusively underscore the white knuckled drama of the scene without unnecessarily wrenching emotion out of the scene or performers. Perhaps the film may be a few shades away from perfection, carrying a whiff of being overly coincidental and slightly unrealistic through having the jurors swayed one by one, but the unexpected moment of quiet humanity culminating the picture is a textbook example of the rare sort of uplifting ending which can ring true, and it is near impossible to dispute the raw power and honest intensity building up to that point, making the potentially dubious logic of the narrative easy to ignore and exceedingly difficult to resist. Such a dialogue heavy story relies upon hefty acting clout to achieve full effect, and Lumet's uniformly exceptional cast does not disappoint, with not a single performer in the delightfully colourful and versatile collection of characters delivering an unsatisfactory or unbelievable performance. No one could have been better cast as the stoic protagonist Juror #8 than the time etched monolith of American honesty and decency that is Henry Fonda, and Fonda radiates the ideal quiet confidence to draw in the support of the audience as much as his fellow jurors. Fonda's unassuming lack of pretension makes him far more than the traditional populist hero, and his eshewal of soapbox moralizing in favour of calculated appeals to reason make his message all the more plausible, and his character all the more timeless. Lee J. Cobb similarly shines as the abrasive Juror #3, with Cobb's fleeting moments of tortured humanity barely discernible under an appalling mask of unsavoury characterization making his role far deeper than a simply stubborn oppositional force, and far more resonant. Martin Balsam is also a noteworthy presence as the level headed Juror #1, with a quirky edginess underscoring his appeals for reason, bringing a potentially simply expositional character to highly watchable life. What could have made for a plodding, overly literary waste of time is instead transformed into crackling movie magic, bursting with barely stifled raw emotion and pulsing with social significance. 12 Angry Men is just about as sublime a legal thriller as one could hope to find, its reputation as one of the strongest American films of all time holding up, and the half a century since its release failing to dilute its power and abject fascination in the slightest.-10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful character portrayals, but too preachy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Fonda is the star here, but the other roles are filled by legendary character actors. To see Lee Cobb, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, and Ed Begley all doing there thing at the same time is a joy. My main problem with the movie is that it is soooo preachy. The scene is painted in black and white, there are few shades of gray. Most of the character are stereotypes-- ie, the bigot, the bully, the nerd, the immigrant, the glad-handing but uncaring salesman, etc. It is a tribute to the fine actors that they bring such one-dimensional characters to life. And shining through it all is the oh so good man who has right, justice, and the American way on his side. The self-righteousness is a bit cloying, and I almost expect Fonda to have a halo over his head. That being said, it is enjoyable for the acting and a must see for those who have missed it so far.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What better way to analyse the persona's of twelve men than to film a heated jury meeting. Throughout the length of Sidney Lumet's twelve angry men little things were picked up by me and gave me ideas in my mind as to the mindset of each of these twelve men. None of the jurors had boring persona's. The director (Sidney Lumet) didn't put people in just to make up numbers. The movie would have been awful if all the dialogue was cut up between three or four characters and thankfully it wasn't. The movie sways a lot at times as well we have scenes of enigmatic melancholy counter balancing with heart warming innocence. Some movies even great movies have characters to make up numbers but as I mentioned earlier on, twelve angry men doesn't. Some criticise saying the movie makes stereotypical views of conservatives but I don't watch it from a political view. It is full of very moving and powerful scenes and if you want a movie to make you think go for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the simplest, but greatest movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Steven Spielberg once quoted, "Oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best ones". And back in the days of the 1950s, a lot of the movies that came out were fairly simple. "12 Angry Men" is one of the simplest movies ever made. Nearly the entire film takes place in one room and the cast consists of only twelve characters. Yet, even its simplicity proves out to be effective, for it is one of the most intense, dramatic motion pictures ever created and truly a great accomplishment for Sidney Lumet and leading actor/producer Henry Fonda. Also sharing the screen with Fonda are other famous names such as John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, and Ed Begley."12 Angry Men" is also a film that becomes so powerful because of the way it develops its twelve stars. Every character has a background of some kind, many times a troubled one, as we see in real people around us. Fonda plays one of those characters that stands alone, bravely against a large opposing force and as he often states in the movie that he's not sure if what he's doing is really worth the trouble. The tension as Fonda tries to convince the eleven others to follow along with him develops to an incredible level with amazing performances by everybody and one of the best scripts ever written. It's one of the best movies ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NOTHING beats this original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why make another version of this movie? I just finished watching the 1957 version and I admit it seems like a play (and probably was developed originally as a play since it basically takes place in one room) and it was also broadcast live during the heyday of the golden years of television. We'll never see the talent of the actors in the room who have since passed-away. In fact, only Jack Klugman (at age 85) is still with us. Other movies seem tailor-made for plays, such as Glengarry Glen Ross. I'm not sure if the casting was simply dead-on or the actors happened to nail the roles they had or a combination, but each person seems very well-suited to his role and it's hard not to get wrapped up in the dialogue and the general pace of the movie (as though you were peering into the jury room through a peephole). In fact, as I watched each actor, I identified with people I knew who had the same characteristics, such as Jack Warden's wise-ass, or Ed Begley, Sr.'s angry racist or Lee J. Cobb's uptight, high-strung yelling man or any of the other people. I do think that Jack Klugman's role may have been miscast. I didn't necessarily identify with him as a product of the slums. They could have cast a minority for his role but I guess in 1957 all-white, male juries were what was the norm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The nature of prejudice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is excellent! Its probably the best film in the careers of all concerned. Yes, its better than Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon, just as good as Fonda's Ox-Bow Incident, and almost equals Lee J. Cobb's The Man who Loved Cat Dancing (just kidding about Cobb!!!). This is NOT a court-room drama but instead concentrates on the jury deliberation process. We have 12 angry men - all familiar faces giving ace performances - stuck in a hot courthouse room with an out of order fan on the hottest day of the year. The humidity is killing them and they have to decide whether or not a Hispanic teen from the slums is guilty of a murder. The vote has to be unanimous or its a hung jury. Juror #8, Henry Fonda, is the only member of the jury who wants to question the evidence before sending the boy to the gallows. For the rest, including the audience. its a cut-and-dry case.In his Western classic The Ox-Bow Incident, Fonda is a bad man who over the duration of the night learns to shed his prejudice. The audiences knows he is wrong and feels relief when he makes the right choice in the end. What is interesting when comparing 12 Angry Men to Ox-Bow is how roles are reversed. Fonda is the only truly good and decent man in the jury and does not have a prejudices to shed. In fact, I as an audience member made the journey from someone convinced that the teen was guilty - based on the overwhelming evidence against him and my own hidden biases - to a person who realizes he has pigeon-holed someone into a mold which may not be accurate. The way this taut drama engrosses the viewer while raising awareness on important social issues is nowhere more evident than in the final scene at the steps of the courthouse where you really feel revitalizes after having spent a few hours in a small claustrophobic room. One of the best examples of films that can truly be said to elevate cinema to an art form, 12 Angry Men is unmissable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So simple yet unbelievably effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men could serve as a textbook for how films can be brilliant without any special effects or action sequences. All you need is a good idea, and 12 Angry Men certainly has that.The film's premise could not be simpler; 12 jurors discuss a case and attempt to determine a verdict. It's as simple as that. In the wrong hands this idea could be a disaster, or at least deathly dull. However, Sidney Lumet has created a riveting character study investigating motivation and prejudices in ordinary men.The twelve are all from a great variety of backgrounds with widely differing attitudes. However, the case seems clear cut and they are all convinced the defendant is guilty. Except one. As the facts of the case are bandied back and forth, Henry Fonda, as the sole juror returning a not guilty verdict, must convince his eleven fellow jurors to think about the case more.It is hard to lavish enough praise on 12 Angry Men. It is also the first film I have reviewed where I simply cannot think of any criticisms whatsoever. The film is enthralling and extremely clever; it is impossible not to get caught up in the back and forth as the sole juror attempts to sway the opinions of the other eleven, gradually calling into question what seemed like a clear verdict. It is a fascinating insight into the unseen workings of the legal system, and how ordinary men really play a role in the system. Further, the characters are never given names, there are virtually no supporting actors for the twelve, and the entire film takes place within one room, enabling all attention to be focused on the details of the case rather than identifying with the characters. It is this that makes the film so simple yet unbelievably effective.Henry Fonda is one of the finest actors of his generation, but no one is overshadowed or shamed by his terrific performance, and everyone holds their own. All twelve actors give outstanding performances.12 Angry Men is a masterful film that should be compulsory viewing for any filmmaker. There was never a clearer display of what can be done without complicated plot lines, special effects, overblown action sequences or overbearing music. A great idea with a tight script and sound acting performances are all you need to make a timeless classic. Faultless.</fullReview>

It would be wrong, if I said more about the story, but it develops in a very interesting way.Each of the jurors have their reasons for finding the accused guilty or not guilty. You see the jurors small talking with each other, and each little story reveals something about the persons. This is perfect character building, it was really made in an impressive way.The concept is very simple, 12 men discussing a case in a room. It does not sound interesting, but it for sure is. The actors perform excellently, each actor creates an unique character, it is simply just amazing to watch their discussions. I think it would be unfair to mention one actor, because all of them do a fantastic performance.You could say that it does not require a good director to create such a simple movie, but that is very wrong. Director Sidney Lumet really understood how to focus on the right discussions at the right time, he builds the characters with the camera, he did an excellent job."12 Angry Men" is an impressive movie. I have rated 454 movies, and only 11 movies have been rated 9/10 or above, and this is one of them. I will rate it 9/10, it's one of the best of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am writing this review before reading any of the others, so as not to be influenced by them. When I saw this film almost two decades ago I was absolutely riveted by the powerful, intense, unrelenting drama and suspense and the profound ethical content, not to mention the artistically uncompromising, sparse esthetics. The last scene, when Fonda walks out into the fresh air and gives a fond glance to the immense pillars of justice caused me to shed some tears, because I wasn't sure if I shared his abiding faith in the ultimate triumph of JUSTICE. In memory, the power of this film has faded, because it seems too comically optimistic. Justice ALWAYS triumphs in the end. It's a well-meaning, compassionate message, but it is also irresponsible. (Or is the message perhaps, that compassionate people should participate in juries more often?) True ethics and jurisprudence cannot afford such facile confidence. There is an insidious equation of law with justice. Every true legal mind, knows that the letter of the law can overwhelm the spirit of the law. Justice is just too big a topic for a movie! I fear it takes on more than it can handle. But what a worthy effort!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know what you're thinking: how in the heck did you just now get around to seeing 12 Angry Men? To be honest, I don't really have a good excuse. Maybe I just got too caught up with another film with "12&#x2033; (Monkeys) in the title.Regardless, I feel ashamed for having waited so long to take this one in. In short, this movie is absolutely brilliant. This isn't a revelation not already proclaimed by a thousand other critics, but I think it's worth noting for the simple fact that contemporary viewers (who might find themselves in my situation and realize they've postponed this for far too long) really owe it to themselves to embrace this multi-layered masterpiece that's just as relevant today as it was 54 years ago.The plot is deceptively simple: twelve jurors must decide the fate of an eighteen year-old on trial for the supposed murder of his father. Everyone on the jury is a male, and they're all fleshed out with nuanced detail. In fact, considering the entire thing takes place in a sweltering deliberation room, it's absolutely astonishing that director Sidney Lumet is able to concoct such a striking character piece that has a lot to say about the presumptions of society (again, both then and now). This, of course, it what makes 12 Angry Men the timeless piece of art that it is.But let's not ignore the flawless acting on display by everyone involved. Whether it's Henry Fonda trying to prove that nothing is ever certain or Lee Cobb bringing a father riddled with guilt to a violent and emotionally draining climax, it's all superb. The directing is clean and efficient, too?this, among other things, gives said actors a chance to fully embody their personalities and draw the audience into a drama that's anything but black and white.It's clear that screenwriter Reginald Rose has a firm grasp on how to effectively use setting, too. As the mood and opinion shifts in the cramped room, so does the bipolar weather just outside the stubborn windows.I don't know what else to say. If you're like me and have a list of certified "classics" that you're just now getting around to, trust me when I say that this one should be vaulted straight to the top. Give it a minute or so to get going, and you'll find yourself glued to one of the most engrossing dramas I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If you follow the crowd, you will likely get no further than the crowd. If you walk alone, you're likely to end up in places no one has ever been before. This is not without its difficulties, for peculiarity breeds contempt." ? Oscar Wilde Sidney Lumet's "12 Angry Men" opens with a teenage boy sitting before a judge. He's been accused of murdering his father. All evidence points to him having committed the crime and even the kid's lawyer believes him to be guilty. Enter the jury: 12 men tasked with settling upon a verdict. It seems certain that they will all find the kid accountable. After all, the facts prove that this kid killed his father. Don't they?The jury seclude themselves in a tiny room and take votes. 11 men find the kid guilty. One doesn't. The majority look at the 12th with bemusement. He's Henry Fonda, a mild mannered architect with a temperament of quiet confidence. How dare this guy disagree with them? How dare he stand alone? Tensions develop and the men begin to argue. Fonda plays it cool, stating that he doesn't necessarily believe the kid to be innocent, he simply wants to discuss the matter. After all, a kid's life is on the line. Why make hasty judgements? Why not talk things out, investigate the issue and dig a little deeper? Reluctantly, the others agree to talk. The kid's guilty, no doubt about it, so why not grant this wacky guy a couple hours of discussion? They're getting the day off work anyway. Humour the guy. And of course as the 12 men investigate the case, they begin to grow doubtful. Previously agreed upon truth comes crumbling down, ambiguities arise, new facts come to light, testimonies are cast in a new shade and the motives of witnesses and jurors are shown to be skewed by personal vendettas and a range of social/racial/personal biases.The film eventually ends with Henry Fonda, an iconic actor in one of his finest (if far too angelic) roles, having convinced the entire jury that the kid is innocent. With his quiet probing, his appeals to curiosity, truth and intellect over emotional hysteria, popular opinion and snap judgements, Fonda successfully opposes the other jurors. The film's message: question the majority, test the Gods with a hammer and be suspicious of commonly held truths. And most importantly, be tactful when contesting the majority, least they threaten you with a switchblade. But who cares? Normal is only a statistical distribution anyway.Upon release, "Angry" was read as a cautionary tale about McCarthyism, then a hot topic. Later its message became more broad: about a callous society's indifference to the less fortunate and willingness to unjustly sustain false accusations. Today, the film's almost a parody of bleeding heart liberals, many siding with the film's courtroom conservatives as a result. "What is this?" actor Lee J Cobb fumes in the film, "Love Your Underprivileged Brother Week or something?" His stance is typical today. The notion that offenders are too heavily viewed as victims of oppression, deprivation, racism, mental disorder, systemic problems etc, and so deserving of support rather than punishment.Aesthetically, "12 Angry Men" is remarkable; Lumet's camera work is superb and the film drips with both atmosphere and tension. The film also differs hugely from other legal dramas, taking place almost entirely within a jury's room and so sidestepping most of the the usual genre clichs (courtroom antics, last minute testimonials, witnesses, cathartic group-hugs etc)."12 Angry Men" may also be the finest film shot around a table. Indeed, any director will tell you that filming large groups of people conversing over a table is one of the most taxing things to do. Keeping track of eye-lines, coverage, body positions, shooting each individual from multiple angles over and over again...it's a mighty chore just to get things down on the most basic level, let alone keep the thing feeling kinetic and fresh.So what's remarkable about "12 Angry Men" is how much of a spatial movie it is. Director Sidney Lumet, who has a background in theatre (a very static medium, hence, perhaps, the initial appeal of such a claustrophobic script), charts his jury's room with a fluid camera. Watch how gorgeous his mise-en-scene is, how choreographed each character's body movements are, how Lumet's camera traces each character, assigning them spaces within the room. It's an incredibly organised little movie, Lumet dancing us deftly throughout this tiny arena, only to then spew his victors back out into the real world with a series of magnificently expansive shots.Then there's the acting. Lumet has always been an actor's director, and here he populates his film with a wealth of wonderful character actors. But Fonda's the star of course. Dressed in an angelic white suit, he's exactly the kind of morally righteous everyman hero which made many of Jimmy Stewart's early roles so popular. With a mixture of "aww shucks", suave sexiness and quiet intelligence, Fonda's immediately endearing. Unfortunately, the motivations of those who oppose Fonda are at times very heavy handed (everyone but Fonda is a raging buffoon, a sneaky attempt to elevate him), each one deliberately positioned to be shot down. End result: a heroic tale of progressive compassion defeating reactionary prejudice, in which the saintly conqueror of bigotry is himself bullying, has a firm agenda and is being buffeted by emotionalism.10/10 ? More great courtroom movies: "The Verdict", "Paths of Glory", "Compulsion", "Death on the Staircase", "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance", "Capturing The Friedmans", "The Paper Chase" and "Murder on a Sunday Morning". Lesser legal flicks: "Inherit the Wind", "JFK", "Adam's Rib", "Anatomy of A Murder", "The Caine Mutiny", "Witness for the Prosecution", "Miracle on 34th Street", "My Cousin Vinny", "Anatomy of a Murder". Worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No sex, no graphic violence, no swearing, no nudity? Wow, what a concept. Great cast. Simple basic use your imagination and follow all the characters. Exceptional script. Dialog and body language were perfectly timed. You just don't find a super combination of talent, story line, directing, etc. any better then in this movie. I never get tired of watching this and find something new to focus on every time I watch this. This is real acting. Most folks now a days would not appreciate or understand the power of this presentation. Now a days if it is not graphic, gory or vulgar people don't understand or get it. This movie wakes up and treats all the senses to something really special. Well, if you don't understand or have not experienced what I am talking about I do feel sorry for you because you are really missing out on something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A youth from an underprivileged home stands trial for the murder of his father with whom he had a strained relationship. Circumstantial evidence seems to have convicted him beyond any shadow of a doubt. Yet as the jury retires to consider its verdict, one man chooses to look further than the boy's background, and in examining the prosecution's case, he finds both the 'proof' and the witnesses to be less than satisfactory.Reginald Rose's compelling story is first and foremost an excellent character study of "12 Angry Men" who all find their moral fibre put to the test when asked to decide the fate of a young street kid accused of a terrible crime. Each from very different backgrounds, the audience witnesses first hand as every man's true character comes to the fore under such pressure. The film also examines mankind's prejudices toward not only the youth of today, but also the less fortunate and the ethnic community.Director Sidney Lumet ("Murder on the Orient Express") creates tension and claustrophobia very well in the small, hot jurors room where the "12 Angry Men" struggle with both their verdict and their own moral values and personal convictions.The whole cast is very solid, especially Henry Fonda who delivers a stand out performance as the architect who just isn't convinced of the boy's guilt, and slowly but surely he starts to win some support for his arguments. Also superb is Lee J. Cobb as a bitter and biased man who is determined the lad should hang. Great support too from Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, EG Marshall and Jack Warden. A most rewarding and thought provoking movie.Sunday, February 19, 1995 - Astor Theatre</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this the perfect low budget cinema for students to learn from?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is a Hollywood masterpiece. It was the start of an incredible journey by the director, Sidney Lumet. It's a shame the writer Reginald Rose did not have as an illustrious career as Lumet, but he did write one other classic, MAN OF THE WEST (1958). The nod goes to the performances by an amazing cast who hold it together in the confine spaces of the one setting. You would expect a film that mostly takes place in the one room to be theatrical, but Lumet manages to create the intensity with his tight direction and the brilliant use of deep focus and wide angle lenses. This is one film that all students should watch to observe the craft of how to create a very low budget movie with a perfect cast, the right director and a top notch writer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a superb drama,and every actor in it gave a great performance.I can watch it over and over without being bored by it.As entertainment it is great,and that is the main purpose of a movie.I only have one slight reservation,and that has to do with the plot.Some reviewers have pointed out that Henry Fonda did things that should not be done by jurors.But the thing that I find strangest is the charge,First Degree Murder,with a mandatory death sentence.Jurors are usually able to find an accused guilty on a lesser charge.Even assuming that the kid was guilty,the circumstances do not look like premeditated murder.Taking place in the middle of a violent argument,after being struck by a much larger and more powerful man,it looks far like manslaughter than murder one.But that is a minor quibble.This is still a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men...12 Individual Opinions...classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men; The simplicity of this film, I believe, prevents it from being named in lists of best ever movies. I was surprised but equally glad to see it ranks #17 here, but have also seen it unfairly omitted from several other polls of modern times.What really strikes you about this film is that the entire sequence is shot in one room. The moment the court attendant locks the doors, you can feel the tension of twelve individuals merging under the surface. The film isn't about spending vast sums of money on creating a blockbuster, nor does it feel the need to explain every last detail about each of the characters portrayed. Perhaps these key differences are exactly the reasons "12 Angry Men" strikes one as so effortlessly brilliant.One of only two shots outside of the room is at the beginning, with the exasperated judge calling for the adjourned verdict from the jury. You have a closing shot of the young boy on trial before the twelve men assemble themselves into the sticky, humid room to consider their decision.The movie doesn't take a long time to get started. Questions are raised instantly and answers are given. Juror #8 (played by Henry Fonda) instead glares in a moments reflection onto the street below as the other eleven men give their first impressions willingly. It is clear from the conversation that the majority who have spoken are convinced of the boy's guilt, with many of them keen to come to a final verdict as soon as possible.Instead, upon the first vote, Juror #8 goes against the grain of everyone else and decides to pitch his verdict of not guilty to the astonishment of his fellow jurors.What happens next is 80 minutes of passion, pain, conflict, and conclusion.What I find remarkable about the character of Henry Fonda is although he is not convinced of the boy's guilt, he is also equally not sure about his innocence. As he poses questions and figures out answers, it is clear that he is realising these facts at the same time as everyone else. In the depths of his mind, he has ideas surrounding why the boy might be innocent but needs to formulate them, and he is able to do that via the other jurors, even the ones that put up a fight. As he finds more reasons to doubt a guilty verdict, his reflection allows the other eleven men to do the same.With each revelation, and the testimonies brought into question, you can feel the passion of twelve individual opinions. Whilst some of the jurors were not so outspoken, they still played a part in peeling apart the layers of badly constructed trial. Whether it was a personal experience (such as living by the El Track, or wearing glasses) or just an view of one man, they all fitted together in a jigsaw that eventually, couldn't be disputed. As the film reached the climax, so did the heat, finally erupting into a violent storm that reflected the tension in the verdict room. In particular, it was parallel with the clash between Juror #3 (played fantastically by Lee J. Cobb) and Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) - 8 being the stand alone verdict of Not Guilty to begin with, and by the end, 3 being alone in his verdict of Guilty, before breaking down.The film was beautifully directed, shots of the intense weather, the cigarette smoke drifting away and the passion of the twelve men in deciding their verdict reflected in their perspiration collaborated effortlessly with the script. There was no need to delve any deeper into the characters, build exaggerated story lines or become unnecessarily violent. All it needed was twelve men, with different backgrounds, to explain themselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Methaphors in Film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, let me state for the record that I think this is the finest film of the 1950's and one of the best films of all times. Only the fact that so many other people share my opinion has prevented me from writing a glowing review on this site, as there were already so many to choose from.However, I saw the film again last night on Turner Classic Movies (and stayed up until well after midnight to watch it, trading sleep for artistic sustenance) and I was struck be something that seemed so obvious, yet had always eluded me in past viewings. I was struck by the use of metaphor in the film. I guess that I had never seen it quite that way before as I was content to watch a simple, yet exciting play unfold. But last night was a revelation. The three metaphors that most jumped out at me are as follows: 1) The lighting. In order to simulate the growing darkness of the storm out the window, the lighting was slowly turned down through the film until it became obvious that the lights in the room would have to be turned on. When Juror-1 turns the lights on, the whole room changes. As the darkness had crept in, the room had become more and more hostile. Yet, when the light came on, most of the characters' attitudes change to more genial manor. The lights comes on after Juror-8 has made most of his points and it seems the light is the symbolic turning of the Jury.2) The cinematography. The direct deliberately changed his lenses in the camera through the shoot to make the walls of the Jury Room seem to close in on the Jurors. This is a nice physiological trick, but it seemed to me to be more. Notice how, the closer they get to a hung jury, the closer they come to Juror's #-3, -4, and -10 simply declaring themselves hung, the closer the walls get. But in the final scene in the room, when they are all leaving, the camera lens reverts back to the proportions used at the beginning of the film. The room is big and airy again. I like the symbolism of of the room, representing the weight of the defendant's life, closing in on them.3) (My favorite) The Rain. Prior to the storm starting, all of the Jurors have voted the way they do at the end except for #'s 3,4 &amp; 10, all of whom are carrying "baggage" of their own. #-4 is a man possessed of intellect and sees himself as above the other's mentally. #-10 has years of racism blinding him. And #-3 has the memory of his failed relationship with his son. Then it begins raining, hard. Juror-10 has his great scene and simply self-destructs, in the process letting go of his racism, at least for the moment. Juror-4 undergoes the "eyeglasses" scene and lets go of his self-assumed intellectual superiority. And Juror-3 (Lee J. Cobb is the MAN!) launches into that most famous scene, finally letting go of his anger toward his own son. As soon as they release their own personal demons, the truth become evident to them, the rain, as it were, having washed their souls clean. No sooner is it has #-3 completed his transformation then it stops raining...and the sun begin to peak through the darkness. This is GENIUS film making! In the end, maybe that is way I love this film so much: each time I watch it, there is something new to find. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character study in a small jury room.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, currently ranked as #21 all time on the IMDb list, is a simple story of the deliberations of 12 men on a jury of a murder trial. We see nothing of the actual trial or the closing arguments. The story begins as the judge instructs the jury, in weighing the evidence presented, they must return a verdict of 'guilty' unless there is reasonable doubt. Although not made clear in the movie, a verdict of "not guilty" is not the same as 'innocent.' Not guilty simply means that the prosecution did not present a case strong enough to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. The case that we do not see or hear of first hand involves a son accused of murdering his father. One witness was an elderly man who claimed to have seen the boy running down the stairs from the apartment a few seconds after hearing voices and a body hitting the floor. Was this old man who shuffled along really able to get there in time? Could he really hear clearly over the noise of the passing train? Another was a woman who identified the boy as the one plunging the knife into the victim. But did she wear glasses, and did she have them on when she claimed she saw the murder 60 feet away through the windows of a passing train on elevated tracks (the 'el')? First seated the jurors take a vote, and it is 11 to one in favor of conviction. There is a ball game that evening and many of the men are anxious to delivered a verdict and get home. One man (Henry Fonda) says he is not sure, the boy may in fact be guilty, but suppose he isn't. He just wants to talk about it. A boy's life is at stake. Don't they owe it to him to examine all possibilities? But the other 11 at first look upon their task as one to convince the lone juror that he is wrong.As the 90 minutes move along, various jurors bring up points that they noticed, possibilities that neither the prosecution nor the defense attorneys had brought up. Others gradually join the 'not guilty' side, until it is only one for 'guilty.' Then there were none. Much of the dialog brought out prejudices certain men held, that were clouding their reasoning, and preventing them from seeing both sides of the argument. This is a story less about jury verdicts, and more about human nature.The movie sets out to show that with reasonable doubt at hand, a verdict of 'not guilty' must be returned. Thus it is mostly an examination of how our personal prejudice can cloud our judgment. I suspect that this story was much more significant 50 years ago than it is today. There have been a number of very public trials (e.g. OJ Simpson) where most of the evidence appeared to point to guilt, but a jury returned a 'not guilty' verdict because of reasonable doubt. However it remains part of the foundation of our legal system, that a person is innocent until proved guilty, even if it means some guilty persons will go free.Although only Lee J. Cobb stands out, as the angry juror who was the last hold out, this contained a fine ensemble cast. Martin Balsam, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Ed Begley are others who are prominent in my mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow, what an amazing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do have a penchant for older movies but this one is special. It perfectly highlights how keeping it "smart and simple" is the right way to go. The entire movie was basically shot in one room with 12 people arguing about a case. With that being said it was just as intense as any car chase. If you like seeing how people logically deconstruct a case in order to prove/disprove the defendants guilt this is the right movie for you. At first the whole case appears to be pretty "black and white" but as the jury (the 12 men) discusses details about the night of the murder new conclusions are being drawn. Conclusions that ultimately make them question their original standpoint. "Is the boy really guilty?" Watch the movie and find out.</fullReview>

However, the movie caught my attention from the very first minute when a murder trial is brought into a court. The great thing about the movie is that it shows different kinds of characters in a society and the whole movie is practically phenomenal. How one man stands against 11 others to convince them which seemed almost impossible in the beginning. Moreover, the tempo of the movie contributes a lot to its theme and screenplay and despite the fact that the movie is in black and white, the interesting story line captivates the viewer and doesn't let them lose interest for even a second.</fullReview>

Fast forward until today and I can still sit and watch it through with no problem. I find no fault in the portrayal of the characters with the actors, in fact they draw me into their scenario. Each time I watch I notice things I did not before. If you are looking for a quiet evening movie or a Sunday afternoon movie, I would not look much further than this. I love the setting, and I found it completely fascinating to sit through. When watching I am hooked. And by the end, I feel satisfied that I didn't waste my time sitting through it. I can't even compare it to another like it, as it's so unique in my eyes. If I were to find one flaw, I actually find I can't. I don't get commission and it's rare I can find nothing wrong with a movie but with such a strong storyline with each character having their own important roles within such a small space and playing it so beautiful, I honestly can't on this occasion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too few film directors today ever learned how to direct actors. This film is the perfect example of why having the skill to direct an entire story, taking the time to rehearse and getting actors off page, can take a story confined to a tiny space and make it one of the top films of all time. There is room for special effects and action sequences but as long as directors take the time and put in the care to make quiet moments solid pieces of acting then even spectacle films can be critically acclaimed. Kevin Feige of Marvel has made it a point to cast great actors in superhero films even when the choice might have seemed unlikely. The reason is he knows great acting makes for a great film. Aspiring Directors, if you do not have great actors you can still get good performances out of your actors. Learn from this film. Focus on story and focus on how it is told which is primarily done by the actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic, Excellent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"12 Angry Men" is an excellent drama with an amazing plot twist.The film begins with the end of an 18 years old boy's trial, being accused of premeditated murder. The details of the trial and murder are slowly revealed as we go deeper into the plot.The whole film takes place in a room where the jurors are supposed to decide the boy's fate. The vote has to be unanimous for the verdict to be applied, but there is one man who is not convinced of the boy's guilt so he decides to try and persuade the other eleven who are certain he is guilty.The message of this film is clearly expressed: everyone sees things how they want to, how it suits them and the truth can be easily flawed. If you seek an example of how facts can be manipulated in one's favor, this drama is what you are looking for.The character development is one of the best I have seen so far. I believe Sidney Lumet tried and accomplished to include all types of personality in twelve men, "angry" being, more or less, the common trait they all manifest. And that is why I think the title could not be any more appropriate."12 Angry Men" is one classic masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court.Today's audiences will find a young Jack Warden, perhaps now best known as Big Ben from "Problem Child", and Wisconsin-born John Fiedler, whose voice is recognizable as Piglet from "Winnie the Pooh". Along with Ed Begley and Henry Fonda, you already have a strong cast (and the other eight men are no slouches).This film is timeless, both as a tribute to great actors of their generation, but also as a testament of the greatness of the American justice system. One likes to think this has inspired at least a few people to approach jury duty with the utmost seriousness and give the concept of "reasonable doubt" a run for its money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Life is not something to be decided in five minutes. Let's talk about it.Well, the most important movie in terms of format and and in fact the best movie it terms of dialogue. This movie is completely unconventional in format and it's setting. 12 men discuss a case in a room, weird for a movie isn't it. How long can you sustain drama with a case, that's the point. Extremely well written and well acted, this is in fact a testimony of writing. All films have to be driven by writing more than anything else. Simply shot, the dialogue makes up for everything here. There are many things that could have been shown like it happens in other courtroom dramas, that is I mean the whole trial, the evidences, the arguments. But here, the trial is over only the judgment of the jury is pending which is 11-1 from the word go and in all expectation should have been 12-0 in favor of guilty. Now, that does not make a good character of the man who stood out. That 1 man has to influence all the 11 others to become an outstanding man from a mere standing out person. And that is what exactly happens. Good, in every which way you consider. If you see it once, and I am sure if you watched it once, you will mostly be convinced by my argument it's the most Simply made movie that is great in all aspects. Henry Fonda, must be appreciated a lot for producing this and giving the job of direction to Sidney Lumet as his first movie. Greatly written by Reginald Rose as a play and then for the movie. All the greatness pertaining to this movie should be credited to the mentioned three names. Thanks for everyone who was a part of this film and made it what it is today. This is one of the most important films of my life as it triggered a thought of why don't I make a movie set in a room and that's just live talk. Oh yes, I waited for the longest time to get a Blu ray of this, and was very happy again with the quality., blu-ray just rocks and thanks for the transformation.It's 5/5 for a movie that has stood the test of time and will be as great as ever even many years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All about the acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant casting, exceptional acting. Lumet very smartly kept most of the film in the jurors' room, which heightens the tension and forces the audience to pay attention to every small detail that is presented in the film. In no way does one feel constrained by the restriction to one location; rather, it is almost as if we are transported into the room. The way the plot is laid out manipulates the audience's perception as well. Lumet invites us to make a judgment on the case at hand - although he also makes a point about how judgments can be easily changed and that perhaps we don't know ourselves as much as we thought we did. Henry Fonda, especially, sells the character well. It is an honest depiction of real people and how real decisions are made. His argument - that he isn't sure if the accused is guilty but at the same time isn't sure if the accused is not guilty - is thought-provoking, as it acknowledges the ambiguity of life. Overall, a well-presented film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Simply wow. There is no other way to articulate the feeling you get after watching 12 Angry Men, perhaps the zenith of Sidney Lumet's remarkably talented directorial career, even more amazing considering this was his debut feature. It's just one of those rare golden gems of a film that gets everything, literally everything, absolutely right. Script, direction, performances, tone, setting, story, the lot. It's perfect. It's exciting. It's gripping. It's meaningful. It's moving. And it may be close to sixty years old, but all of the many things it's trying to say remain relevant to our society, and sadly perhaps always will. This truly is a cinematic masterpiece that deals with not only the rule of law and it's place in society, but along the way deep rooted prejudice, ego, the class system and the fragility of parenthood - all wrapped up in ninety short minutes. Honestly, this is no understatement... it's just magnificent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple plot turns into one of the deepest stories ever told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems simple at first, one man resists the almost certain evidence that an 18- year old child from a slum has stabbed his father. This simple plot however brings out emotions and bias from each of the twelve juries. This is backed by stellar performances, especially from Henry Fonda and Lee.J.Cobb who the film centres around. Lee.J.Cobb plays the most complex of the Juries, and his slow descent into his true feelings toward the case are both compelling and believable. There are some Juries that don't really get that do not get that much screen time, but the film makes sure to make them have a key role somewhere. Some may dislike that there is only one location, but I think this allows the film to stay focused and not stray onto another side story, in this way it is very similar to rear window, in that you never see anything that happens from anyone Else's perspective apart from James Stewart perspective. This style helps to keep 12 angry men flowing. Overall this is one of the finest films ever created and has not aged one bit.</fullReview>

In planning the movie, he says, a "lens plot" occurred to him: To make the room seem smaller as the story continued, he gradually changed to lenses of longer focal lengths, so that the backgrounds seemed to close in on the characters."

		<shortDescription>12 talented actors, 1 very simple set and no special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Produce under good direction. Serves millions. Seriously, this film is awesome. A jury has to decide a seemingly open and shut case of a young guy who has been accused of murdering his father in a fit of anger. The evidence couldn't be clearer that this guy killed him. Murder weapon, motive, eyewitness testimony all in place. One juror (H. Fonda) however, wants to talk the case out. He's not 100% convinced that the boy did it. And so everything starts. An emotional roller coaster follows as we learn about the jurors, their reasons for voting as they do and how they are forced to re-evaluate the evidence. Part of the charm of this film is it's starkness. 98% of the film takes place in one room; the jury room, a simple set consisting of little more than a table, 12 chairs, some windows and a fan. The best part, in my opinion, is the character development of the jurors. When the movie begins, they are just 12 unknown characters. Even though none of the jurors are named, in the end of the movie, you feel as if you know and understand every one of them. Truly a remarkable piece of movie history and well worth repeated viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a wonderful story of 11 people believing that because of race, age and half-witted facts that a young boy is guilty of killing his father in cold blood.This film, throughout the storyline proves that not only, can one man start a sort of revolution in a jury room, but that what may be seen is not what is truth. People have a way of judging on personal experiences, but when it is a matter of life and death, one can not fully depend on such experiences.The actors create such a thrilling satire without any other effects other than emotion Wonderful movie for all ages!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is just brilliant. It is a classic of course, but time goes by and many of us, young people, pass on smart movies like that, and that's a shame. But fortunately, I am here to talk about it.12 Angry Men came out in 1957, it was made by Sydney Lumet and stars Henry Fonda, to name only one of the fantastic actors that made this movie so real. 99% of the action takes place in the Jury room. 12 Jurors are debating on a murder trial. A men, played by Henry Fonda, will try to convince his fellow juror of the innocence of the boy accused in this trial.12 Angry Men is such a smart movie and evoke so many different themes through this one trial. It mainly shows how powerful is one man's speech. All of the beliefs about the case, the ones that seemed so obvious to the 11 other men, are refuting one after the other by the character of Henry Fonda, leading to heavy doubts in the jurors mind. The life of a boy depends on how will this man try to convince 11 others, of what he truly believes is the truth or at least the not certainty of it.Through the movie, you feel the pain, the claustrophobia of being in this room, you just feel like you are the 13th member of the Jury.All in all, of course it's an old movie, it's in black &amp; white but please, don't pass on this movie, it has a strong message, and is the typical type of movie, precise, smart, deep, relevant..., that are strongly missing these days.</fullReview>

Also, it's notable the criticism during all discussions between characters to choose the destiny of a man's life.This is a masterpiece and a must-see.

It was a simple however effective storyline. This is not your typical comedy movie! The acting was superb by many of the characters if not all of them. I highly recommend watching this movie if you want tenseness, surprises, thrills and comedy! The basic plot is a boy who is said to have killed his father. All 11 jurors agree, except one. Can the 12th juror convince all of the other jurors to believe him or will he lose out? Eventually, they turn out all to be 12 Angry Men.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Henry Fonda's greatest performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps Sidney Lumet's most widely acclaimed film 12 Angry Men was a true masterpiece for a directorial debut. The movie tells the interesting story of a dissenting juror in a murder trial who slowly manages to convince others that the case isn't as obviously clear as it seemed in court. In which the Juror that tries to convince the others is played by Henry Fonda who gives the best performance of his career under Lumet's masterful direction. The other jurors are played wonderfully played by Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley Sr., Jack Klugman, and Lee J. Cobb (in his best performance since On the Waterfront.). In my cinematic opinion I consider this film as not only a great from Sidney Lumet but I also consider it as his best movie that he ever directed. But there was other masterpieces that he directed in his career for example The Verdict, and Network.This was a great movie that is worth watching over and over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men is one of the very few historic features to uphold its high reputation when watching it today and really is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from a mundane premise. The story of the eponymous dozen of more or less agitated men, jurymen to be precise, gaining more and more insight into a seemingly certain murder verdict is one of, if not the best character study ever put on film and pulls off the sheerly unfeasible feat of gripping its audience over a time of an hour and a half with the setting never changing once.The means by which this is achieved are a trailblazing storytelling style and twelve superb actors, each of them getting multiple chances to prove their talent by a brilliantly conceived script. The cast, including names such as Henry Fonda, Jack Klugman, or Lee J. Cobb, has an absorbing quality to their acting, easily making one forget that the film is nothing but a couple of lads bantering for the entire running time. It's almost funny, how such a simple story can lead to such exquisite writing, as Reginald Rose equips the twelve angry men with a realistic past, relatable character traits, and pieces of dialogue fitting perfectly to those criteria. Due to the lack of things to be gained when rewatching the film, it's not one of my all-time favourites, but 12 Angry Men is indubitably a classic and highly inspiring picture ? regardless of your wanting to pursue a career as a director, actor, or screenwriter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am only a teenager, but I am well-versed in classic cinema. When I began watching this film, I was skeptical that I would come out of it with any feeling other than boredom. It's a black and white film--the implication is that it may be slower than movies that are released nowadays. I've got to say: I LOVED THIS MOVIE! This is probably one of the best films I've ever seen. I loved every second of it! It was full of suspense, amazing dialogue, and incredible acting. 12 Angry Men is on my list of my all-time favorite movies. I was on the edge of my seat for the entire film. 12 Angry Men is perfection. I try to get all of my friends to watch this film. I haven't been this passionate about a film for a very long time. Whenever someone asks me what movies to check out, I always add this one on the list. I can't believe this movie isn't as famous as other classic films. I think this movie is deserving of every award out there. I have never rate a film a 10/10 on IMDb, but I was VERY close to making this my first and only 10/10 rating.</fullReview>

Very good portreyals of human character. Very nice presentation by how the past can affect the human character and how you can solve problems with qualities not with flaws.

		<fullReview>This film, 12 Angry Men is famous for it's use of only one interior location for the duration of a film. It's a hard challenge to make a good film in only one location, but it works for this film. It's also known for it's disappointing box office and the critical acclaim it has received. Personally, I enjoyed the film because it does a great job building tension as the film progresses and it makes you what will happen next. It doesn't need action or explosions to old your attention, it has the proper characterization to hold your attention.Sidney Lumet's film is a courtroom drama on the outside, but on the inside it's more about a debate amongst jurors on reasonable doubt on a case about a kid who supposedly murdered his father.This film requires great acting and that it has plenty of. With only one bankable star in Henry Fonda, the cast manages to pull this off. Each character has their own unique identity and each identity is prevalent here. Their emotions are essential to how this film leads up to it's big ending.Overall, this is a great film and a great character study. It's a film that people in film school should be required to watch. It's all about the little things here since each of them count. We don't know anybody names, but we come to get to know these characters. It's as if we are there in person watching all this unfold. A great film indeed. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

Many people I know have discarded this movie claiming that it is too talky yet love movies like "Pulp Fiction".

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Unforgettable And Powerful Classic From Sidney Lumet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is one of the greatest films ever made and an excellent and unforgettable Classic from Sidney Lumet that combines amazing direction,a terrific cast,a wonderful script and a fantastic score making 12 Angry Men one of my favorite films,Sidney Lumet at his best and cinema at it's best.Set in New York City,12 Angry Men tells the story of 12 jurors who have to decide the fate of a young boy who's been accused of murdering his Father. While the 11 other jurors think the boy's guilty and the case is open and shut,one juror,juror#8(Henry Fonda)Isn't so sure and think they should discuss the case and change the other jurors including juror#3(Lee J. Cobb)verdicts and convince the jurors that the boy is not guilty.12 Angry Men is a brilliant classic that marked the directorial debut of director Sidney Lumet and also gave viewers one of the finest courtroom dramas ever made. What separates 12 Angry Men from other courtroom dramas is the setting because where other Courtroom dramas take place in and out of the courtroom,12 Angry en takes place mostly inside of a jury room. Right from the moment when the characters enter the jury room viewers are given an riveting and powerful film that has no gunfights,explosions,fist fights or car chases but is one of the most intense and emotionally charged films of all time. When you watch 12 Angry Men you are in the minds of the 12 jurors who are making a choice about a persons life whether they decide that the young boy is guilty or not testing our thoughts and what would we do if we were in a situation like that. 12 Angry Men not only succeeds as a court room drama but as a character study as well because as we watch the film and see all 12 of the jurors we see who they really are outside of the jury room bringing their personal feelings about who they are whether it's about the case or how they feel about each other and the characters are well-developed and interesting. The film also deals with themes such as racism and prejudice in a intelligent and thoughtful way that is still powerful and relevant. Another thing I love about 12 Angry Men is the visually stunning photography and atmosphere. Boris Kaufman's black and white photography is beautiful and haunting adding to the movie's intensity and as emotions run high the photography becomes more dreary and dark. I also love the fact that most of the movie takes place in one room which gives the movie a claustrophobic feel and as 12 Angry Men keeps going the room becomes more enclosed and isolated where you feel like the characters will never get out. Also,the fact that 12 Angry Men takes place on a hot and humid day adds to the tension of the main characters because the jurors are not angry just because of the decision they have to make as jurors but also the heat. When you watch this film you will feel the heat coming of the screen. All the jurors are great characters but the two who are the most fascinating are jurors number#8 and #3 because both pretty much represent the voices of the film. Juror #8 Isn't convinced that the boy is guilty wanting to talk to the other jurors and convince them by asking questions and making a case. You will root and relate to juror#8 because of his determination and persistence that never stops. Where as juror#8 thinks the boy Isn't guilty,juror#3 is convinced right away that the boy is guilty from the start not just because of the facts presented in the case but because of the things going on in his personal life that affects his decision and when the other jurors are talking about the case juror #3 explodes with anger and rage not understanding why would they continue with this case. Juror#8 and #3 are classic and unforgettable characters who anchor the film and have a complexity that adds to the film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose is terrific,with Rose giving the characters memorable dialog as well as scenes that are amazing and will stick with viewers. The ending of 12 Angry Men is fantastic and in my opinion one of the best endings in movie history with non-stop greatness and intensity that you will never forget. A powerful and outstanding conclusion.The whole cast is amazing in their roles. Henry Fonda is excellent and at his best as Juror#8,with Fonda bringing depth and a heroic quality to the role. Lee J. Cobb is brilliant and fiery in one of my favorite performances in film history as Juror#3,with Cobb bringing intensity,anger and complexity to the role and having great scenes with Fonda. E.G Marshall is terrific as Juror#4,an intelligent stockbroker. Joseph Sweeney is wonderful as Juror#9,an observant and elderly juror. Ed Begley is riveting as Juror#10,a man full of racism,hate and prejudice. Jack Warden is outstanding as Juror#7,with Warden bringing humor to the film. Jack Klugman is fantastic as Juror#12,a man with a slum background. George Voskovic is sensational as Juror#11,a European Juror. John Fiedler(Juror#2),Martin Balsam(Juror#1,The Foreman),Robert Webber(Juror#12)and Edward Binns(Juror#6)give great performances as well. The direction by Sidney Lumet is amazing and stylish,with Lumet constantly moving the camera and showing close-ups,over head shots keeping the film moving at an incredible pace with a wonderful visual style. Terrific direction,Lumet. The score Kenyon Hopkins is great,memorable and intense and matches the film's tone.

		<shortDescription>A top-notch cast under superb direction by Sidney Lumet makes this movie excellent in every aspect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others (Jack Klugman , Martin Balsam , Jack Warden , Lee. J. Cobb , Ed Begley , E.G. Marshall , Robert Webber , among others) that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court. As Juror #8 holds out with a verdict of not guilty, thus setting the stage for arguments and reasons why or why not the boy may be guilty . As he desperately seeks to convince his eleven peers to reconsider their hast conviction of a boy framed of murdering . As 12 jurors are struggling to decide the fate of a teenager who allegedly killed his father . Made for television classic about twelve jurors quick to condemn a youth on trial for murdering his father before reviewing the evidence. Though the whole movie is set in a jury room it never lacks for taut , suspense , intrigue and inspired direction . The struggle behind closed doors is tense , charged and riveting . Reginald Rose's brilliant TV play script was left virtually intact in its move to feature film. This famous play from the 'Golden Age of Television' was splendidly directed by Sidney Lumet with an extraordinary plethora of actors who give magnificent performances .Because the painstaking rehearsals for the film lasted an exhausting two weeks, filming had to be completed in an unprecedented 21 days and shot in a total of 365 separate takes. However, nowadays none of the twelve stars are still alive . The acting level of the cast during some of the intense discussions and debates almost bursts in the screen . The movie is commonly used in business schools and workshops to illustrate team dynamics and conflict resolution techniques. Nominated for 3 Oscars , another 16 wins &amp; 6 nominations ; the film lost out in all its categories to The Bridge on the River Kwai . It ranked #2 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre "Courtroom Drama". This Lumet's impressive debut was followed by a remake made for cable TV (1997) , a contemporized rendition of the memorable tale whose script has been slightly updated but the premise is the same , it was directed by William Friedkin with a formidable cast such as William L. Petersen, Edward James Olmos, Hume Cronyn, James Gandolfini, Dorian Harewood, Ossie Davis, and Courtney B. Vance , George C. Scott , Armin Mueller-Stahl , Tony Danza and Jack Lemmon takes on the voice of dissent , the Fonda role . Furthermore , a Russian version (2007) by Nikita Mikhalkov with Sergey Garmash , Valentin Gaft , Aleksey Petrenko , Yuriy Stoyanov , Efremov , among others .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Modern Filmmakers Should See This Incredible Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No car chases here. No crashes. No explosions. No loud noises. Very little music and no background music during the bulk of it. In fact, most of its action takes place entirely in one room and the action is the playing out of a grueling day in a dingy, hot and sparsely furnished jury room without pause. Yet this is one of the finest movies ever made. Better acting you will not find in most other films. And this puts modern movies - with all their stunts and special effects - to shame. This is an object lesson in what makes a great film. It's not noise and smoke and mirrors. It's a great story and great acting. You don't need a million cuts or scene changes. You need just one room if you have the essential elements, as this film proves.The tension is incredible - palpable and nonstop, the important story of intolerance unfolding in a series of surprises and the human interplay almost unrivaled. No bells and whistles here. Just one of the best stories ever featuring one of the best casts ever assembled. And one of the most memorable films you'll ever see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Imagine a filmmaker walking into a boardroom today and trying to pitch the following movie: 12 men sit in a room for 90 minutes in real time and argue with each other. They're discussing a murder case, but the murder isn't actually shown, they just talk about it. It would be shot down today, because it's not the kind of movie that we're used to seeing in cinemas ? public tastes have changed. Or so Hollywood seems to think, but this movie is in IMDb's 10 top rated movies of all time. This took me slightly by surprise before I saw "12 Angry Men". It's a movie made more than 50 years ago, and yet it's still more popular than any "Lord of the Rings" or "Star Wars" film. It's a testament to the public, I think, showing that old movies have not grown stale, and are still appreciated as much as new flicks.The film itself completely deserves its position on the IMDb list. It's not one of the best movies ever made, but it is a skilfully crafted, well acted drama which is intellectually stimulating and actually quite thrilling throughout, despite the lack of action. It's far more than it says on the tin, since each one of its 12 characters is well written and of great importance to the story. Henry Fonda particularly shines in the film as the one juror trying to fight for a "not guilty" verdict on the grounds of reasonable doubt. He takes it upon himself to convince the other 11 to change their minds, and through this, changes the audience's view of the case as well. The progression of his arguments and logic is extremely clever and his unpicking of information that we've had throughout makes us admire him even more.The film covers so much ground in so little time and space. All of the jurors are unnamed for the majority of the film, and we're not dealing with specific characters most of the time, but members of the public from all parts of society. There's someone each of us can relate to, and we leave the film considering how we would deal with the case. Lumet uses the single setting to his technical advantage, managing to create a disturbing sense of claustrophobia as the film progresses, and the use of real time is so important in making us feel like we're on the same level as the characters and not missing a single detail."12 Angry Men" completely deserves to be seen as a classic. It's both a masterly technical achievement, and a fantastic lesson in mob mentality and not being afraid to go against a crowd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this film on IMDb's top 250 I wanted to see what it was all about. If I'm not mistaken its the oldest film in the top 10 as well. Before seeing this film I had never seen a black and white film, with the assumption that they would all be "Boring".. and oh boy was I wrong. This film is mainly dialogue driven, and to some people from my generation, growing up in the mid 90's and early 00's this is something we have a hard time getting through in movies. But the way this film paces itself and drives through the plot, with only 12 guys in a single room talking, its great. You get very immersed in the story in a very short amount of time, and you will not be disappointed after you finish watching the film. An excellent film overall and really made me appreciate movies for the content, and not just visual eye candy. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why 12 angry men should be number 1 on IMDb top 250 list.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know whether I will give any movie a 10 on 10 rating ever in my life again, but 12 angry men is such a movie even a whole 10 is an understatement to describe it's magnitude and brilliance.I strictly follow the IMDb top 250 list and I have made it my personal mission to see and understand each one of them to the best of my ability. So obviously when I saw 'The Shawshank Redemption' on number one I saw it and gained a perception that it was the most complete and meticulous movie I have ever seen. But that was until the day I witnessed '12 Angry Men'.Personally, I am not a very big admirer of court room drama or anything related to court room drama. There are very few court room dramas which I like. So I wanted to try this movie out as I heard a lot from my fellow movie buffs. Black and white picture and the camera rolled on filming each and every corner of the New York City courthouse. From the initial scenes I thought that I was in for a boring court room drama. But I was kind of optimistic when the scene of court room was over in some minutes and the 12 jury members came into the room. From there I was mesmerized.Short, crisp, witty, and outstanding are some of the adjectives which I can use. The way the movie portrays the differing mindsets of the jury members and especially my personal favorite Juror number 5 played by Lee.J.Cobb, it gives the movie a different and unusual edge which I don't find in other dramas.It will be cruel of me to compare 'Shawhshank Redemption' and '12 Angry Men' but when it is a matter of ranking there must be some aspects where the both can be compared. Both of the movies are excellent in their own ways. But, for me 12 Angry men takes the edge over Shawshank Redemption in the area of script and idea. Shawshank redemption spans over a variety of areas and characters which in itself gives the movie an edge over others, although I am not questioning the acting capabilities of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. I was engrossed and enthusiastic throughout the whole movie and it gripped me. But to create that same effect in a small and claustrophobic room of a courthouse is according to me a much more arduous. 12 angry men doesn't have a huge surrounding which elevates the viewers experience of seeing the movie apart from the dialogues. It only had 12 rational, emotional, and sweaty jurors who were in an intense deliberation of murder case.Another small fact which I noticed in the movie was the close up shot of the young boy whose trial was going on. That shot must have lasted for only seconds, but those that small face shot captured the sadness, bewilderment, abhorrence and insecurity of the boy. For me, that small scene was one of the best schtick I have ever seen.Although I have no problem with seeing long movies which span for 3 to 4 hours, but I got my so called 'viewer's satisfaction' in one and almost two hours on seeing 12 Angry Men and that too to an extent a little more gratification than 'Shawshank Redemption'.For me, 12 Angry Men till now is the best flick I have seen till date. I am waiting for such a film who can knock this one from the mantle. Till then, next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a magic in this movie, it makes you travel to a different time in a different world &amp; you can even feel the those times.Watching black &amp; white cinema has never been my cup of tea &amp; if someone tells you that its a black &amp; white movie which has been shot in one single room, you make sure not to watch it. But I somehow tested my patience with this one as I heard a lot about it &amp; got curious cuz I never heard the reviews like that before.. &amp; Boy I was left speechless!! - Well some people say that perfection can be achieved, I would say here it is .I have watched many but not a single movie has ever been able to reinvigorate the thrill I experienced on watching this captivating masterstroke. None of those could even come close to this one.I tell you, if you die without watching this one movie just because its has no color to it, you'll definitely regret it in your afterlife cuz you could have experienced this heavenly movie on earth. This is one neat performance by 12 stunning artists. Definitely better than Shawshank for me. Although I just watch a movie as an audience &amp; don't know much of the technical aspects which critics might have observed. But I would say that Sidney Lumet has done a great job in those times. Quite possibly the finest screenplay in the history of cinema only behind "A Separation-2011",fantastic dialogs, intelligent storyline, immaculate direction &amp; acting at its peak. You just cant get away from aura of it. Selection of actors according to the character is one aspect which only a few flicks can match.It's definitely in my list of top-3 movies &amp; I will never be able to figure out which one of them shall be on top.Not to spoil much for the guys who haven't watched it yet - Thats all I have to say about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Jurors and you're Juror 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine that you were put into an anonymous jury of everyday men, and your decision would determine the fate of an 18 year old Puerto Rican who allegedly murdered his own father. The substantial evidence prosecutes him. Then after reaching the verdict, you shine your shoes, shrug your shoulders, and return to your everyday life. 12 Angry Men is a compelling courtroom drama that isn't even in the courtroom. We never solve the case. We're not supposed to. Instead we're subjected to a tense conversation among jurors who dissect and unfold fragments of the case that we didn't see in court. What happens next is a moving drama about prejudice, bigotry, and ridicule among working class American men--and it's all piloted with masterful direction by Sidney Lumet.This is the second Sidney Lumet picture I have seen, the first being Dog Day Afternoon. I can infer that Lumet is a realist. Like Dog Day Afternoon, 12 Angry Men dramatizes a single event in one single setting. It allows for unprecedented drama and character development in ways which are typically battered down by other courtroom dramas. The film originated as a play and it's definitely easy to recognize the influence with Lumet's picture. But Lumet succeeds as a director by translating the "stage scenario" into one believable setting for a feature length film. I can't help but recall the numerous past occasions where I was confined to a room for two or three arduous hours. 12 Angry Men has a way of illustrating that claustrophobic headache.Another pivotal earmark is its dissection of not just the case (which we never witness) but of humanity itself. While twelve men are put into one room to bicker about the inconclusive evidence or the reasonable doubt, the more they bicker the more we become attune to their fallacies. These are not just fallacies or mistakes from the case; these are sociological imperfections. One man is a raving pedantic racist.Another lets his estranged relationship with his son fuel his bias. The impetuous Yankees fan hasn't a say in anything but sports--a poignant example of the way he feels about the rest of life, no doubt. And then there's the immaculate doubter, played by Henry Fonda, who questions not only the case in-and-out but his own sensibilities. Fonda's character openly states his discomfort for sending somebody to the "chair" in such an insouciant manner; he only wants to talk about it (via review) with his fellow jurors to justify that "Hey, I'm about to give the OK to kill somebody!" At first, the eleven opposing jurors (and audience) look to Fonda's capricious demeanor as burdensome. But his "rocking of the boat" is not meant to upset the majority rule. It's meant to weed-out and expose the levels of human decency and moral that hide beneath the faces of the same men. And it's all exploited in a confined room. No names are uttered. Hardly any benevolence is found. Instead we're given only a slim portrait of these men which expands into a stunning social statement on America altogether.I suppose that after the decision (as is seen in the film), the men all return to their labors. One has a baseball game to catch. Another will return to his wife. What occurred in the room mattered only in that room. 12 Angry Men held me at a genuine surprise, for I was uncertain of how a courtroom drama would handle a large cast of characters. Most courtroom films just replay the drama; 12 Angry Men immerses you right in it. Leaving the bedroom, the theater (wherever you saw it), you feel, in some ways, like the 13th juror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>all it took is 1 room and 12 people to create one of the best movies I ever watched in my life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a film that takes place almost entirely in one room and is mostly made up of dialogues, I must say it was a blast. Although the premise may sound completely boring for most people, the context in it surpasses most of everything out there. In a way it is a detective story that takes place in a confined room and where all evidence are based solely on speculations and thin reasoning. Through means of possibilities, deduction, and doubt, 12 men are supposed to decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his own father. Although the case seems crystal clear at first, as all the evidence prove his guilt, a single shred of doubt is more than enough to begin a long line of second thoughts and complicating debates. Anyone who loves intelligent disputes and exposed lines of thought behind anything will definitely be mesmerized by its attention to detail. What makes the movie even more enjoyable is how its characters are not emotionless orthologists or cynical businessmen. Each one of them has a very distinctive personality and his judgment is usually affected by his life experiences and personal bias towards certain social issues. You will see hints of racism, hatred for youngsters, snobing of the poor, even some who don't care and just want to get over with it soon so they can go watch a baseball match. An extra element that adds to its magnificence is how it is using its laws of that time as well as various details of the society it takes place in. You are constantly given various information regarding law specifics, and cultural events, so you are really made to believe the story takes place in an American state of the 50's. Something which is very important when it comes to any story regarding trials or detective work, since without them one would wonder why wouldn't they just use some fancy CSI method to determine if he really did it (which was impossible at that time) or why are thy even using common people to determine if a man is guilty or not (which happens in very few parts in the world). The interesting thing is that we are never actually told if the accused man really did the crime or not; that is not the objective of the movie. It is more about following the logic behind the use of a jury to determine the lives of others, as well as how reasonable doubt is more than enough to let someone go free if you are not certain he did it. This would of course mean that lots of people are found not-guilty even when they really did it, but that is not what the movie is all about. It has more to do with upholding the laws of a state in their fullest and in this case they really were. There are still a few things that annoyed me in the movie, even if they are completely excused for their time and era. The whole film is made up of only white males. Not a single woman or member of a different race. Although the 60's were indeed like that, in a sense it feels kinda racist. That is why I like the 90's remake even more in overall. Although it does not have superstars protagonist in it, it is with color, the characters are behaving in a more natural way (not that wooden feeling of the old movies), there are black members in the jury, the accused is a latino, and the judge is a woman. And despite the 30 year gap, the laws are still used in almost the same way (with only a few minor details presented differently just to adjust to the era) and thus the plot is presented in exactly the same way. Not that it's feels like much of a problem; it s still an amazing piece of cinema and worthy to be part of most top 10 movie lists with similar categories.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very unique and engaging film that takes place in just a single room. The discussions on a guilty charge is built upon with enough materials and suspense elements to cover the whole 1.5 hours without any need for the change of scenes or characters or any other plot twist techniques. And a brilliant masterpiece indeed! It is certainly not an easy task to make a movie like that with the same fixed setting. Probably this movie is smart enough to make up the number of characters to at least 12 men to make up for the rich details. But really, what other faults can you find in this movie with a perfect script taking place in one room for the whole time? What other flaws? I can't spot any.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men....You be the 13th Jury</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I've actually never seen a black and white film! Yes, its hard to believe that. But, I decided to watch this film as it was obviously one of the highest rated films and certainly the title sounded quite interesting. Without knowing anything about the movie, I went in to watch it and was stunned! The first ten to fifteen minutes just introduces you to each of the juries in the most interesting way possible. You aren't introduced to them by their names, but you are to remember them by their faces and different personalities. It started off very quietly, and I'll admit...pretty boring. However, as soon as the murder issue was brought into the movie, I felt this sudden urge to watch the movie immediately from start to finish. At this point, I was in. From here on in, its all filled with tension, friendship, loyalty, justice, truth and hatred. Its the best drama film I've ever seen, and certainly remains the greatest of the Mystery films. What really makes this film stand out as an alone success? Its pretty much the way each character is introduced. '12 Angry Men' is the only film in history, that can give you whole bunches of characters and not give out their names and yet love the characters and the story. The plot is extremely simple and not too much happens, but its the way the film is executed that really stands out. If you think about it, at the end of the film not too many events happen. Its just different juries laying out their evidence to Jury 3 (mainly) about why the boy could be innocent of the crime of murdering his father. Its not a story that shows it from the boys perspective, nor any sort of action. In fact, the whole film takes place in this jury room. Wow! Other strengths about this film are the incredible dialogue sequences and the masterful acting by each and every single one of the actors. At no point did any actor slack off, not even the old man. Speaking of the old man, he, apart from Jury 8 (the main jury) is the character I liked most. I also absolutely loved Jury 3, the one who detested the boy being innocent. The acting was masterful and his performance is also extremely powerful. I also enjoyed the man who looked a lot like Peter Cushing, the one who was 'believed' to be the first to say not guilty. He seemed great, as did the foreign jury. Pretty much every character was brilliant. '12 Angry Men', overall, is a clear example that a film does not need to contain extensive amounts of special effects but its the dialogue, the plot, the characters and the acting that makes a film a success. Also, the better executed, the better the film and this film has such strength in every one of those aspects. Directors like George Lucas, should watch movies like '12 Angry Men' as well as his original Star Wars trilogy and understand what makes a good film. Its not CGI battles (not that they could've done it back then), not the action, not the stupid love story (Anakin and Padme) and definitely not stupid slapstick humor. '12 Angry Men' is definitely the greatest black and white film I've seen and its definitely a must see for everyone and deserves a high spot in my Top 20</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must see to know what is democracy and freedom!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The whole concept of one man standing on what he believes to be right and fair is one that seems to be lacking nowadays(not in media or culture , but in life). Nowadays if you were 1 against 11 you would back out immediately and follow the crowd, I am not saying that people would change their mind and go with the crowd , but they would agree and then silently go home with their heads down and feel guilty for the rest of their days, weeks( later maybe forget and drop the guilt , but some part of us will always remember how we didn't stand on our opinion. This is not a story of the boy ( the convicted man) being absolved ( there are almost no personal emotions involved in the story (regarding the defendant) , but its a story about standing for what is right and just and good. Its about democracy!! This should be a must see in law and humanity courses alike! I have no idea how the jury's in US work now , but I really hope they are just. This would be silly , but they should show this film before the real life jury starts their work. Actually this should be a crash course into professional journalism and politics as well :D , I mean the way that "he" makes them change their mind or digs out new information , is quite brilliant. Just the way in which he makes them realize their own falseness is so clever and fair. He doesn't convince them that they are wrong , but he makes them see where are they wrong, makes them realize that they might be wrong in what they believed to be self-evident. I have always believed that the only way of making somebody change their mind is by making them change their own minds , and in this movie it is one of the central ideas. Not to even mention the incredible performances , every single actor is perfect in his role! The script , the dialogues,the close ups. Perfect! Just something we are really lacking in modern cinemas-good dialogues ( not saying that nothing like that is produced , but nothing like that gets to the big screen).why only 9 at the end, well its not only 9 , it IS great , however for higher mark it lacked a little bit of emotion ,drama . Then however , I don't think that this particular story could have been made any better ( well I haven't watched the remakes , maybe I will), but huge part of the idea was for somebody to be truly fair , they have to get rid of attachments and personal feelings. So the film itself also makes you look at it without any personal involvement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What powerful and hard-hitting cinema! There is so much said and conveyed directly and indirectly within a mere 96 odd minutes! I, for one, was neither ready for nor expectant of such a treat when I started watching "12 Angry Men". But boy, did it hold my attention within that short span!Let me be frank with you. These days I am on a Top-250-movie watching spree. But half of these so-called masterpieces are just packaged trash- packaged either with drugs, sex, homosexuality, underworld, etc. Barring these, there is not much to boast of in most of these movies. I watched Raging Bull and just could not make head or tail of it. I mean, I being an avid movie-watcher, had there been anything excellent about the movie, it would have made itself obvious. Also my expectations for the movie were rather too high. But I just could not bring myself to like this movie. But 12 Angry Men indeed means business when it comes to story, performances and meaning! The focus is entirely on the jury of a murder trial and whether the accused does deserve a benefit of doubt in a previously thought open-and-shut case. As one man is unconvinced of the accused boy's guilt, he elicits his reasons and calls for a discussion. I must mention that character-etching at this point of the movie becomes very important and the movie does excel in this particular requirement. Each of the jurors have a distinctive personality and their own prejudices or indifference. Nothing is forced to churn out a performance, each character dons his role comfortably. There is the leader of the group who drives the discussion smoothly, there is a shy, polite timid person who must always respectfully address others even when angry but still speak out his mind, there is the man who is convinced of the boy's guilt out of personal prejudice, there is the loudmouth old guy who belittles certain people, there are the rational men like the man who was raised in a slum, the painter and others, and there is the man who has no interest whatsoever in the matter. And there is Henry Fonda as the man who is the voice of reason in the entire jury.The storytelling is riveting and at the end of it, I was yearning for more. A simple but outstanding movie! Move over The Godfather, Pulp Fiction- I rate this one higher in all counts of movie-making...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best known courtroom dramas since "To Kill a Mockingbird" starring the great Henry Fonda in a tale of justice and the search for truth. A young boy has been accused of murder of his abusive father and now it's up to 12 men to decide if the boy will live or be sent to the electric chair. 11 men believe the defendant is guilty, but one lone juror (played stoically by Fonda) is convinced that the boy is innocent of the murder. Also starring Lee J. Cobb as the antagonistic and angry Juror #3 who harbors personal hatreds, John Fiedler as the meek Juror #2. Jack Klugman as Juror #5 who was raised in the slums, Martin Balsam as the Foreman of the jury and many more make up this panel of unique personalities. The film is packed with tension, anger and mostly importantly a tale of morals and its importance on human judgment. A truly wonderful film by famed director Sidney Lumet with a memorable cast.</fullReview>

The twelve angry men of the title are jurors and must decide the fate of a young man accused of killing his father. It does not help his case that he is poor and Hispanic, and not even the tone of voice of the Judge in the case seems to hold out any hope when giving instructions to the jury about their forthcoming deliberations. The evidence to convict, and thus send the man to the electric chair is overwhelming, and the first vote taken by the jurors is 11:1 to convict. Then Juror No 8 (Fonda) starts dissecting the evidence piece by piece in an almost forensic analysis of the facts. Is everything as it seems ? Of course not. The whole film is built around the concept of reasonable doubt and whether our individual prejudices will allow us to see it. The film offers no safe answer, as even the juror who was completely dispassionate about the whole affair turns out to be mistaken. A tour de force performance by Fonda as the Liberal everyman we all wish we could be, but with excellent performances all round, particularly from E G Marshall as the composed and evidence-led Juror No 4, and a scene stealer from Lee J Cobb as Juror No 3. This film is an object lesson in film making. The tension, which ratchets up nicely throughout the film as each successive vote is taken, is created entirely by the friction between the twelve protagonists. We are presented with a cross section of American society in the sixties, and undoubtedly we will agree with some of their perspectives and disagree with others, although in fairness to Lumet the unsympathetic characters are not difficult to spot and there are some powerful moments as their true characters are revealed. There is a valid question raised in the middle of the movie by Fonda's character: there is a man's life at stake: shouldn't they take some time to talk about it ? After all, supposing they get it wrong ? I think that whether you come away from this movie as a champion of the jury system will depend on whether you believe that your peers are indeed "twelve good men and true" as the one point this movie does make is that while the jury system is all we have, it is far from foolproof, an can easily be derailed by ignorance and prejudice. In this case, however it doesn't and this leads me to suggest an interesting aside. I believe that if this film was made again for a modern audience, and here I am also discounting the 1997 remake, so let's say a 2012+ audience, the director might wish to provide an ending where the Fonda character does not win through in the end, and the petty arguments and prejudices of the majority of the jury are too powerful to be overturned. However, for it's time and place, this is an almost perfect film, filled with excellent performances, and a Hollywood morality tale ending where goodness and common sense win through in the end. No wonder Fonda allows himself a Mona Lisa smile as he walks away from the Court House at the end of the movie. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless,unique masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a unique,remarkable film for a lot of reasons.One reason is the flawless direction from -one of the best directors of all time- Sidney Lumet.Another thing is the exceptional acting from all the juries,the simple yet superb plot and of course the fact that in the 96-minute-long film ,93 minutes of it take place in one and only set!But what makes 12 Angry Men truly exceptional is the deep psychological analysis and presentation of all the 12 juries.One could say that every jury is an allegory,a symbolism of a human being's type of personality,but looking at it that way,it seems that anybody is as different with anybody as the same .The only thing that determines is the experience that one has.The film also is so powerful that you can't but put yourself in the place of the one that decides.Could you decide about another man's life? And who makes you responsible?Is the law just?These are just a few reasons that 12 Angry Men is simply one of the best films of all time,and probably the psychologically deepest -maybe along with One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest- one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best "old films"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this film to be very compelling. There isn't any action, any special effects, any journey and anything beyond 12 men in a room arguing and it is great. The acting was perfect and the main theme was very interesting.Anyway, this is a film that has some serious gray matter: The individual has by right that he/she is always innocent unless proved guilty and the film debates this question. Also, there is the question of bias affecting judgment of the jury relating to the social class of the individual under judgment.Highly recommended film, one of the best of old-school cinema (which I am not particularly fond of).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good it belongs in a time capsule</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man has been brutally murdered and now the life of his eighteen-year-old son, the prime suspect for his killing, is in the hands of twelve jurors. At first glance, it's an open-and-shut case: two witnesses supposedly saw and heard him do it; he had a clear motive; and he even owned an identical knife to the murder weapon. Yet, while eleven jurors are completely convinced of his guilt - some because of the sheer weight of evidence and others due to their own personal prejudices - one man (Henry Fonda) is not. He does not necessarily believe the defendant to be innocent; he simply isn't sure of his guilt. Alone, ridiculed and under intense pressure to conform, he must persuade his fellow jurors one by one that all is not as it seems.The scene is set for a fascinating cinematic study of the human condition and, arguably, the most gripping film ever made.I meant to review 12 Angry Men for my university paper two years ago, but never got around to it. Now, having recently completed my first stint of jury service, I believe the time couldn't be more apt for me to right this small injustice. For Sidney Lumet's directorial debut, with its perfect acting, intriguing plot and technical mastery, symbolises for me all that is good about Hollywood cinema, but which we rarely get to see.Based on Reginald Rose's teleplay of the same name, 12 Angry Men takes place almost entirely within a drab and claustrophobic deliberation room. There are no set changes and little in the way of action; only gorgeous, clinical dialogue. In a genuine feat for 1957, however, Lumet's camera glides effortlessly around this room, making it appear far bigger than it truly is; indeed making it seem as if you yourself are walking around it, like the jurors tasked with deciding a man's fate.For the classicists reading this, the film adheres to the unities of time, space and action, with film-time closely mirroring audience-time, a detail that yet again transports us against our will inside that room. Lumet also presents a Moby-Dick-esque 'self-enclosed universe', in that each juryman represents a specific human trait: anger, meekness, indifference, compassion - the best of humanity and the worst. It is a film replete with close-ups of human faces, as if the director is constantly trying to see what lies behind them.What at first appears to be a simple story of revenge is gradually and ingeniously deconstructed by Fonda's character until the audience doesn't quite know what to believe by the end. Every time we think we've reached the bottom of the mystery before us, new depths reveal themselves, until all we're left with is multiple pictures of the truth taken from confusing angles, rather than a single definitive image.Fonda is imperious as the white-suited knight of justice, fighting bigotry (the defendant's ethnicity is left ambiguous) and ignorance at every turn on his quest to discover the truth. What might entertain you even more than his rhetoric, however, is the detailed characterisation on show throughout - twelve men who are utterly believable and who all have their own unique motivations for voting "guilty" or "not guilty".Aside from Fonda, notable performances come from Lee J. Cobb (The Exorcist), who plays the antagonistic Juror #3, and Joseph Sweeney, an actor whose IMDb profile page doesn't even include a photograph, but who is sublime as the elderly yet highly observant Juror #8. Perhaps the biggest compliment I can pay to this film is to say that there isn't a single average performance in it. Good as the actors are, however, they are helped massively by Rose's acidic script, memorable monologues, and one-liners that are so incisive they'll leave you stunned to silence.On that note, I can't think of a film that has as many genuinely surprising moments as 12 Angry Men.12 Angry Men is not devoid of humour - indeed it contains several amusing characters who provide much comic relief - but it is first and foremost an intellectual, psychological and, dare I say it, philosophical film that has been teaching us about ourselves for over 50 years now. It really belongs in a time capsule; it certainly deserves a place in your movie collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my my !! What a feast to watch ! I watched this movie for the second time today. I generally don't prefer to watch a movie second time as I prefer to watch something new instead of something I have already seen. But today, somehow, I didn't have any new movie available to watch and I thought of going through my library of close to 1000 movies just to have a glimpse of what all I have got. I desperately wanted to watch a movie since I was getting bored and I picked my "12 angry Men" from my library. I was casual in the beginning since I had already watched it before, but oh boy, I was so much captivated while watching this movie second time too. The story and the characters are so likable.Kudos to Henry Fonda and the team to come up with such a masterpiece. I wish more meaningful movies with as low a budget as this one could be made in today's time too. 10 out of 10 for this movie !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tremendous Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a tremendous film, worthy of repeat viewing. If you are a fan of courtroom drama's, then this will definitely be to your liking. It is not set in the courtroom itself, but rather the film deals with the jury, and it's attempts to reach a verdict in the trial they've been assigned.Henry Fonda plays the part of a juror who does not necessarily dissent at first. He simply feels that the other 11 jurors ought to talk for a few minutes about the trial. What builds from his few initial questions forms the basis for all the tension that comes later.The entire film is shot in only two rooms, a large deliberation room and a bathroom. I believe there are a few exterior shots at the beginning, and there are a few at the end, outside the courthouse. There is little of anything to work with here in the way of props and settings, so you know that the acting must be excellent in order to hold everybody's attention for over an hour and a half. It is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One for the ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I'll start off by saying that I'm only 20, which in itself should say something about my rating of the movie. I'm not some old guy reviewing based on nostalgia or anything like that.They really don't make movies like this anymore. There are no twists, there are no turns, there are no explosions, and there are no special effects. What you get here is a smart, dialogue driven tale about 12 men burdened with the fate of a young Hispanic man. Something you don't see too often these days is a brilliantly written script. 98% of this movie takes place in one room, and thus relies on character interaction and dialogue and nothing more. It reminds us that there is more to life than whats on the surface, something we often forget.It reminds me of a movie like Clerks. Obviously a completely different type of movie, but at its root is quite similar. Smart, subtle, and character-driven (and black &amp; white which is kind of beside the point). Most everyone can identify with one of the jurors. The skeptic, the racist, the conformist, the indifferent. We all know people like this, and you'll likely find yourself identifying with one or more of the jurors.So many around my age would immediately dismiss this film because of its simplicity and because its understated. I feel quite sorry for them. The film is quite compelling and you really get sucked into the life of a juror in a murder trial. Don't dismiss this film because of its lack of color or anything superficial. Easily one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and there is a reason its rated so high. Do yourself a favor. See it. Then see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent parable about the importance of standing up for your views</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the fact that the majority of this film is shot on one set where at various points, all four walls are visible is an impressive technical achievement. The camera work and set manipulation that this feat required must have been agonizing to plan and execute in a way that does not break the viewer's suspension of disbelief.However, the film is noteworthy for more than singularly impressive camera work. It is a work of masterful acting in that the players disappear into their roles and all that the viewer sees is a man seeking to give a boy the benefit of the doubt when the rest of his life is at stake. The specifics may differ, but this is a sentiment that all people can agree upon, and this is why this is a great film: everyone has been in a position where they have had to convince a group of people that their position was the right one, partially through rational argument and partially through a sharing of gut feelings. But this shared experience is why this film is relate-able, why it is a movie that transcends cultural boundaries, and why in the year 2011, a inner city black male watching this film will be as moved by it as a suburban white girl who sees it in the year 1955.This film really isn't about the boy, or the trial, or who killed the boy's father. It's about feeling passionately about something, and then going to whatever lengths to convince others of that, whether they have just as strong and rational an argument as you do but in opposition, whether they have an inner, purely emotional antagonism towards your point of view, or whether they simply don't care either way about the outcome. This film works on a different level than most movies do, and that is why the names of the jurors, the names of the boy, the arguments of the lawyers during the case, or who really killed the father, none of that is important. What is important is that one man decided to make a stand against eleven others because he felt that his position was right, and whether it was or not, his actions will resonate with every single viewer of this film who has ever took a stand on any issue and had someone tell him that the issue was "cut and dried."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A must-see of simple filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Sidney Lumet. Written by: Reginald Rose (from his own teleplay), Starring: Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G Marshall, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, Robert Webber.Sidney Lumet's first film explores a murder trial from the jury room based off the teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Twelve men debate the fate of a Puerto Rican teenager on trial for the murder of his father. Eleven jurors think he is guilty and one (Fonda) thinks he is innocent.The amazing thing about the film is how the film pulls out emotion as well as logic in the trial. The two do not way each other out however. Lumet balances the racism and laziness of the eleven jurors with the unbiased nature of Fonda's character. Reginald Rose creates a perfect juror and an ideal protagonist while allowing Lumet to add claustrophobia and conflict to add to the film's relatively limited cinematic approach which adds to the experience of the play.Lumet's career was not always as successful as his first film and sometimes it was more powerful, but this is certainly not mediocre in any way. It makes better use of cinematic techniques in a theatrical narrative than most films like this. This also serves as one of the many high points in the career of Henry Fonda and a starting place for a number of character actors such as E.G Marshall, Ed Begley, and Jack Warden. The impact this film had on Lumet and Hollywood in general is as great as any film based off a play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And Justice For ALL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the many great reviews for this film, this is my first time seeing it. It starts with a judge explaining to a jury of 12 men that the only way to come to a decision of guilty is to not have any room for reasonable doubt. The judge then goes on to say if the jurors find the defendant guilty, the guilty verdict will automatically impose the death penalty. The 12 men then go to a jury room to deliberate, which is where the whole movie takes place. The defendant is a teenager accused of stabbing his father to death, with a switch blade knife. All but 1 (Davis, played by Henry Fonda) of the 12 men find the defendant guilty, immediately, without any discussion to the arguments heard during the trial. The theme for this film is justice. Eleven men were ready to sentence a teenage boy to death without even analyzing the information presented before them. For some, it seemed their verdict was for personal reasons and Davis (juror # 8) was not going to conform to the majority. The men were mean, hostile, demanding, stereotypical, rude, and impatient, but Davis didn't break. Davis went through many of the testimonials from witnesses, even acting out scenarios for the other men to get a better understanding of how he could not convict the boy, also putting doubt in the other 11 men. The men one by one started to change their votes because or Davis's analysis . The first juror to change his vote from guilty to not guilty was juror # 9, who was later identified as Mr. McCardle at the end of the movie. After many more discussions and possibilities, juror #5 changed his vote to not guilty, followed (in order) by juror # 11, juror #2, juror #6, juror #7, juror #12, juror #1 (the Foreman), juror #10, juror #4, and finally juror #3. Davis made his point many times throughout this movie. An example of Davis making his point includes the fact that humans can mistake things sometimes, and if it was possible that at least one of the witnesses made a mistake in what they heard or saw, they should not find this young man guilty, and if so, no justice will be served. Another movie that has justice as the theme is The Accused (1988), starring Jodie Foster and Kelly McGillis. Jodie Foster's character is gang-raped and her lawyers job is to convince a jury that this crime has actually committed by these men, and this was not consensual sex. There too were witnesses in this movie and it was also up to the jury to decide if the witness's story was credible and true. Although the opposite of 12 Angry Men (1957) because in The accused (1988), the main character was trying to convince people that a crime had been committed by a group of men for sure, and in 12 Angry Men (1957) the main character was trying to convince people that maybe they had the wrong guy. Yet, both themes for each movie was justice. The move 12 Angry men (1957) was shot in black and white. I believe this movie was filmed this way because during that time period (1957) black and white films were standard. Color television had only been introduced a few years before. Black and white also gives the viewer the option to better focus on the characters, and dialogue, and not what is surrounding. I liked how the camera would zoom into whichever juror would suddenly have doubt and change their vote. During these moments there was no need for dialogue really because after Davis gave another possibility, we knew that another juror would change their guilty verdict to a not guilty verdict during the next vote. I had to put myself in the shoes of both the teenager and the 12 jurors. I found myself wondering how I would feel knowing that I didn't commit a crime, yet 12 men had my life in their hands, relying on the testimonials of two unreliable witnesses. I also had to put myself in the position of Davis; trying to convince these men that there is absolutely room for doubt when you analyze the evidence, whether the boy committed the crime or not, there was not enough evidence to say guilty. Going into a room and not once talking about the trial, but finding this young man guilty of first degree murder would not have been justice. Only someone with poor morals could do such. The movie was great and I would recommend to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good courtroom drama but not without problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The interesting thing about 12 Angry Men is that you come away from it and can't honestly say if the jury were right to acquit the accused man. The film never really answers the question of whether he was guilty or not. It just simply says that it was impossible to be sure. The film is ultimately about the Not Proved verdict.At least I certainly hope that we as an audience were not supposed to leave the film thinking that the accused man was definitely innocent. The counter-evidence brought to our attention by juror no. 8 (Henry Fonda) is often not especially convincing but seems to be taken very seriously by progressively more and more men in the room until inevitably we have a unanimous Not Guilty verdict. An example of this, is when Fonda successfully gets the others to acknowledge that the old man witness is unreliable, yet then goes on to base a major part of his own evidence on the old fellows testimony that he took fifteen seconds to get to the door to witness the murderer fleeing. Fonda clearly assumes that this man he has determined as unreliable would get his exact timings spot on in a moment of heightened emotion. It may seem like a minor point but there are just a little too many of these small inconsistent assumptions littering 12 Angry Men for me to feel it was an entirely successful exercise. I really couldn't help shake the notion that Fonda's character had his own agenda and was simply unwilling to back down. Perhaps he was the most persuasive man in the room and that was ultimately the reason that the decision was made. It's difficult to really say with any certainty that the accused was innocent at all. Did they really make the correct decision?Setting this consideration aside, one thing the movie does have in abundance is stellar acting talent. The 12 members of the jury are well played by all. While the direction is simple but highly efficient; it is not an easy task to set a movie in one room with dialogue the only action on offer but Sidney Lumet does keep things moving along at a good pace and maintains the interest. This is certainly a good movie despite my misgivings. For me it does ultimately have a definite ambiguous quality and if that was the intention then I can hardly argue with that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Courtroom dramas don't work well with everyone. Neither do movies in black and white, people find them dull, boring and lack-lustre. 12 Angry Men falls in both these categories. Yet, it manages to astound you with its breathtaking brilliance and subtle perfection.A boy is convicted of murdering his father. Witnesses, good lawyers, bad past record, motive; an open and shut case. Three minutes into the movie and the twelve jury members are in their chamber. They have all got their priorities and schedules - one has a baseball match, another has his garages going to pot. Everyone wants to leave; it is not their butt that is going to land on the electric chair anyway. Prior to a discussion of any sort, an initial vote is held with the hopes of making a quick, clean job out of it. Eleven are convinced he is guilty. One isn't quite so sure. And hence unfolds one of the greatest dramas Hollywood has ever seen.The movie doesn't waste time in showing the lawyers fighting like shark. It doesn't show a depressed teenager sobbing his guts out in the box. The camera focuses on him but once, and that single look is enough to convey a farrago of emotions - fear, exhaustion, uncertainty and a certain innocence. Instead, it does what it is meant to - focus on the twelve men that matter; in whose hands resides the fate of the accused. They are regular people from everyday spheres of life - a coach, architect, bank clerk - men who don't overanalyze when presented with facts. They naively, yet innocuously, take things at their face value which compels them to reach the guilty verdict; after all, the evidence is overwhelming. The lone man (Henry Fonda) who contradicts them, however, realizes the onus that has befallen them and refuses to reach a hasty conclusion, for he believes that there is the possibility of there being reasonable doubt and as the American Constitution states, a man is innocent until proved guilty. Initially, the others are merely taken aback at the trivial inconvenience due to this rebellion of sorts. But this soon turns to resentment, finally boiling to anger - something that beautifully justifies the title of the movie.Henry Fonda does a convincing job as juror number eight. He is brooding, intelligent, pragmatic and at the same time calm with a mild demeanour. His acting isn't artificial as he thoroughly indulges himself in his role. The performance is powerful and both the jury members and viewers find it hard to counter his arguments. He asserts that ratiocination is the best and only way to decide - for a man's life hangs in the balance. As the movie proceeds, you see him demolishing proofs one after the other, till they all collapse like a stack of cards. The others too play their part, however, there isn't a real standout among the remaining eleven; a shortcoming that the movie faces. The rest of the characters have been poorly portrayed and lack depth; there is nothing that stands out or is memorable about them. While the film had several chances to introduce more dimensions to its actors, it simply fails to do so, despite the fact that is it primarily a character-centric movie. Fonda is staunch in the lead role, but the faceless others serve no purpose than contradict him, sticking to him like leeches, without creating an identity of their own.The tension has been skilfully built up - right from the weather (it is the hottest day of the year) to the claustrophobic environment where the entire episode takes place. The idiosyncrasies of men have been highlighted wonderfully; their feeble mindedness, their anxiety, dogmatism, their indecisiveness and their fury at being constantly opposed by men who change their votes like the flip of a coin. They reason out, fight, talk dirty and negotiate. Their faces glisten with sweat. They smoke. A weapon is brandished and a man resorts to violence. Men are prejudiced, for the accused comes from a poor society with a history of violence. Some even cite personal reasons for convicting the boy. There is racism, bigotry and impatience; but juror number eight refuses to budge, for he believes that the life of a man is worth more than that. The director Sidney Lumet (Network, Dog Day Afternoon) knows that the movie isn't about the suspense and doesn't try to make it into one. It is about how the characters have been drawn out, each representing a dimension of human personality. Though, like many great movies, 12 Angry Men was a commercial failure, it is considered as a benchmark in American cinema. It is touching, mesmerising and provocative, and it does so much in a mere ninety six minutes, which indisputably makes it one of the greatest cult classics of all times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect within it's own confines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can be said about Twelve Angry Men that hasn't already been said before with more eloquence. Sidney Lumet's first and arguably best feature has entered into the annals of film history and has been picked apart ad nauseum by critics, industry professionals and academics alike. Twelve men walk into a jury room eleven say guilty, the one played by Henry Fonda says not guilty; etc. etc.There is a reason for this however; not the least of which is the films enduring timelessness made all the more impressive by its subject matter. Made during the decline of the studio system, the film was an oddity onto itself. A tiny black and white film at a time of Technicolor, a principle cast of character actors at a time of A-list credit cramming, and a director who up until then stuck to television and stage. Still Twelve Angry Men was far from conventional and in many ways ushered in a new age of cinema. It can be reasonably argued that Lumet paved the way for Robert Altman, Sydney Pollack and John Schlesinger among others to make the jump from TV to features.Within its own confines, the movie is flawless. Most of the film takes place in a single room and most of the information pertinent to the case is told second-handedly. Despite this, the film has the tension of a modern day thriller and then some. The dialogue is so innately organic though never rambling and the characterizations are rich and detailed. The camera moves through the room effortlessly making enough cuts to keep things interesting without being distracting. Many large lugubrious epics wish they could keep things this interesting! The inspired script written by Reginald Rose is so fluid that it has been open to interpretation not all of which are good. Many argue that Fonda's Juror #8 manipulates the other jurors and is less a fleshed out character than a symbol of ivory tower intellectualism. Additionally the points he raises range from valid to a bit sketchy and he takes "beyond reasonable doubt" to extremes. I wouldn't put it quite in that context. I think just like everyone else in the room, Juror #8's choices are made based on his personal perspective. He feels compelled to push and push because no one else will. It's a character flaw that may not be admonished like the racial ramblings of Juror #10 (Ed Begley) but isn't legitimized by definitive answers either.However you interpret the film, Twelve Angry Men still remains a taut emotional roller-coaster, a thoughtful introspective and a brilliant character piece. I didn't even mention the wonderfully nuanced work of Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall and Jack Warden. It launched the career of a brilliant auteur and helped define an era in filmmaking that became the norm until the age of the blockbuster. Out of all the films of the period, this courtroom drama is with little doubt the most deserving of its reputation.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was in IMDb's top 10 list over the best voted movies of all time. I knew nothing about this movie and was very eager to watch it so that I could see what all the fuss is about.I can conclude that this movie raises so many ethical questions and the storyline is nothing less than perfect. The whole plot takes place in one single room and portrays 12 jurors with different backgrounds and points of view. One would think that this kind of movie would very easily get boring, but it doesn't at all. I was stuck to my TV screen for the entire movie.The actors are outstanding and the writers of this movie have obviously done an excellent job. This movie has probably given a lot of people something to think about, snap judgment can be so wrong.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highly regarded as one of the best pictures of all time, 12 Angry Men manages to be intense, funny, and serious, simultaneously without being over-exaggerated. The characterisation of each of the 12 jurors are perfectly realised, with each being distinctive juxtapose with the others. Although the lead actor in the strong cast is Henry Fonda (who's excellent here), I'm particularly impressed with Lee J. Cobb's Oscar- worthy performance.The interesting fact of 12 Angry Men is that more than 95% of the filming is done in a small enclosed room. Praise to Sidney Lumet for being able to creatively work around with the cast in a confined space, without boring the viewers. The screenplay is exceptional, highly entertaining, yet allowing room for intelligent thoughts (of viewers) to roam. This is a quality black-and-white offering from the late 1950s, and is definitely in most film critics Top 100 films of all-time. Very highly recommended!GRADE: A+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whoa! This is called direction!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been seeing this movie in IMDb's top 250. To be honest, every time I see the year of release I just skip it. Finally yesterday I got the mood to watch this movie and so I did. Right now, I feel so much glad that I saw it. Better late than never at all. A timeless classic. What!! a direction. Sheer talent! Ironically, words are eluding from me to praise this movie where words/dialogs/talking play a pivotal role. Just a single room, 12 men and 96 mins. Henry Fonda, Reginald Rose and Sidney Lumet prove that its more than just enough to capture your full attention. Stupendous! This movie shows that one's conviction and attitude can get him through whatever he wants! Casual acting by all the actors. It's simply cool.As they say don't judge a book by its cover, I say don't underestimate this movie just because its released some 50 years ago. Watch it to believe it! This will surely make it to your top favorites no matter how many more years will pass by and how many more movies will get released. This movie has already left its mark in Hollywood and will leave a lasting impression in you too! Thanks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cerebral experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie proves that a good story and a tight script are more important than any other thing for a movie to succeed. Sidney Lumet was already experienced when he directed this movie but still 12 Angry Men is an amazing first film. Henry Fonda is the main dissenter from the jury who tries to convince others that the case is not as simple as it appears. Joseph Sweeney who plays the role of the old man also does a remarkable job. The movie proves that a defendant has the right to a fair trial regardless of his social or economic status. I wish this movie could be shown in every law school so that lawyers and judges can understand the gravity and importance of their decisions. The movie is more than 50 years old but still feels fresh and is also a must watch for anyone who loves good cinema and for people interested in film making. This is also a perfect example of a simple yet powerful movie that will stay in the minds of the audiences. I can bet that anyone who has seen this movie will not be able to forget it easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Search for the best male personality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"12 Angry Men" is an awe inspiring movie resembling a play where 12 jury members are asked to determine a young man's fate. The condition that the young man must either be convicted guilty or not guilty is too harsh and made me dislike the plot. However, this movie, at least for me, is not about the decision or the trial but about the 12 unique male characters.All the 12 men have personalities we can relate to in our daily lives making this movie realistic. For the sake of classification, let's say there are 3 kinds of men - "so called real men" , "Polite, theoretical/ intellectual but timid" and "cool, fun loving but careless."The so called real men are arrogant. They are not at all flexible. They have fixed views and they don't want to change their views. They prefer going with their preconceived notions. They have special ways of behaviour. They represent style - the way they walk n talk. They have personalities which easily make any timid guy to follow them. Such dictatorial people may not make the best leaders but gets most attention for sure. They represent a very high male ego. It is interesting to see Juror no 10 disliked by other jury for his preconceived notions in one scene. His male ego gets hurt when Juror no 4 says "Now sit down and don't open your mouth again." His emotional break up is worth watching and so is Juror no. 3's. Difference between juror no. 10 and 3 is juror no 10 does not care for anyone's support when he expresses his views but Juror no. 3 accepts Juror no. 4's leadership. Such kind of men can influence by their personalities but are perceived as vain people."Cool, fun loving but careless" men may be the most appreciated by women but for this plot they are the ones who are least admired. Such self centered people are best for themselves but should have maturity to keep personal life separate from work. Juror no 7 belong to this category. Juror no. 12 also appear to be more n less carefree types."Polite, theoretical/ intellectual but timid" men are the products of our education system. They are taught to behave with manners, follow social rules and think in certain intellectual ways. They are the pillars for the well being of the society. If they are not there, the system wouldn't even work. They follow discipline. However, they appear weak and boring. Most of the men from the jury belong to this category. However, there are many shades. The timid but intellectual men (Juror no. 1,2,5,6,9,11 )are the ones who are necessary both to keep the best man appear best in relative terms and run the system smoothly. However, when it comes to intellectual, confident men, we have very few options left. Juror no. 8 is the most important character in the plot. However, as movie goes on, he appears manipulative. His guts are appreciable, but taking a stand, which appears neutral at the first instance but using it for self-glory later is not appreciable. Such men can only make winners in the society. However, I personally would not prefer to become such a manipulative winner. (Putting personal prejudices apart: P)Juror no 4 is an interesting character. He is combination of both characters - real man and intellectual man. He is definitely better than all other personalities but the most important thing is he does not seem to be interested in attracting attention for the sake of attaining it. He is not in the competition. Guess, that makes him the best one however (his apathy towards becoming best) making this search look pathetic.The whole discussion and the clashes among all these men are worth watching; making this movie a worth watching treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as good as it can get.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is minimalistic movie making at its very best. I mean as far as movies set in a single room go this is simply the best one out there. Lots of later movies tried to imitate it and attempted to reach the same level of successful and brilliance but none of them have even come close yet.It also has one of the most simple premises out there. All that the movie is about is 12 jurors trying to decide whether or not the accused in a murder-trial is guilty of the crime or not. So the movie is all talk but sure no bore. It's a movie that is always going and at all times interesting, due to its diverse and rich characters and its simple, yet greatly intriguing concept. I have no illusions about it though that this is also how its like in real life. So even though the movie takes a realistic approach with its story, it's still obviously fiction but at least it's not overwritten or ever exaggerated.Interesting and most effective thing about the movie is that it starts off with only one guy voting for the accused being not guilty, even though he himself is not at all convinced that he is actually innocent. He only wants to talk about it because he feels like he owes it to the guy, who's life they are deciding about. All are reluctant at first, since it seemed to be a clear and done case but the more elements and proof gets debated about the more doubt arises about his guilt. So slowly opinions start to slide and some of the jurors get set up against each other, due to their different opinions. Its what keeps the movie so interesting to watch and is also what makes the movie a real well flowing well.It's also brilliantly brought to the screen by director Sidney Lumet, who had never directed a theatrical movie before actually. Even though the movie is set in mostly one room he uses this aspect to the maximum and to the movie its own advantage. It gives the movie a great atmosphere and feel to it. There are some long and dynamic shots, that allow all of the characters to often do their say in a sequences. It gives the characters actually some depth and personality, even though we never get to know all of their names and of course it's not being the type of movie that has the space and time to do some character building. Sidney Lumet really did the most and best with the story and its characters.It's obviously a character drive movie and in a way also a real great character study. So it also really helps the movie that it has some truly great actors in it. I was a bit worried about Henry Fonda being what was supposed to be the most sympathetic character, also since I was used to seeing Jack Lemmon in that role, in the 1997 remake. But no, Fonda was just surprisingly great and effective in his role. Lee J. Cobb was also really great but by saying that I feel like I'm not given the rest of the cast enough credit. All are simply great in their roles, though it are Fonda and Cobb that stand out, also because they are being the main characters of the movie, that throughout stand opposite to each other with their views and opinions. It's were most of the movie its fireworks comes from.One great and fantastically effective minimalistic and simplistic movie. Movie-making at its best and purest.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie, but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't add much to the laudatory admiration for this movie -- I share it. A wonderful example of bare, minimal drama, based on plot and acting and characters. I think it was almost without exception a wonderfully performed movie -- Henry Fonda, Jack Klugman, all the jurors.Here comes the only thing I think I disagree about with others who think as I do that this is a wonderful movie. I think they were wrong.It may very well be an aside as to what the jurors were really talking about, but to me, it was very important. And Henry Fonda made, again to me, some pretty poor arguments that were to overcome the evidence that was pretty indicative that the boy did in fact kill his father.Just as an objective look at the arguments being made, beyond the wonderful drama, the boy was guilty from all facts that were presented. Perhaps that may be the only flaw, but a fundamental one, in this very exceptional movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as applicable today...timeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched this film again last evening for at least the twentieth time, it struck me how this film has so much to it that is real and important, each character reflecting an attitude of society. Racism, intolerance, rage, hatred, class distinctions, family discord. It is remarkable that each trait and character is so clearly developed and reflected on film. A newer version has been made for HBO which includes women, not sure what the jury selection criteria was in 1957 but apparently women were not considered for jury duty as often.Henry Fonda is of course the standout as fair-minded and intellectual architect, a reflective man who sees the flaws in the judicial system and wants the case to be considered on its own merits. Jack Warden as the selfish yet humorous baseball fan irritated that he is missing his Yankee game. Robert Webber as the man in the gray flannel suit, not wanting to make waves. Ed Binns as a working man who at first needs convincing by Fonda. Ed Begley as a hateful racist who could care less whether a man is executed unjustly for a crime he didn't commit. Lee J. Cobb, as a man alienated from his own son after beating him, who takes out his rage on the accused. Jack Klugman as a man who grew up in "slums", as they were then called, and has compassion for those who survived it. E.G. Marshall, an analytical yet sheltered man who comes to see his own veiled prejudices have caused him to vilify the culprit.The young boy accused of stabbing his father was supposedly seen by several eyewitnesses, but their testimony is then questioned. The entire film is twelve men in a heated and uncomfortable sequestered jury, and their thoughts and reactions to the case. This film should be watched thoroughly to appreciate it: for instance when E.G. Marshall, who seems to be a fair and intellectual man suddenly realizes that yes, the witness which may send a young man to his death may have been mistaken.Do not miss, the remake has no such stellar performances. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extra Ordinary finishing touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What Can I say? I never thought I would be much interested in a Black and white movie like this one. Started to watch with an ordinary feel. But finished watching with a very high satisfaction. The way they avoided to tell us whether the boy is really guilty or not makes us feel like a thirteenth juror over there. That thing attracted me the most in the movie. And all through the movie, I suspected that Juror 3 could have actually made the murder as he was strongly stressing that the boy is guilty. But when Fonda, in climax, takes the coat of Juror 3 and helps him wear it changed my view. It made me feel that Juror 8 actually respects the view of Juror 3 who just fought hard for what he believed to be true.Extra ordinary Climax. * Respecting Juror 3 left the movie without any villain in the movie * Leaving to our own decision whether the boy actually did the crime or not though they let him go because of the benefit of doubt.These two things will never go out from my mind whenever I think about this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films I have ever had the good fortune of watching. A jury is nearly convinced that the accused is guilty. One man stands against the rest and argues that he may not be. In the 90 minutes that follow, this goes into these twelve individuals, and we see how peer pressure and personal prejudices can sway decisions that ought not to be taken lightly. This is a masterpiece, and it is so on account of all the elements being carefully crafted, each excellent on their own, and the mix of them all being so seamless. Every character(they are the focus of this, if the well thought out case itself does get a lot of attention as well) and the script is well-written, developed impeccably and credible. This is quite realistic, and what flaws there are were possibly conscious decisions for the dramatic effect(it is not a documentary, nor was it meant to be), and do not take away from the whole. The acting is perfect for all concerned. This is carried by dialog and marvelous speeches, with no flashbacks and essentially only one setting(albeit the cinematography makes full use of it, so no claustrophobia is induced). The camera stays on the people, follows them, remains on them for reactions when someone else suddenly speaks, and there are long takes. Editing is impossibly subtle. You forget that it's a movie. Instead, you find yourself experiencing this tense situation with them. A dozen men in a locked room, determining if someone lives or dies. This raises questions about the legal system, as well. Other than Serpico, I haven't seen anything by Lumet, but Dog Day Afternoon is on my list of ones to get. There is some mildly disturbing content and a few instances of moderate language in this. The DVD comes with the original trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How can a person make a movie that is filmed in only one room, and never gets boring? well, ask Sidney Lumet. This director, showing maturity in his very first film, made a classic, one of the most acclaimed movies of all time, using twelve actors and a excellent script.In one of it's first scenes, where there was eleven jurors voting guilty, and only one voting non-guilty, I thought, "It's impossible, there is no way that in only one room, a single man could convince eleven jurors that there was a reasonable doubt", but fortunately there is, you'll see, this is the most important quality of this picture, otherwise everybody would be thinking, "What a stupid idea that is, to make a movie in only one room, it's just boring". It's not fair to review this movie without talking about the acting, with the help of the script, they made twelve different two-dimensional characters, and they represent all the different kind of people in the society, there is the grouchy, there is the one who only cares about himself, the wise old man and a lot more.This movie is for me the best example for me that action scenes and visuals effects are not at all, the most important element of great films, of course there are movies that think different than I do.Verdict: You can watch this movie ten times, and you will no find a reasonable doubt to not watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simplicity can be complex if you work at it and 12 Angry Men is a perfect example of just that. The first time I saw it was in my civics class my freshman year of high school and unlike my other classmates who saw it boring and dull I was for lack of a better word riveted and here's why: The beginning of the film brings you into the tail end of a trial about a teenage boy who's accused of murdering his father. The evidence is a switchblade knife and the testimony of a old man and woman who heard and allegedly witnessed the crime. The Judge sets the tone for the film explaining that the "jury" (you included) have to decide whether the boy is guilty or not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The jurors descend into the confines of the jury room and are locked in until the verdict is made. Most of the men automatically deem the defendant guilty just because they want to leave and a few because of the evidence which consisted of the eye witness testimony. When the first vote is taken Henry Fonda (juror #8) is the only one who says not guilty but not because he thinks he not guilty or guilty but because he isn't sure. The film then progresses into Fonda breaking the case down to the others and slowly but surely guiding the others into a verdict of not guilty all except juror 10 and 7. After some heated prejudicial and racial words eventually all become convinced of the kid's innocence. The very end of the film concludes that men go their separate way revealing only 2 of the men's names and the picture ends.The great thing about the 12.A.M is that you really need no information on the case, the trial, or the testimony you solely rely on the jurors showing that a little usually means a lot. I think it's a wonderful movie with a brilliant classic cast including the man behind the voice of Winnie the Pooh's Piglet (you'll know it when you hear him) and of course the incomparable Henry Fonda. Truly a film although simple was way ahead of it's time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a true undeniable American masterpiece. Courtroom dramas rarely match Sidney Lumet's film. The story is about 12 jurors on a murder trial that turns out to be much more complicated than first thought, all thanks to the persistence of Juror 8 played wonderfully by Henry Fonda. This is an hour and a half of gripping, engrossing drama. Prejudice, society classes are just some of the themes that run through the movie from start to finish. These characters are so well written that by the end of this movie you will feel as you must have encountered them at some point in your life. This realness makes 12 Angry Men even the more powerful and thought-provoking.When this film came out in 1957, Sidney Lumet main input was limited to TV shows and series. Working on 12 Angry Men was not that much different, Sidney Lumet did not use any sophisticated material or expensive locations, he relies here on the power of the screenplay and dialogue and the strength of an all star cast headed by the great Henry Fonda. Limitations that only add to the sheer power of 12 Angry Men.12 Angry Men is a must-see masterpiece, it is one of the best films of its time and genre, it will capture your attention and make you sit down and think long after you finish watching, it also rewards multiple viewing. Now if those qualities don't make a good movie, I don't know what does.</fullReview>

It is excellent and on a very high level for high school though our school always does AMAZING but challenging musicals and plays. am i the only one who thinks that we'll do a good job..? last year we did The House of Blue Leaves, a very challenging yet wonderful play, and the year before we did You Have the Right to Remain Dead.

		<fullReview>This is simply another comment in the long line of praise for 12 Angry Men, one of the greatest films of the 1950s and one of the greatest films ever made.It was part of a remarkable year in films, with Bridge on the River Kwai and Witness for the Prosecution.Sideny Lumet managed to piece together a perfect cast that gave not a single poor performance. The characters acting out the tensions of class and race that would soon explode in the streets in the late 50s and 60's, in a tiny jurors room. The passion and the rage feels like it is leaping off the screen, while the 12 men are trapped in the room until each demon is confronted.12 Angry Men is a movie about humanity, all bottled up, ready to explode. It carries around our weight, and shows how all of our experiences, all of our past never leaves us, and how truly difficult, if not impossible it is to be freed from it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great films don't need to be multi-millionaire productions to be remembered for the rest of the eternity by everyone who has seen them(or by everyone who has seen all the spoofs on TV). This movie is a major proof of this principle. "12 Angry Men" is theater on the big screen: one single scenery during most of the film (except at the end), real-time narrative, 12 characters involved: 1 is your favorite because he represents all the good ideals (honesty, loyalty, etcetera) and the philosophy of Descartes: doubt about everything they tell you. By the other hand, there's also the complete opposite of this hero: racist, closed, liar and cold-blooded. Simple basic theatrical characters, written to make people think. Why does this work in this film? Because the script is so well written that you don't care about anything else than being on Henry Fonda's side during the entire feature. And of course, trying to enter to the movie and shoot Lee J. Cobb's character. Usually, when I watch a movie, I try to pay attention to every detail: direction, writing, editing, photography, etcetera. But this one kept me on the edge of the seat the whole time, waiting for the final verdict to come. You don't even care if the film is in black an white or whether it has no music at all. Well, my final verdict: 1 charge for being entertaining through and through, another charge for being impeccably written and directed, and 2 extra charges for being very good acted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Absolute genius! Who would've ever thought of making a movie about such a thing. If only this was always the case! The acting was excellent. I could feel the tension and bubbling anger as the debates raged on. I felt a sigh of relief and faith in the human race return throughout the film. I felt like I was one of them and found it hard to hold back from yelling at some of them, and you still never find out the real story!This is one of those films I could watch over and over again and all takes place in small physical space but mentally vast world. It shows that one must use all senses of self to come to any conclusion and a human life is not one to be played with. It reminded me of Malta (where I live) and the everyday encounters with the Maltese. People are hot-headed and too quick to pass their judgements. I can't say they are wrong or right without knowing the facts, but I think many are loud-mouthed and don't take the time to think. I think everyone should be made to watch this film to show that your own prejudice does not make you right... I don't know if this can be considered a spoiler or not, but I will mark it so, just in case. I haven't really described characters or the plot but would be doing something I myself am criticising. That of assuming and I could be wrong! All I can say is, WOW! Utter brilliance and acting at its best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was fantastic! I was very sceptic when I sat down to watch this film: a black and white film, and 95% of it takes place in a room thats smaller then my bedroom. At first I thought it was just another overrated movie that isn't even half as good as the statistics show it. But thank god I was very wrong!I loved it!It makes you think. When a poor kid is on the verge of being sent to the chair, the jury wouldn't even go through the evidence again, they condemn the kid, but one of then opposes the others and gives the kid a chance.This was one of the most tense movies I saw and the intellectual value is also enormous.It surpasses most of the great detective movies we saw and it doesn't even need fireworks and gunshots to do so!Watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece ( spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never expected "12 Angry men" to be so great. A movie that takes place in one room and has no action what so ever doesn't normally spark my attention. I can't really pinpoint what it is about 12 Angry men that makes it so great, because all that this movie is is conversation between 12 men. I really got pulled into the conversation and just like the jurors the more time went by the more I went along with juror nr. 8. At the end of the movie I was even convinced that Henry's Fonda's character was right all along.However the main strength of the movie wasn't the subject of the conversation (guilty or not guilty)but the real underlying (daddy/ son)issues. Although the movie took place in one room I really got a good impression of most of the jurors. Some were more fleshed out than others, but there were a few instances that I was really impressed by the dialog and also the acting. A scene that comes to mind is the whole racist rampage that is uttered by jury nr 10 (from a very good Ed Begley)and the reaction of the other 11 men. I also really liked juror nr. 12, a man that wants to be liked so badly but hardly dares to give his two cents and changes his verdict from guilty, to not guilty, to guilty and then Not guilty again. Also the part where Juror nr 9 talks about the old man that "witnessed" the murder. He talked about the witness as this was an old man that wanted attention, because he was lonely and no-one ever listened to him. You could tell by the acting of Sweeny that the witness was exactly like him. Also Lee J. Cobb (Juror nr 3) has a few very impressive scenes. Especially the last one in which he breaks down comes to mind.I know that everybody talks about Fonda and although I think that he is a really good actor, I thought that the ones that really shown in this movie were Cobb and Begley. However everybody was good and at the end of this movie I was really glad I watched this masterpiece. There I said it. Not a word that I use easily when talking about movies. But according to me 12 Angry men is one of the best movie's of all time, a brilliant character study.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film had to have been a risk to the producers. It was a film set almost entirely in one room, I believe there were only three scenes that took place out of it. It is hard to keep the attention of an audience with such a limited set, but this limited set was made up for with excellent dialogue and an intriguing story. The story is a very intricate mystery set in a jury room. There are no flashbacks or anything to show how the crime happened, as would have been the easy route. Instead the script allows the characters to paint a picture of the crime in the minds of the viewers through outstanding dialogue. The dialogue never stops and the mystery only deepens. Through this dialogue the characters reveal themselves to be a microcosm of society. It would be a difficult thing to not see oneself in at least one of the twelve characters portrayed.The script isn't the only thing that deserves credit, the cast brought these characters to life. Without the genuine humanity that the actors brought with them no one would have cared about the responsibility placed on the shoulders of these twelve man as to whether a man should live or whether he should die.The camera work was also excellent. With such small confines it would seem difficult to come up with new shots, but the cameras explored just about every inch of the room.All in all this film is a great feel good movie about the American justice system and how it should really run. And how emotions can be the difference between one man living or dying. Although I haven't seen every movie out there I believe that this is one of the best films ever made and deserves every bit of the praise that it has received over the last fifty some odd years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellen Film that Uses Little to Say Much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 12 Angry Men, director Sidney Lumet makes so much out of so little. All of the men are wearing white shirts and ties, and when we first see them they all appear to be as simple as their clothes; they make small talk before casting the first vote, and we make the mistake of feeling like we understand them. But as Henry challenges their decisions, we learn that they each have a complex set of beliefs and motivations.We soon learn that evidence is not the only thing that's influencing many of the juror's decisions. Some vote guilty because they don't trust teenagers, some do it because they don't trust the young man's ethnicity, which is never made clear (but racial stereotyping certainly is), some do it because it just "feels" right, and some do it to escape the boredom or oppressive heat. These factors, together with the evidence, make it seem obvious that the man truly did murder his father, but Juror No. 8 (Henry Fonda) refuses to let him die without being absolutely certain that he is in fact guilty.Fonda's character reminds the men of two very important things that they either forgot or didn't take into consideration. The first is that a young man's life is in their hands, and whatever conclusion they come to is going to profoundly affect him. Although this is never discussed, it's possible that none of the jurors have ever had to make such an important decision and are not used to taking the kind of precaution such a situation requires (in fact, Juror No. 12 appears to treat it like a routine board meeting). Fonda is fully cognizant of the severity and tries to get the others to feel the same way. He also reminds them that a guilt verdict must be made free of any doubt. According to American law, a man is innocent until proved guilty, but the men consider it to be the other way around. It is through close examination of the evidence that the men are able to reach a verdict clear of any doubt or outside influences.Of course, the road from small talk to their final verdict is not a smooth one, and never has there been so much drama in one single room. Although Lumet keeps them in the same room, which has no interesting features, for the great majority of the film, he manages to pull of some subtle yet incredible cinematic effects. In the beginning, the camera is placed towards the ceiling and we are looking down at the jurors, a visual metaphor for our mistaken feeling that they are simple men. Later, it is placed toward the floor and we now look up at them and perhaps even marvel at their complexity. Lumet has challenged our conception of the average man, showing us through camera and dialogue that he or she can indeed be very intricate.Lumet also uses different lenses to great effect. As the film progresses, he uses lenses with longer focal lengths to make the room seem smaller. The tension is greatly increased as the walls seem to close in on the men, and this can be seen as different metaphor: as Juror 8 dismisses the stereotypes and prejudices, the only thing left is the evidence.12 Angry Men is a masterpiece and can be the subject of endless analysis. It can be viewed from a political and a sociological perspective, and would be great for a prospective cinematographer to study. If nothing else, the acting and dialogue are superb and make for an entertaining experience.</fullReview>

Even though mostly all of this movie except for like 5 minutes are filled in one room, which could be considered a very boring movie, but the take on each of the characters is so great, from there different backgrounds and personalities it makes this movie a true masterpiece and one to be seen again and again. Basically its about one man (Henry Fonda) who thinks one man's life is worth a little more time to considering instead of throwing in a guilty vote with the other 11 in a matter of seconds. From what starts as just lets talk about the trial begins to have a turning effect on the other 11 people, and what ensues is something so amazing!12 Angry Men (1957)Review: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twelve men sit around a table and talk for an hour and a half. There's your movie. Doesn't sound like much now does it? But 12 Angry Men turns out to be an exercise in wonderful simplicity. It is refreshing to know that in order to make a great movie you do not need a huge budget. No special effects are necessary. Wonderfully vibrant locations can be done without. In some cases all you need to make a great movie is a great story performed by great actors. And in 12 Angry Men that is what you get.12 Angry Men presents an exceedingly simple yet undeniably powerful story. We follow the jury deliberations in the New York City trial of a young man, a boy really, who is accused of killing his father. There is a very brief introductory scene in the courtroom as the judge presents the jury with its instructions. Apart from that scene and another very brief moment outdoors at the very end the entire film takes place within the confines of the jury room. And what goes on inside that room will fascinate. What seems to be, as one juror points out immediately, an open and shut case turns out to be much more complex. We will get to know each of the twelve members of this jury, men who come to this room from all different types of backgrounds, each with his own unique perspective. Some of the twelve will end up playing a bigger role than others but each man certainly plays his part in what unfolds.Initially eleven of the jurors vote to find the defendant guilty. There is only one holdout, Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda. Fonda's character may not be convinced of the boy's innocence but he feels the defendant is at least owed a fair deliberation to determine if there could in fact be reasonable doubt. And off the movie goes, with Juror #8 seeking to convince his fellow jurors that maybe this is not such an open and shut case after all. Suffice to say it will be quite difficult to get some of those in the room to change their mind. There are dramatic twists and turns along the way and in their interactions we learn a lot about each of these twelve men who bring their own prejudices and emotions to the proceedings. A few of the jurors stand out, most notably numbers 3 and 10 who are most adamant about the boy's guilt. Played by Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley respectively this pair threaten to overwhelm the proceedings at times with their explosive outbursts. The contrast between this pair's rantings and the calm, rational, reasoned arguments presented by Fonda's character are quite clear. Without a doubt Fonda is the star of the film but it is the opportunity he gets to play off of the other characters which really makes the film. Without the contributions of Cobb and Begley the whole thing would be rather mundane. And the other nine actors are not to be forgotten either. Each of the jurors is completely unique and every performer in the cast does a terrific job in breathing life into their character.When a movie consists almost entirely of a group of men sitting around talking there are certain to be a few lulls and sure enough this film has a few. But once the deliberations really hit their stride and the arguments are flying back and forth the film never fails to fascinate. It's an incredibly simple movie. In this case simplicity works wonderfully. Great performances, from Fonda of course but from each of the other eleven actors as well, make this simple story real edge of the seat stuff. What goes on inside the confines of that jury room is truly memorable. It's a wonderful film and a wonderful look inside the American justice system, serving as a reminder that even the most seemingly open and shut case may not be so clear cut after all.</fullReview>

While the acting was without doubt superb and the atmosphere was so well crafted you could almost smell the sweat coming off the 12 men and feel the heat and pressure of the approaching storm. I was Stunned with the stupidity of the plot, Anybody who has watch any courtroom drama will understand my point when I say everything that Henry Ford ask the other jury members to consider should have and would have been raised in the courtroom by even the most incompetent of legal teams, The old lady and her glasses, and the slow walking old man being the two most obvious but not the only point in question. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. Therefore only a 5 out of 10 rating from me, but a fair rating I think you will agree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable Doubt...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of 'Reasonable Doubt' is highly pervasive within the Judicial System; it is the concept that eventually decides the fates of the accused, and is the concept that is one of the most controversial. It's controversy lies in the fact that it is purely subjective, and dependent on the individuals that comprise the jury. The notion of Reasonable Doubt has no one definition, yet it is almost universally known. In 12 ANGRY MEN, Sidney Lumet successfully gives the viewer an idea of how this concept comes into play in a trial.It is worth noting that while this may be one of the best courtroom movies of all time, it doesn't in fact occur in the actual courtroom; all but 3 or 4 minutes of this Motion Picture is spent in the confines of a Jury Room, where the verdict is hotly debated. Lumet does well to present the Room as a sort of confinement from which there is no escape until a unanimous verdict is decided. As the film progresses, the sense of urgency and claustrophobia sets in, and the tension becomes increasingly high. The first technique Lumet used was to employ the locked door. The second was to cue the rain, which gives the feeling that even the outdoors are 'inaccessible' and that only the Room exists. The third technique may be missed by less astute viewers; Lumet switches his scope from wide to narrow to close-up during the movie, which adds to the claustrophobic feeling mentioned earlier.The acting is top-notch, as required by any good character study. All 12 men have been developed to some appreciable extent, but the key players have been developed to a comprehensive level given the film's ~95 minute run-time. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the 'hesitant' juror, but to me Lee J. Cobb outshines him in almost every scene (save the opening scenes).Another aspect of the film worth mentioning is the Music (or lack thereof). This is another intentional ploy by Lumet to give the viewer a 'feel' of the Room. There is no Music in the Jury Room, so why should there be in this film? I agree that while a musical background score serves to enhance or capture the mood of the scene, sometimes the absence of the music (silence) speaks volumes, by allowing the viewer to concentrate fully on the scene(s). One of my favourite movies lacking in music is NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. Another brilliant score-less Motion Picture is CAST AWAY, where no music is used for the entire length of time that Tom Hanks is stranded.The screenplay is solid and intelligently sound. In fact the only thing that stopped this film from winning Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay was the excellent THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI. Had the movie been made a year or two earlier, it may well have won the esteemed accolades.I can see why this film ranks in IMDb's All-time Top 10. It is simply a brilliant Motion Picture that has wide appeal, and can be enjoyed and appreciated by many.4 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Will appear in my Top 200 at around 167 or so. Strongly recommended.</fullReview>

My excuse is that I am not American, and not a "die-hard" classic films fan. That being said, I really prefer movies with intelligence and a good realistic plot.Now the movie itself... I was sitting 1,5 hours captivated by a black/white feature all taking place in one room with just talking...The reason for this was the amazing acting by everyone involved. The characters really grab you, and you hang on every word. It is clear that these actors were "forced" to be more skillful, they had no special effects to cover their shortcomings.It was like watching a room full of Daniel Day Lewis' going full blast for 90 min... anyway, that's what I thought of it :)(and by the way, any remake of MUST cast DDL as that last, angry juror ;))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's directorial debut remains a tense, atmospheric (though slightly manipulative and stagy) courtroom thriller, in which the viewer never sees a trial and the only action is verbal. As he does in his later corruption commentaries such as Serpico or Q &amp; A, Lumet focuses on the lonely one-man battles of a protagonist whose ethics alienate him from the rest of jaded society. As the film opens, the seemingly open-and-shut trial of a young Puerto Rican accused of murdering his father with a knife has just concluded and the 12-man jury retires to their microscopic, sweltering quarters to decide the verdict. When the votes are counted, 11 men rule guilty, while one--played by Henry Fonda, again typecast as another liberal, truth-seeking hero--doubts the obvious. Stressing the idea of "reasonable doubt," Fonda slowly chips away at the jury, who represent a microcosm of white, male society--exposing the prejudices and preconceptions that directly influence the other jurors' snap judgments. The tight script by Reginald Rose (based on his own tele play) presents each juror vividly using detailed soliloquies, all which are expertly performed by the film's flawless cast. Still, it's Lumet's claustrophobic direction--all sweaty close-ups and cramped compositions within a one-room setting--that really transforms this contrived story into an explosive and compelling nail-biter.Starring: Martin Balsham, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Wardem. Director: Sidney Lumet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"12 Angry Men" is a consistently fascinating film, but one where it's conclusions don't hold up in a lot of modern-day democracies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked the observation that even juries can become suspicious of one another despite the fact that they're all working toward the same end, and since legal teams are all human they may still be subject to the same propensity to err as the rest of us. There were times however when I disagreed with the influences that brought about the verdict. One of those cornerstones is the notion of 'reasonable doubt'. Clearly this particular principal isn't applied as strenuously as the justice system says it ought to be in all cases that are heard today. My bet is that often these days verdicts are reached by the appeal of common consensus, and any apparent holes are ironed out by majority opinion instead of meriting closer inspection. As one juror says, you can use the counter-argument of "supposing it happened this way?!" for just about anything. If that is meant to be the clincher that makes adjudicators unsure, then almost nobody would be getting locked away even with lots of admissible evidence stacked up against them.Secondly, unlike on its first general release in 1957, the death penalty is no longer enforced in a heck of a lot of places. In a film where so much of the drama derives from a miscalculation in good faith being enough to condemn an innocent to death, the stakes are no longer quite so high in a lot of territories, which speaks well of the modern age. Now I'm not arguing that wrongful imprisonment is in any way some kind of a picnic, but when you have the facility of a seemingly endless appeals system that can be fully exploited by a canny lawyer, the intricacies of the justice system somehow don't seem quite so immediate or important anymore. We know that sentencing is no longer the final word, because we hear of judgements quashed and rulings overturned virtually every day.... and thirdly, does any ordinary member of the public nowadays really have the confidence to believe that a juror could be so observant to notice marks left by a pair of spectacles?! Many are probably on the verge of dozing off when testimonies are being heard, or at least they would only be listening to the account without having the alertness to take in every minute detail about the personage in front of them, as well. I would think that juries have fallen into a habit of working with details that are overtly given to them by officials, not scrutinising closely enough to allow for consideration of things that they happen to have noticed themselves.Whether or not such idealistic events are indeed credible in these times, "12 Angry Men" is unfailingly, rigorously intelligent in its deconstruction of deliberation. I only wish that in the real world we were without doubt certain to arrive at the proper outcome, so long as we made sure to follow all of the 'rules'...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's just say, Henry Fonda was a cream pie and Lee J. Cobb was a apple pie. Both taste good. Combine together with some cherry sauce and a nice strawberry float to wash it down, you have the perfectly combined meal for tea, even if it's only a simple meal. This is the best way to describe Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men. It's simple. Only three minutes of the movie was shot outside the sixteen by twenty-four 'jury room'. We expect the landscapes and the magnificent out-of-life sets and camera landscapes to grasp our awe. 12 Angry Men only has a small, dusty jury room to pull an audience. Believe me, it succeeds memorably.The story starts as we see an 18 year old teenager is accused of murder in the first degree. Twelve jurors are assigned to handle this case. Clearly, as we see no one cares about the case, except for juror #8. His actions and thoughts that spring alive in that room is what makes this offering a fruitful and simple lesson about a man and the decisions he has to make right.Lumet creates a ensemble cast out of thin air. 12 Angry Men is awesomely simple, touching, most of all funny. I see an even longer future ahead for this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"12 Angry Men" is about a jury of 12 men voting on a death sentence case. Eleven of the men see it as an open and shut case with a clear verdict of guilty. However, one of the men thinks there is reasonable doubt.The majority of the film takes place in the deliberation room with the 12 men discussing the case. Even though the film takes place mostly in this single room and is singularly focused on the 12 men discussing the case, the film is never tedious. On the contrary, while a lot of films have slower moments, this one is gripping from start to finish.Each of the 12 performances is strong and each of the 12 jurors' characters is well-developed and adds to the film. Henry Fonda is inspiring as the one man who believes there is cause for reasonable doubt. "12 Angry Men" is a triumph of minimalist filming and highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the all time classics! The story is about 12 jury members in a room for about 90 minutes (real time) to decide the open and shut case of a young boy of 18 years killing his father. There are 11 votes confirming guilty and 1 for not-guilty. The whole movie is about how the 12 votes finally reach 11 confirming non-guilty and 1 for guilty, until the last one too gives in to an anonymous verdict that the boy is not guilty of his father's murder.The movie was delicately presented. As audience we find that the case that was to be fought in the court-room was fought among the jurors. Each and every juror was aware of all the facts of the case and everyone was on the same page, except one ? Juror no. 8 (Henry Ford). The movie explores the value of one life on looking minutely at the known events and unfolding them in better light for audience to understand and know that what seems truth often is not ? if you look closely at it.The movie is shot in a single room that is hot, humid and sweaty ? and halfway through it starts raining outside. The enigma of the 12 jurors, the ding-dong dallying between guilty and not-guilty, the peeling of the case layer by layer with new discussions crossing personal experiences and relation to the case was fascinating to watch.Henry Ford acts with such anxiousness that you are bitten by his conviction of not-guilty the moment he speaks his doubts by saying ? I do not know, I am not sure. That starts the mastery roller-coaster to a finale that is hard to take the eyes off.The Director Sidney Lumet does a fantastic job in I think (most probably) converting this stage drama into big screen canvass with eminent 12 actors. All of them have acted poignantly well in their well written characters and mannerisms. One can see their upbringings while they talk and that is marvelous.Wonderful movie, normally I hesitate to give movies more than 8 stars, but for this I will give (Stars 8.25 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply astounding. It's incredible that basically just a one-scene movie could be so gripping and involving, but the fantastic script and terrific acting make it so. I'm glad they didn't show a re-enactment of the crime, or definitively say whether the kid was innocent or not, as the film's not really about the crime at all. It could be the best character study ever told, even though we know none of the character's names until the end (and then only two of them) nor what they're like outside of the jury room. The only weak spot I found among the ensemble was Juror #2, I just found him incredibly irritating and was surprised the other jurors - especially #3 - didn't rage at him at all. It's kinda idealistic, but still one of the greatest films ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the play in school before I watched the movie, and I liked the play so much that I rented the movie from the library. Considering that I was very excited to see it and had extremely high expectations, it's pretty amazing that there was no let-down whatsoever when I actually watched the movie.A teenager living in a slum is charged for the murder of his father, using a knife. Although Juror #8 convinces everyone by the end that the kid is innocent, there is tons of evidence stacked up against him. I was easily convinced that the kid was innocent, but I know several people who watched the movie from start to finish and still thought he was guilty. I love the movie and consider it one of my top five favorite movies, but I think it's a little unrealistic. I don't understand how Juror #3, who personally wants the kid to die, and Juror #10, who discriminates against slum people by nature, could be swayed to vote not guilty, since even my parents and some people in my English class couldn't be swayed.Despite that, I really love this movie. I think it's incredible that people can be so interested in a movie that takes place in one room and where you don't know the characters names. It just shows how good the script and acting was.10/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the film, just one complaint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still voted this movie a 10/10, but I have one complaint. I feel that many of the points that Juror #8 made should have already been brought up by the defendant's lawyer. Yes Fonda makes the point that the lawyer was appointed to the case and doesn't have much interest in it, but I still find many of the omissions the lawyer made were far fetched. I have never studied law, and I already came to many of the same conclusions that juror #8 did before he brought them up. Perhaps this is because I have grown up watching a number of movies with courtroom scenes in them, many of which stole techniques used in this film in their own movies. The noise from the train, the time to walk through the apartment and the glasses were all very obvious contradictions to the facts given. However, if these facts were already presented in movie prior to juror deliberation, it wouldn't have made much of a movie! Just an observation I made, does anyone else agree/disagree?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, intriguing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Twelve Angry Men" is a simple movie in that it's setting is a single, solitary jury room and it's "excitement" lies in the intriguing relationships and dialog between jurors during deliberation. What could be more simple than that? The trick to this movie is the powerful storyline and the absolutely magnificent acting. That said, "Twelve Angry Men" needs no special effects, mind-boggling action scenes or a beautiful actress co-star - instead, it relies on good, old fashioned movie making for it's intrigue. In may ways, "The Breakfast Club" reminds me of this movie (without the courtroom, but with a school library instead). Both movies make statements about society's biases and inequalities while exploring each character's "stand" on the matters at hand. At the end of both movies, all characters involved understand each other a little bit better. If you like powerful story lines and brilliant acting, this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering the age of this film, and that it is filmed mainly in one room, I think it is amazing that it still manages to keep you gripped from start to finish. There are no special effects, no camera trickery, just a solid script expertly deployed by a legendary cast. The fantastic camera angles mean that you almost feel the sweat and the tension even though its in black and white and was made nearly 50 yrs ago!! My favourite scene is when the men are discussing how rare the murder weapon is by saying, "a knife like that could only be one of a kind!". Then Henry Fonda proceeds to pull an identical knife out of his pocket, flicks the blade out and stabs it into the table!!.......this film is proof that they don't make 'em like they used to!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The greatness of this film is in the intelligent debate of logically trying to decide if a man is guilty or innocent. What takes place in this film transcends human thought. It follows a very precise and complex line of thought moving from one persons subconscious to the next analyzing the possibilities through countless view points. What makes this film stand out is the lack of information and the pure joy of examining the evidence ourselves and using the deductions by our 12 men to move with them toward their own conclusion. All people can identify with one individual or another in this film. It pulls us in, making us think about the possibilities. We argue ourselves really, right along with each juror until the very end. And wonderfully, we are left feeling vindicated. A classic for the ages!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An outstanding courtroom drama thriller which benefits greatly from tight direction, a literate script and superb acting from a first-rate cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teenage Puerto Rican boy from the slums is on trial for allegedly murdering his own father. Eleven of the twelve jurors are certain that he's guilty, but one token odd man out dissenting juror (beautifully played with subtle understatement by Henry Fonda) has his doubts. The juror gets everyone else to question their motives and more heavily scrutinize every last minute detail of the seemingly cut and dried case.Director Sidney Lumet, working from Reginald Rose's smart, literate and incisive script, further aided by Boris Kaufman's sharp black and white cinematography and Kenyon Hopkins' spare, unobtrusive score, works wonders with the simple premise, placing a keen and intimate emphasis on the exceptionally colorful and distinctive dozen characters. The uniformly marvelous acting from a bang-up ensemble cast qualifies as a substantial sterling asset: Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are both terrific as radically opposing guys who are at continual loggerheads with each other while Ed Begley (incredibly fearless as a despicable racist jerk), Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney (simply lovely as the old man), George Voskovec, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, John Fiedler, Robert Webber, E.G. Marshall and the criminally underrated Edward Binns all lend top-drawer support in equally meaty roles. The twelve individual jurors serve as a very revealing and insightful microcosm of our justice system in particular and our society in general, representing all the various flaws, strengths and quirks of our culture which range from blithe indifference (Warden's boorish baseball fan, Webber's slick advertising executive) to cold pragmatism (Marshall's prissy intellectual) to meek passivity (Fiedler's soft-spoken wimp) to foul prejudice (Begley's unforgettably odious hatemonger, Cobb's seething ball of roaring rage and resentment) to true blue responsible patriotism (Fonda's calm voice of liberal reason, Sweeney's supportive old man, Voskovec's proud adopted American immigrant). Kaufman's gorgeously crisp photography tremendously heightens the considerable tension, palpably evoking a sweaty, uncomfortable and claustrophobic sweltering hot atmosphere that's as gripping as it is convincing. In the hands of a lesser cast and director the story could have been flat and stagy. But Lumet's tight direction and the seamless ensemble acting from an amazing cast effortlessly blend together to create a crackling sense of absorbing drama and rip-snorting energy that's constantly engrossing and exciting throughout. An undeniable classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great directing supports strong performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie based mostly in the necessity for repetition and seeing both sides of the issue, it does not, like it would seem, make one tired of hearing the phrase "beyond a reasonable doubt." This is an issue of objectivity, the idea that has taken centuries of philosophers to finally understand doesn't exist in a subjective standpoint. I can say nothing about this film that isn't repeated, with full clarity, in the dialog under many different contexts. They hold a man's life in their hands, and in the process are going to learn a lot about what must go into the proof.To be a bit honest, and a little hesitant, I must say that a lot of it strikes me as pretty liberal. I think this film is strongest when it doesn't get into politics, so the constant repetition of the phrase "bleeding heart" kind of gets to me. However, it's something of a necessity, because one of the things that these characters have to overcome is personal politics and prejudice to figure out where exactly to take a stand and where to leave be. And as a product of its time, it's immensely profound.What I like most about it is that it is not a criticism of the American system, it's actually in full support of it. If it criticizes anything, it criticizes the people who take it aloofly and don't understand the power they hold when they operate within said system. Responsibility is something I personally find quite lacking currently, and it's nice to see a movie expound the virtues of personal responsibility towards lawful conduct. This does not mean falling into hegemonic status quo, for that would mean the boy dies because nobody takes the time to question him. This means making sure you understand what you know and what you can't know.Beyond the writing itself, the directing and the acting really shine. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera shows the audience EXACTLY what it needs to know when it needs to know it. It's art to be beheld. Also, all of the actors maintain their characters and the characters' mood swings amazingly, making it fluid and above all, very real.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some films that are acknowledged classics of one degree or another. Whether it be a technical aspect such as cinematography or something less tangible such as emotional content or a gripping narrative, some stand out. 'Twelve Angry Men' is one such film, mostly noted for the amazing acting performances from a large cast in one room. They have few props and one main set. The stage for twelve actors to show their stuff. And show it they do.This film works as a pure stage play on the screen. All twelve actors step up to the plate. The writing is immaculate making the complex inter-relationships between the twelve work believably and never letting the pace slacken. It's tense and taut. The points being made aren't always subtle, but they're never hammered home. Keeping twelve characters involved in a story while keeping it moving along is a tough task for a writer. All of them want to have their say so you don't forget them, all of them have to show what their character is, yet none of them must be allowed to dominate. Reginald Rose deserves immense plaudits for what he achieved here.There is a political message here. To some it may be obvious, to others it may be unpalatable. You may call it propaganda, yet unlike a lot of more modern propagandists, this doesn't solely preach to the converted. This is one to think on for everyone. It's important that even at the end, the viewer doesn't know what really happened the night of the crime. Did they save an innocent from the chair or did they let a killer walk free? It asks questions, says where its loyalties lie but doesn't claim that the issues are black and white. A truly unusual standpoint and one I would welcome more of in film.Perhaps one of the notable aspects that isn't much commented on about 'Twelve Angry Men' is the oddly un-filmic qualities it has. As previously mentioned it moves like a stageplay rather than screenplay. The look is reminiscent of a TV production including the sans-serif credits underneath the actors faces, and the simple studio set. This hasn't prevented its strengths propelling it into a slot as one of the best and best loved movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great actors; somewhat preachy script; still worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't repeat the details of the plot as many comments above summarize the plot and even the 12 jurors in depth...Briefly, Fonda's character challenges the rest of the 12 man jury to take time to reexamine the evidence before they send a very young man to the mandatory death sentence. A fair challenge. Even tho the case (as one juror argues ) seem so "open and shut".Here, the best thing about the film (to me) is the use of logic. Why? As the 12 men examine each bit of proof, they discover several possible logical flaws or false assumptions. Sound too dry? Not the way it is presented.My criticism is that Fonda's character is just too perfect, too right and (for most of the movie) too free from perspiration, unlike the rest in that hot jury room. Fonda early questions some jurors as to whether there's any possibility for error. If he said "It's possible" one more time, I was going to scream. (I remember various evil characters getting off on slim technicalities...! ) But fortunately, his questioning leads others to question evidence and to find REAL doubt that the testimony, etc. is valid.Their use of logic to pick out the evidentiary flaws is fascinating. Thus, this is still an excellent movie worth watching!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic study of the psychology of a jury in a murder trial. Exciting movie with a great cast, including Henry Fonda who also produced the film, Lee J. Cobb (perhaps his best performance ever?) and Martin Balsam as the weak but earnest chairman. But they are all great. John Fiedler as a perplexed juror, E.G.Marshall as the somewhat reserved man with the glasses, Ed Begley who plays the bigot and off course Jack Warden as the working class guy who just want to get it over with so he can go and watch a baseball game. Although the characters in some cases are somewhat on the brink of being caricatures, the movie is so nerve-racking and you get so involved n the drama and tension of the questions involving right or wrong, good or bad, true or false, that you are just compelled to the max with this film.

I suppose it's all been said already about this film....My number 2 favorite Film ever, after The Good, bad the ugly. Lee J Cobb I suppose was the next most important character and it seemed like a battle between him and Fonda. I think Fonda's coolest and classiest part was when he showed that even after Cobb had threatened to kill him and all the hostility Cobb showed him throughout, he still offered Cobbs coat at the end. He didn't bear a grudge, cool right to the end. Really this film was about how people from different back rounds and professions interact when placed on an equal footing.</fullReview>

Second, it requires great acting...and that is exactly what it has.Certainly one of Fonda's best, 12 Angry Men earned every single one of its Oscar Nominations.As this film is nearing fifty years old, it is slipping away from current audiences -- which is truly unfortunate.

		<fullReview>Of course Twelve Angry Men is about the legal system in the US. Of course it is considered "artsy" in part since it is low budget and filmed in black and white.But above all it is cinema that has the three basic ingredients of what makes a great movie: a good screenplay, great actors and impeccable photography. Cinema started as filmed theater and IMHO any film should be aware of its origins. As soon as a movie denies its origins totally and turnes into a computer generated roller coaster ride, I don't like it.I don't say all films should play in just one room. But the "real time" feel should be explored much more often in movies. Hitchcock did it with "Rope" and I think he did it excellently. Twelve Angry Men is based upon a television play. These were transmitted live (!!!) back in the 1950s because the video tape didn't exist back then - so we can speak of theater. The movie itself has very much the same feel to it. I like the interactiveness between the actors and the "modern theater performance" used back then. In recent movies we can see all too often an actor caring about his/her facial expressions when filmed and caring about the voice at the studio dubbing stage. In this film everything what you see and what you hear looks 100% natural. I am especially overwhelmed by the values transmitted by the main characters. Honest Hank (Henry Fonda) is of course the most likeable character. E.G. Marshall stands out as well. But it's the great, late Lee J. Cobb who runs away with the movie in his final scene. Very powerful. Watch it!One of the finest movies ever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, I remember being a kid watching 12 Angry Men on TV for the first time. I was blown away, 13 years old and seeing Henry Fonda for the first time. Nah, forget that, I was seeing every one of these 12 actors for the first time. This was also the first film I watched by Sidney Lumet.I didn't even know who these guys were until they crawled onto my screen and began rattling my brain. This story truly takes you deeper than almost any other story, the acting performances here are absolutely wonderful and seeing as you're getting not one or two memorable performances but TWELVE, this is one special movie.Sure, it's black'n'white. Sure, the sound isn't as good in old movies as it is nowadays. But you know what? If you do not like this movie you do not like movies at all. Period.It's the way Henry Fonda manages to be completely invisible, despite being the lead character, allowing the rest of the cast to completely shine when they're called upon!It's the way the camera is not watching these twelve angry men from a distance, rather that it is AMONGST them, giving you the feeling that you are pretty much the 13th juror. Which prompts you to make up your own feelings on the given issue of the story as well as getting you so aroused and hot-blooded about the proceedings that you feel as if it were you on trial! Never before (or after) has a movie ever inspired such interaction on my behalf as a watcher...It's the way the jurors remain anonymous until after they've reached a verdict and emerged from the room, each going their separate ways. I never would have thought a simple line like, "what's your name?" could possibly have such a strong effect on me in a film. But, as with most other things about this movie, seeing is believing.But, enough of the hype already. There's a reason Sidney Lumet is legendary, as well as Henry Fonda, Lee J Cobb and all the rest! There's a reason this movie is on every film-educated man's Top-whatever list of favorites. There's a reason it is such a praised piece.Haven't seen it? Then you're in for a treat...one of the very best movies ever, and I say that without hesitating.5/5 (same as the re-make)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like "Sunset Blvd," "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" and many other B &amp; W classics, this is one film that could NOT have been made in color -- at least not with the same effect.In fact, it is unlikely that Hollywood would even TRY to stage a movie today in a locked room with 12 individuals spending 2-3 hours together to hash out a trial verdict. Yet Sidney Lumet managed to take this simple plot and produce an enduring and endearing movie for the ages.Henry Fonda, Jack Klugman and great veteran character actors like Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam &amp; E.G. Marshall make a wonderful array of living, breathing Everyman jurors. (And pipsqueak John Fielder -- Mr. Peterson on "The Bob Newhart Show" -- is an excellent foil to the bullying Cobb and Begley when he builds up his nerve!) The pace is steady and gradually builds to a climax without any of the Hollywoodish melodrama some 1940s &amp; 1950s films had.Maybe the best thing about the film is the wonderful black &amp; white cinematography. Some of the close-ups of Fonda &amp; especially the old man (Juror # 9) are downright eerie.This is the kind of film and the type of performance that made Fonda what he was. This is a memorable triumph of mid-20th century Hollywood.</fullReview>

Saw again in 2005 n then again few days back on a DVD. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances, fantastic dialogues and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome. All the actors really got into the skin of the character n they portrayed their moods n emotions very well. Henry Fonda (The grapes of wrath, Once upon a time in the west, The longest day) n Lee J.

		<fullReview>This movie accomplishes something in the fact that the whole drama in the movie takes place in a courtroom.The story is simple but told in an interesting way. For example, the way the professions of the characters are disclosed at different intervals during the conversation.It feels as if the movie is shot in real time. The performances are great. The day is hot,which adds to the intensity and frustration of the drama in it's own way. The movie is not about right or wrong. The viewer is never told whether the boy actually killed his father or not. That is for the viewer to decide. But it definitely raises some questions on the legal system. The term 'reasonable doubt' is ambiguous. We are not shown any legal discussions in the court. While giving judgement, the judge himself seems bored yet claims the case to be complex. Juror no. 3 in the starting claims to 'almost fell asleep' during the trial while another feels 'lucky' to get a murder case, as other cases might be boring. Yet all these people except juror no. 8(Henry Fonda) vote the boy as guilty without giving a second thought. While some jurors are open to ideas and are 'reasonable', other have preconceived notions and are biased due to their personal experiences( juror no. 3 or 10).The vote which begins from 11 to 1 against the boy gradually shifts to 12 to none in favour of the boy. This itself is unsettling. The fate of a man's life is left in the hands of 12 people, who completely change their decisions in a couple of hours. The movie has been written brilliantly and beautifully performed,giving the viewers an engaging experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best fims of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everyone has already explained why this is such a good film. It is a travesty that it never got an Oscar bu that is a reflection more on the Oscars than the film itself. Henry Fonda is outstanding in this as is Lee J Cobb, but really all the actors were very well cast. Don't make the mistake of confusing this with the colour remake, although good it does not match up to this original and best version. For me the best bits are the part where Jack Klugman's character produces the knife ( although this could never have happened in a real Jury it is stil dramatic ) and then there is the part where Lee J Cobb breaks down while looking at a picture of his son. This film will take you on an emotional roller-coaster ride for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am baffled as to how this film didn't make it on the AFI list of the top 100 movies of the last century. It's great on every level -- the cast is magnificent, and the script and direction are also wonderful. A great showcase, in fact, for great acting and writing, since it's basically twelve people locked in a room, where they talk, persuade and argue about a man's life. Henry Fonda is terrific as the initial holdout, but it's the way that the others come around to his point of view that makes this such a fascinating drama. I won't focus on specific performances because the entire cast was so stellar. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched twelve angry men the other day and was surprised at how good of a movie it was. The acting was great and they had a good cast. Id have to say that my favorite was Fonda.The movie was about an 18yr old kid who supposedly killed his father. When the jury went to discuss the case all the jury except one man Fonda, Believed he was guilty. For many reasons they believed he was guilty like because he was from a slum. There was also a man who no matter what anyone said would not admit that the boy was not guilty Lee.J Cobb. So Cobb and Fonda were basically rivals in the film. Through out the movie Fonda convinces everyone that the boy is not guilty (even Cobb at the end).I really enjoyed this film I really recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The hope of democracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As brilliant a presentation of the arts of logic and conversation in a situation of severe stress as one can imagine. The dialog is razor sharp, the characters well-drawn, and director Lumet, cameraman Kaufman and editor Lerner have worked miracles with a cramped space that doesn't lose any sense of claustrophobia in the process. Although one can certainly take the message as having to do with inherent problems in having a death penalty as a rule of law, there is a deeper message still: does not justice, in a democratic society, demand of us to think clearly? to uncover and expunge our individual prejudices? to confront the enormous weight of responsibility as coolly and objectively as possible? If the answers to those questions must come up negative, then democracy is a false hope and we should abandon it and give ourselves over to the nearest group of elitists who can guaranty us bread and circuses.Right now, with a right-wing junta in power in Washington, many Americans seem satisfied with such a possible result; they seem to forget that the result would be the same under a left-wing junta as well. The hope of democracy is that government is neither left nor right, but every day, that it allows all of us some share in shaping our own destinies personally and collectively."12 angry men" is thus a film filled with hope - hope for ourselves, each as individuals, but also hope for our future, our children and the possibilities they represent.If this hope is false, it is still certainly preferable to any of the lies spewed forth by the American media today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The jury has reached a verdict</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This near perfect, post-courtroom exploration of the twelve jurors who were to decide one boy's fate is every bit deserving as accolades would suggest. A shot to my dying cinematic heart, this film's staggering focus took an involving legal story and brilliantly merged it with a complex and diverse character study, making 12 Angry Men one the most engaging ensemble works of American history. Packed almost entirely into one plain meeting room for deliberation, the simmering screenplay should keep anyone glued to their screen into the very last frame; tension like this is simply unavailable these days. Equally effective as a plot-deducing mystery and gripping morality play, the genius behind this legendary feature lies in a seamless combination of those two particularly strong traits.Delivering the film's highest ideals from page is an absolutely flawless group of men who are highly synergistic on top of their incredible individual takes. Though Henry Fonda will be remembered as the central character, the level of professionalism coming from the remaining 11 demands complete attention. Therefore singling anyone out would be a lost cause, except for studying the intricacies of any of the individually sublime roles. Some have characterizations that dwarf others, many take up less screen time then a few key players, but all in all the respect and generosity given to manifest each different personality is astounding and echoes the most transcendent aspects of dramatic form as we watch the mesmerizing layers of human consciousness become peeled away.Essentially it is that timeless and eloquent capturing of a man's mind on the brink of justice that will keep 12 Angry Men forever fresh in our hearts. A historical directing debut for Sidney Lumet proved that his years working in television were not in vain. Exquisitley shot, even many technical setbacks will do nothing to distract from this commanding work. From start to finish, the film is testament to singular creative glory, only slightly betrayed by an overplayed cathartic climax.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest-ever Legal Drama and One of the Greatest Films of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a courtroom drama with a difference; we see nothing of the actual trial except the end of the judge's summing up. We only get a brief glimpse of the defendant, a young man accused of stabbing to death his abusive father. We do not see the lawyers or any of the witnesses. The action is confined to the jury room after the trial has finished. At first, eleven jurors believe that the defendant is guilty but one, played by Henry Fonda, has doubts, and tries to convince his colleagues that the case has not been proved beyond reasonable doubt.The remarkable thing about this film is that each of the twelve jurymen (all are male) emerges as an individual in his own right. Thanks are due to Vukodlak whose helpful review accurately summarises their characters. The jurors are referred to by their jury numbers, not their names, although we discover the surnames of Henry Fonda's character Number 8 (Davis) and of his colleague Number 9 (McCardle) right at the end. Number 8 is the key character. At first he is somewhat hesitant in his views. He is not convinced of the boy's innocence, and perhaps, at first, not even of the reasonable doubt about his guilt that would justify bringing in a "not guilty" verdict. He is, however, unwilling to condemn a young man to the electric chair without close consideration of all the issues, and suggests that the jury should take its time to talk the matter over. As they do, each piece of evidence is subjected to close scrutiny, the reliability of witnesses is cast into doubt, and holes start to emerge in what had previously seemed a watertight prosecution case. One by one the more conscientious members of the jury, with one exception, start to come over to Number 8's point of view.Four other jurors play particularly important parts in the drama. Number 7, played by Jack Warden, is the least conscientious of all. He is not worried in the least about the defendant's guilt or innocence. He has tickets for a baseball game that evening and wants to reach a verdict as quickly as possible so that he does not miss the match. At first he votes to find the defendant guilty, but when he sees how things are going he abruptly changes his vote to not guilty in order to get home more quickly. (He is deservedly rebuked by Number 11, a painstaking, foreign-born watchmaker).Number 4, played by E. G. Marshall, is the exception mentioned above, the one juror who approaches his duties conscientiously but who nevertheless holds out for a guilty verdict almost to the very end. He is a stockbroker by profession, clearly something of an intellectual. He approaches the case calmly, logically and methodically, weighing every piece of evidence. The problem is that his approach takes no account of the emotions involved and leaves no room for doubt. As one of the other jurors says, weighing up evidence is not a precise science, but Number 4 treats it as though it is. When convinced by Number 8's arguments, however, he concedes with good grace that there is now reasonable doubt in his mind and changes his vote to not guilty.Number 10 and Number 3, although Number 4's allies, are completely different in their approach to the case. Whereas he approaches it with too much scientific detachment, they approach it with too much passion and prejudice. Number 10, played by Ed Begley, is prejudiced against the young man because of his social background. In a memorable scene he gives vent to his feelings in a long rant about "those people"; this could mean slum dwellers in general or could be a racist diatribe. (The defendant's ethnicity is never precisely established). One by one the other jurors, even those who have previously supported him, turn their backs on him. Number 3 is as violent in his feelings as Number 10, but his hatred of the young man arises less from social or racial prejudice than from his resentment of his own son, from whom he is estranged.All of the parts are very well played, including the calm, authoritative Fonda. The best, however, was Lee J Cobb as Number 3. Whereas Begley's character is simply contemptible, Cobb's is, in a way, pitiable. He is full of anger, but we see that his anger arises out of the anguish caused by his failed relationship with his own son. This is, in fact, one of those rare films where everything works perfectly- the script, the acting and Sidney Lumet's direction which emphasises the claustrophobic atmosphere of the jury room and the tension of the plot. (Lumet is one of a select band of directors who have made a masterpiece with their first film). The result is a true classic of the cinema, the greatest-ever legal drama and one of the greatest films of all time. It did not do well at the Oscars, but that is because it had the misfortune to come out in the same year as another great film, "Bridge on the River Kwai".Unlike some, I did not see the film as reflecting a preference for liberal political values over conservative ones; a belief in the importance of the presumption of innocence is not confined to liberals. Also, I did not see it necessarily as a vindication of the jury system. At the end of the film we feel a sense of relief that a possible miscarriage of justice has been averted, but we are also left with an uneasy feeling that, in real life, innocent people may have been convicted because their juries contained too many Wardens, Cobbs or Begleys and not enough Fondas. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men (1957) **** (out of 4) A poor slum kid is on trial for the murder of his father and it's up to one juror (Henry Fonda) to try and convince the other's that he's not guilty. Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Bins, Jack Warden, Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber are the twelve jurors and it's going to be hard trying to find a film with as much great acting as what we see here. I really think this is one of the greatest screenplays to be written for any movie since the movie only runs 96-minutes and we've got all the evidence to listen to and watch them discuss it but we also get to know each one of them personally with just a few remarks, which tells us everything about them. Another important aspect is the direction by Lumet, which might be the best of his career, which is certainly saying a lot considering how many great films he has made over the years. There's nothing getting blown up here and there are no gunshots but this film, in terms of drama and suspense, can rival any action movie ever made for those edge of your seat thrills. The cinematography is also top-notch as the camera just floats around the juror's room picking up pieces of the action. What I love most about movies is when you get great actors going at each other in a great screenplay and I can't think of a movie that does this better than this one right here. There is so much excitement as the men, who all believe they are right, slowly fight and tear away at one another until the thrilling end. All of the performances are wonderful and what better than having a mild Fonda going up against the anger of Cobb. The final sequence is brilliantly handled and doesn't come off as forced or silly. On the top this is certainly a courtroom drama but underneath the film plays more like a lesson of this countries legal Constitution and why it is so great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men (1957) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For viewers out there who don't like "old movies" or "black and white," please give this gem a try. I think you'll find it completely engrossing. It's a masterful piece of work, expertly directed by Sidney Lumet and contains no sex, explosions or special effects, not even a single female (it's still worth it!). Flawlessly acted by fine performers: Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, etc. The simple setup involves only 12 jurors in a little juror's room, nothing else. It's the power of the story and the interaction between the varied personalities of these men that keeps you riveted. It's why less can be more when it's done well.SPOILERS AHEAD:It's perfect symmetry the way these men each have a personality all his own: the liberal, the bigot, the wise man, the jerk, the haunted man, the immigrant, the hard worker, the know-it-all, etc.... During the course of this film we get to know them all, maybe can identify with one or two. There's an air of Political Correctness which tends to favor the liberal side, painting the "guilty" voters as racists, loudmouthes with personal agendas, or ignorant sports fans. It's because of this (and more objections) that I'm hesitant to award the movie a complete 4-star rating. It's a "great" film, but I just cannot call it "excellent" when I can't seem to side with Fonda's noble cause. From the moment we see Fonda (Juror 8) in angelic white, he's a "do-gooder". He "says" that he does not really know if the young defendant is innocent of killing his father, but his facial expressions and sighs of relief tell me he had his mind made up to free this boy all along. Fonda even goes out of his way to buy a knife - BREAKING THE LAW IN DOING SO - just to plead innocence for the kid. He constantly asks jurors: "isn't this possible?" but the same could be asked by other jurors and their ideas. Our justice system is a scary mess. because I believe ANY murder case can have "reasonable doubts" raised in them, if someone wants them to. So no witnesses are ever to be considered reliable? Luckily for the kid here, one of the jurors wearing glasses scratched his nose, so there's an instant case for "reasonable doubt" because a juror recalls that a female witness also rubbed her nose (maybe she wore glasses). There is a lonely old juror who observes that an elderly witness seemed lonely and ashamed. So this juror "relates" to him and decides that the old witness may have wanted to "appear important" and so maybe his testimony was unreliable! A truly guilty man could get released by this! Whenever Fonda wants something to fit his agenda for "not guilty," he believes the old witness' every word; when it won't help his cause, he dismisses his feeble testimony! There's a crude re-enactment where Fonda hobbles around to determine if the old witness was able to get to his door in 15 seconds as he testified - it actually takes 41 seconds - but is this as conclusive as Fonda claims? Maybe the man was mistaken when he said "15 seconds"; maybe the man said "50" . Fonda doesn't care; this is one of those times he'll trust the man's testimony if it proves his agenda! He sure works awful hard to ignore anything the other jurors suggest. The boy claims he was at the movies when the murder was committed, yet one hour later cannot recall anything about the films he watched. How does Fonda chip away at this evidence? He tests juror E. G. Marshall by asking him if HE recalls what HE did last night. When Marshall easily replies, Fonda goes back to the night before. Marshall still doesn't miss a beat, so Fonda goes back a couple more days (why doesn't he just go back three years?) until he's back to a week. Naturally, Marshall eventually can no longer remember, so a "point" is supposedly made (um, not really). Is Fonda correct that some of his points are feasible? Yes - but so are the others'. "Juror 8" won't give up until the kid's life is spared, it seems. Even when the "guilty" voters suggest to "have a hung jury," Fonda will not accept. It's not good enough for him. Here's the key to me that Fonda's not interested in a "fair verdict": Jack Warden votes "not guilty" with all the others, just because he doesn't care and wants to get out. If Fonda was so self-righteous, he should have gracefully said: "11 of us have now voted 'Not Guilty'. But I cannot accept the 12th vote, as this man is only voting for whatever verdict will let him get out of here". But Fonda will take it -- the boy's free, even if he had to get one "fake" vote to achieve it.We have to give the benefit of the doubt. I don't want an innocent man executed. But nor do I want guilty predators freed because a witness "had lines on her nose," or "maybe that witness lied to feel important." When Fonda says "this isn't a game!", it seems to me the jury system IS a game - who can think of a twist the fastest, who has the best lawyer. I think Fonda plays a "game" very well and won - even if society lost. Because when he marches out of court at the end, thinking he's a hero, I can't help thinking he let a killer fall through the cracks to satisfy his own conscience. Still, I wish I could side with him. I think this is a more fulfilling film for those who do, and I believe we're supposed to. Either way, this is a very powerful piece of cinema. That's the main thing.***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a movie that takes place in one hot, smoke-filled, sweaty room, at a time when men felt naked if they took their jacket and tie off. 11 come into the room wanting to fry the defendant; one man starts pointing out all the ambiguous testimony. He nobly upholds the concept of "reasonable doubt." Guess who triumphs?The movie is remarkable. Sidney Lumet was even then a master filmmaker. The claustrophobia is palpable, but the camera is fluid enough to give you every angle on the closed, locked room, and every emotion and bead of sweat on the men trapped there.The story, however, presents easy heroes and villains: the everyman just trying to make sure justice is done; the bigot who can't keep his opinions to himself; the noble immigrant. Cliches all, even back in 1957.Yet, the cast is so real. These are real, sweaty, down-to-earth actors putting on the performances of their lives. You always feel like you are in there with them, following the logic, thinking about whether the evidence presented is believable. It's searing, yet dopey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet's Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lumet's staggering courtroom drama 12 Angry Men mostly takes place in the cramped jury room where a dozen "men with ties" decide the fate of Puerto Rican teenager accused of murdering his abusive father. Yet the prologue to their civic imprisonment, which takes place beyond these confined walls, sets the stage for Lumet's overarching concerns about the contradictions of the democratic process. After a few short establishing shots where men, women, and children traverse the plaza steps and interior hallways of the court building, Lumet and director of photography Boris Kaufman focus on a particular door, where one of many cases currently in motion is just about to reach critical mass. The legal arguments have subsided, leaving the courtroom mostly silent and the fate of the accused in the hands of the aforementioned 12 white men. Before their dismissal, the judge looks down at the group and bequeaths them to "separate the fact from the fancy." Despite his harsh tone, we quickly realize only one of them takes this statement seriously.That man is Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), the lone dissenting voice during the jury's disturbingly jovial initial vote to convict the boy of first- degree murder, which would send him to the electric chair. Juror 8 has questions, a lot of them that he wants to discuss further, much to the chagrin of his fellow jurors. "There's always one," yells sarcastic Juror 10 (Ed Begley), who, like many of his fellow deliberators, desires a quick conviction so that they can all get back to their regular lives. In the minds of the other 11 men, the evidence is overwhelming in favor of the prosecution, so why even bother with debate. But Juror 8's resistance to such mob mentality and manipulation helps erode the devastating moral righteousness of men like Juror 3 (Lee J. Cobb), whose certainty about the boy's guilt is just one of the many red flags to surface during the proceedings. Slowly but surely, Juror 8 forces each man to look beyond their own prejudices?to question the evidence at hand and to become active participants in the judicial process.What's most interesting about the intense deliberations that ensue, specifically when a piece of seemingly indisputable evidence is brought back into question, is how a fresh angle and perspective, usually born from Juror 8's critical thinking, can permanently alter the tone of the discussion. As this trend becomes more of a factor, each character begins to show their true colors in relation to the case. Whether it's a bit of blatant racism from Juror 10, extreme hatred from Juror 3, or a sobering plea of humanity from Juror 8, Lumet shoots the most important lines of dialogue in close-up, lingering on the characters' faces for extended moments, establishing the importance of proximity and duration when it comes to dramatic shifts in the story. It's almost as if Fonda's character, and Lumet for that matter, believes these men are smart enough to make the correct decision if given the context and time to carefully consider the ramifications of their actions. Despite some crippling character flaws, laziness and apathy are the only real villains here.Aesthetically, 12 Angry Men is a master class in refurbished cinematic space. It takes a confined, almost completely banal real- world location and makes it completely dynamic, using incredibly nimble camera movements to establish character motivation and theme. Kaufman's fluid long takes track each character as they leave the table in anger and frustration, the men departing for sporadic moments of personal reflection before returning to the heated discussion. Seemingly simple conversations lead to damning assumptions about ideology and purpose, and each man brings their own set of moral baggage to the table. This allows the location to grow in depth as the characters become more fully developed. In turn, the smooth visuals have a strange effect on the narrative itself; they juxtapose a narrative seamlessness of cause and effect with the building uneasiness in each man, creating a volatile and unpredictable feel that rivals the extreme shifts in weather (from sweltering heat to torrential downpour) beyond the juror room windows.Incredibly, 12 Angry Men was Lumet's feature directorial debut, a fact that remains massively impressive considering the film's meticulous craft and pacing. Harboring just as much compulsive energy and momentum as most modern Hollywood action films, 12 Angry Men makes every shot and line of dialogue count. It's a film immersed in the organic relationship between faade and perspective, how each character tries to hide their own weaknesses by lashing out at others. "Prejudice always obscures the truth," one Juror finally says at the end of the film. As the unnamed men depart and walk down the courthouse steps, it's finally clear that some of them understand how that particularly true statement relates to their own conflicted, ambiguous, and flawed life experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word "go". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They have twelve scraps of paper... Twelve chances to kill!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise for this film is fairly straightforward. Twelve men are elected to sit on a jury of a murder trial for a young boy who is accused of killing his father. Almost the entire film is centred in one room, where the men, if they unanimously vote that the young boy is guilty then he is sentenced to death. Initially, the vote is guilty, 11-1 Reasonable doubt is called into question and the men must discuss their reasons for their votes.I particularly liked this film as the situation is something that is very believable. One of the first reasons that the men give is 'he just looked guilty' due to the boy being from the slum areas, another is a man has his own personal reasons for his vote. I've always had a personal belief that jury duty is an odd premise. It seems strange that a number of complete strangers are able to determine the fate of another human without their own personal background being known. For example, someone gets accused of domestic abuse. Several of the jurors are unfortunate enough to have also had a history of domestic abuse in their life, either on the giving or receiving end - their judgement is going to be clouded by their own experiences and they are not going to be impartial to the accused. I suppose the issue is, what is the alternative then to strangers on a jury in these cases? It also doesn't seem right that one judge should be responsible for making this decision.The acting in this film isn't the best I've ever seen. Some of the characters over emphasise their lines and their character portrayal, but the 'main' juror, Henry Fonda, is wonderful. His character is deep, sympathetic and a real interest to watch on the screen. This is the first film I've ever seen with him in it, but it hopefully won't be the last as I go delving for more. Lee J. Cobb is another one of the main characters, and plays a very different part to Henry Fonda. His character is unlikeable, loud, brash and rude - and you're meant to hate him, and you truly do! The ending is slightly predictable, but you're not sure how they're going to get there which continues to make the movie enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, yet powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard a lot about this movie before eventually watched it. Everybody keeps saying this is a must-seen movie. And I hereby agree to all those people that saying this so far because this movie is really a must-see movie. The plot is very simple, yet the details of the movie are very neat. It is incredible to see how this simple can expand into something so much more interesting and keeps me going as long as the movie goes on. Also the fact that the movie only takes place in one small room and all those conversation that happens between these 12 jurors just make me amaze how amazing this movie is. I cannot take my eyes of the screen just for a second. Watching every juror in the room exchanging the conversation really makes me feel like I was in that room with them, It's like watching them playing ping-pong that goes back and forth back and forth and it's getting more intense each time any one open up their mouths. Overall this one small movie changes my view towards my experience in watching movies forever. You don't need a good location, big plot, special features and all those crap to make a good movie. All you need is just a simple plot but brilliant enough to keep the audience captivated and you're all good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men (February 14/15)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's first film, 12 Angry Men follows a dozen jurors as they attempt to determine the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murdering his father. It's a simple premise that's employed to sporadically electrifying effect by Lumet, as the director, along with screenwriter Reginald Rose, does a superb job of introducing each of the (nameless) twelve men of the title - with the uniformly stellar performances going a long way towards initially luring the viewer into the claustrophobic proceeds. Star Henry Fonda delivers a typically compelling and thoroughly charismatic turn as the lone juror convinced of the accused's innocence, with the actor's magnetic work matched by a supporting cast that includes, among others, Jack Klugman, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, and Lee J. Cobb. (The latter is often riveting as Fonda's most vocal and tenacious opponent, and there's little doubt that the film is at its best when focused on the two characters' increasingly contentious arguments.) It's not terribly surprising to note, however, that 12 Angry Men's dialogue-heavy structure results in a decidedly erratic midsection, with the movie's few lulls stemming mostly from the characters' penchant for small talk. This is a minor complaint, of course, for what is otherwise an above average drama, and it's clear, too, that the film has aged surprisingly well in the years since its 1957 release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A excellent movie experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"12 Angry Men" is one of those films that I feel everyone should not only watch at least one in their lifetime, but also must be in their DVD collection as the film is a marvel in filmmaking at its finest.The plot about 12 men debating the fate of a teenage boy that may or may not killed his father is something you wouldn't find yourself becoming engrossed in. But it is due to the actors involved and of the director that you become interested in the fate of this boy and to his fate. The film doesn't reveal if he was guilty or not, but rather if we shouldn't be too hasty in our decisions. The film takes you a a journey that leaves you wondering how it will end and for a film that takes place in one location outside of the beginning and end of the film it is a true estimate of filmmaking to make such a plot as this as suspenseful as humanity possible.This is a film I employ you to find on DVD as this is a film that begs to be watch and I feel it is one of those few films that hasn't aged one bit since it was released. So I finish with saying that if you haven't watch it yet, then see it as soon as you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Character Studies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teenage boy is on trial accused of murdering his father. At the end of his trial, the 12 members of the jury (lead by foreman Martin Balsam) retire to the jury room to reach their verdict. It initially seems like an open and shut case, but when eleven out of the twelve jurors reach a verdict of guilty with only juror number eight (Henry Fonda) reaching a 'not guilty' verdict, juror number eight takes it upon himself to try to convince the other jurors that the case against the teenager may not be quite as open and shut as it seems.On the surface, 12 Angry Men seems to focus on whether the teenage boy is guilty of said crime. However, if you scratch beneath the surface this film isn't really about whether the teenager did or did not commit the crime, but rather it focuses on the notion of making sure that he gets a fair trial. Henry Fonda as Juror number 8 is the initial dissenting juror, but if you observe closely he never actually says that the boy is guilty or innocent, but merely offers reasonable doubt to counter any arguments or objections that are raised by the other jurors. Of course, predictably one by one the 'guilty verdict' jurors start to come round, but despite this the film is still involving because it's interesting to see how Fonda will convince everyone - clearly some men are more difficult to persuade than others, but I just found how Fonda achieved this to be fascinating and ingenious.One could perhaps argue that it may be a bit contrived that a juror with no legal experience could convince his fellow jurors of a seemingly guilty mans innocence, but I think to criticise this film for doing that would be missing the point. I think the point here was to try to remind us that just because we're told that something is true or that we want to believe that it's true it doesn't necessarily mean that it is true. Reasonable Doubt was clearly the pivotal factor in this film.I'm all for a good character study, but here we actually have 12 character studies. Despite its meagre running time, 12 Angry Men does enough to develop each character sufficiently. All 12 Men are from different walks of life - some of submissive, some are loud, some are aggressive, some are leaders - it all just felt so real and gritty and I must admit that I was immersed in almost every aspect of this impressive drama.I really don't think there's much more that I can say other than I'm glad that I watched this film and also that I found it to be a tense, involving and thoroughly enjoyable 90 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When people ask me what my favorite movie is, I always have a difficult time selecting just one. 12 Angry Men is usually the answer I give, although it may not be my favorite movie at the time - as that is constantly in flux.The reason I always go back to this film is it's universal appeal. It's filled to the brim with exactly what you want in a good story - rich dialogue, nuanced characters, explosive conflicts, a clear plot with detailed complexities throughout.It all comes down to the story - a universal and beautiful tale all told in the confines of one tiny room. If you are a fan of storytelling you owe it to yourself to watch this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a classic film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The power of movie dialogue really makes this movie a true classic.The story to 12 Angry Men is one man on a jury stands alone in a case in which most are initially convinced one way but one by one may be convinced another way.12 men in one room just talking about one murder case and them sharing they opinions if the person that may have committed murder is guilty or not, now many things here could have went wrong, you got to have the best writer, the best director and the best actors to make this movie work and it payed off so well and I think this is cinema's greatest risk of doing something new with the story, giving it a twist and a edge and 12 Angry Men paid off brilliantly.The acting from every singe actor in this movie all do realistic, believable, funny and serious performance's and they all add a lot of weight and drama to their character's. I wish I can bring up every single actors name in this cast but I'm not since these 12 of them and it's going to take up the all page and I can't talk about every singe actor and go into detail about them one at a time, but I can say that everyone in the movie did a flawless work of acting that's pure Oscar worthy and the kind of drama acting they should show kids in drama school. Nicely done fellas.Sidney Lumet directed this movie and this has to be some of the best directing I've seen from this guy. He really added a lot to this movie when it came to story and characters and the back and forward they have with each other and it worked by his direction.The characters in the movie (The Twelve Angry Men) don't really like each that much as in every scene they at each other's throat trying to confidence the other men in the room that the man is guilty for murder while that person and the other's bring up some really solid points that this man is guilty or not guilty for murder. As a viewer myself I got really interested in the case and trying to think if he's guilty or not, so this movie does a fantastic job of giving the viewer a opinion on the case and see if you think he did it or not.For problems with the movie: I don't have any.Overall 12 Angry Men is such a classic movie with excellent performances from everyone, the writing outstanding and the directing was some of the best. You haven't seen 12 Angry Men then I say go see it, it's worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twelve Angry Men,Nominated for three Oscars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't keen on watching old movies but this movie changing my opinion.The plot of Twelve Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father.It is proof that, for a film to be great, it does not need extensive scenery, elaborate costumes or expensive special effects - just superlative acting.The small dimensions of the room forces the men to interact and stare one another in the face preventing anyone from shielding themselves from the taunts and scrutiny of their other jurors. This is where we gain and insight in to the characters more than the exposition allows, as we glimpse in to the individual train of thought and how they conduct the world around them. Jack Warden as Juror number seven is a man who sees the world through the sports filter, as Robert is fascinating as the charismatic advertising agent who seems very confident and reveals his ability to fold under pressure as the tensions ensue. Lee J. Cobb is incredible as Juror Number Three, a man who clearly is viewing the case through his own lens of familial angst who is certain that this young man deserves punishment by principle alone. The dichotomy between wanting Justice and upholding Justice is the consistent plot conflict throughout "12 Angry Men," and Fonda and Cobb work wonders as two opposing forces of opinion and morality that aim to win over the ten other men struggling to decide.it deserves to be on everyone's watch list.</fullReview>

The efforts of a person shown in this film to save an innocent as a lawyer and as a human being was awesome. Henry Fonda as a determined person gave an excellent performance. The plot itself is inspiring. Like shown in this movie, there are still some good people out there who can and really are willing to help others, who value lives. Out of twelve one as a rebel stood for what he believed in, such a powerful movie inspired me in many ways. I'm really honored that I've watched this great movie.A stunning classic of all times.

So they are busy with their own problems and want to finish the task assigned to them in quick matter of time without having a proper judgment, but what's waiting is a deeper darker secret to unfold slowly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry men is a single room movie. Just a focused dialogue movie in which someone of these 12 angry men try to convince the other 11 with his opinion in a crime.The best thing about this movie that it talks only to your mind, you won't see impressive visual effects, you won't listen to an amazing soundtrack, you won't have any action scene. Just a discussion for 90 minutes to be excited till the last second in the movie.This movie has the absolute meaning of critical thinking, and how critical thinking can change many axiomatic issues which we don't give them the enough thinking and then judge on them the wrong judgement.Henry Fonda was wonderful in his way which he tries to convince the others and refuses to follow his intuition and just went to the critical thinking in somebodies life or death matter</fullReview>

The simple yet compelling premise provided an instant draw and allowed me to immerse myself in the storyline. Henry Fonda performed brilliantly, with his understated and muted take of the everyday hero. The other characters were also intriguing, and the glimpses of their behaviour within the deliberation process made me want to learn more about them.

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men : A great film which must be watched by anybody interested in learning more about the legal system.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film by American director Sidney Lumet is called "12 Angry Men",it portrays much more than mere anger of 12 men whose services are required as jurors to decide the fate of a young boy accused of parricide.Everything starts for these men at a leisurely pace as a vast majority is convinced that the young boy is guilty of killing his father.However,it is at later stages that one discovers that not enough attention had been paid by these men in order to carefully study certain key facts which indicate that a lot of inconsistencies were found in what was expressed by the witnesses.It is said that a defense lawyer's negligence can send an innocent convict to gallows.In the same manner,an intelligent juror with clever arguments can help an innocent victim escape punishment.This is depicted in the form of actor Henry Fonda's character whose labored reasoning outwits unreasonable arguments given by other jurors.These arguments do not come alone as they enable other jurors to somewhat get rid of their prejudices.This is one key lesson one learns from watching this film which suggests that finding the truth in a court of law is no laughing matter.</fullReview>

It left me guessing as all the jurors left the court. Where they correct? It is like asking who shot JFK. The way the film was shot in only one room for almost the entire flick made me think what a great job the director did, I have read the play script and I am glad he didn't change the it that much (like Peter Jackson did with the Hobbit). I watched this film before knowing about IMDb or its top 250 place so I knew not much about. I also didn't expect that much of the film. I definitely got much much much much more out of it. I am only only thirteen so I haven't seen Pulp Fiction or Se7en so this film is better than any other film I've seen which includes Shawshank and Godfather. This film should be number 1 in the top 250. No questions asked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It explodes right from the get go. Confined in a room , the story unfolds like magic. 12 jurors are given the task to decide on a case involving a young boy stabbing and killing his dad. The jurors are strangers to each other as they are to the audience. The story revolves around how these 12 strangers with completely different backgrounds, experiences and opinions go about the case. Its dialogues and camera angles are masterfully crafted . It is one of those movies , where everything you see on screen pushes the story forward , even something as small as moving a piece of furniture or smoking a cigarette. Filled with ironies and unexpected twists , it would be an understatement to say this movie an intense thriller . A roller coaster ride that will keep you glued to the screens throughout.

		<fullReview>Being 15 I've only recently heard of, or had the incentive to go back and watch, some of the older classics and this was first on the list. To make a black and white film based solely in the confines of a small room sporting little more than a table and some chairs is a brave endeavour and this film nails it. It's a great example of how a budget doesn't have to affect a film's quality. As long as the story and the characters are there you can create a sensational film as 12 Angry Men demonstrates. Each of the 12 layered characters is unique which keeps it constantly engaging and the little twists along the way help too. Personally I'm very impressed with the film and hope many others like me can watch and enjoy it as it truly is timeless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Story: Based on the play. 12 men of the jury are deciding if a 18 year old boy is guilty or not guilty for killing his father. 11 men decided that the boy is guilty but one man said he's not guilty. So this single juror tries to prove to the other 11 jurors why the boy is not guilty. The movie then turns into a huge argument between the jurors to put this case to rest.*Review: 12 Angry Men is one of the best dramas ever made period. And this movie is right up there in my favorite movies of all time. What's really good about this movie is that it all takes place in one room and that's the jury room. The dialogue between the jurors is just phenomenal because you just don't know what the next person is going to say. Also each character is different their not the same which is great. During the film you get to learn about the case and try to piece it all together. This movie is amazing. Everything about this movie is perfect from the acting, writing, and plot. Overall if you love dramas or courtroom dramas then this is your movie."Prejudice always obscures the truth." -Juror #8</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry men is the best low-budget movie ever. This movie serves as a proof, that to make a great movie, you don't need tens of millions of dollars. The only things you need are: 1 room, 12 actors and a great script. The whole movie takes place in a jury room (2 minutes are at the court of law). That was the reason why I didn't want to watch this movie, but I can tell you, that I've been so wrong. The 12 men are, like at the actual jury, very different, which is one of the main points of this movie. They all need to agree and above all, they have to make the right decision.The one thing I don't like about this movie is, that it's breathtaking only for the first time.

		<fullReview>This masterpiece is undoubtedly the greatest of all time. Why? Because no other film makes such magnificent use of its script. Each and every line is delivered with pin-point accuracy and brilliance, and is vital in relation to the plot; Whilst modern, Hollywood films incorporate endless and unimaginative amounts of filler, such as unnecessary action sequences, exotic locations, sex scenes and forced extra camera shots to add to the movie's runtime, 12 Angry Men proves that filmmaking can truly come inches from faultless and quintessential excellence. Never has a film so successfully captured an audience's love and attention through nothing but 12 outstanding and charismatic actors sharing one room for an hour and a half. In fact, the only reason why I felt this beautifully crafted movie deserved 9/10 instead of full marks was that I have to believe that there is still room for improvement, and I hope for humanity's sake that perhaps one day, a film may arise which deserves to be considered filmmaking perfection.</fullReview>

The actors ability to hold the passion and hope of the jury's outcome keeps the viewer completely involved. The film shows prejudice in many forms, like having a kid of your own you don't like, or color, race, age, financial status, local/foreign connections, how people see from a distance with poor eye site, but hear what they want to.

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Man, One Strong Room. One Great Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you look at 12angry-man you see a couple of people who made of dialogs and every single character made of own dialog (that exactly remember me the great film "who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?"). The conversations between people appear things of their past and every single character help the plural of them. So we go from single to plural.Of one guy to all people. We never go out of Jury's room but real things and important things that we know of Jury's people is so bigger than size of room. And it's interesting, we don't need to go out of room, never, 'cause that strong characters give us strong and obvious things that help us to know outside and out characters. So we go of singular to plural. In the first, simply, we have 12 guy. They should decide guilty or not guilty of a killer. And this decision is make by 12 simple and ordinary people who are not characters but with hand-up of a one person ,act with Henry Fonda, the stories is beginning and we forget ordinary guys. They were not ordinary anymore. They were not tips anymore and every time we have vote, also they start to appear their self. Every time we have vote, one more plus to not-guilty peoples and that one person is that person who is passing from a simple mind to a strong character. Look at that moment in 52 min, when camera move to number 11# Juror man with mustache and very clever, in the duration of move he is thinking for decision, as if that duration we know what he thinks too. ha? What a art move by the director Sidney Lumet. And what is more important than it?, The director made somethings that move all a character's thoughts to people's mind who watch the film , made it without use of one dialog and one word just with a pan or move. This is cinema. In while of pan, We know he'll decides "not guilty" and he does it. Maybe in another movie, this camera move won't be great but in 12angry man, after 50 minutes and according to his speaks, yes it's great. This is art and art is continue with shot of hands. Hands who go up for not-guilty. Every characters is different and don't like with another. Every single man has a story in past. This story make in minutes of movie. Makes with their describes of their idea, their thoughts and their past. The film is puzzle. All of them is a part of this puzzle. A puzzle with 12part. And every single man had their puzzle with enormous part. Some guy complete their puzzle quickly, Simply. Some else don't like or don't want to complete puzzle like last vote man. Angry guy. He keeps his secret puzzle not complete but finally dose it with cry. He been alone as his son leave him alone and with cry he complete his puzzle. There's so words to describe every of 12 man. Every man have a story but i think it's great if we watch again and watch carefully characters and hear them and understand them. 'cause i think they are real and it's so better who keep them in our mind for years. Ha? Enjoy more maybe. Enjoy more than write about them. And this is cinema.But somethings about subject of movie. Who are 12 man? who Are they? maybe us? People who make decisions and post commands about others everyday, quickly and simply? Ha? People who don't know what from their past is influence on all ideas and thoughts of present? Yes of course. This move is about parts of human's life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend, Tejas, recommended the movie '12 Angry men' to me. Frankly, till then I had never heard about such a movie. He then said that it is an old B&amp;W movie made in late 1950&#x2032;s. But the reason I really got interested in this recommendation was because, he mentioned that the whole movie was shot in a single room ? in a single setting.The movie takes off brilliantly from the start. The characters and their personalities are gradually disclosed to the viewer as and when required. The cast of actors have done their part remarkably well, though at times it seems that Henry Fond does steal his moments (Henry Fonda was also the co-producer of the movie). Apart from the unique situation, that of a jury in a criminal case with a split verdict, in which the movie is set, it is also the dialogues (or the arguments of the case) that keeps us hooked to the screen. There is no moment where there is a distraction or a chance for the viewer to yawn. The brilliant pace, the heated debates, the moments of short surprises keeps us interested till the very end. It's a masterpiece and I would recommend this as a 'MUST WATCH'!I am keeping this review short without even giving the synopsis of the film, so as to let you enjoy the film.Happy Viewing .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men doesn't made me angry. It makes me think. It's one good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is one of the best plays turn into movies films ever. 12 Angry Men was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose by director Sidney Lumet. There is no music score, no action scenes, no sex appeal, but this movie is one of the best, due to two reasons: great writing, and great acting. One thing that I love about this movie is how little locations there are in this film. Beside the opening scene, most of the film takes place in a room made up of 12 men jury as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. They must stay there, until they can be make a unanimous decision. To add to the pressure, the room goes from hot and humid to warm, and cold, making each character go through a chain full of emotions. The way, the film is filmed is amazing. It shot in a way that makes the room feel a bit claustrophobia. Since there is a lack of locations, the character of the film had to be very interesting people, and they were. Like the title says, 96 minutes of the movie is pure intense arguments between a group of men whose personalities ranges from quiet and good-hearted to outright anger and hate. None of the jury members have their real names mention, as most are refers to each other by a number given to them beforehand. When you think about it, nobody name was used in the film; the defendant is referred to as "the boy" and the witnesses as the "old man" and "the lady across the street". The film use anonymity as a way to make the film more a general representation of America. These are everyday people that could very well be on your jury. This sense of anonymity raises the stakes of the play as a social drama, in that is a more general commentary of our society. Who were these men is still a mystery? We only get a glimpse of what they do in their real life. They soon become acquainted with the personalities of each other and want to vote. Some of these men believe that the young teen killed his father in a fit of rage but only one juror, Juror Number 8 (Henry Fonda) is not certain beyond a reasonable doubt that the young boy did it and felt they should talk more about it. The jury soon came head to head with clashing of arguments and questioning of the evidence. Without spoiling too much about it, I have to say the heated discussion of evidences is the best part of the film as find out more about the true personalities of the jury members. All the actors did a great job. Henry Fonda does a great job as Juror 8, as the lone man wanting to convince his peers to evaluate the matter beyond their initial, largely emotion-based judgments to determine what the kid really did do. He does this, by explaining the murder weapon and the faults of the two witnesses. Still, I doubt, even in 1950's standards, a jury member can carry a knife in a jury room. Ed Begley as Juror Number 10 is chilling as the loudmouth racist whom based on the locality where the accused lived. Lee Cobb as Juror #3 is painted as a father who allows his poor relationship with his own son to influence his judgment of the case gives one hell of a performance. Last, worth noting is Jack Warden as Number 7, a sport fan who cares more about a baseball game than the case that he is given. While the others jurors members, are interesting characters, none of them were as great as these 4 men who brings the best out of this play. Throughout the play, we see two opposing views of justice which I love. The two-sided nature of justice create tension and contrast the characters. Each character wants "justice," but what justice becomes unclear and fluid throughout the course of the play. If I can find one fault in the film is how the movie makes Henry Fonda seem like the protagonist and everybody else the antagonist. We don't know if Juror 8 is right and yet, his actions are framed as an act of bravery, standing up against the group to do what's right. In the end, of the film in a chilling reverse of roles, Juror 3 is view as a stubborn man, refusing to come over to the side of reason. What's really interesting about the case within 12 Angry Men is that we never ultimately find out for sure whether the accused is guilty or innocent. It's up to question. People even today, still have open debate about if the boy did the crime or not. In modern terms, most likely the results would happen, is a mistrial assuming, of course, that applicable law permitted the content of jury deliberations to be revealed. It's one of the few movies that make you think. The film should be view by anybody going to Law, but not only that, but regular people in general. Yes, the film is a bit outdated, and younger people might not want to see a black and white film with old men yelling at each other, but I think once they mature enough, they would find this movie great as well. If not, this movie. They can watch the 1997's remake of 12 Angry Men. That version is also pretty well done. There is a lot of things that people can learn from this film, like issuing dealing with class, racism, family relationships, psychology and communications. It's really hard to hate this film. The more years pass by, the more praise it gets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why you should watch this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No wonder why this film was picked by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and selected for preservation.1. It is one of 'The Classics'. It is a film that many people talk about, write about and recommend. Even if you don't like old, black-and-white films, this one should be watched by everyone.2. It has a significant, well written script. The main mediators for the meaning are words and you need to carefully follow what is going on. It is a trial film, where we observe jury and their deciding about a boy who was accused of a murder of his father. Not so visually refined, the words are important. Dialogue and body language are vivid and most important.3. Also the character study is one of the greatest and the most detailed. All 12 men from the title are portrayed the best possible way. Actors so in sync with their work that you completely forget you are watching a film and not a live version of a jury. You get lost in the emotions, excitement and quarreling. Each man's personalities are portrayed incredible and their range of personalities adds up to the conflict they have.4. Main theme is as the title says it all. It is about 12 angry men and how a person is biased by their own emotions and prejudices when he is required to be the most rational, objective and following the facts. As it is important for the juridical system that every detail, every fact must be took into the account before you convict someone, since it is a possibility you could send an innocent person to jail (or even to death). A matter of ethics! 5. Cinematography: sequence shot of the main one-set (jury room), minimalistic Mise-en-scene, because we need to focus on acting and words. Nimble camera movements, key and soft light, close-ups at dramatic shifts, camera moves from above-the-eye to low-angle position and at the end the ceiling is visible and it seems that it is closing the set also as the men are more and more pressured. - Stylised realism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am studying this at the moment, and it is the first play/movie that I have thoroughly enjoyed at school. We watched the movie before reading the book, and I thought it would totally ruin my understanding of the book. However, much to my disbelief: it helped me understand the book more. This movie is practically word for word of the play, and every action is demonstrated. *This movie works magic*. It managed to get my whole class (17 year olds)to be interested in a black and white movie. NOT many movies can do that. The movie doesn't have much going for it: Shot in a jury room (the whole film), black and white, and not much of a story line (at first glimpse). However, some way or another it manages to make the audience feel worried and suspenseful at the end of the movie? I think it is the development of each and every one of the characters, and the numerous lessons to be learned. I will remember this movie for the rest of my life. *For anyone reading this review: Watch this movie, you will NOT look back*.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is about humans and society This movie has nothing to do with the new fairy tales that movie industry produces today . The point of this movie is how our judgment can be bias from our experience of our lives , and how information (and the lack of it ) can drive us to wrong conclusions , event conclusions that provoke death to an other person .I liked very much that movie, because it is simple with no excesses and no pointless shots . Every moment of this film is connected with the whole story , it has no waste in it like the majority of films . It is one movie that i can watch over and over , just to see how the characters are evolving through the presentation of questioning the facts that the trial is based on .Even from the start that almost everybody , did not hesitate to send an other human , a kid , to his death , the movie concludes that none of them is a bad man, every character is with good intentions and lust for justice . Maybe , lust is one other thing that the director wanted to show off . This is not a movie . THIS IS A LESSON .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great acting, great story... Beautiful in its simplicity, while being it extremely challenging to transcend to such a great quality movie for which most part takes place in just one room. A room filled with 12 diverse people who try to reach unanimity in deciding if an 18-year old man is guilty of killing his father. Just one person having doubt about his guilt, trying to convince the others to not take the decision of death penalty lightly and rethink all the evidence they have seen during the course of the trial. Every person having their own personal history coloring the way they look at one another, giving rise to prejudice, and guiding their interactions with others. Besides being a joy to watch the story and interactions unfold, it's a nice lesson in humidity and self-consciousness about how we can mislead ourselves, how we can be so certain, when the only certainty is uncertainty (although I realize this is a contradictio in terminis).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 angry men is an instant classic. I watched this movie for the first time in the year 2013, 56 years after its release with my mom and sister and we all loved away. I was blown away with the script's and the directors ability to capture the audience. It seemed as if we all were in the room where those heated jury discussions were going on. The movie is mostly shot in that single room but the audience don't leave the edge of there seats till the end. I honestly don't know how to complement James Fonda who singlehandedly made the movie so interesting. All the actors were at there best and the heated discussions seemed to be so intense and realistic, the movie does stay in your mind for a long time.The movie is something else.It is a classic, and don't be surprised if it becomes your favorite movie after you see it.</fullReview>

I loved how situations changes from cold to hot, high to low. A movie which is black and white, there's 2% music, only one location (The Jury Room) in 95% of the movie, you don't even know that there are no names to the characters and most importantly NO HOT WOMEN! Still it's the Most Powerful Movie I've ever seen or will ever see... And I hate these type of slow track/tempo movies but this one caught me all up from the first frame to the very last. In my book, this is on 3rd spot for the Best Movies that changed my perspective of seeing and believing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 angry men was always in my watch-list for ages, but I was not certain that I would watch. Mainly because it is being black and white and frankly I have not seen a single black and white Hollywood flick back then.That was god of movies I guess who pushed me to give it a try! Thank you movie god I was lucky enough for witness a such masterpiece.Almost the entire movie was shot in a single set, always appear a same bunch of guys.Shocking actions,no car chases,blood,chicks,drugs,violence you name anything you would see in a all time favorite flick,but sorry you wouldn't find any single thing in this great flick.Instead of them this movie keeps you at the edge of the chair with only its well-crafted, truly talented way of writing. It never let your eyes take away from the screen.And after the end of the movie you are still in the jury room with those 12 angry men, will-always-stay-in-your-heart kind of movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My all time favorite movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is without any flaws. It's the closest to absolute cinematic perfection I've ever been privileged enough to see. I'm a 13 year old kid and last year when I was in 7th grade civics class my teacher brought this in when we were talking about court cases. I was excited because I'm a big Henry Fonda fan! When I first watched it I loved it but it wasn't my favorite film. Then after I watched it 4 more times I gradually loved it more and more! It then became my favorite film. So this is the plot. 12 jurors are deciding the guilt or innocence of an 18 year old boy accused of stabbing his father with a knife. On the surface the kid looks guilty but juror #8 (Fonda) wants to discuss all witnesses accounts given in court. Eventually he decides that the kid is innocent and eventually so does everyone else. It's interesting to listen to even the smallest details become the most important facts of the whole case. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. Every frame of the film is golden. Whoever did the casting is smarter than a scientist. It's so good it looks like I've completely run out of complements to say about it. Watch this movie. It's so amazing it makes everything else seem low. If you ever come across a chance to watch this movie by all means take it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One room, 12 brilliant actors and outstanding performances.This movie represents a realistic image of the Men's world. How will the interaction be between 12 distinct men locked together in one room, trying to make an innocent or guilty verdict? How will the connection be established between the fickle and the determined personalities to make a life or death decision? We will see tension, anger and how everyone's personal life problems influence their decisions.12 characters with different beliefs, different prospects, different motives, different interests and different standards of living, all reflected by using different manners to present their thoughts. Everybody listened carefully to the man who was speaking reasonably. Everybody ignored the man who was yelling and shouting. The loud voice doesn't mean you are right. Finally the sound of logic and persuasion took it's place, and one of them could convince the other 11, not because he had invulnerable evidences, but because he realized from the beginning that it was a human being's life issue not to be settled in 5 minutes.While watching the movie, you will feel like you are the 13th juror. You will join the other 12 jurors in analyzing every new detail they reveal while they're reviewing the case. You will live these attractant 90 minutes with all your senses.If you haven't seen the movie yet, I urge you to do so.</fullReview>

It has to be a movie that I would watch again and again and realize something new every time. It has to make my mind run to its highest capacity. It has to have acting, dialog, and a story like no other. It has to be something that could be put away for decades at a time and still feel fresh. This film is a perfect 10.Is there any action? no.

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest films I have had the pleasure of watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are not many films that can keep you listening intently and watch every move the actors makes but 12 Angry men is one of those movies. Running at an hour and a half and practically the whole one and a half takes place in the back room of a court however never once did I feel bored or uninterested.Each actor brings something to the film, they each play their characters to perfection. Lee J. Cobb in particular plays his character so convincingly one forgets at times that he is acting. This movie goes to show that you don't need fancy effects and expensive sets to create a great film. You just need a great script and superb acting and that what one gets with this film.The plot itself moves along at a pleasing pace. The side talks between the jurors just reinforces the characters that the actors are playing. As I am writing this there has been so news about Jack Klugman being snubbed at the Emmy's and if you watch Mr. Klugman in this film you would understand why people are upset. This has become one of the greatest films I will probably watch and I am saddened that I didn't get to see it sooner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of acting and filmmaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Brilliant film version of the televised play, scripted by the plays' author Reginald Rose, and produced by Rose and leading actor Henry Fonda. It's fascinating and compelling, offering memorable showcases to an amazing ensemble. The basic story is solid, but more than that, it's a nice look into a rich variety of characters, each with their own background and reasoning. It's all the more impressive for being a young Sidney Lumets' filmmaking debut; he makes this a highly charged, atmospheric experience.An 18 year old teenager is on trial for murder, and the jury has retired to discuss the case. When things start out, 11 men are ready to convict the boy, and there's one holdout, juror no. eight (Fonda); Fonda doesn't necessarily believe the boy is innocent, but he's passionate in his belief that there's enough *reasonable doubt* in the matter to refrain from voting guilty. He encounters a fair amount of hostility at first, particularly from the excitable juror no. three (Lee J. Cobb), but as the night falls and a storm starts up, he wears down his fellow men a bit at a time, insisting on bringing up facts that he felt weren't adequately explained during the trail.What's so wonderful about "12 Angry Men" is how believable it all is, right down to one juror, the baseball loving juror no. seven (Jack Warden) being willing to change his vote just to get the hell out of there, and the earnest juror no. 11 (George Voskovec) admonishing him for not doing this for the *right* reason. Each actor gets their own chance in the spotlight, and they're all superb. Cobb has the most intense role as a truly stubborn man who's gotten himself personally involved in the case; Ed Begley is equally potent as juror no. 10, another holdout. Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Joseph Sweeney, and Robert Webber fill out the rest of this powerhouse cast.While the story is quite good dramatically, it's not without some humour, some of it coming from adman Webber. Use of music is sparing, which only adds a sense of realism to the proceedings. One of the most striking moments is when most of the group turns their backs to Begley after he launches into a rather disconcerting rant.Overall, this does deserve to be considered one of the finest American films of all time. It keeps the viewer riveted every step of the way.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is definitely one of the most astonishing dramas I've seen. It has a simple premise, but all the discussions between the jurors were just so captivating and revealing. I liked how they always went back and forth with the case, gathering as many details as possible to find out if there was any room for doubt with the facts presented. Not only director Sidney Lumet masterfully orchestrated an intriguing story filled with little twists, but he also investigated very thoroughly how prejudice and preconceived notions could be in the way of realizing the level of uncertainty of the facts.The performances here were truly remarkable, being another strength of the film. Each juror had unique personality traits and I felt the presence of every single one of them was very important to show interesting characteristics such as indifference, modesty, meticulousness and many others when dealing with the case. If I had to pick my favorite performance of the bunch, it would have to be from Henry Fonda as this persistent and considerate individual who feels the need to talk the case over and over as it's not as obvious as it looks. I really think the other actors were superb as well in their own way though. The fact that each character contributes to adding more depth to the story makes this film such a powerful experience. 12 Angry Men is only my second film from Sidney Lumet, but it certainly ranks among the best of all time and I will be looking forward to seeing more from this brilliant director.</fullReview>

This directorial masterpiece by Sydney Lumet is a must watch for all of you. Though the entire movie takes place in a single jury room (with a broken ceiling fan of course) but has got an intoxicating screenplay where several twists and turns awaits you.There's a scene where it starts raining all of a sudden, a scene which brings a fantastic change to the story where you, as an audience, feel like taking a break from the hassle and enjoy rain.Overall, this movie is a must watch and is highly recommended.

As the film passes he tries to convince others that he may not be guilty. The way the movie is directed is simply outstanding. The movie proceeds with just dialogues. I have never seen any other movie in which a plot has been executed so amazingly. The movie puts most of the modern films to shame. Without much visual effects and technology the plain storytelling style guarantees that any viewer would be enthralled watching it. This is a must watch movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie, one of the best. When I first heard about this movie I thought its gonna be some boring old movie, but when I watched I was mind blown. It really gets you thinking more. Lumet keeps things tense, sweaty, suspenseful and entertaining despite the contrived story line.The acting was great, its sad that all of the 12 angry men are dead now. I would recommend it to everyone, but don't watch the new version, watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lumet Often Overlooked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot of great performances in this classic, but you don't often hear about the flawless direction by Sidney Lumet. With only two sets, the jury room and the washroom, Lumet's camera always seems to be in the right place, and the small shifts and movements let the viewer feel as if they're the thirteenth member watching the truth unfold in front of them. Bravo.One can only wonder what kind of control Lumet was able to exercise with this formidable cast. Fonda is his usually restrained self, but Cobb, who usually shouts in every role I can remember, has a genuine humanity that deepens with the unfolding of the story. I have to be honest, he's not my favorite of the era, but this role really redeems him in, my eyes. All the others put in solid performances (you'll see a lot of familiar faces if you watched any 60's TV). I particularly like Jack Klugman and EG Marshall, even if their roles seem a bit reminiscent to future or past performances.All in all an enduring film which actually offers something new with every viewing. Isn't that what we all look for in a "classic"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece With Henry Fonda At His Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie made me feel that I actually took a part in it! Especially Fonda's character was so realistic I could nearly smell him! At some points I felt like Juror 8 (Fonda) were reading my mind and speaks my ideas out. His character made me feel that every single person's ideas actually matter as individuals. I almost believed, it was Henry Fonda himself, defended that young man, without knowing that he is innocent for certain. Yes indeed, there mustn't be even a little bit of an uncertainty when it comes to execution of a person. An honest man with doubts would defend him at all costs. And I saw an honest man when I looked Fonda's(Juror #8) eyes. So that I wish there was a Juror #13, who could have been me and supporting Fonda in this discussion where he argued against 11 another jurors all by himself. A great script, with Fonda and 11 other great actors; eventually has become a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is an understatement to say that it is a great movie. The plot and the story takes the cake. There are no expensive cars, big houses, and stuff on display, but whats needed in the film are right there in place - The actors.Watching it in 2013, where we have multi continent shooting and heavy expenditure incurred on accessories of fake illusions of characters, this film has been shot in almost the same room where the jury members decide the fate of an accused. The 96 minutes that you spend watching the film will definitely change the way you think (If you do think that way).A simple yet very effective story that runs like a knife in butter, smooth as silk and crisp as a nut. It is must watch for all and sundry. To sum it up, it is one of those movies that you will not only enjoy watching, but enjoy recommending as well :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who would knew that 12 "Angry" men in a room on a long dialog would become an ULTIMATE CLASSIC? Really who?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Men with totally different personalities, located in a room with a bathroom, proved only through words and insults that justice is not an exact science. And also managed to become a timeless classic in the history of cinema thanks to a 20 years old director, Sidney Lumet? cheers! The story of "12 Angry Men" is not one that can be reinvent or repeated (despite the fact that it had a good and underrated Reboot in 1997), because the young Lumet and screenwriter Reginald Rose made it a unique experience (and experience several times if you buy on Blu-Ray or download through the internet, easy enough). Everything begins on a normal day like any other in a court where the camera follows the corridors, and shows people and lawyers walking from one side to the other, people getting out fresh from the courtroom, some relieved some doesn't. Once we are in one room with the judge finishing the meeting and sending the 12 juries to the other room to decide the final sentence of a 18 year old boy that, as the evidence presented, "prove" that he killed his father in a rage attack. The Jurors come into the other room, normal mans who had never met and are there to lend their public service. All normal as if nothing was happening, certain that all the evidence is concrete and the boy is guilty, and a cold-blooded killer. But juror n? 8 (Henry Fonda) disagrees, he does not believe in the innocence of the boy, but also do not believe in his guilt. Now one man must face 11 that fully believe in the guilt of the boy and are tired to go home.Nowadays, the film for this new generation would be boring or perhaps "impossible to happen". Perhaps the film has to be viewed with a free and spirit mind to see the tremendous and beautiful message of justice that Lumet's classic tries to transmit. The film, NEVER for one minute gets to be boring or incomprehensible, the direction is superb and all that, but it's the script and the performances that stand out strongly in the film. A story that goes inside one room (and bathroom) had to have one writing at the level of "non- boring ", no problems with Reginald Rose's screenplay with an amazing flowing narrative, I dare say that perhaps this is the best screenplay ever written (up there with "The Godfather" and "Pulp Fiction").From the beginning the audience grasps the plot heavily, not only by the superb script, but the wonderful performances. In the cast we have all the kings of acting from the golden age of cinema, from the heroic Henry Fonda to the ferocious Lee J. Cobb (juror n? 3), to the calm John Fiedler (juror n? 2) and the satirical Jack Warden (juror No. 7). I say the names of the actors because none of them mentions the name throughout the film, really putting the audience in that room with those men discussing the case.I say that the film proves that justice is not an exact science, because thanks to the character of Henry Fonda, the film is full of arguments and assumptions against all evidences presented at the beginning of the case, the case is not shown but through dialogs from the 12 characters. Arguments that are not only to the 12 to think and reflect, but to the movie's audience. Such arguments come in the form of structured dialogs; several of them focus on various topics since politics to social problems and even ophthalmology. The film is not boring annoying also because of the various funny moments with a good intelligent humor, but where there is room for humor there is too no place for pure tension between the characters, tension coming only by words .A classic that will forever be etched and remembered in cinema, thanks to a flawless script and a marvelous cast, a film full of tension and humor and a message of justice that fits perfectly in our today's society, and an emotive finale, "12 Angry Men" is a must see film at least once in your lives?. and many more for pure pleasure!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is probably the best and most timeless movies ever made about negotiations, negotiating conflict and standing up for a personal belief. In today's world of nanosecond attention and immediate judgment and decision making 12 Angry Men is a powerful reminder to follow personal instinct, gut feeling, and sound, calm reasoning to come to a fair conclusion. As high profile trials are becoming more and more a TV prime-time event, especially in the United States, everyone who is following it wants to get an answer to the question "did he/she do it?". As only fragments of the information are available to TV audiences so it seems that the jurors in 12 Angry Men are only presented information that is easily interpretable from two completely different, opposing angles. The amazing use of stylistic devices builds and reinforces the tension among the jurors from the first to the last minute. The film is truly a timeless classic that is a must watch for virtually anyone.</fullReview>

I found this movie quite fascinating!* This is one of the finest courtroom dramas ever produced by Hollywood! Sidney Lumet was a very underrated director!* Henry Fonda gives one of his best performances ever in this movie! I can watch it repeatedly!* 12 Angry Men is one of my favorite motion pictures of all time! It has one of the best-written scripts and 12 fine performances from great actors!* I watched it years ago and loved it back then. Even now when I watch this movie, it impresses me!* This black-and-white movie is a MUST-watch for everyone. It is not just a courtroom drama, it is about human psychology - about the way we judge each other based on our own preconceived notions and prejudices!* This is a timeless movie that will never age! The performances of Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb are superb. The movie manages to achieve greatness without the use of any special effects or camera gimmicks, which is indeed worth noting!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All happens to a jury room where twelve people manage to decide if a young Spanish - American is guilty or innocent of murdering his father. All things show us that is a clear case of murder but one juror has different opinion from the others, and that's how our movie starts.In this movie we see twelve different personalities which have their own opinions for some subjects and they have different experiences and different problems from the others. We can also see in this movie how the circumstances change as time passes and the debate between the twelve jurors continues. We are tempted to compare this movie (12 Angry Men of 1957) with "12 Angry Men" of 1997. Personally I liked more the old version of this movie than the new version which I found it not as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time at the age of 18. I must admit that in the very beginning of the movie, I thought it seemed like just another boring "old" movie. But as the story unfolds you get to see more and more of the Jury's personality, through the way they behave and what they say. The writers of this movie did an amazing job creating twelve so distinctly different characters, and that's what makes this movie interesting. The setting and the scene is as simple as it gets, and I would guess the movie budget was very low. Yet I got the feeling that it was very professionally made. I must say the actors did also did a really good job, and as in any classical movie, the ending is closely based on absolutely everything that happens during the whole movie. To anyone who has not yet seen this movie I strongly recommend it. I am not sure I would see it again, because knowing the ending will spoil the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eighth grade was my first exposure to 12 Angry Men. My class was reading it as a play, I read the lines of juror number eleven. Shortly after the conclusion of our class read, we watched the film adaptation. I was in eighth grade, I knew it was a great film, but I didn't understand the brilliance of it that I see today. 12 Angry Men's greatest creative strength is the direction- technically. Sidney Lumet has every shot in every scene fitting together creating an effortless flow for the film. However, the greatest weakness the picture has is its hard for the viewer to really settle their inner roots in the it for some reason. The directing doesn't transport our emotions until the second half of the film.The Good Wife produced en episode in their first season titled Doubt. In a show that studies a defense attorney's efforts to create doubt in a jury's mind, the process of the jury members consolations are shown. I thought it was a brilliant move and we should see more media centric things about juries. That episode glimmers with inspiration from 12 Angry Men, but it lacks the morality, mystery, and humanity found in the play. People mistake character development for spending mass amounts of time with a particular character. I believe character development is to I understand a character, the writing and actor thoroughly explain the person on the page to me. 12 Angry Men develops twelve characters in ninety minutes without even knowing their names. As each juror slowly changes their verdict in 12 Angry Men, near the middle of the film I was struck, seeing a metaphor occurring mid-film. It all goes back to politics, the jurors willing to believe that the boy on trial is innocent are the liberals and the men who close their mind to any possibility of innocence represent the conservative party. The jurors who may have been judged for the way they talk, what ethnicity they are, their sexual orientation, or if they were just plain old sensitive were the ones who opened their minds up to Juror 7's campaign to examine the case thoroughly. Now 12 Angry Men still lives back in the days where life was religion-centric and things were one way, and one way one only. This is a move that makes 12 Angry Men ahead of its time. 12 Angry Men is a slice to how a jury actually acts to some extent. The thing they always forget, when their minds are clouded with things in their life they are missing due to their obligation to the justice system, is they hold the fate of another man's life. It's not something that can be taken lightly. Reasonable doubt is mistaken with something that proves the accused not guilty. That's not true and 12 Angry Men shines a light on that discussion. What this film is about to me is the laziness, selfishness, and our personal bias hiding our judgment. We all need to take a step back sometimes and really look at the situation for the gray, not black or white. Even laughing here and there, 12 Angry Men is something that may not be the most fun film to watch, but it's certainly an important to see. Rating: 9/10Grade: A</fullReview>

It does not matter if the boy was actually guilty, the movie is not a murder mystery, but that there is not indisputable evidence against him that would in turn sentence him to death.

		<fullReview>I personally thought that the film improved because it is a B/W movie. I believe that if we had of transformed it into a color, high definition film it would loose the detail. If it had have been In color then you could not get the feel of how intense the heat was because you could literally see the sweat drip off of their skin. If it had of been color that detail would have been lost which would of had a huge negative impact upon the storyline. The atmosphere wouldn't feel/appear so intense! Also the storyline is that of which cannot be matched or compared. It was a lower budget film, which was set in one room with the occasional court room or outside steps but other than that no other setting. It is mainly based on very complex yet strangely understood characters (12 angry men, 1 teenage boy) that is it and we only see the teenage boy at the beginning of the scene placement. Yet as simple as it may be it is a classic must watch film of the past century. Any film buff must see it to understand how intense old movies used to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A jury of 12 men discuss their verdict on a murder case. Amidst the heat and the confined room they are locked in, they unravel the case piece by piece only to discover all the clues which they originally missed.Each of the characters has a unique personality and the beauty of the movie is that the characters are getting to know each other (and themselves) at the same time as the audience is.The movie begins with the end of a murder trial and the jury are dismissed to discuss their verdict. An initial show of hands sets the votes at 11:1 in favour of Guilty. Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) feels the case needs some discussion and is not prepared to pass judgement on another man's life (the defendant is sentenced to death if found guilty) before delving in a little deeper.One by one, the other 11 men begin to see the errors of their initial knee-jerk reaction and the balance of votes gradually starts to tip. As the room becomes more divided, each of the juror's personalities shine through, building to a tense climax.A must see movie and a deserved place in the top 10 of the IMDb top 250 list!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Court-Drama movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There aren't many films that can illustrate the power of a strong script and superlative acting better than Sidney Lumet's 1957 classic, 12 Angry Men. There are no startling visuals, no bravura camera angles, and no special effects. Just twelve men - all jurors - on a hot, stuffy afternoon, in a single room, debating the guilt, or otherwise, of an 18-year-old boy from the wrong side of the tracks. That it kept me riveted for its entire length is a tribute to Reginald Rose's dynamite script (adapted from his own play), the superb acting that fleshes out each character (remember there are twelve here, and each one is more vivid than those in a slew of modern blockbusters), and the sure but restrained direction from Lumet.The story is simple but no less relevant even now. A young, disadvantaged boy is charged with the stabbing murder of his father after an apparent heated argument. The case against him seems overwhelming, and the twelve jurors assigned to his trial retire to their chamber to decide on his fate. All are convinced of his guilt - all, that is, except juror #8 (Henry Fonda). He is not sure if the accused is guilty or not, but he wants to discuss the case a bit further. In the face of some stern resistance, especially from jurors like #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a spiteful man who has a personal reason to see the boy behind bars, #7 (Jack Warden), who just wants to record a quick verdict so he can catch a baseball game that he has tickets for, and #10 (Ed Begley), who is convinced that everyone in the boy's socio-economic group is a criminal, he starts to argue some of the prosecution's points. He points out some inconsistencies, and slowly some of the jurors come around to his point of view. Will he convince all of them there's enough doubt for a "Not Guilty" decision?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young boy is accused of murder and every jury seems to find him guilty, expect one man, who tries to convince the others that maybe they are all mistaken. From that point, each man tries to separate the prejudice from the actual evidence and make up his own mind about the boy's guilt or innocence. For such a simple story, the film is tremendously intense and clever, and it will most likely keep you on the edge. The acting is absolutely flawless; the twelve men of the jury represent a wide spectrum of personalities, from the tempered and reasonable guy to the funny and naive one. Henry Fonda takes the cake and gives what must be one of the best performances of his life, but every other actor is equally brilliant. The whole story is developed in just one scenario and it often has clever and funny moments, becoming more and more tense as the film progresses. This film honestly blew me away. Does it deserve to have the seventh place in the top 250? It sure as hell does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 angry men: a masterwork of the motion picture!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What film-lover has not ever seen this classic movie at least once? 12 angry men is a beautiful film about the justice system and the logical deduction. twelve characters, from different social environment, of different ages are perfectly played by twelve excellent actors. Each of them has his own opinion and his own reasoning about the case. The complexity of some balances with the simplicity of others. There is an incredible diversity of characters, an opposition between two opinions but also between leading characters who are occupied to convince the following characters. This film is a big psychological fight between wisdom, ardor, impatience and reason. 12 angry men is also a reflexion about decision to inflict a capital punishment, which is sometimes took with too much banality. Lumet manages to create suspense and to stage diverse situational turnaround with the only conversation. The movie looks like a play because it takes place almost in camera but the director manages to make us feel an excitement specific to the cinema.Added to actors' genius as the great Henry Fonda or the excellent Lee J. Cobb the movie becomes a real marvel. In conclusion, this film is simply a masterpiece of Lumet's work and the twentieth century cinema. Definitely 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having only watched this film recently, and with it still fresh in my mind, I can safely say that some of the best written arguments and put downs are featured in this film. Henry Fonda is magnificent, showing that his character is a man of incredible bravery, standing up against 11 other men when he knows the decision about to made is wrong. All in all, fantastic film and a true classic piece of cinema, which effortlessly stands the test of time due to thematic content which is all the more apparent in this day and age, as it was back then. With only one location and 12 characters, it's a film I would watch again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actor's tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are not any real spoilers here but in discussing characters I could reveal some plot points and the last thing I want to do is give away any portion of the film's powerful message or ending.Sidney Lumet gathered the cream of the film-acting crop (and Broadway for that matter) to make a film version of the play. The entire movie is basically twelve sweating men arguing in one room for an hour and a half. However, the dynamics of the script and the performances of the actors in this claustrophobic presentation are the key elements that make this film a classic. Not a shot in this film is wasted. Every moment is filled with tension brought about by actors who knew how to utilize every aspect of their bodies to portray emotion from their position to their expression. Each character is so unique, you'd think it was a complete slice of Americana minus African American representation. "12 Angry Men" is a must see movie not simply because it is an acting tour de force, but because as a film it works and as a piece of cinema history, it is a classic that must be seen, this version being the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tug-of-war battle between morality and rationalization</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how 12 Angry Men can make other movies seem gimmicky having to rely on props or set pieces to make the audience feel immersed only to feel let down in the end. And that is due largely in part to its acting performances. Never would I have thought I would ever feel tension just from the use of dialogue, but '12 Angry Men' proved me wrong showing that if you have a good plot and a good script, then you can make a quality film without the use of large sets, car chases, gun shots, and beautiful scenery shots.There was never one moment in this film where I was not paying attention. One reason I can give for this is the distinctiveness of each and every character. What I love is how every juror is different from one another hailing from many different backgrounds. Just listening to these guys talk made me want to get to know everyone of them and what their motives were and how it would affect the outcome of the story. As the story progresses, you get more and more immersed as things start to get tense and personal in situation in which extreme rationalization is required in using reasonable doubt.What also makes this film rewarding is that you feel like one of the jurors and it makes you want to think just as hard as they're thinking about the case. There are twists and turns here and this is not a simple case to analyze when everything is not pure black and white. When we're only presented with very few details, we can only look to the unseen details that could give us a strong reason to doubt a person(s)' accusations. This is a story that is universal and how reasonable doubt must be taken into all accounts when there is blurred line between who is right or wrong and who is good or bad.</fullReview>

This is the kind of movie that makes you think about our natural prejudices and how important it is to look beyond the superficial appearances to find the real truth. Everyone who ever serves on a jury should see this movie first. One of the things that makes this movie one of the greatest triumphs in cinematic history is that it is completely dialog and character driven. There are no cheap visual tricks or special effects needed to hold the viewer's attention, it's the story that keeps you glued to your seat. Even after all these years this movie is relevant and interesting.</fullReview>

Few years ago me and my friend set up for a mission: to watch all of the movies in top 250 list on IMDb. It has not been finished yet, but it's going okay. No movie has ever cached me as Twelve angry men did. The movie shows the argument of a jury in a murder trial. Their case is a young boy accused of murdering his father. I can't point out one scene or one point in this movie that enchanted me. Maybe it's my addiction for old movies, or my love for Henry Fonda, I don't quit know. I like how every character in the movie has its own point of view in the case. There is though one thing that charmed me little more than anything else. It's the message that I take from the movie: The power of speech! I love how obvious it is in the movie. How Henry's Fonda character changes things that the other men found clear in the beginning, with nothing but words love it, really do! -Johanna http://2culture.com/index.php/movies/10-tvelve-angry-man</fullReview>

The script is as boxed in as our jurors are creating a tense cin-experience that doesn't waste words or time. An idealism of American justice is countered by a mob mentality in this war of words. The quality acting aptly balances out the democratic message as each juror listens past their own snap judgementality. A score more suitable for a sci-fi B movie can't derail the sharp 12 Angry Men drama. While many courtroom dramas are memorable, it is the back room drama that feels much more personable. I find myself trying to identify which each and every juror as they are quite developed in their annoying, corny, obnoxious and gentlemanly ways.

		<fullReview>I was on a desperate search for classics and my friend gave me this film and he told me a movie can't be classier. I was really fascinated by this simple film. The movie deals with the varying viewpoints of 12 jurors on a murder case. Only one juror feels that the accused is not guilty and he goes against the other 11 with a handful of evidences against their theories. Believe it or not, 90 percent of the film is shot in a single room. You won't find elaborate sets, skimpily clad girls or any high octane action, but what you are going to find is the stellar performance from all the 12 angry men and a very subtle yet edge of the seat thriller. It once again proves the point that the success of any film relies on the performance of the actors and more importantly a furnished screenplay. There is never any dull moment in the entire movie. If you miss this movie you have missed one of the best films ever made, period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'12 Angry Men' is a true timeless classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film examines prejudice and the sheer callousness of human behaviour, issues which will forever be relevant. At the beginning, 11 out of the 12 jurors are happy to see the accused, an 18-year-old Latino from the slums, be executed by the state. Initially this seems unremarkable, you assume that they all have good reasons for their verdict. However it's soon apparent that most of the jurors have just glossed over the facts, reaching their damning conclusion because they 'just think he's guilty' ? there's even one juror who can't wait to leave the room so he can go to a baseball game. Only Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) is disturbed by the hastiness of it all; he doesn't know whether the kid is guilty, he just wants to at least talk about it before the jury so swiftly condemns him to death. I've praised films such as 'Killer Joe' for their success in engrossing its audience despite much of its story occurring in very few locations. However, compared to '12 Angry Men', 'Killer Joe' is a veritable action adventure - this legal drama never leaves the jury room. Its success in gripping its audience and fully involving them in the characters and plot is a masterful achievement of writer Reginald Rose.At the table sits a spectrum of personalities, all of whom you can identify and resonate with. Some are measured, some are fickle, some are blinkered and one or two are downright pig-headed and obnoxious. The natural, timeless performances allow you to cross-examine them; they are all personalities one has come across before, and the viewer can probably draw parallels with people they know - this is one of the film's core strengths. Sidney Lumet's debut feature is to be lauded for its reserve and lack of sensationalism. There may be those who doubt the credibility of some of the case developments, but to my relief, I personally found few if no traces of hyperbole or implausibility. '12 Angry Men' is a film I truly admire, a timeless classic that deserves the attention of all generations ? it will continue to live on as many of its contemporaries continue to date.www.hawkensian.com</fullReview>

What's more, all 12 of them seem to really click and feed off each other. Though credit must also be given to the fantastic directing.You feel the scenes of the movie really mesh into one smooth ride... it manages to keep you on the edge of your seat as the movie progresses. You won't for a second feel like you are watching a movie made in 1957 due to the timelessness of human nature and our societal issues. This is one of the main reasons this movie ages so well...Finally, and this has been mentioned before, the fact it is in black and white strangely makes it that much more real. It emphasizes the beauty of this movie: its story, dialogue, acting, and directing. Not the crazy production we have nowadays. Nope.. this is a movie about the basics of film making, and how to execute them perfectly. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The jury is now in session!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. And wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth. I don't really know what the truth is. 12 Angry Men is one of the best courtroom dramas I've seen despite the fact of it being filmed way back in 1957 in black and white and happening almost entirely (except for the opening 3 minutes and a few seconds in the end) inside an enclosed room. So why is this so good? Because Reginald Rose came up with an excellent story, which he wrote as a play first and was later turned into a movie under the direction of the great Sidney Lumet. This was actually Lumet's first feature film and among his best movies all time, although it wasn't received really well when it first came out. This film paved the way for Sidney who in the 70's made one great film after another (Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon, and Network). 12 Angry Men works thanks to the strong characters that are introduced in the story starring Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb. In order for a film in an enclosed room to work you need a very engaging story with interesting characters and that is what Rose was able to do. Many great plays have failed to perform well in film, so credit has to be given to Sidney who managed to maintain the tension and suspense in the movie. As the film moves on the enclosed room seems to be closing in on each character, and this was achieved really well by Sidney. The dialogue in this film is really powerful and authentic as we see how each character interacts with one another. Sidney manages to let the action play out through words because the entire film is one giant deliberation between these 12 men.The film opens in a courtroom where we hear the judge say his final words before sending the 12 men in the jury to deliberate over whether the accused young Spanish American is guilty or not of murdering his father. He reminds the jury that if they find the teenager to be guilty then he will be sentenced to death. The 12 men enter the jury room where the rest of the film takes place as they deliberate whether or not the kid is guilty. Everyone seems to have made their mind up and believe he's guilty even before beginning to debate the issue. The first thing they do is vote and 11 of the 12 men believe he's guilty pointing to the clear evidence, but Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) claims to have his doubts. He isn't sure the guy is innocent, but he has reasonable doubts so he asks the rest of the jurors to deliberate about it for the next hour considering that the young man's life is in their hands. Once the jurors begin to debate the issue the more difficult the case becomes and doubts begin to creep in all over the place. The rest of the jury is played by Martin Balsam (#1), John Fiedler (#3), Lee J. Cobb (#4), E.G. Marshall (#4), Jack Klugman (#5), Edward Binns (#6), Jack Warden (#7), Joseph Sweeney (#9), Ed Begley (#10), George Voskovec (#11), and Robert Webber (#12). The debate escalates as tension builds and the jurors begin to grow impatient over one another's arguments. The small room and the heat also seem to play an important factor in the story.One of the greatest things about the film is that it actually serves as a case study as how small groups work and how important communication can be in these scenarios. Many of the jurors entered the room with prejudice and had their own conceived ideas, but sometimes in order to find the truth you have to discuss the issue as objectively as possible. As the men debate we see how all of this plays out, and Reginald Rose writes the story in such a way that it begins to unfold through the conversations these men are having about their own views. There is no mention of names (except for the final scene where we hear the name of two of the jurors), but we do find out a lot about each character through the way they think and act. Their personalities are very different and that always makes it hard to have everyone agree with each other. This is why the film is used in so many business and communication schools today. These characters are well crafted and we might even have come across a couple of these jurors in real life because their personalities and views are still very much alive in the 21st century. Overall I believe this to be a great film and a must watch for all cinema lovers. It is really well executed and one has to admire the talents of Sidney Lumet and Henry Fonda who have left us with their rich legacy.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most enduring, timeless and engaging classics of our time. It has the right to rank among the classics. It has the right to stand tall among all the great pieces of art, Mozart and citizen Kane included. Sidney Lumet is a genius and he surely knows how to tell a story. First you bring about a group of jury members, eleven of whom are sure about a boy's guilt and only a true protagonist goes against all of them. Now the job rest in the hands of the story teller. How will that one juror convince all the others? Henry Fonda was really good. He just had the best expressions to command a team. Then we have all the other actors. Especially Lee J. Cobb, giving the best of his anger. A distraught father who wants to take revenge from his son by pouring his entire hanger on the convicted boy. Everything, just everything makes this movie a piece to love and enjoy.My rating: (out of 100) Direction 99 Acting 97 Cinematography 79 Music 78 Screenplay 99</fullReview>

But it gets you where you live.I'm glad to say that I now have this on DVD, and pull it out at least once a year. I'm still enthralled, every time.I wish they still had Saturday Movies like they used to, on telly. We had a very early Tarzan at 9 am or so, after the cartoons. Then we had the Matine at 11 or 11.30, which could be anything from an Abbot and Costello to an old style musical or western. Then you'd have your main feature at 2:30 ish, always something wonderful if presented by Bill Collins, and he always gave you lots of info about the film. And always something for everyone on a Saturday.I guess DVD killed that kind of programming, but I wish it hadn't. A day filled with every different kind of film was, and is, paradise for me. I discovered so many more films that way...who has time to go looking? I found out my abiding hatred for musicals! Now I'm glad that Australia has SBS, because at least we get some world cinema.I found this film, on a Saturday, and am everlastingly grateful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insert verdict joke here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is at the same time a very conventional and a very innovative film. It's a classic social drama, one of those dour black-and-white movies where men in suits talk about Serious Issues, and that can be very off-putting to a modern audience. But at the same time there's a lot of interesting, subversive stuff going on below the surface.For starters, there's the format. 12 Angry Men is what's known in television as a "bubble episode" -- it takes place almost entirely within one room, with the only action being dialogue between the characters. And this totally works. The movie never becomes dull, even for a member of my attention-span-deprived generation. Moreover, our isolation as viewers mirrors the jury's own isolation. The only facts we know are the ones we overhear, which puts us in the same position as these men. Of course, all this could fall apart without good acting, but the mostly (at least now) unknown cast pulls through and does an admirable job.What's most striking about the film is the uncertainty it leaves us in. Unlike in TV lawyer shows, there's never a smoking gun that says that the client is innocent or someone else did it. All that 12 Angry Men introduces is doubt: our eyes, our ears, the testimony of others, all can deceive us, so determining the truth becomes an impossible. The film reveals the absurdity of the American justice system, which puts so much stock in not just frail human perception but also the biases and pettiness of ordinary people. In the end the accused goes free not because he is innocent (that remains undetermined) but because Henry Fonda's character is very persuasive, and another guy wants to get out early to go to the ball game.Of course, you could also read this as an affirmation of the justice system. The jury is presented with a stack of convincing evidence, but through argument, is eventually able to come to the right conclusion. That's what makes this film so interesting: it's ambiguous to the point of paradox, being simultaneously a range of opposite things. I don't buy the idea that all great art is ambiguous like this, but in this case it's certainly true.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie with 1 hour and a half showing 12 men arguing inside a room is what one would expect to be a big failure. This one is not. It may be the best movie I've seen in my life. The actors work beautifully and the dialogs are placed in a both intriguing and, sometimes, funny way. Henry Fonda does a great job convincing the other 11 men that a boy is innocent (or at least, not surely guilty) of the murder of his father. I was amazed at how he and some other men, as they dispose of their original opinion, arrange their arguments in order to show that the boy may be innocent - and that is another beautiful thing: there is no way one can determine, from the arguments given, whether the boy is or is not guilty. That's where the viewer's imagination takes part.I only imagine how it is to be a lawyer and watch this movie. It must be one the best jury experiences one can ever witness. A perfect 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One room, twelve men and talk, talk, talk. Ninety minutes of film. Sounds like a bore, but turns out to be quite the opposite. The back room of a courthouse where a jury of ordinary men has to decide upon life and death becomes the place of first rate drama, where a seemingly insignificant shadow of a doubt makes people talk at least once more about what at first appeared to be a clear cut case. Henry Fonda with his understated play is in the lead of the doubters, supported by strong character actors like Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden or Martin Balsam.The reluctant, some even clearly prejudiced members of the motley jury all look at the case from very different angles, but they are made real by distinguished acting and screenwriter Reginald Rose's crispy dialog, which never misses the mark. Also remarkable is the fact that the battle of the jurors is embedded in a highly believable environment - a hot day, people sweating, emotions getting the better of them, then a downpour outside, there are casual conversations about what's on people's minds in the breaks, restroom scenes which serve further character elaboration. Director Sidney Lumet on his part focuses on making the film as claustrophobic as he possibly can. He uses subtle camera tricks to gradually make the confined space even seem closer to the actors as the film progresses to add to the mounting intensity and the final shots are made from below eye level to reflect the change that has taken place. "12 Angry Men" above all is a captivating character study. It is not about solving a crime, but characters confronted with decision making and how they approach it. Exceptional film-making.Side note: "12 Angry Men" was remade in 1997 with another outstanding ensemble cast headed by Jack Lemmon. A decent film, but no reason to miss the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twelve angry men was built with a simple idea and was developed entirely attractive during the show till the end. Needed no many rooms and sets and even the casts didn't have their own name. I watched this film in the midnight and for a long-conversation movie, it didn't make me drowsy at all. I follow the story well and attracted to find it till the end.It may be a drama movie but the crime story catch me a lot. The way the director presented the development of the story is top of the class. The story flows constantly. Every details was included neatly. I had my eyes all over the room every time the camera move around and I tried to find errors such as misplaced sets after different take, bad expression from the walking around jurors or anything. But, I couldn't find any. Every part of it looked natural and I admired it. Splendid.Its story shows us how impact and self-influence is not only about power and authority. Look how Henry Fonda in this movie influenced the other 11 jurors and made them all agree with him. That's fascinating. This movie teaches us that in order to influence others or to make people listen to us, we have to listen first and then speak with noble way and rationally accepted argument. This is a very perfect portrait to be presented in an Influence-Training seminar.There are so many valuable thoughts inserted here and inspired me in so many ways. A lot of things such as humanity, leadership, courteousness, manner etc. I've already added this movie in my favorite list. If you haven't watched it, make sure you'll do.</fullReview>

Filmed entirely into one room itself is an achievement for a film made so earlier. The movie helps filmmakers to think differently and not follow the established rules.

The equivalent of advocacy journalism, I admit, but no one denies that the creators of this entertainment have agendas. To the extent that the film affected me, it emphasized again in my mind how fallible our system of justice is. One should steer clear of it at all costs (The justice system, not the film).And having said that, we've arrived at our system of justice through centuries of trial and error. And the advocacy system still seems superior to any previous arrangement.But back to the film: it's respected because it's tightly plotted and exhibits impressive characterizations on the parts of several actors. I'm sorry that several characters are stereotypes when stereotyping itself is the 'crime' the jury (as opposed to the accused) is so guilty of. But the fact is that stereotyping is how messages are conveyed through the mass media, and it's a matter of whose stereotypes are being retailed. Rose &amp; Lumet have their own, and they indeed add up to shooting fish in a barrel. (Immigrants=good, Nativist Americans=bad, etc.)There's also an implication that with enough consideration, no one would ever be considered guilty of anything, especially if we consider extenuating circumstances. Separately, it's scary to consider that the lack of air conditioning in jury rooms led to a lot of hasty verdicts!Finally, though, I can readily imagine how bracing this entertainment was in 1957. It was probably very much like a lightning bolt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angry for another reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twelve angry men. Anger is the appropriate response to injustice and violence; the anger of the law in this case means the defendant will be executed. But each juror at the start of the movie is angry for a wrong reason. Even juror number 8 (Fonda) votes "not guilty" not because he has a reasonable doubt but because he is offended by the haste of the other jurors. Tempers cool as each juror changes his verdict, until only one angry man is left.One of the great pieces of cinema, 12 Angry Men is art that offers to be studied, discussed and interpreted rather than reviewed. Though understated (what one juror terms a "soft sell") it is powerful, thought-provoking and never dull. It finally demonstrates that in film, as in theatre, story and character are central, while action, setting and special effects are extraneous.That is to say, see it. It may change you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most engaging and genuine films i've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't praise this film highly enough.From the very beginning you are forced into the debate by the subtle camera work and superb acting. At various points throughout the film and used delicately the actor in focus is directed to speak into the camera, it has an engaging effect in which you feel yourself become part of the Jury. You feel the tension between characters as opinions begin to change.The characters themselves are so cleverly developed that even after small amount of dialogue you can see the cross section of society sitting around the table becoming apparent, a very ordinary group of men, ordinary in such a way that anyone watching this film would be able to identify with at least one of them, each one having a slight difference in attitude. There are no bad guys or good guys, nothing is forced. All you see is mostly people who initially believe they are right with their views.The film centres around the jury beginning to question the defence given to the accused. Initially it falls to just one juror played by Henry Fonda who is not happy to proceed with a verdict until it's been fully discussed, albeit to the annoyance of the the remaining jurors who are convinced and willing to give a guilty verdict. As the prosecution case is slowly pulled part and the views of the jurors alter, it's not just the case at hand which is affected but the general attitudes of each one of them, prejudice and insecurity is brought out into the open as the up bringing of the accused is discussed.There are no weak spots acting wise, everything falls into place, is delivered to perfection and blends seamlessly. I do think Lee J. Cobb deserves an extra mention though for his performance in this film, it's truly outstanding.This film is a genuine masterpiece, a true cinema experience that should be watched by as many people as possible.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who would have thought 12 men sitting at a table could be so exciting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a film that wasn't hailed as revolutionary at the time. In fact, it didn't make AFI's first "100 films" list and was only ranked #87 after the revision. It wasn't even a box office success when it was released. Despite all that, its with good reason that this film is ranked so highly on IMDb's top 250 list.12 Angry Men is one of the few films ever made that is excellent in every regard, in some regards it feels almost flawless. The acting is top-notch from every actor involved, with Lee J. Cobb in particular standing out with one of the best performances I've seen in a film (in particular his speech near the end). The directing is wonderful, the plot is interesting, and the pacing throughout is spectacular. This is one of those films that is very hard to dislike, in my experience even younger audiences with lower attention spans or those who dislike black and white films have, with very few exceptions, really enjoyed this film.One aspect that I want to single out is the editing and pacing, which stands out as some of the best I've ever experienced. All but a very few scenes take place in the jury room, and yet the film is "edge of your seat" material throughout. More than that, every single time I watch it I feel as the jurors feel. It starts out slow, like there's nothing to deliberate. When the jurors begins speaking a little more seriously, a little more angrily, you can feel your heart beating faster. Then the tension builds even more and just when I feel like I can't handle any more, the jurors take a break and walk around the room and cool off and wipe sweat off their brows just as I do while watching. The pacing is absolutely perfect, the fact that so many films are filled with gratuitous sex and constant violence and yet fail to enthrall me like this film, it speaks volumes as far as the quality and greatness of the film in all areas.The most criticized element of the film is the ending (which I won't spoil) and really the entire process that is begun by Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), which is kind of out of bounds as far as how a jury is supposed to work. In real life, yes, what happened in the jury room, would probably have been enough for the whole situation to have led to a mistrial. But this criticism really misses the point of what is something of a "message movie", although not in an obnoxious way. Its a look at the justice system, the fact that a life is being put in the hands of twelve individuals with their own stories and, necessarily, their own biases. And indeed, a human life is worth enough to at least "talk about". The film takes a good hard look at the legal system, and its worthwhile and personally has led to many good discussions with others who have seen the film.12 Angry Men isn't a film that was the first of its kinds, its ideas aren't necessarily unique. Its excellence in every category and the tremendous direction and pacing (and Lee J. Cobb) is enough to make this a favorite of mine and a film that will be enjoyed by almost anyone who watches it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple but fantastic; it's old age is irrelevant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept of this film is incredibly simple, as are the sets throughout. However, this is why the fact that this film is over 50 years old, is completely irrelevant to how enjoyable it is today.Despite of the fact that this is not an action film, it is engaging, exciting and tense from start to finish and manages to stay highly entertaining throughout in the most subtle, intelligent manner I've seen in cinema. This is achieved through absolutely fantastic characterisation; each of the 12 men the movie centres around are individuals who are void of any tedious stereotypes that most of the shallow characters we see in cinema today will fit into. Every one of these characters are complex, controversial and interesting. This is contributed to hugely by the fact that each and every role taken in this film is acted tremendously; it would be unfair to highlight a single great performance as every member of the cast is just sensational.In addition to this, the script gives an authenticity and realism to the movie; we can relate to and believe every situation on-screen, which is what makes this such edge-of-seat stuff. Furthermore, the film could not be paced any more perfectly; as a result, the running time flies by.Although this is, undoubtedly, a necessary watch for anybody, I could not give it a 10/10 purely because I felt that the direction of the plot and the nature of some aspects of character changes were a bit too predictable; I had a pretty good idea what was going to be different from the beginning of the movie and the end.Overall, I believe that the unrivalled characterisation and simplistic thrills of this incredibly authentic, intelligent movie, render it a must-watch. "12 Angry Men" is NOT a victim of it's age... Just give it a go.</fullReview>

A modern rendition of the same source material might have expanded this to cover the trial, the repercussions, the media's reaction and a happy ending for each juror, which completely misses the point. The most vivid drama of almost any court case comes from the simple, nondescript table its jurors convene around to determine their verdict; everything else is just sideshow. Via a dozen tremendous performances from his cast, first-time director Sidney Lumet produces a dazzling showcase of dense character development, precise plot expansions, expert dramatic timing and meaningful underlying conclusions. I must have seen it a dozen times now and still it holds me in rapt attention from word one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What is there to be said that hasn't already been said? It's earned it's status as a classic for a reason. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.The ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft Henry Fonda and the explosive Lee J. Cobb were intense. Sidney Lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an "actor's director" and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but I think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. The way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all.Practically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding Fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive E.G. Marshall, the racist and volatile Ed Begley and the wise, determined Joseph Sweeney. The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. I also loved the added touch of putting Fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey.</fullReview>

This character is what I believe makes this film. The way he produces his facts glues you to the TV to await each other juror's response. Each response is taken differently each time facts are given. Difficult to explain but very interesting and exciting.The film really does show how people react in everyday situations and in the films case the impact it could have on a young mans life.Can't put my finger on why I only gave this a 9 - will definitely watch it again to catch all the detail.happy viewing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Study in "Reasonable Doubt"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, the title of which gives one the impression that it is charged with tenseness and suspense, calmly but steadily follows its plot line to its touching conclusion. It is a study in the legal concept of "reasonable doubt." The judge in his final instructions to the jury speaks of it, and one of the jurors asks another whether he understands the concept of reasonable doubt. The presence of a number of reasonable doubts heightens the pathos of a young man's life hanging in the balance of justice. All of this is hauntingly surrounded with the music of the oboe and bongo drumming, so characteristic of late 50s and early 60s films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?

		<shortDescription>A Legal Cinema Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Puerto Rican youth is on trial for murder, accused of knifing his father to death.Directed by Sidney Lumet, 12 Angry Men tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, the verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous one way or the other. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse and ends with the jury's final instructions before retiring, a brief final scene on the courthouse steps and two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, the entire movie takes place in the jury room. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room, having been admonished that the defendant is innocent until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Eleven of the jurors vote for conviction, each for reasons of his own. The sole holdout is Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda. As Fonda persuades the weary jurors to re-examine the evidence, we learn the backstory of each man. Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a bullying self-made man, has estranged himself from his own son. Juror #7 (Jack Warden) has an ingrained mistrust of foreigners; so, to a lesser extent, does Juror #6 (Edward Binns). Jurors #10 (Ed Begley) and #11 (George Voskovec), so certain of the infallibility of the Law, assume that if the boy was arrested, he must be guilty. Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) is an advocate of dispassionate deductive reasoning. Juror #5 (Jack Klugman), like the defendant a product of "the streets," hopes that his guilty vote will distance himself from his past. Juror #12 (Robert Webber), an advertising man, doesn't understand anything that he can't package and market. And Jurors #1 (Martin Balsam), #2 (John Fiedler) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney), anxious not to make waves, "go with the flow." The excruciatingly hot day drags into an even hotter night; still, Fonda character,Juror #8 chips away at the guilty verdict, insisting that his fellow jurors bear in mind those words "reasonable doubt."This is a classic film wherein where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language.Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound.Sidney Lumet,who is in his directorial debut,effectively modulates the drama without ever taking the camera out of the jury room until the verdict is in and the jury is out.As for the story,it was mechanically written, but within its own middlebrow limitations, it delivers the goods as it presents a powerful impact to the viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Greatest Movies Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I told you a film was 50 years old, black and white, all of it takes place in one room, and has no comedy, you probably would think it to be a rather boring flick. Yet 12 Angry Men uses such an interesting character study and dialog it maintains our attention level the whole way through. The film does slightly drag at the beginning, but Fonda amuses us by gradually picking apart the case bit by bit. This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. It belongs on the shelf of any movie lover. Cobb delivers an outstanding performance as a bitter, torn father who has had a rough relationship with his son. Fonda is displays one of the greatest performances I've ever seen as the average family man who turns the tide of jury. E.G. Marshall is the intelligent, cocky Juror 4. Ed Begley is a prejudice, heartless old timer. All of them deliver stellar performances in this classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An authentic classic has audiences captivated, be it 1957 or 2012; this one does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the young middle age viewers of today would not remember the named actors in this ensemble cast except a few. I remember them well and I know I'm not alone. Most all of them have had superb careers and were leading men. The name that transcends them all is of course Henry Fonda; the coolest and most deliberate role was his and he owned it. I think of all the others as co-stars and not supporting actors. Lest we forget the directing by a master, Sidney Lumet, and camera crew as well as the grips who had to allow the story to flow without interfering; splendid work. I don't agree with some reviewers who state this sort of drama in one room is not and could not be done anymore; it was done magnificently in the 2010 movie "The Sunset Limited" with Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson; however that was only two men going back and forth with their arguments, and the script was worked from a successful play. I expanded on the qualities of it, in a review; the 1957 "12 Angry Men" is superior in a few ways. The dialogue is more difficult and requires very good direction and oddly, the one room also for stage for 'Sunset?' was bigger and allowed gesturing which '12 Angry Men' were limited in such acting resource.In '12 Angry Men' Fonda makes the profound arguments for the other jurors to take their responsibilities seriously because of the stakes. The story is a brilliant piece of work in the development of characters and principals and the flow of all that should be, actually gets there in a plausible flow. The audience is captivated by each juror's journey; that's classic drama/thriller. The high ratings has been steady over time, which only means new audiences can appreciate good stuff. I was glad to view it again after so many years and I still feel I get my money's worth; I'll be watching the 1997 remake to compare and see how William Friedkin handled a remake of such a strong Classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An inviting courtroom drama, with the suspense of a thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you were born in the late 20th century as I, there is a good chance you haven't watched the best court room drama of all time, which I hereby insist that you must. The title alone may not even be known to most people, and that is a shame, because "12 angry men" is a fantastic movie that definitely deserves attention. The movie depicts the ongoing ruling of 12 jurors, eleven of which are convinced that the defendant is guilty, but are all met with the resistance of one juror determined to question what seems so obvious to the others.The merits of the case, and the movie, are clear. A young man is charged with murdering his father and the evidence against him is compelling. As both sides have given their closing arguments the jury retires to their chambers, and is faced with the decision of condemning a man to capital punishment. As the setting is set for the viewers and the different characters introduced, the actual course of the movie takes place, and it begins with a preliminary vote: Guilty or not guilty. When the tone of agreement has been set, there are 11 votes "guilty" and 1 "not guilty"; and as the 11 rests their eyes upon the one, juror #8, the movie unfolds in a uniquely interesting manner. Juror #8(Henry Fonda) starts off with nothing to validate his position, other than saying that he does not want to sentence a young man to death before at least talking about it. And from that point on, the jurors begin to explore the case's circumstances, all the arguments and testimonies, and one by one starts to rethink their position on the issue.What makes this so interesting to watch, is that the movie's plot unfolds at the same pace it unfolds for the characters. Apart from what was said during court, no information is held back, which puts the jurors in the same position as the viewers. This allows a deeper involvement in the movie, and creates a feeling that the viewer is uncovering the truth alongside the characters themselves. It almost feels like a detective/criminal investigation movie at times, and even though the movie "suffers" from old age and outdated cinematic effects, the suspense never ceases to exist. The excitement is also strongly affirmed by the growing tension between the jurors, many of which are greatly inconvenienced by their required presence. The feeling of claustrophobia grows larger, and as the persistence of juror #8 starts to affect some of the others, the viewer begins to understand the meaning of the title "12 angry men".As the title also suggests, the number of key characters is large, especially since they all appear on screen at all times. Despite this the movie never seems to confuse the viewer with a clutter of characters. Instead it constantly complements all of the jurors' presence, and never makes any of them feel expendable. This is achieved by presenting all the characters individually, but in such a seamless way that the viewer hardly notices that it's going on. This is also what helps emphasize the feeling of being on the same pace with the characters. As we learn more about the jurors, so do the jurors themselves. This process takes place throughout the entire movie, constantly evolving every character and makes it more and more clear, as to why everyone stands where they stand.All of these different things come together and deliver a weirdly subtle yet suspenseful drama, rich on both deep character involvement, and masterful writing. The movie appeals to the our sense of rational thinking, by making the characters question the circumstances of the case, while also making the viewer question them. On top of that "12 angry men" has a wide range of characters, and strikes a near impossible balance, of equalizing the importance of all of them, and thereby justifying their ongoing presence.This isn't a courtroom drama, this is THE courtroom drama, and it sets the bar of which all other movies within the genre should be judged.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess the message of this movie is timeless, especially in the modern world, in this modern times. So I am republishing it. For all the Journalism and Mass Comm student, no make it, for everyone who is with even a little but of a democratic mind set, this movie is a must watch.I was doing a case study in my Mass-Communication class, when I came upon an old 1957 movie named "12 angry men". Who would have thought that a monochromatic film about a Spanish boy accused of murder, and the dilemma of the Jury could be such an experience? "12 angry men" was such a lucid, tense, and strangely realistic thriller.The story is pretty contrived - during a murder trial, one man's (Henry Fonda) doubts about the accused's guilt gradually overcome the rather less-than-democratic prejudices of the other eleven members of the jury. While the film itself points out that democracy and all its human participants are flawed in nature, it upholds the values of democracy, probably in a way which is very much apt to the time. The jurors were named after numbers, very much in sync with ideal democracy, and the photography, being black and white, heightens the tension.Taking place in almost entirely a jury room, the film was very economical, 12 angry men watches as 11 jurors, convinced of the boys guilt, are slowly won over by one man sympathetic enough to at least looking into the matter, and having reasonable doubts before sending a man to die..the tagline of the movie sums it up..."life in their hands, death on their minds". The screenplay, happening almost entirely in a single room, in a hot summer afternoon, adds on to the claustrophobia, and rather being confining and acts as a tension and drama building measure.The film leaves a tremendous impact, and leaves a person wondering, about the inevitability as well as the futility of democracy. Check it out folks, they don't make classics like this anymore...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all let me name it as classic. No other word will be sufficient I believe. Mortal is life so is life related things i guess. The mortal man is so preoccupied with the very concept of mortality and it overflows into everything he does: his words, opinion, character and the list goes on. It also reinstates the hard truth that everything and anything can be coloured so easily at our will. And, one other thing is that man is mere puppets in the influence of his prejudiced mindsets. He doesn't even try to think instead just act on the spur of the moment.Yet another aspect is, what's actually truth and is there truth indeed? Everything turns out to be mere the fabrication of words and vulnerable to errors I believe. Mortality is coupled with relativity, a perfect companion for the mortal man to have on his side. Well, watching films is really educative. For, I've studied one other lesson too. Among the 12 Angry Men, most of them are really angry at themselves, being in this hellish status of life and may be the way they are compelled to live on. If its so, how can they value others life on which they are casting their vote. Love, correct, value ourselves first then to the other.. Isn't it the right path?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The jury system is far from perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is any movie that more plainly dramatizes the need for a major revamping of the jury system, this movie is the one. This movie dramatizes in no uncertain terms the chaotic process associated with trying to determine guilt or innocence. Instead of being impartial, the jurors are guided by their emotions and most openly admit that they really cannot determine the truth of the case. This movie completely underscores and conforms the need for a professional jury system. The present system is so messed up that now almost both prosecutors and defense attorneys will do almost just about anything to avoid a jury trial. They are the experts and they know that once a case go to a jury, anything can happen. This movie is great because the story is completely plausible. Jurors ready to fight each other; jurors who are angry, who really have no interest in deciding the case other than just to get it over with; jurors who are projecting their own emotions onto the defendant or prosecutors. In short, this movie most effectively and succinctly highlights the glaring imperfections in the system of justice that is structured in such a way as to almost guarantee that mistakes will be made, and that is because the jurors are laymen and are being asked to apply complex legal principles to cases that often hinge on circumstantial evidence. Although the cast includes major stars like Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, it's really an ensemble cast. Ed Begley gives a fantastic monologue, ranting and raving, a really classic performance. After watching this movie, one can better understand why cases are plea bargained. It has nothing to do with ensuring justice; it's just a way to avoid having to go to trial - by jury.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrhetorical discussion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Pulp Fiction",this was the movie which I really respect for DIALOGUES.As this is actually a very old movie I only saw it recently--- when my craze for watching old movie started.I had only seen melodramatic old Indian movies and decided to mitigate my broken mind by not watching old movies anymore.But after watching 12 angry men,my excitement for watching old movies bolstered to a great extent! I actually watched it manly for the rave reviews it had received.I realized that this is the movie which inspired,many recent movies based on murder trials.When I started watching the movie,I was actually skeptical about how the movie would proceed,if it were to be confined to a single room!!The development of the first ten min of the movie----- from the 12 jury men sitting in the courtroom hearing the case to how they start the discussion about the case in the jury room----- was actually one of the simplest,but the most realistic sequence I had seen!I mean especially to find it in a old movie was actually surprising.The way the jury members sweating due to the scorching heat,was shown in a very authentic manner. Based on the teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose,the story is how one the jury members(Henry Fonda) convinces the rest of the 11 members that the murder trial under the discussion is not as simple as it seems.The movie then develops with conversations about how the case is discussed and sorted out!Frankly my verbiage is not enough to describe the brilliance in development of the plot!!As movie proceeds,the screenplay not just depicts a murder case,but also depicts the beautiful sketching of each of the characters.The way the argument proceeds with the infusion of their mindsets to the case is so realistic that,you at some point might feel that the screenplay was written by the screenplay writer actually sitting in a real jury room!!The camera work is simple,but exclusive especially in depicting various erratic emotions of each person.I personally felt that the performance of Lee J Cobb as the short tempered and intransigent jury member was the best!!His anger depicted was like watching my father shouting at me!!!!!So finally thanks to Sydny Lumet for his thought provoking direction.It is,according to me, his best movie till date.The true meaning of an HERO is very well defined in this film!Henry Fonda not only should be just appreciated for his acting,but should also be haled as an iconic hero portraying aggressive candor and calmness.So please watch this movie mainly for the simple,but taut screenplay.Lastly I do not mean to offend old Indian movies,its just my opinion.If not for the melodramas of those times,I don't think our culture would have been preserved till now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You can't send someone off to die with evidence like that".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a store manager for a regional supermarket chain, about thirty years or so ago, our team was presented a developmental seminar featuring "12 Angry Men". Breaking into work groups, our task was to watch the film, and at strategically paused moments, predict which of the jurors would be the next to change their verdict from guilty to not guilty. It was an exercise in analytical thinking and observation of human behavior, characteristics that a good manager needs in order to develop a work force toward a common goal. There was actually a group that got all the positions right from one through twelve, which astounded me. Watching today, I got stuck again right at the outset, figuring Jack Klugman's Juror #5 would be the first to be influenced by Henry Fonda's argument.The film is an extraordinary piece of ensemble acting, and if the players weren't that well known back in the day, they have certainly made themselves a name since. Almost all have passed on, but to see actors like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, Ed Begley and Klugman all in one film is a veritable treat, even apart from the story. But it's the story itself that rivets one's attention to the screen, and the slow, methodical plodding Fonda brings to the table with convincing arguments even in the face of his own uncertainty about the case. With a surety that "The facts are supposed to determine the case", Fonda's character struggles to assure his fellow jurors that the life of an accused killer is worth the effort to consider reasonable doubt.Aside from Fonda, the two most galvanizing characters are portrayed by Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley. Begley, Juror #10, who exhibits the most extreme traits of racism and bigotry, forces each of the jurors to confront their own prejudices in an uncomfortable scene where almost every other juror stands up and turns their back on him. Cobb, Juror #3, has a much more personal investment in the trial, harboring a failed relationship with his own son that colors his view of the world. The really interesting point regarding Fonda's character is that he accomplished his mission without ever raising his voice. I don't think I could have done that considering the stakes involved.It's a rare film that can anchor the viewer in one spot for an hour and a half and make time fly by with an intriguing story and realistic dialog. Rarer still is the ability to poke a finger at one's own pre-conceived notions of guilt or innocence, forcing the serious viewer to take a seat at the jury table and examine the facts from all sides before voting guilty or not guilty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'12 Angry men' is not the movie if u have prejudice against black n white cinema, its not the movie if u want Tyre-scorching action.....it is only for those movie goers with subtle touch of patience and want can over look obvious looking simplicity......Story is pretty straight forward of jury deciding the fate of a person who looks to be given a swift verdict.......yet a man comes forward and gives a different viewpoint n challenges every juror in a very subtle way to just 'think again'. This is start of movie which really captivated my attention from start to end, it never required beautiful movie set or location.....the unfolding of story was so good that i was glued to the screen and yet at the end i realized the whole film was shot in a single room, no guns or girls, yet i loved the ending and tell you what at the end you only get to know the name of main 'protagonist' of change of opinion........u just don't need such formalities !Simply put '12 Angry men' showcases 12 'angry' jurors just looking to seal the fate of a person yet 1 person is managed to change perception of all by power of reasoning and convincing all of them one by one to change, what was pretty much done n dusted verdict.....You will love the movie if u really have in you the patience to sit in front without expecting any melodrama and yet in the end you will feel really satisfied as if u have seen a action pack thriller !. There are very few movies in Hollywood who can match the level of '12 Angry men', 'Sleuth (1972)' comes close to it in a way but i won't tell how.........A movie for person who can enjoy cinematic brilliance in a very fine,simple and subtle way and not a movie for ludicrous action-pack stuffed movie goers !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the premise is that twelve men are presiding over a murder case during jury duty, anyone who has ever been required to attend jury themselves will agree that, this sounds like one hell of a boring plot. Nevertheless, 12 Angry Men has become an incredibly popular film over the years and for good reason. The plot is deceptively simple; twelve men in a jury engage in heated discussion with each other, over the innocence of a young man accused of murder. It appears to be a very open-and-shut case, yet the calm, enquiring and objective Henry Fonda's questionings cause the entire jury to turn on their head's as more and more perceptions start to come to light.The situation this jury finds itself in is in itself, incredibly gripping. We, the audience, look in on people who seem as though their opinions on the matter are firmly set in stone. Characters who at first are so certain about the ultimate outcome, they'd rather joke, talk about sports, boast about their business, banter or play crossword puzzles, rather than take the matter at hand seriously. Watching Henry Fonda manage to convincingly break down each and every one of their uncaring barriers is something highly engaging as he seems to be breaking down your barrier as well. Something about the way in which the story is portrayed almost makes you yourself feel like one of the characters in the jury; the film is shot in real-time, the characters opinions change with each monologue, the room you are in while watching the film almost becomes just as hot, stuffy and restless as the room in which these jurors preside in.Speaking of the jurors, another amazing thing about this film is what amazing characters they are. The twelve we are presented with are all unique and all of them have differing reactions to the situation they are in, the situation to be discussed and to each other and this is one of the most fascinating aspects about the film as a whole. First, there's Henry Fonda's protagonist, a man who despite being comparatively timid in contrast to the other characters at first, manages to show an admirable amount of unflinching will and integrity, without seeming to become annoyingly sanctimonious. Then there's Lee J. Cobb's excellent performance as our antagonist, Juror #3; a man who from the offset is more personally involved with this trial than he will willingly let on. My personal favourite character is the analytical stockbroker Juror #4 played by E.G. Marshall, as of all the characters in the room willing to vote guilty, he seemed to me as the most logical yet still open to reason.Of course, although the film is very good, it isn't perfect. It is however, good enough to the point where I can only really make 'nitpicks' rather than criticisms. One such nitpick is the use of close- up shots during the film, particularly the one's involving the old man, Juror #9, which I felt looked quite out of place. The film seemed to flow in a very much naturalistic way, for the close-up shots to be in any way effective. I did also think that while some of the evidence discussed in the juror's room on the young man's behalf, was very convincing, some of it did really seem as though they were grasping at straws; the talk about the knife in particular I found quite circumstantial. Maybe more information at the very start of the film, about the case at hand would have been helpful as well. Like I mentioned earlier however, these are minor nitpicks.12 Angry Men is an extremely interesting film; you have an interesting situation, a load of interesting characters and all of this is excellently executed. Considering the setting as well, these 96 minutes seem to fly-by as you never once find yourself bored. A very well justified, timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They're 12 angry men!! A boy is convicted of murdering his father and it's up to the jury to decide if the boy is guilty or not guilty. Although 11 jurors voted guilty, one voted not guilty. Who is this juror and why did he vote not guilty? Here are the profiles of all the jurors..Juror 1(played by Martin Balsam)- Aka the foreman. An absent-minded but helpful juror. Did he voted not guilty? Juror 2(played by John Fielder, who also voiced Piglet in the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh)- A shy and timid juror who works as bank clerk(No wonder why John Fielder played the voice of Piglet ^_^!). Sooner or later, he'll stand up against the bullying 3rd juror.Juror 3(Played by Lee J. Cobb)- AKA the bad guy juror. You don't want to make this juror mad! He is short-tempered and mean and will do anything to get the boy guilty. But will he change his mind? Juror 4(Played by E. G. Marshall)- A stockbroker who's rational but calm. Good thing he's not like as aggressive as Juror 3.Juror 5(Played by Jack Klugman, who also starred in the Odd Couple)- A juror who comes from a violent neighborhood. I feel sorry for this guy.Juror 6(Played by Edward Binns)- A juror who also paints houses. Just because he has a tough personality, that doesn't mean he's disrespectful.Juror 7(Played by Jack Warden)- A juror who rather focus on baseball than focus on his duty as a juror.Juror 8(Played by the legendary Henry Fonda)- AKA the main hero. He is an architect who is pure at heart and believes that the boy is not guilty for a reason(He may not be Astroboy, but he does know right from wrong).Juror 9(Played by Joseph Sweeny)- A stereotypical wise old man.Juror 10(Played by Ed Begley)- A blabbermouth juror who is just as bad as Juror 3(Maybe:p).Juror 11(Played by George Voskovec)- A immigrant clock worker and one of the good guy jurors(just like Juror 8^_^!) Juror 12(Played by Robert Webber)- A juror who can't make up his mind to prove if the defendant is guilty or not.This is an exciting drama you won't see in the court house! My favorite character is Juror 8(to know why, read his description:p). 12 Angry Jury will give you plenty of intrigue and excitement. I loved this movie so much! I recommend this movie and I hope you'll love it(If not, then what's wrong with you&gt;_&lt;?!!!!) 100TrillionStars/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely touching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few movies that challenge the very essence of humanity, but Twelve Angry Men is among them, likely at the forefront. Just a bit of inquiry by Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) is enough to turn all of convention onto its head, and what ensues is a manifesto of the human thought process. First he is treated as the village idiot -- "There's always one.....", then through common reasoning and questioning he gains some momentum among the jury until he has eventually won the vote of all eleven of his peers.The characters in that room represent a microcosm of greater society: you've got the righteous yet somewhat humble speaker of truth, the socially cold yet honorable logical thinker, the wise old man, the baseball-loving hedonist, the jaded self-proclaimed sadist, the cynical old man, the earnest hard-working foreigner, and the unimposing supposed leader (the foreman) who is among the quieter individuals who form the background audience to the great debate that carries the story. This portrayal of society makes Twelve Angry Men suitable for all viewers, and it may as well be mandatory for all people to watch this movie as its adventurous trek through morality has been and forever will be relevant to human relations.Twelve Angry Men is a longstanding testament to the spirit of originality and inquiry -- questioning the judgment of another rather than weakly conforming to it. This theme is again and again visited within the dialogue of the movie, as juror #8 is bashed by a couple of his fellow jurors for trusting his gut, or forming unconfirmed yet sensible hypotheses. But it's this pioneering spirit which achieves basically all the great feats that we reach -- it's how the judicial system and greater democracy was set into place in this country, for example. The gradual conversion of each juror from a "guilty" vote to a "not guilty" vote shows you the potential for the realization of truth that lies in each man in this world, as well as their varying methods of reaching it. For some it was reached by plain logic (juror #4), for others it was through direct empathy. Some men leapt aboard the bandwagon only once it had gained some might, and some only came over after having held onto their original view until the bitter end.....having been blinded from common sense by their own distorted emotions (juror #3). Regardless, every juror lands somewhere on the spectrum and is entitled to their own unique view, just as ordinary people are in society.There are almost too many unforgettable moments/lines in Twelve Angry Men to count all of them.....from the hullabaloo that ensues when the jury first learns of the lone "not guilty" vote at the beginning, to the re-enactment of the old man limping down his hallway, to the convincing of juror #4 through the "glasses" ordeal, to the final stand and glare of the eleven jurors at juror #3. There's the final exchange of the movie, when jurors #8 and #9 exchange names and "meet" for the first time (telling you something about how dehumanizing and tense things got in that small room). Oh and speaking of that small jurors' room -- virtually the entire movie takes place in there! On paper that idea seems somewhat ludicrous for a movie, but the compelling nature of the plot somehow made me forget how physically stationary the story is. Cinematographer Boris Kaufman used a brilliant tactic over the duration of the film: he lowered the cameras as the plot continued. At the start we're able to appreciate the size of the long room, and we look down upon the jurors, but by the end each man looms over our view, large than life, as we see him speak, and the walls appear to have closed in on us to create a very cramped and tense atmosphere. Very well done.Ultimately, this is one of my favorite films, touching the soul of humanity and leading its audience through an entire range of emotions, and all while in a very commonplace setting. Sometimes the simplest premise makes for the most enthralling story, and through superb acting, a terrific screenplay, and innovative cinematography, Twelve Angry Men accomplishes this and lays claim to being one of the greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trial And 'urrah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's several years since I saw this film and it holds up superbly despite the built-in flaw in the plot which perhaps remains unspotted - though with the number of reviews posted here, which would be difficult to read in toto possibly it has been noted. As we all know the action is virtually confined to the Jury Room in the wake of a murder trial to which we are not privy. It seems open and shut and eleven of the jurors are ready to vote guilty and get out of there but one man persuades them to at least consider the possibility that the accused is innocent. Eventually all twelve jurors vote not guilty, end of story. BUT: It they are correct then WHO did kill the victim? Presumably the police never bothered to search for anyone else so is there a murderer on the loose? Conversely, what if the accused really IS guilty, then they have conspired to let a murderer walk free. Clearly this began life as a play for television for which its single set is ideal and the transformation to the big screen is masterly. All twelve actors are beyond praise and this is, without question, a truly fine film, yet a film that tackles moral questions so forthrightly should itself be questioned by ignoring others.</fullReview>

Just consider that: in an era when movies have to rely on cars chases, explosions, CGI special effects and 3D technology, here's an absolutely riveting movie that was filmed entirely within the confines of a single room! That just goes to show what can be achieved with a great script, a great cast and a great director. Although Henry Fonda is the only real "movie star" in the cast, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley were both distinguished stage and film actors. Most of the other actors in Twelve Angry Men enjoyed long careers on stage, screen and television, mainly as character and supporting actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twelve men cloistered in a steaming Manhattan courtroom for ninety minutes. It's this basic premise that had always rather put me off 12 Angry Men. Technically, the film ends up as a study in close quarter drama. The tension of Hitchcock's Rope is very much in evidence, although the whodunnit element of 12 Angry Men is simply a MacGuffin (which Hitchcock would have appreciated). The drama itself is a study of men: the way in which men behave towards one another, understand and deal with one another, what they consider acceptable, and so on.It's a very interesting film, as the acting techniques are really dated. Despite this, one consistently gets a sense of authenticity, that for all the melodrama, men - these men, with their own backstories - do behave like this. Even without considering individual performances, there is much to confirm this. For example, the general, collective meandering about the room before they all finally sit down and begin to discuss the verdict; this tells us as much about their pride and insecurity as any exchange.The entire cast is really excellent - it's a bit like trying to single out one particular performance in Glengarry Glenross. Henry Fonda leads but only as the initially unconvinced juror. He asks questions. His liberalism isn't didactic. I actually found his attempts to undermine the evidence childish, compared with the dialogue that this confrontation provokes in the defensive ensemble. The key to the film is that he doesn't win anything. The majority of the characters do retain their autonomy. There is no genuine emasculation.I finished watching this movie two hours ago. At the close, I didn't feel particularly impressed or moved. But the quality of the performances and what they meant about the characters, about their situation and consequently about me are sitting in my head talking to me in exactly the same way as a reasonable, unprejudiced man in a white suit. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This little film has been one of my favourites since the first time I saw it on 3/12/72 on UK TV; back then I couldn't fault it but over the years its minor imperfections have become more noticeable to me. Repetition assists clarity...It's an engrossing tale of 12 sweaty jurors cooped up in a hot and claustrophobic jury room trying to reach a unanimous decision on a potential murderer who's just been tried. Henry Fonda believes it's possible the guy is innocent, the other 11 initially don't. And that's all the background needed. It's marvellous watching the story unfold ? more or less logically ? but! The characters are really 12 Emotive Stereotypes: The 2 main well bred Thinkers just had to be the broker and the architect and not the slum dweller or the baseball fan, the 2 small businessmen just had to be the most interesting characters, not the old man or the clerk. The stagey and sporadic irrational emotional outbursts would make an agreement unlikely in the real world and yet it's carried by both the sincere and insincere at the finish. Where did Lee J. Cobb go to when everyone was theatrically getting up from their chairs and turning their backs on Ed Begley's right wing frothing? His chair was empty during this very contrived scene but not just before or after, presumably because it would have looked a little incongruous if he'd stood up too. And I concur with Fonda's glib comment that the defence lawyer couldn't have been very good!However, it's still a classic and a film I owe a lot to: it made me realise from age 13 there's often more lurking under the surface than above, and in all probability nothing is impossible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb examination of human dynamics (R.l.P. Sidney Lumet)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sidney Lumet has passed on. May he rest in peace.Twelve Angry Men exhausts one in the search for superlatives. All but a few minutes at the beginning are set in a single, nondescript jury room, consisting of, essentially, the table and twelve chairs, a closet for hanging coats and hats, a water cooler, a fan that only works for half of the movie, restrooms and windows overlooking a generic view of a city which happens to be New York but which could as well be any other metropolis. Within this sparse environment, director Lumet crafts a riveting drama from Reginald Rose's original story.Twelve Angry Men does employ some major elements of dramatic license, and some criticize it for them. A few are: juror #8's walk through the defendant's neighborhood and purchase of a switchblade knife constitute jury research, a no-no, not to mention the implausibility of a juror getting away with bringing one into a jury room. The test of the time for a witness to walk a certain distance is a jury experiment, also disallowed. Either would be grounds for a mistrial.I do not consider these flaws. First, this is not like a modern courtroom drama, trying to realistically dramatize our system of justice. It is a drama about people, their passions and prejudices and the tension that rises high when twelve people are faced with the need to find unanimous agreement on a subject as emotionally charged as murder, with so much at stake, forced to subjugate their freedom to think, feel and speak independently and unchallenged under pressure from eleven others trying to do the same in that search for universal agreement. Jury deliberation is the vehicle for creating this environment. Some limited bending the reality in ways that are implausible only because of the rules of the real world is no crime.A movie trying to be faithful to the process of jury deliberation would consist almost entirely of people sitting around a table talking. It's hard to imagine making a decent drama out of that. Dramatic license, when properly chosen and limited, is no detriment.The characters and the superbly cast performers characterizing them are wonderfully diverse and defined, from hesitant and mild-mannered to brash and arrogant, stiff and cerebral to low and bigoted, idealistic and forthright to weak and manipulable, simple and quiet to vengeful and enraged. There is a distinct dynamic to every combination and interaction, and the human condition and spirit are uniquely explored in each of them. Each is a drama in itself and at the same time one piece of a whole seamlessly joined with all of the others.This movie also contradicts the cynical view that society is hopeless. Despite the differences of intelligence, personality, integrity, values and ethics among these people, ultimately a basic desire to do the right thing surfaces in each one.A black-and-white cinematic masterpiece, this film is not for those numbed by dazzling effects and wall-to-wall "action." For those moved by a brilliant view into the core of what it means to be human, this will ring true for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anger among the jury results in justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic movie has an excellent cast of well-known actors in a story that goes to the heart of the justice system. From the beginning, it is apparent that the young man on trial for a murder is saddled with a jury that is totally unfit to pass judgement on whether he should live or die. Very few of these men should have passed a jury selection process; they were impulsive, lacking in compassion, ignorant of the law, and highly prejudiced against anyone not like themselves,except for two or three. This wedge enabled Henry Fonda, the lone dissenting voice at the start, to make a series of points that eventually blew away the arguments that the young man was guilty. During the process of passing judgement, the jury is subject to an intense self-examination of their own prejudices and opinions.As the movie goes along, the viewer is appalled at the mentality of the group, with no understanding of the scope of their responsibility. The foreman, Martin Balsam, takes his job very routinely and would have easily allowed the jury to pass judgement without any reflection. The movie was very effective in showing the men sweat and fly off the handle in the midst of a New York heatwave that made them eager to get away from the courtroom. At one point, one of the last holdouts, E.G. Marshall, playing an unemotional and stone-faced juror, was forced to wipe his brow under a barrage of questioning from Henry Fonda that exposed the falsehood of his assumptions. We see similar cutaways to Lee J. Cobb, who eventually loses his grip as others take the opposite side in the argument.This is a tense and unvarnished look at human beings thrown together in a jury and it shows the forces at play that would deny that justice be done. I am sure that this movie and others gave rise to some of the changes to the American justice system over the last 60 years to prevent the miscarriages of justice that probably occurred in many cases. A great movie and a lesson in the due process of law.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>no argument here: it's still a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An all-star jury deliberates what seems to be a clear-cut murder charge, but each guilty verdict is swayed, one by one, by the reasonable doubt of good Samaritan Henry Fonda. The film was made in defense of an insecure legal system, showing how a jury of one's (all too human) peers, sidetracked by prejudice, laziness and impatience, can still deliver an impartial decision after considering all the available evidence. The drama is played out in real time, and with real emotional power, building considerable tension out of the conflicts between each character (many of whom would likely never have been selected for an actual jury in the first place). Credit Reginald Rose for the elegant simplicity of his original screenplay, and 33-year old Sidney Lumet (making his feature film debut) for the all but invisible direction, maintaining the punch of the original story (a stage play originally written for television) without it seeming at all like a claustrophobic, one-set theater piece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is my 2nd review since signing on to IMDb. I love movies and all types. 12 Angry Men should be watched by everyone over 20 years of age. The older you are the more you appreciate it. This black and white film lends to the effects like so many of the other great films from before 1960. Henry Fonda has always reminded me of my father, especially in his mannerisms throughout this film. I feel sorry for those under 20, because they probably have never heard of this movie, but for those who have, it will open them up to many others. Every generation (including mine, HS class of '71)believes that their parents don't understand them. I was definitely no different. But, I was fortunate enough to watch these earlier films so I have developed a strong bond with them. If you have just seen this movie for the first time, may I suggest reviewing and watching some of the AFI's top 100 films of all time. I have over 70 of those films in my DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film.I love it because it teaches us the lesson about how when someone's fate is in your hands,it's important to examine things from every angle.We as a society have a tendency to want to see people hang just because they fit our own personal idea of what a bad person is.If something bad happens and they happen to be nearby,we tend to make assumptions that this person participated just because of the stereotype we hang on them.Henry Fonda leads an excellent cast here in a film where dialog rules and you can cut the tension with a knife.Especially enjoyable was Lee J. Cobb's very dramatic monologue toward the film's end.A definite keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twelve angry men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie Twelve Angry Men, because this is an old black and white movie. The movie reminds me that when I was a little girl, my home had a small TV. The television screen also is black and white. At that time, neighbors came to my house to watched TV. They brought some food and fruit came to my house, then we talked together, ate together and everyone was happy. After we changed new TV, I watch black and white movie seldom. In the school, we watched Twelve Angry Men made me remember my old TV. Secondly, I like the story of the movie. From one man to all men agreed the boy was innocence, I think juror No.8 had good persuasion. He explained again and again, told other people the truth. Twelve different people have different personalities, but after they just united as one said "not guilty"On the other hand, the reason why I don't like this movie because of the movie was always talking and talking all the time and they didn't do many actions. Also, the movie just had two kinds of music as background in the whole scene. If the producer can add more kinds of music, that will be great. Moreover, I don't like the room; it was too small .Everyone smoked at a crowded place made the air so muddy and the temperature was so hot. In the room, everyone was sweat, the clothes was wet. The whole room was dirty. During the watching time, I felt so uncomfortable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twelve Angry Men was a very good movie, with good dialogue and an excellent cast. The cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. Although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. It was amazing how one by one Henry Ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. It was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. They all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but Henry Ford's character made them take the time to think it through. Watching the movie Twelve Angry Men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. The emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form. A movie that I would recommend to anyone who wants to sit down and watch and old black and white film with a strong cast of stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie 12 Angry Men is a nice movie and I liked it. This movie is related to a murder case and the jurors are trying to find out if the son is guilty of his father's murder. The best part of the movie I liked is where juror #. 8 is the only one who votes the boy not guilty and the interesting part of the movie was where all the jurors sit by their numbers so they can point to the right juror for their opinion. After few minutes juror #. 8 tries to prove that the boy is not guilty. He also finds a similar knife that was found at the murder scene and everyone was shocked to see that knife because all jurors thought they don't sell that kind of knife anymore. The movie is more interesting to watch then read the play out of a book because it has the action in movie and the way they talk to each other. It is1950's movie but worth to watch it. The best part of the movie I liked where juror # 3 in anger was really going to stab juror #. 8, but all the jurors stands up and say "WOOOHH" and juror #. 3 stops and they go back to their seats. At the end of the movie everyone agrees that the boy is not guilty. This is a must watch movie specially who likes to watch drama movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>People have their different opinions about 12 Angry Men due to its film colour, the time it was filmed etc. To me I thought 12 Angry Men was a good movie. What I liked about the film was that it was acted out just as described and explained in the play. The fact that the movie was black and white made it seem like it was going to be boring but the more you got into the movie the more interesting it turned out to be. What I liked the most about the film and made me more intrigued with it was that the jurors were acted out just as they were described in the play even better. After reading the play and watching the film I would definitely choose the film just because instead of thinking and visualizing about how the jurors are speaking, acting or even of how they actually look you see it all in the movie and thats what makes it better then the play. So I definitely would recommend watching the film especially if you're into films about crime and law.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that the movie Twelve Angry Men was great because of the way all the actors played their roles to perfection. This is a type of movie were no sound effects were use so it required the actors to really become the character they were portraying in the movie. Something else that I like was at first mostly everyone said that the accused was guilty of the crime but then slowly the jurors began to change their minds except for one juror. Some of the things that I didn't like was the way it was filmed in black and white because it cause me to have less attention towards it than I would have if I was watching a regular colored movie and also how the whole movie was just filmed in that one room and this did not allow us to see how the jurors lived their lives and acted around other people outside of a jury room. Between the movie or the play I would say I like the movie more because I am more of a visual person I learn things faster like that but other than that I thought the movie was interesting because of the way it allowed me to see and believe that character were who they really were when I was reading the play.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Take On 12 Angry Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally think the movie Twelve Angry Men is better then the play. Not just for the reasons that I like retro movies or that the acting was so bad it was kind-of funny. But for the fact that the movies plot connected to me in a way I don't think it connected with other people. Because I have a thing for law and I think that this plot and this movie/play showed me a different side of law that isn't really talked about, but is a big part of the process. The reason I picked the movie over the play was that I guess my era is used and is attracted to movies more then to reading also that it was funny that the whole movie was 90 minutes of twelve men sitting in one room which got really boring but not as boring as the play. This might not be the best. Another reason I don't like the play as much as the movie is that. I don't think everyone was interested as I was and didn't really follow along and when it came to their part to read I was ready and they weren't ready to read which was really boring. Because yo9u would have to wait for them and I think I fell asleep a couple times. But overall the movie was WAY better then the play. If you're into law I think it's a must see. Well before you see the remake. Just for some laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Recently, i read the biography of Henry Fonda named as "Fonda My Life" inside which all the events and aspects associated with his life (both personal and professional) were highlighted. He started his career as a stage actor and gradually became one of the most matured actors of Hollywood at that time.12 angry men is undoubtedly one of the major milestones of his career. his biography as a source i came to know that 12 angry men was the only film that he produced in his entire film career. Due to the disappointing performance of the movie at the box office Fonda decided never to produce a movie again. but this film was critically well acclaimed and after watching the movie i understood why is it so....if you wanna ask for my personal opinion about this film then i only want to say that _ if you want to learn how to make a low budget masterpiece then there are numerous lessons that you can come across after watching this film.yes, some people may say that this film is more than 50 years old (black &amp; white, of course) and will not match up with the expected standards of the new generation. But it is a fact that 'Old is gold' and 12 angry men is a classic example of it. staying consistently at IMDb top 10 list is not a child's play. watch this film and you will come to know how much powerful it is.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant In It's Simplicity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forty three years since the release of Sidney Lumet's debut, in a current cinematic age where films seem increasingly judged on the strength of their special effects or CGI, how refreshing it is that 12 Angry Men can still be considered a masterpiece.On the face of it selling the premise of 12 Angry Men is no easy feat. The film focuses on the jury in the case of a young man facing the death penalty for the murder of his father. However, what's different is that 12 Angry Men is set almost entirely within a single, unremarkable room, as the twelve jurors try to reach a unanimous verdict.Featuring such cinematic greats as Joseph Walden, Lee J. Cobb and the superb Henry Fonda the film relies purely on an excellent screenplay, fantastic dialogue and consistently excellent character development as the various prejudices of the twelve jurors are revealed. Because of unspectacular setting there is a fantastic feeling of claustrophobic suspense that dominates throughout Beginning with 11 jurors convinced the man is guilty, only Henry Fonda's character expresses any doubts. As the film plays out various ballots are taken where the characters give their verdict and increasingly Fonda's character places doubt in your mind that the other juror's opinions are clouded. In the history of film there are very few directors who could capture the suspense that Lumet generates from such a shabby, sparse setting, for instance each time the men take a ballot and it is revealed more and more of the jury have their doubts.Compared to the stunt filled, special effects marathons that seem to dominate our screens today, 12 Angry Men still stands out as a ray of light that proves beyond doubt that excellent dialogue, screenplay and acting talent wins out on CGI any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twelve angry men in one fine movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this, Sidney Lumet's debut feature, we're taken into the jury room as twelve jurors deliberate over the fate of a young man accused of murder. All of the evidence points to a guilty verdict but one juror is determined to explore every possibility for reasonable doubt, lest they send an innocent man to his death.One remarkable thing about this film is that it unfolds almost completely in real time within a single room. While that might sound like a limitation, Sidney Lumet managed to keep the visuals interesting throughout, resulting in a well-deserved Oscar nomination. Meanwhile, Reginald Rose's taut, Oscar-nominated script deserves equal credit for keeping the narrative flowing.Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, the cast is stellar. Henry Fonda turned in a solid performance in the lead role and all of the supporting actors gave it their all. In my mind, the standout performances came from Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley &amp; Jack Warden. However, the group as a whole is a diverse one and each of the actors contributes a unique piece to the puzzle.My only complaint (a minor one) is that the mechanics of the script are sometimes overly apparent, particularly in the early stages when Fonda's character supposedly has only a vague apprehension about certain pieces of evidence. Luckily, when the story unfolds it is compelling enough that I can forgive the screenwriter's dramatic license in setting up the events.At the moment this film is rated #8 among the top 250 films on this site. I think that it definitely deserves a spot on the list but the current ranking seems somewhat generous, especially when you consider that it's above the likes of "Casablanca", "Seven Samurai", "Chinatown", "2001: A Space Odyssey" and several other highly acclaimed films. So, by all means, see this movie but don't be surprised if it doesn't turn out to be one of the ten best films of all time.</fullReview>

I won't point out how well this movie was directed or how well this movie was written or how well actors acted in this movie because in case of this movie and some handful of other movies talking or arguing about these things doesn't matter. Some movies are not just about entertainment, some movies are beyond than just entertaining, some movies are something more than just entertainment and surely this movie is one of them.This movie is a perfect example of multiple aspects of human nature. This movie gives a perfect example of justice. This movie shows how reliable justice is and why justice is not always justice. This movie gives an idea about why world issues doesn't solve and not only an idea about issues of today's world but world issues from any age.This movie has a huge influence in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 50s are known as the age of the big picture ? the epics and the uber-budget monstrosities. But it was also the era when the Indy film came of age, and every now and then a mini-budget wonder peeped through between the tall trees of the major studios. And 12 Angry Men is quite literally a small picture, taking place almost exclusively on the one set. It's unusual that a production that is so minimalist in terms of locations is derived not from the stage (as was, say, Rope) but from an earlier television edition ? testament to the growing influence of TV at that time.This is the cinematic debut of director Sidney Lumet, who has something of a flair for these claustrophobic little dramas (he also did the job on Murder on the Orient Express and Dog Day Afternoon). Already you can see him thinking about how to turn the one space into several different kinds of space. We begin rather objectively, with the camera holding back unmoving in a far corner as the jurors potter about. We then gradually close in, the shots becoming more personal. Crucially, the camera now often follows actors around as they move (especially the restless Ed Begley) to get that more aggravated feel to the shots. Finally towards the end the camera starts to pull back again, revealing the group dynamic as they spiral into heated argument. Lumet shows his inexperience (some shots don't match up very well, and the close-ups are too close) but essentially his ideas are geared in the right direction.Such a tight little drama calls for some first class acting. Henry Fonda gives a subtle, considered performance, showing with his face and general demeanour that he is really not thinking just about how to persuade the other jurors, but about the implications of the trial, and the life that is at stake. Fonda clearly understands that Juror #8 is not simply a man doing the job he has been called up for, but one who has found himself under the burden of an almighty responsibility. Lee J. Cobb gives a performance of great power, and one that is needed since it is really his character that ends up holding the emotional weight of the picture. Honourable mentions also go to George Voskovec and Martin Balsam for giving the most realistic and human portrayals of the other jurors.12 Angry Men is a hugely affecting and effective piece of work, not to mention a really neatly structured one. But is it perhaps sometimes a little too neat? It ought to be entirely believable, entirely smooth and unforced in feel, and yet too much of the dialogue seems so calculated. The writer's thought processes are too much on display. I'm talking, for example, about the way Juror #3 keeps saying something so perfectly hypocritical at exactly the ideal moment. And while it's true that each character must clearly represent a different attitude or segment of society, some of them are embarrassingly stereotyped, and the twee acting styles of Joe Sweeney and John "Winnie-the-Pooh" Fiedler don't help. None of these things is a big enough flaw to bring 12 Angry Men tumbling to the ground ? don't get me wrong, this is still a mighty picture ? but they do serve as a warning that the little pictures are just a susceptible to corn and gimmicks as the big ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Outstanding movie. Every single character have done exceedingly well. What i have liked most about this movie, is that, it gives a message to everyone---don't pass the verdict unless you are sure about all the facts.Juror #8 Henry Fonda made a point first, then Juror around him started to make points. Among them some are afraid to to accept the truth, even when Henry Fonda proved that the old man who testified in the court was wrong.The movie became most interesting when the voting result was 9-3 to not guilty. One of the juror made a point that he believes the boy is guilty because an woman testified it in the court and even Henry Fonda could not explain it, then the old juror and the most experienced one notice the rubbing around the nose of the juror. And that eventually solved the problem.It showed to us how a small little facts can change the whole thing. The movie is so amazing that you can not distract for one moment.</fullReview>

We want to hear them again. We have as much time as it takes".And for this movie i am not convinced if i can stop watching this timeless epic again &amp; again.For the conclusion part.I am not sure if the boy was guilty or not.The truth is no one would know.I don't want to know.If you have any arguments.convince me by watching 12 Angry Men!!and decide for your own sake guilty or not guilty.</fullReview>

This movie confluences the intellect of the script writer with impeccable direction and formidable acting performances. The way the case was resolved, dealing with disclosed facts and the analyzation of the witnesses' testimonies in pragmatic way is extremely tremendous, and thus, making it one of the best in the history of Hollywood.

		<shortDescription>A classic study of "reasonable doubt"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before seeing this film - and having never served on a jury - I hadn't seriously contemplated the meaning of "reasonable doubt" in a legal context. Now, I can't imagine a better explanation than what's shown here. It was amazing that they accomplished so much with a simple set and somewhat stilted acting. There's never a dull moment, as you might expect from a film shot in just two rooms (court and jury).Every juror should watch this film to avoid tunnel-vision, especially if a death sentence is possible. It's common for people to lock on to an opinion and stop thinking entirely. Including those who consider themselves skeptics. The Fonda character represents a proportionally rare critical thinker.Knowing how thick-headed folks can be, especially those who fly the flag of conservatism, this film made me wonder how many court cases are decided fairly vs. hastily. Note the review on this very site titled "Another Liberal Propaganda Classic." Courts need to screen for small-mindedness before all else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew this was a popular film, but as I came here to review it tonight I noticed it is currently #7 On IMDb's top 250 and with good reason. It has so much to offer and has twelve very unique individuals, they all exploded with personality.I had always wanted to see this movie, but had no idea really what it was going to be about. The title tells me its about a jury obviously, but I didn't know if it would be a trial and then a jury or what. I love how it turned out, I found no flaws in this film. I would give it a perfect 10 but that is reserved for my all-time faves.It quickly goes from the courtroom to the jury room, only showing the young defendant for a brief moment. We never hear the trial but 11 of the men come in and start off about how it is an easy verdict and the kid is guilty case closed! One man (Fonda) is not that definite, he is not saying the kid is innocent, he isn't saying he's guilty, he just thinks they should talk about it.They all get mad at Fonda but they start talking it out, we then get to hear the case via their discussions. As time passes more and more facts surface and they start to change their votes one by one. I personally was on the edge of my seat the entire time so eager for more. It really starts to show these men as individuals and we get an insight in the minds of men, not just the jurors but each man there is representing people as a whole and thats the beauty of the film. By the end of it all they are all on the not guilty side and the journey to get there is some of the best time you will ever have watching a movie.Each actor was amazing, all stand alone as separate visions of man, some younger, some older, some angry, some sad, some bitter, those who seek reason and those who place blame.The directing was great and to spend all but 3 minutes of this film in one room and keep it alive must've been a real challenge for the director. The room is somewhat big, but he had to get up close and personal with the men, and also show the viewer a sense of claustrophobia that one must feel. A fan that didn't work on a hot day and rain forcing them to close windows were beautiful touches. The large wall of windows with a tease of the outside world and most of the men bluntly stating they have some where else they need to be. It was just a beautiful film.100 percent drama, all dialog, but simply amazing to sit thru, as nice to watch as it is to listen to the arguments and reason. I can't say anything that hasn't been said about this film, I am no critic, I just love movies and few touch me and move me and entertain me as this one has.</fullReview>

Fortunately not all people are the same.Out of 12 people we may find one man who's able to turn the rest around, back on the tracks of justice and moral duty.To put it simple, what do we obtain if we put 12 different men, and when i mean different, i mean different like fire/water, in the same room? We get an outstanding sample of how things really occur in the jurors chamber.It's not pleasant, not nice. Every character has it's own faulty impressions, it's own flaws, defects and those things have a direct importance in making a vital decision, a life and death one.Whether it's right or wrong, who cares?,justice won't prevail, never did, never will, there's no objectivity, everything comes to those 12 angry men.Well, seems like juror no8 has something to say about the failure of the USA justice system.It's a proof of character and civic duty to stand in front of 11 men pleading guilty, and say not guilty, "like a pain in the ass", like an obstacle in front of "more important things to do", like there is something more important than the life of a young man. Maybe i'm naive, but i'd like to think we live in a fair world, even if the reality shows us something else, I admire and salute the presence of juror no8 in this classic, beautiful interpreted by Henry Fonda. Funny, how one man can make a difference, this is in fact the whole message, that a single man can turn things around, if he keeps his temper and shows character.We live in an unfair world, that's the inconvenient truth, the question is: what are those involved in the system, especially the jurors, going to do? Watch carefully and find out.The budget is ridiculous, but what do you need money for, when you have Sydney Lumet? Big budgets don't guarantee success, 12 angry men is the proof. This one is more than just a movie, it's the truth we all know and do not say. Think that the same situation could happen again, if not already did, without Fonda being there to literally save the defendant, what then?Very very impressed and overwhelmed by this movie.That is why I rate it a well deserved 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is on trial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a film that takes place entirely in the jury room of the deliberation on a murder case. With the finest of acting, this film guides the audience through the details concerning the murder. At first, the jury box is almost overwhelmingly against the suspect. However, through unbiased questioning of by one of jurors (the only one that is truly unbiased) the audience is quickly drawn in as they realize that it is not the suspect that is on trial, but rather personal bias. This movie is sheer genius and will thrill the audience as they begin to ask questions such as what do we know and how do we know it. This is truly a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good characters, but predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know much about the movie before I started to watch it, except the fact that everyone says it's one of the best movies ever. When that one member of the jury said he thinks the boy is not guilty, I instantly knew that he is going to convince the other 11 members to believe that by the end of the movie. I think the plot is good and that I couldn't know HOW he is going to make them believe that, but it wasn't really exciting for me. On the other hand, I liked the way they think and how they pay great attention to the details. They are all great actors and great characters, nicely built. I give this film 7/10 because of the story, characters, the acting, but I definitely don't think it's really that stunning, nor a masterpiece. I just wasn't thrilled enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb acting pulls you right in</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favourite movies. The quality of acting is outstanding and this helps one become immersed in the story (despite it being black and white and shot, for the most part, in a single room).The 1997 remake is actually a good film but the inevitable comparison with this one does it no favours. Both are, in my opinion, great showcases of character acting.One other thing I particularly like about this 1957 film is the cinematography - it's very well shot and you can get a real sense of feeling enclosed in that jury room. This adds to the atmosphere of the film and I think deserves a special mention as it's often overlooked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Character summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie Twelve Angry Man revolves around twelve jurors deciding the fate of the young boy who is accused of murdering his own father with a switchblade. In the beginning of the movie, we see the accused boy for a brief time and the judge telling the twelve jurors to make their decision. After the twelve jurors enter the jury room, they decide to take a preliminary vote to "see who's where." During the preliminary vote, jurors # 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 12 immediately puts their hands up while jurors # 2, 5, 6, 9, and 11puts their hand up due to peer pressure. Juror #8 is the only one who voted not guilty. After the preliminary vote, juror # 12 suggests to "convince" juror #8 by going around the table telling the reason for their vote. Juror # 2 says he voted guilty because he "just think he's guilty," while Juror # 3 says he has "no personal feelings" but the "fact" all says that the boy is guilty. Juror # 4 says boy's alibi was "flimsy" and couldn't even remember to movie he saw. Juror #5 asks for pass while Juror #6 says that the people's testimony was strong. Juror #7 believes his guilty because of his past criminal life. Lastly, Juror # 10 also believes in the testimony of an old woman who said she saw the killing. The other jurors did not tell us the reason for their voting. Although some of the reasons are logical and reasonable, the other reasons are not logical such as juror # 2 where he says he just "thinks" he's guilty and juror # 4 where he just believes his guilty because of weak alibi. Throughout the movie, there were many evidences pointed out by many of the jurors. Some of the things that motivated their consciences are their own experience with their sons and their prejudice. There were a few main pieces of evidence against the accused. First one was the switchblade used to kill the father where it is believed that the switchblade is one of its kind and store manager identified it, however, it is revealed that it could be easily bought for $6 at other stores. Second Evidence was the testimony of old man who lived down stairs. He said that he heard the killing and saw the boy run away after killing the father. Last main evidence was the testimony of an old woman. She said that she was trying to sleep when she saw the boy stabbing his father through the windows of the train passing by. The two antagonists of the movie are juror # 3 and 8. They were forced to pit their wills against each other because while juror # 3 believed the boy to be guilty, the juror # 8 continuously said the boy is not guilty. In the end juror # 8 won as the juror # 3 changed his vote to not guilty. The juror # 8 won because he firmly followed his conscience while juror # 3 let the emotion get better of him saying "I'm gonna kill you" and "we can throw away all the other evidences." By the end of the movie, the jurors started to realize that the evidences have faults in them. Throughout the debate, jurors gain many new insights to the evidences. The first evidence, unique switchblade is discovered to be not unique at all and can be bought for $6. The two testimonies by 2 people also is discovered to be unlikely. It is almost impossible for an old man who has a bad leg to walk across the long hallway just in time to see the boy run away. It is also highly unlikely that the old woman without glasses can see the murder happening clearly through the windows of the moving train. The hearing of the body falling down and words said by the boy can also be false as there was a very loud train passing by them at that time. Lastly, the phrase "I'm gonna kill you" are said everyday without actually meaning to kill someone. As the discussion went on, many jurors started to get more insight to the case and started to change their vote to not guilty. Two of the jurors who changed their votes are juror # 9 and juror # 7. Juror # 9 says he changed his vote because he respected the juror # 8 standing alone and trying to help the boy out. This swayed the juror # 9 to wanting to hear more and discuss about it more deeply. Juror # 7 however, changes his vote just because he is "sick of all the talking" while he really just wants to go to the ball game before it ends. I believe that the juror who had the most mature conscience is juror # 8. Despite being pressured by the 11 other jurors, he believed that you can't send a boy to the chair just with 5 minutes of discussion and voted not guilty following his principles of human life. He did his best to convince the others that the boy may not be guilty and succeeded in the end. The juror with the least conscience is the juror # 7. He was very impatient during the whole discussion and frequently joked about the case and the life of the boy like it was nothing important. He even changed his vote only because he wanted to go to the ball game before it started. He was acting only for his benefits and following the ego level of the conscience. The movie Twelve Angry Men explores wide range of conscience levels and the discussion involving human life. Throughout the movie, there were many changes occurring between how jurors saw the case and what they believed. I really enjoyed the movie and how the jurors changed as the many of the evidences started to prove inaccurate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For some reason I had not heard of this film before I sat down to watch it with my fiance last night. I'm ashamed to admit that I can sometimes be reluctant to sit down on a weeknight and watch a wordy, black-and-white film; when my fiance explained to me that the entire movie is set in one room I sighed and settled myself in for the long haul.Luckily what I watched was a brilliantly made, flawlessly acted masterpiece of tension that would not let me drift from the screen for even a single second. I have honestly not seen such an ensemble of brilliant actors working together like that for a long long time, if ever. This is a superb film and one that has left me thinking deeply about it, and looking forward to seeing it again.If there is one gripe it would be that some of the points raised by Henry Fonda as the original dissenting voice among the jurors, would surely have been made by even a bad defence lawyer (finding out whether the only eyewitness to the murder wore glasses, for example); but the point here is not the innocence or guilt of the boy, but the motives of the men in reaching their opinions on his guilt."Twelve Angry Men" is a brilliant set of character studies and one of the finest films I have ever seen. Such a refreshing way to spend an hour-and-a-half in an age when we are constantly bombarded with big-budget, empty-headed blockbusters. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

It's hard to add anything new to what others have already said. I've seen it twice now, and I'm still blown away by the fact that it was almost entirely shot in one room, with an unchanging cast. The character development is just fantastic. And you know what blows me away more than anything?

		<shortDescription>Utter cinematic perfection!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's ultimate masterpiece "12 Angry Men" is a paramount in film history and is certainly the most memorable of courtroom dramas, a film that stands true to what intelligent, perfectly-made cinema ought to be.The plot is simple enough. It's about twelve men from different social backgrounds and jobs who make up the jury of a murder trial for an 18-year old kid who has allegedly stabbed his father in cold blood. They (the jury) must now retire to a private chamber and discuss the verdict before sentencing the murderer to either death or freedom. The entire film, then, takes place inside this chamber and follows the arguments and quite heated discussions between these twelve angry men, as they attempt to reach an unanimous vote.From the start, while the men accommodate themselves in the room, we're introduced to them and their personalities, their likes, and basically we gather enough information to discern the type of person each of them is like. Also, they are never identified by their names, but are referred to according to how they were sitting in the trial, with a number from 1 to 12. It is in this setting of anonymity, of a locked room which is practically boiling in heat, that twelve different personalities clash, different points of view are alternately objectified and refuted, and the future or doom of a man is tactfully decided.It's a masterpiece, I tell you. The screenplay is sent from cinema heaven (Reginald Rose is a masterful screenwriter), for what begins as a discussion to eliminate all possible doubts becomes a passionate, gripping and utterly suspenseful probing into a different area of human bias. The ball is bounced back and forth among different subjects, and it's such a harrowing game they play that we watch transfixed through the entire duration of the film, uncertain of anything and equally unsure what to make of it. Is the kid really guilty or is he innocent? No one knows, they merely speculate, and like one of them says, "Who knows what could be worse: sending an innocent kid to his death or letting a cold-blooded murderer free to do as he wishes?" The theme is searingly vivisected and analyzed, and you'll find your own morals, ideas and reasonings both questioned and assured in a mind-blowing way.Apart from the terrific screenplay (enhanced by rapid-fire, witty dialogue), Sidney Lumet has done wonders with space and cinematography. The fact that such delicate and controversial topics are being dealt in a stifling hot room by twelve men who are rapidly loosing their patience deals for an emotional powerhouse. Nothing can be avoided. Also, the camera angles, the focus of the camera itself, makes the room even seem smaller and more suffocating by the minute, with increases the heat of the arguments and the sharpness of the remarks. I read somewhere that the first shots in the movie are taken at a high angle and they slowly decrease to a point where, by the end of the movie, they're below the character's faces (I watched the film again and this fact is true). Also, different lenses were used to give the impression that the walls were shrinking. I tell you, it's cinematic perfection.The acting is point-perfect. Henry Fonda delivers a searingly intelligent performance as one of the jury members who poses most of the troubling questions, and amongst the other twelve, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall and Jack Warden are equally powerful and entrancing. Overall, the film lasts a little over an hour and a half. But it's an hour and a half of pure delight, of witnessing amazing cinema unlike any we've seen in recent times. I mean, the film was made in 1957, and it's still as fresh and as original as if it had been released yesterday, even with an unnatural quantity of courtroom dramas that Hollywood spews out.I've seen my good share of courtroom dramas, and even in my young age I happily come to discover films like these that even having been done way before my time still manage to be more interesting than many.Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is one of those films with a high reputation, high in the IMDb top 250 and a rare 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I too think its a very good film.The premise for the film is very simply, a jury of 12 men much decide on whether an 18-year-old man is guilty of murdering his father. If they find him guilty then the defendant would be sent to the electric chair. The film is set in a small room, on one of the hottest days of the year in a New York Court. The jury at first vote that the man is guilty, all but Juror #8 (Henry Fonda). He believes there is enough reasonable doubt and it is up to convict them of that, looking at all the evidence, witness testimony and pretty much the whole trial. Juror #8 is a righteous man who is trying to do the right thing, give the man the fair trial he deserves. He gains allies along the way and they are sympathetic characters, but they are rivals, especially the hostile Juror #3 (Franchot Tone), who is convinced of the man's guilt.12 Angry Men is based on a play by Reginald Rose, and it shows with excellent dialogue, a tight plot and great character development. It's writing at its best. The director Sidney Lumet, keeps the film within it play roots, keeping the film in a close, claustrophobic environment, like a real jury would be under. They are some wonderful shots and close ups, especially at the beginning when follow many different conversations in one continuous tracking shot for 5 minutes. Lumet knew how to work the camera, use the script, keep the tension going and gets the best out of his actors. This is a strong debut from a legendary director. 12 Angry Men is also great example of an actor's film. You believe in these actor's performance and all of them are on the top of their game, matching each other. Henry Fonda said this is one of his favourite films. Some of the characters are likable, some unlikeable, but all are real.The film also raises questions about legal ethic, the American legal system, the American constitution and is international in its message to any country that has trial by jury. It shows many different sectors of American society at the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I agreed with the vast majority of the remarks made in the critiques of this great movie - I think you are on safe ground when you call this film a 'classic'.It has always been a source of surprise to me that Henry Fonda had to wait until he was almost dead before the Academy Award voters finally got the wool out of their collective heads and gave him the Oscar he had deserved for 30 years.Fonda is the only real 'star' out of this movie but I have always been a fan of Jack Warden - a really excellent supporting character actor. E. G. Marshall is another of my favourite support actors - finishing his career in big time movies with an excellent cameo in 'Absolute Power' - the only David Baldacci book to successfully translate to big screen, thanks to Marshall and the excellent Gene Hackman. None of the reviewers mention much about Ed Begley - not the greatest of actors but good in this and also in 'Million Dollar Brain' playing a megalomaniac with KKK overtones.</fullReview>

I loved every second of it. For starters it is beautifully written, and I believed in every second of it from start to finish. I was completely absorbed, as if I was in the room with the characters themselves. Also, the entire plot is extremely clever, at the beginning I had my doubts as to whether the man would be able to convincingly persuade the others to vote not guilty, but I was totally convinced.

The whole movie is directed in one set i.e. the jury room. The movie is an exemplary example for how to convince a whole bunch of people who are against your views. Henry Fonda has presented the idea of making others believe in ones opinion very convincingly.This movie doesn't present a bland way to convince others, but gives an idea of how to read between the lines, how to be attentive at a discussion and how to uncover the loop holes in a particular case.This epitome of a movie surely deserves to be in the top notch of all the movie ever produced</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying I couldn't expect anything more from a film than what "12 Angry Men" provided. I don't know how else to describe this film than by writing the following statement. "12 Angry Men" is immaculate, impeccable, flawless, perfect and astounding. Pardon me for writing these many superlatives but this film is a classic Masterpiece in the true sense of the word. I absolutely loved it! The movie has one of the most simple plots and only runs for an hour and 36 minutes. It is predominantly shot in a single room and its in Black and White{released way back in the year 1957}. So whats so great about this film you ask? Well to start with this film has 12 stars...Have you ever seen a film with more stars? Probably not. These 12 stars are none other than the 12 Jurors who have to decide a boy's fate. All they have to do is to vote whether the boy is GUILTY OR NOT? What follows is the greatest and maybe the longest conversation in a film I've ever seen. You won't believe how different and unique these 12 men are.Juror#1 : A guy who appears confused and tries to calm everyone else around him so that they can reach to a conclusive verdict. Juror#2 : A shy person who doesn't speak his mind but understands the situations.Juror#3 : A dominant personality who appears very firm and a successful businessman.Juror#4 : The most logical of all.Juror#5 : A young man from a violent slum who maybe understands the boy's situation the best.Juror#6 : A well built man, principled and respectful.Juror#7 : A sports fan who doesn't care much.Juror#8 : An architect who deeply thinks about the case.Juror#9 : {I liked all the characters but the most interesting was this one} A wise old man whose experience speaks for himself.Juror#10 : A foul mouthed and an aggressive person.Juror#11 : An immigrant watchmaker and a supporter for the justice.Juror#12 : An advertising executive who likes to be with the majority.As someone had commented before "If you ever see only one Black and White film make it this one"...Rightly said. Kudos to that Guy. Will always remain in my Top Movies list. Go see it!9.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never served on a jury and therefore have no idea what is involved in full but this film drags you into this jury room and makes you pay attention to every second and gives you an insight as to what could happen should you serve as a juror. Apparently all but 3 of the 96 minutes length of this film was in shot in that room. I am not into camera angles and lighting and such its the whole effect that I am interested in and the experience of watching this film was spellbinding. When I watch this film I am always drawn to the one voice in the room who isn't sure about the guilt of the accused. Just imagine being in his shoes under those circumstances and you can see how easy it would be to say yes he is guilty can I go home now, after all the eleven other jurors are probably right so I will just agree with them. But this one juror applied a certain amount of logic and was determined enough to resist the jeers and negative comments and demand that he be listened to and of course he gets his concerns over and most people know the ending. In real life a mans life could have depended on whether the guy was going to speak up or not. That is a scary responsibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe it!This movie belongs to the 50's.IT'S 53 years old!! And still,it is a huge success.We don't have this kind of movies any more.I don't even think there is any other movie like this one.It's one of those movies that makes you wonder.I've seen a few movies of this kind.This one made me think about the fact that many young people(including myself,until I saw this movie)think the movies older than the 90's are pieces of crap.Well,some of them are.But many aren't.And this is the best example.It's black and white.It all happens in one room(or whatever,most of it).But that's what makes it so good.See it.It really is one of the best in history</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No funny characters. No complex story. No huge cast. Just about average acting. Keep the story tight, not too complex. And stick to it and don't deviate. End result? Grand Success. Thats what this movie tells us. The story could be about anything. It doesn't have to based on a real-life or an inspiring story. 12 Men talk about a same thing which will decide a young man's fate. How simpler could you put a story in a single line? Whats so breathtaking or even attention-drawing about this storyline? Really nothing.But as they talk, we are amazed to see how people could take different views over a same thing. Its also amazing to see, as a movie, the strength relies on the story and how it is told and not on characters,photography etc! The acting is just so cool and everybody gets a good share. Almost ninety percent of the movie happens inside a room where these dozen men do nothing but talk. Perfect drama-thriller with no nuisance characters or scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's "12 Angry Men" (1957) has me laughing out-loud every time I see it. This is not because I dislike the film, but because the director makes it seem so easily done, it makes you think you could do it yourself. The acting is a complete dream. Henry Fonda, E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Robert Webber are exceptional. But the real star of the film is Lee J. Cobb. He immense's himself so completely into his role that its hard to believe that the movie isn't a documentary. The ending of the film, with that look on Lee J. Cobb's face is heart rendering. Lumet's directorial debut (he had been previously in TV) is as remarkable as Orson Welle's in "Citizen Kane". A brilliant piece of film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simplicity At It's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's undoubtedly one of the finest works of cinema directed my Sidney Lumet. The actors portray the characters that they depict so wonderfully with such brilliance that one tends to get totally engrossed in the film and script. The script should be appreciated for it's simplicity- 12 Jurors and just one room. The audience gets tense and sweats in suspense as the final verdict comes closer. And also a great work of camera is done by Boris Kauffman where he makes the screen less wide as the end approaches that the viewer too gets the feel of the tension and the claustrophobia. It's intriguing to know how 12 different people come together and use their varied experiences to come to their final verdict.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brainy, thought-provoking movie without any action, romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a rarity to find such a film without any action, romance, comedy etc. and especially no commercial elements. Well, you can see that it's made in 1957 and maybe that's the reason...?!!The movie starts with a scene in the court(as usual in some movies) where the accused has been proved guilty and given a death sentence for committing a murder. Here comes the actual part of the film, where the scene now shifts to the jury room, where twelve men take part in a discussion. The beginning 20 minutes gives the details of jury member, how they're here. It's not so surprising that one decides the life of a boy/man by deciding him guilty or not guilty in order to get to a baseball game!!!As usual, you find an exceptional guy who keeps mum throughout the introduction of the movie(and steals the show for the rest of the part of the movie!!!). He's the only guy who said he thinks the boy was not guilty since there's a little doubt in the murder. And there it starts, the whole discussion takes place with a few breaks and at the end of vote count there seems to be increasing support for the boy being not guilty. However, there's a twist almost at the end of the film, where juror 3 and 4 tear apart the theories of the boy being not guilty. It's not the actual hero who proves the accused is not guilty, but watch for yourself.Another one whose performance is to be mentioned is the role of Lee.J.Cobb who's also the executioner and shows up the emotional stress at the end, exceptional performance of the father!!! Finally, I give the movie thumbs up if you're not a fan of action genres, but you enjoy a thrilling ride not through adventure but dialogs that's been crisp and provide a superb stroke of intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a film which should be taken for what it is. A brilliant and engaging script draws in the viewer and as the events unfold, we are left truly captivated.The film shows how perceptions in human nature can be clouded by bias, prejudices, or indeed ones' desire to see a baseball game. The subject is even perhaps less about the actual guilt or innocence of the chosen party, than the turmoil the jurors have in deciding so.Although this movie may be a tad plot-driven and lacking a bit of creativity in directing, taking the film for what it is, it is a great success.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men Great Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A beautifully told story. It all takes place inside a single room ? and yet so much happens that it is never dull and never slow. The intensity is constantly tight, and it gets tighter and tighter as the film progresses, leading it toward its climatic ending that reveals so much about humanity and how we become stunted by our prejudices. Lumet, who is of course one of our brilliant filmmakers, is great in that he never let's the drama (which often is very intense) or the acting go overboard. Furthermore, the film is very unpretentious. This frank approach to the material is exactly what makes it so believable. Instead of being weighed down with the philosophical, good 'ole drama takes the lead, and the philosophical undertones instead allow each moment to soar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1954 vs. 1957</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Archive of American Television has finally come out with a DVD version of the original Studio One teleplay, "12 Angry Men" by Reginald Rose, directed by Franklyn J. Schaffner, who did many Studio Ones and much later was the director of "Patton". I can now compare it to the famous movie version, starring Henry Fonda, which was directled by Sidney Lumet three years later. A lot of the things Lumet gets credited for in some of these reviews are already present in Schaffner's staging, including starting with the high camera angle and ending with the close-ups.A key difference is that the TV version is only an hour long, (actually only 50 minutes due to commercials), while the film uses 96 minutes to tell its story. Some of the lesser characters suffer as a result. In the film Robert Webber's nice-guy businessman wants so much to go along with anybody else that he changes his vote simply to be part of the majority when the tide turns. In the Teleplay, we never learn why Will West changes his mind. Edward Binns as juror #6, is very protective of "the old man", Juror #9, (played by Joseph Sweeney in both versions), in the movie. He clearly sees him as a similar to his own elderly but beloved father. In the teleplay, Bart Burns is little more than a spectator, except for one key moment that has nothing to do with the old man.But the big difference is in the lead actor, Robert Cummings, (He was "Bob" in a comedy, "Robert in a drama"), vs. Henry Fonda in the film. Fonda is, of course, an actor of much greater repute but Cummings was much underrated. He was a thoughtful actor in dramas, carefully weighing his words and inviting the audience to think along with him. As Juror#8, Cummings portrays a man who is not sure of himself as the beginning but wants to answer some key questions before he makes a decision. In the film, Fonda seems like a man who has already decided to vote "not guilty" from the beginning and is trying to figure out how to loosen up his fellow jurors from their stances so he can draw them over to his view of things. A key point is that fact that the lady who "saw" the murder through the windows of the train wore glasses. In the film, Fonda divines this by noting how E.G. Marshall, as juror #4 rubs his nose to deal with the irritation the glasses cause. It's the final piece to the mosaic Fonda is trying to create. In the teleplay, it is Burns' juror #6 who makes this point after watching juror #2 and this seems to be the final piece of the puzzle for Cummings who for the first time, has become firm in his decision to vote not guilty.His two antagonists are jurors #3 and #10. #10 is Edward Arnold in the teleplay, Ed Begley in the film. Both are good. The scene where #10 is ranting on about "people like that" is more effective in the film. It's just a matter of timing. On TV, the jurors get up and begin to walk away as soon as he starts talking. In the movie they do so more slowly, each one making the decision on his own. Franchot Tone, another underrated actor, (he started out playing charming men about town and wound up playing garrulous old timers), is just as strong and forceful as Lee J. Cobb. His true motivation, his resentment of his own son, is hinted at early but is not part of his breakdown at the end. In fact, he doesn't break down at all. He simply surrenders. He doesn't become Cobb's "shell of a man".As to the other jurors, Martin Balsam has more to do than Norman Fell as juror #1, the foreman. Martin's a nice guy who just wants everybody to get along. We don't' know that much about Norman. John Beal's role as juror #2 just calls for him to use his watch to time Cummings' performance as the old man walking and to wipe his glasses clean at the right time. Marshall came through a little stronger than Walter Abel as a relentless "logic machine" who can't think outside the box. Lee Phillips is solid as the shy young man, somewhat ashamed of coming from a disadvantaged background. Burns has little to do besides noting the significance of Beal's glasses. Paul Hartman is OK as the guy who wants to leave early, (he has tickets to the theater, not a ballgame). Much of the additional dialog in the movie goes to Jack Warden's version of this character. Sweeney and George Voskovic are the only two actors in both versions and both are fine, with Voskovic underlining the significance of this procedure to someone who came here to experience freedom. Missing though, is his empathy for the defendant as an outsider like him, which is emphasized in the film. West, as indicated, is a non-entity in the teleplay.On the whole, I'll take the movie over the TV original but it's a close thing. But the TV version, which was "missing" for many years, is certainly worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic movie which lives up to its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 angry men must be one of the most unpretentious classics ever. The reason I say this is because most classics either have a reputation for being long epics about war and love (ala Gone with the wind) or for being slow moving movies which may not be accessible to all (ala Citizen Kane). But this one was different. It is a movie about 12 jurors who meet to decide a young man's fate. The whole movie is shot in the same building and mostly in one room. And it deals with human nature and how people behave when in a group. These are universal themes that anybody can relate to. The style is also very simple with no unnecessary complications or flashy camera-work.12 jurors are now required to take a tough decision - to decide about the guilt of a young 18 year old boy. If found guilty, he would be put to death. At the beginning, most jurors are in agreement over his guilt except for one of them. That is Juror no.8 (Played by Henry Fonda). One of the jurors then gives an opinion that the rest of the jurors should try to justify their decision to juror no.8. The arguments go back and forth till the end. These exchanges are very interesting because of the emotional nature of the discussions.Most of the jurors have set opinions on social issues and these are exposed during the discussions. Objectivity is in short supply and juror no.4, a stockbroker is notable in his objective analysis. Juror no.11 (played by George Voskovec) is also notable for his detailed analysis and opinions on the case. Juror no.7 is noticeably disinterested in discussing the case as he has already made up his mind over the guilt of the accused. He, in fact, is more interested in the baseball game in the same night and in cracking jokes when serious discussions are in progress. I did laugh at most of them. One of them, about a hair-splitters convention, was especially hilarious! Juror no.3 is one of the jurors who are convinced about the boy's guilt. He becomes too emotionally involved with the case and details and at one time even moves to punch Juror no.8 before he is held back by others.Juror no.2 is usually timid but gives valid arguments when asked for his opinion. His exchanges are also sometimes quite funny! Juror no.5 is another person whose opinions are clouded because of his past perceptions and opinions. Juror no.1 is a man who tries to direct the group and he does his best to break up unnecessary arguments. Juror no.12 is an advertising executive who is quite self assured and confident at the beginning but then becomes doubtful about his opinions on the case. He sways back and forth based on the evidence presented and the arguments laid on the table. He tries to crack jokes and often the others don't find it very amusing. But once he makes an off the cuff remark and most of the jurors find it funny. It is scenes like these and the attention to detail that make the movie special. Juror no.9 is an old man who has lots of life experiences and speaks on the basis of that regarding the case. He also brings up some very good points especially one towards the end.Henry Fonda is obviously the center of attention. With his kind eyes and his screen presence, he is definitely the pick of the actors. Jack Warden(Juror no.7), with his great sense of humour and easy natural acting style, is one of my personal favourites. It is quite unusual for a fifties film. Lee Cobb's performance as Juror no.3 was the most emotionally charged role in the whole movie and he has given a powerful performance that at times gave me goosebumps. This is one of the best acting performances on film. George Voskovec as Juror no.11, the immigrant watchmaker, is also quite good and he is especially good in the scene where he confronts Jack warden about his decision. That scene is my favorite in the film. E G Marshall as the stockbroker, juror no.4, gives an excellent performance as the impassive and objective man who gives his opinions in a detached manner without any emotional connection whatsoever. The others are also great in their respective roles.I didn't expect to like this movie based on the premise but instead I loved this movie and it has become one of my favourites. This movie has great replay value and this is because of the great performances and the smooth screenplay which doesn't have one unnecessary scene which might drag the movie. This is one of the classics that might appeal to a large majority of people unless they get turned off by the premise itself. This is Sydney Lumet's masterpiece and it is such an original idea that it deserves to be placed as one of the great classics of cinema.10/10</fullReview>

How it become anti-thesis &amp; arrives in the end with synthesis on a discussion table among these 12 jury is a thing to watch here. Sidney Lumet has directed so many brilliantly scripted films but this one is his real masterpiece &amp; remains classic forever. Without a doubt this is Henry Fonda's career best performance played with a reasonable nuance. Lee J.

		<fullReview>Now here's that kind of a film, writing about which is a major task! Words are not enough to describe this gem, which after 51 years of its release, has stood the test of time..and still packs the punch. All the newfangled courtroom dramas of later times cannot hold a candle to this "classic" in the true sense of the word. I was shocked to read it performed poorly at the box office on initial release, in spite of the huge critical acclaim. The movie, which is the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet, is the film adaptation of Reginald Rose's play. The screenplay for the film was penned by Rose himself. The story is fairly simple, with 12 jurors assigned the task of presenting a verdict on the case of a boy accused of killing his father. What seems to be an open and shut case, takes an ambiguous turn when one of the jurors votes "not guilty" against eleven others voting "guilty". This leads to some immensely gripping and taut drama full of very interesting debate that never lets up until the words "The end" appear on the screen! Wonderfully directed by Sidney Lumet, this is quite possibly the best film of his career. There are lots of unique features of this film. The cast is all-male. None of the character names are revealed (almost). They only have a "juror number" to identify each other by. The entire film (with the exception of a couple of small scenes) is shot in one small Jury Room. The performances are all superb. The most notable ones are those delivered by Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Joseph Sweeney, George Voskovec, Ed Begley, Jack Warden and Jack Klugman."12 Angry Men" is a movie that is sure to appeal to every generation. It is one of those "immortal" movies that never age with time! And it is surely an example for all filmmakers and movie-buffs. No special effects, no stunts, no gimmicks...just pure drama, thrilling and powerful!Go and buy the DVD now..and preserve it..for your kids..your grandkids..your great-grandkids......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born more than 40 years after the release of 12 Angry men so I'm from a different generation than the crowd that first saw it. I only know Lumet by his new films and I think this is the first film I've seen Henry Fonda act in. This is why I could watch this movie unbiased and without prejudice.12 Angry Men is one of those rare movies that would not benefit from modern cinematography or acting. It is perfect as it is. Obviously the movie is this great because of its screenplay but all the technical aspects of it were at least on par with it so I had a really hard time guessing what decade the film was made. In my opinion what determines a movie's timelessness is its rewatchability and the ability to attract new viewers from new generations. 12 Angry Men definitely has both of these characteristics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is about 12 guys who are all dealing with hostile feelings. The characters played by Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, in particular, are very angry. These two actors do anger really well. When they are not out right agitated they seem grumpy. It's like they got up on the wrong side of the bed every day of their life. It's fun to watch them get mad too. Lee J. Cobb excels at shouting at people. He yells at Henry Fonda a lot in this film. If John Wayne had played the Henry Fonda part, Wayne would have pulled out his six-shooter and at the very least, clubbed Cobb on the head when he yelled at him. Fonda keeps his cool for the most part even though he too has his moments of anger. It's not easy to be the loan dissenting voice when everyone around you is so gosh darn mad without getting a little hot under the collar yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"12 Angry Men" is the antithesis of today's blockbusters and blockbuster-wannabes. The successful action movies trim their dialog in favor of chases, fights and stunts. Many films which depend on dialog have a lot of empty chatter.The twelve actors in Sidney Lumet's jury room face no such emptiness. Every line in the film either contributes to the case (deciding whether or not an accused murderer is guilty) or says something about the speaker. All of the actors make their characters live in verbal and silent moments.An early example of an actor silently projecting his character comes when E.G. Marshall (Juror #4) ignores a fellow's attempt to hand him a business card. #4 comes across as a person who feels infallible and superior to everyone else whether or not he speaks. His imperfections are sweated out (literally) over the debate that follows; he responds by using his listening and speaking skills better.Meanwhile, #10 (Ed Begley in the difficult role of humanizing an unrepentant bigot) becomes the angriest juror for a while. He's sociable at first, and he did pay attention during the trial (as is evident when he points out facts to the dissenting #8, played by Henry Fonda). But he contributes little substance to the deliberations. His favorite phrase, "know what I mean?", always comes at the end of a complaint or a bigoted remark. Finally he goes on a rant which antagonizes all of the other jurors (even Lee J. Cobb's seemingly similar #3).Most of them react by leaving the table. Jack Klugman's slum dweller (#5) goes first. Jack Warden as the "I couldn't care less about the case, let me go to the ball game" #7 slouches in his chair. The only other juror who stays seated is #4, still in the "Guilty" camp but already a changed man, and he utters a devastating counterpoint to the other jurors' silence.#10 retreats to a corner, too ashamed to return to the table. He may never express his bigotry so openly again, although he will always be closed-minded (books are at hand where he sits, but he doesn't touch them).When 12 actors talk in a room for an hour and a half without a moment of tedium, full marks go to all twelve along with writer Reginald Rose and director Sidney Lumet.-Tony</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is the tailor-made type of movie that was common in the 1950s but has become non-existent today. It is all dialog, relies heavily on acting, and is short but sweet in its running time. All this adds up to one of the most satisfying watching experiences available in the movies. Henry Fonda plays a juror who has a "reasonable doubt" that the boy they are trying might not be guilty. From beginning to end, no matter who is standing against him, he continues to vote not guilty.Slowly, but surely, Juror #8 begins to raise questions and doubts about the validity of the witnesses boy being and the evidence against the boy being accused of his father. Soon, more than just one juror thinks he may not be guilty, and this leads to some fantastic drama.For this type of movie, the two most important issues were handled very well. The acting is top-notch all around, especially Fonda as the quiet, gentle man who sees something wrong with how most of the jury takes the evidence blindly. Lee J. Cobb also sticks out as Juror #3, a man with severe personal problems that tend to influence his decision. The script is tight but very good at exploring all areas of the judicial system and the stereotypes many of us have about it. All in all, this movie very openly discusses the importance of life and how when it hangs in the balance of a group of men's hands, it should not be rushed into but rather thought out and analyzed.Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of pacing the movie and keeping the suspense all throughout right to the final shot. It isn't a movie everyone will enjoy, but for those who want something more out of their movies, 12 Angry Men says something and then some. One of the best court-room dramas ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The defense and the prosecution have rested and the jury is filing into the jury room to decide if a young Spanish-American is guilty or innocent of murdering his father. What begins as an open and shut case of murder soon becomes a mini-drama of each of the jurors' prejudices and preconceptions about the trial, the accused, and each other. Based on the play, all of the action takes place on the stage of the jury room.With a simple plot and a simple movie, simply put, this is one of the best movies ever made. From the sound of the plot, many of you might be unpersuaded, but the movie is that interesting. It's not boring as you think! It's like the action film filled with special effects for the previous generation! (I know, I shouldn't assume audiences these days love action films with special effects, but you get the point)What's so brilliant about this film is that it's timeless and with one setting, you are pulled in the movie. The movie is also a study of human nature. It's not just "OK, we need 12 votes to release the convict or execute him." The dialog is also tremendous. I've never heard a set of dialog this good since, maybe, "Pulp Fiction."The film is taut and, at times, suspenseful. The performances were excellent. The film is very interesting and brilliant from start to finish without a second of boredom. This is the classic you would want to watch before you die!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the great courtroom drama of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, it's between "A Few Good Men" and this for the best courtroom drama, but most likely this is it. This is not the type of film I would typically expect to even be interesting. Nearly all of the film takes place inside a single room, as one lone juror (Henry Fonda) tries to convince the other eleven that the accused party is not guilty of murder. The film is composed of nothing but dialogue, but don't let that stop you from watching it. Few films can rely this much on dialogue to keep its viewers interested the entire time. Like all great courtroom dramas, "12 Angry Men" is an intense film, not because it is action-packed but because we must watch twelve men make up their minds and weigh all of the evidence. It is intriguing what each of these men come to realize as they ponder for hours upon end. Not a bit boring. I can watch this film multiple times and still be fascinated by it each time. The acting is some of the most superb I have ever seen, causing the audience to feel the tension going on in the room in each scene. An absolutely perfect movie.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The script of this movie was nominated for an Academy award. Why it didn't win it I don't know. Why it didn't win 10, or 100, or 1000 Academy Awards for the writing I don't know either. It is the most gripping script I have ever seen, and I have seen it several times.Even the best script needs good actors and a good director to have its potential realized. In this case, there were no impediments to that realization. There is not a weak link in the 12 actors chosen to play the jurors. Every one of them is perfect, every one of them gives a masterful performance.And they work together to create a masterpiece because the director did a masterful job of making this movie build to an unforgettable but completely motivated climax.Never in the history of Hollywood has a movie that cost so little to make been so great.=========================================Added 2 February, 2014: There are few movies I will watch more than once. There are even fewer movies that I will not interrupt when my stomach tells me it is time for dinner. This is one of those few. TCM ran it again this evening, and once I saw it on, I couldn't stop watching until the end. There is more great acting in this movie, and more great direction, than in a dozen other "great" movies. It's all great performances and brilliant camera angles to drive them home. A masterpiece.My question at the end, however: what happened in the life of the character played by Lee J. Cobb (spectacular performance) that caused him to hate the accused so?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1957! I've said it before and I'll say it again: What a year for FILMS! PATHS OF GLORY, THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL, and this film, 12 ANGRY MEN, possibly the best of the lot. BRIDGE won Best Pic, but personally, I would have given the award to either PATHS OF GLORY or this film, 12 ANGRY MEN. They are the only two films of the lot that I think are truly perfect. I've said that I would give PATHS an 11 if I could and same goes for 12 ANGRY MEN. It's hard to believe this was a director's film DEBUT! That's right, this is the FIRST film directed by the great Sidney Lumet, and perhaps his best. I'd say it is.12 ANGRY MEN is the most simplistic of tales: 12 jurors must decide the fate of a teen accused of killing his father. The entire film consists of these men deliberating, debating, conjecturing, and learning about the case. In the process, we the viewer get a valuable lesson in LAW 101. You'll learn more about the law and legal system in this 2-hour exercise than in any 100 episodes of LAW AND ORDER. So simple, so true. The film is so flawless in it's presentation that you swear that the entire 2 hours is one long tracking shot of the 12 men in the room.The film stars the great Henry Fonda (as Juror #8) as the lone juror who finds the defendant NOT GUILTY. Fonda must convince the other 11 men that the teen is possibly innocent, that there is a REASONABLE DOUBT. The process through which he does this drives the film and is enthralling from start to finish. As the film progresses, you learn about each juror and what makes him tick. The other 11 jurors numbers 1-7 and 9-12 are, respectively: Martin Balsam, William Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, and Robert Webber. All actors are brilliant. Can't see an ounce of acting of showmanship in the entire film.I watch 12 ANGRY MEN virtually every time it airs and never feel like I've wasted my time. Now that's a great film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men - Top 15 films of all time Sidney Lumet's masterpiece follows a group of 12 jurors deciding the fate of a young teenage in a case that is seemingly overwhelmingly against him. The votes start 11 to 1 in favour of guilty and the one juror (Henry Fonda) seems adamant that he is not guilty. Remarkably the whole 96 minutes take place in the jury room, its ever so simple but captivating throughout which is why this film deserves its mounted praise and my standings of it as being up there with Hitchcock's Vertigo.Fonda pulled off a blistering and powerful performance playing the rebel of jury. He is the only one that has any belief in this seemingly condemned soul. But he teaches one important lesson that nothing is rarely as it seems. He manages to convince 11 other men of the jury that this man isn't guilty. A remarkable feat.This is one of the few films that can truly be labelled as a timeless classic, this didn't need action or special effects, just sheer cinematic brilliance that shines through the flawless script and the dynamic direction.Not only is the film convincing, its frivolously entertaining and a true milestone in cinematic history Perfection 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliantly filmed drama exploring human nature and the basis of morality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>96 minute film with all but 3 minutes taking place in the same room: that's daring. It's hard to believe, but director Sidney Lumet finds a way to make "12 Angry Men" move at an attention-holding pace while being hardly dull at all. Now that's film-making. Lumet's camera techniques and the phenomenal performances from the actors he captures makes "12 Angry Men" a terrifically interesting court drama that is so elemental but so profound.In the opening minutes, a 12-man jury breaks into deliberation over a case where a teenager has been charged with killing his father. If found unanimously guilty, the boy will be executed. After a preliminary vote, every man votes guilty except for one juror played by Henry Fonda, who is afraid of being too quick to reach a verdict.The story basically paints a picture of 12 strangers. If you follow closely, you can learn a lot about these people, but the point is that you learn a lot about them and what makes them tick as they argue and reason. The first thing achieving that requires is great acting. This film is loaded with classic actors of the 40s and 50s. It's hard to really single out one performance as the best, though certainly Lee J. Cobb as Juror #3 is the most dramatic and he very much helps give the story an adrenaline boost when his character acts out.But the most excellent aspect of this film, what pushes it above a lot of other drama, is Lumet's directing choices in what is his first feature film. Filming in one room, it can be easy to put little thought into camera angles and movement, but Lumet considers everything very carefully and no single shot in the film feels arbitrary. The camera moves with incredible purpose, zooming in at perfect speeds and picking angles that best reveal the characters. Also, his attention to the idea of the heat in the room, the impatience, the confinement, all comes across in his directing. His angles start above the actors in the beginning and thus more impersonal, but the camera lowers more and more as the film goes on. You're so interested in the story at this point that you don't even notice, but you feel it. Lumet makes you feel much like a 13th juror and you begin to form your own opinion, bouncing back and forth (that is if Lumet and writer Reginald Rose did their job right, which they do.)The film is--and this really isn't a spoiler--without a climactic payoff for those that need a little something more or a resolution or mystery solved. You're supposed to find it satisfying in the way that it reveals a bit about who we are and how we arrive at the moral conclusions we make. You're supposed to learn so much about these characters that by the end you're shocked that you never even learned their names. The film is like a social experiment on screen and it's very realistic and yet still very interesting. It's an absolute marvel for being stationary, dialogue-heavy film. ~MMRVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I actually learned a bit more about what it's like to be a jury from this movie. I've only seen this movie twice and they were both for a school project. I had to read the book and watch the movie, I was assigned jurors, although I got the ones who don't talk very much. It was pretty fun to do it twice. I do love to watch TruTV, I learned a lot what it takes to convict somebody, especially in a murder case. It be nice if there was a job to be a juror full time, instead of asking random people to do it, and they don't even get paid that much either to be a juror. To anybody who likes to watch crime or cop shows, this is a true movie for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once More Around The Table</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A courtroom drama which spends about a minute inside an actual courtroom, "12 Angry Men" defies expectations in other ways, too, most particularly by not being a star vehicle despite starring Henry Fonda.It's a bit of a Trojan Horse, too; screenwriter Reginald Rose making his case against the death penalty by showing a kid who appears guilty of having stabbed his father in a moment of rage and encouraging us to root for jury nullification, a la OJ, because he shouldn't have to die for his crime. If the charge wasn't first-degree murder and execution not concomitant with a guilty verdict, we might see the pesky Mr. Davis (Fonda) and his tireless "supposing" not much differently than does angry Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb)."It's now your duty to sit down and try and separate the facts from the fancy," a supremely bored judge tells the jury at the start of the movie.But a lot of "fancy" gets tossed around in the jury room, not just ethnic slurs from Juror #10 (Ed Begley) and baseball chatter from Juror #7 (Jack Warden), two solid early votes for conviction. Much of the fancy comes from Davis himself, who asks the other jurors to accept an odd set of coincidences and aspersions in order to ignore the stubborn fact that someone walked into a man's apartment and stabbed him to death with the same kind of switchblade that had belonged to his angry son."This kid's been kicked around all his life," Davis says. "He's had a pretty miserable 18 years. I think we owe him a few words."Does anyone really believe this should work? Well, in "12 Angry Men" it does, aided by Rose's clever manipulation, Sidney Lumet's seamless but unshowy directing, and a performance by Fonda that demonstrates his egoless mastery of the screen acting craft at its near-height. The supporting cast is great, too, even the underdiscussed ones like Ed Binns' salt-of-the-earth painter #6 and Robert Webber's marketing whizkid #12, who apparently invents Rice Krispies before our very eyes.The script does have its weak moments, none worse than when #10 goes off on his unfortunate diatribe regarding "them", in which all but two of his fellows leave their seats and symbolically turn away from him. A Richard Thomas stage production I saw handled this awkward business more cleverly. The music is a collection of ugly off-notes, and much of the background chatter is unconvincing."12 Angry Men" does have terrific setwork and piercing character moments, like how stuffy stockbroker #4 (E.G. Marshall) sniffily ignores #3's attempt to hand him a business card. Cobb as #3 is stuck with the most over-the-top moments, but sells them well. Cobb could yell with the best of them, and proves it here.But "12 Angry Men", while a good movie, is not great film, pushing a dubious rooting interest for a killer's freedom. Maybe he doesn't deserve to die, but "12 Angry Men" stacks the deck too much in his favor to be called high art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is highly recommended for anyone interested in group dynamics. The 12 characters are not caricatures: their complex motivations and thought processes are skilfully played out in an very dramatic--and yet highly plausible--plot, and this is certainly no mean feat. Analyzing this film can provide hours of fascination.The formidable cast gives virtuoso performances, particularly from Peter Fonda, Lee Cobb, and E.J. Marshall. The exchanges that take place in this small room--giving the feel more of a stage play than a movie--will stay with the viewer for many years. This film clearly deserves its current (July 2008) rank of 11 on IMDb's Top 250 List. The later remake does not do it justice--this is undoubtedly the version to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most amazing Movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard from a friend that this was an incredible movie, but I, not being a big fan of courtroom dramas, pushed it aside. One day at the public library, I saw it, so I decided to check it out. I went home and watched it. This is one of greatest movies ever made. A kid is on trial for murdering his father, and if the kid is found guilty, he will be sentenced to death. After the trial the jury begins deliberating. 11 out of the 12 jurors believe the kid is guilty. 1 man believes that the kid isn't guilty. From the first five minutes of the movie till the end, you are on the edge of your seat. The movie takes place in one room, and the whole point of the movie is one man trying to show 11 men that there are flaws in the prosecution's reasoning. In the movie each character has their own unique personality, but Henry Fonda gives an incredible performance with help from a great supporting cast. Fonda tries to convince the others that if they don't take everything at face value, and take other variables into account, and if they overcome there biased views, then the kid is innocent. This movie is a 10 out of 10, and a must see for any human being on earth!</fullReview>

Not even a single scene will make you feel boredom. Also, being a movie in the 50s, you should also analyze the adaptation of the movie. How the gentleman convinces one by one and makes his argument crystal clear, without dealing much about the actual victim. One added advantage in this movie is the dialogue delivery which can be understood by someone who is trying to learn English.Sheer Brilliance Screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You're not really going to kill me are you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those great films that, at the time it is made, tackles a difficult subject, but does so in such a way that it becomes that subject's definitive movie reference point.The story focuses on a young boy who is charged with murdering his father. Given a public defender as he cannot afford legal counsel, the case seems to be open and shut. He didn't know the films he saw on the night he was supposed to be at the pictures, he had bought the knife that was similar to the one that killed his father, he was experienced in using a knife and 2 witnesses saw him kill his father and flee the scene. Chances of mistakes, well, let's face it none. He'll be found guilty and as it is murder he will go to the electric chair.In Sidney Lumet's supreme drama 12 men hold the fate of this boy in their hands and within a claustrophobic room on a hot summers day the discussions that take place are more gripping than a hell of a lot of bland action films who rely on special effects rather then script, storytelling or performance. The acting within this drama is superb and Henry Fonda is magic as Juror number 8 who has some doubt as to the guilt of the accused. Everyone in the room is superb in their role, with a special nod to Jack Klugman as the guy from a poor background who knows the kind of area the kid comes from, Joseph Sweeney as the shrewd eyed Juror number 9 is also fantastic, but for me E.G.Marshall and Lee J. Cobb (Arguably the most underrated American character actor) are magnificent in their roles as Juror's 4 and 3, the clever juror who takes careful consideration of the evidence and Lee J, consumed by anger over his own child's independence and taking that out in the jury room.It is a fine film that has stayed the test of time that, although some of our current generation may find stagy and un-dynamic, is still as appealing as ever for a generation who enjoy having the cinema do some thinking with them about our world, and not necessarily for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men (1957)Number 1 - 1957Top 5 - 1950sTop 50 - All Time12 Angry Men is a simple but extraordinary film; it begins in a court of law where the judge reminds the jury at the end of the case that this is murder in the first degree and if the young man is found guilty he will fry on the electric chair. The rest of the film takes place in a jury room where disagreements, powerful arguments and strong points from the 12 jurors are made.At the beginning, it is decided that a preliminary vote should be taken to see where everything stands; 11 vote Guilty, but Henry Fonda votes 'Not Guilty' because he is not sure - this man respects the notion of reasonable doubt and he is willing to discuss before sending the man to the electric chair. The accused is actually a young kid (18 years of age) from the slums and many jurors immediately condemn him because of his breed and branding such people as 'liars and murderers'. Although Fonda meets stiff opposition at the beginning, opinions swing here and there until the very end where Lee. J Cobb brakes down shouting 'Not Guilty'.It is rare to see a film so simple yet so stirring and poignant in its meaning and value. What this film exposes so successfully is how the lives of men lie in the hands of 12 random people many who may just want to finish and go home, refuse to look at the evidence in a balanced way or more frighteningly be overpowered by personal prejudices and thus voting 'Guilty'. While great cinema, 12 Angry Men makes some great points about the judicial system in our democratic nations.Powerful performances from a variety of actors some unknown, great direction by Sidney Lumet and a very strong script, which is basically the backbone of this film.One of the greatest films of all time.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie a few times throughout the years and have always liked it.However, a lot of people bash it for stupid reasons.In high school, our 10th grade English class had to watch this. However, everyone immediately booed the movie for being "too boring" or "too old".And I read one "Hated It" comment here on IMDb. By user Jonathan Kwok. He claims this movie was bad because it was in black and white....and thats all. No supporting evidence, no in-depth details, no anything.It's safe to say that movies like 12 Angry Men are becoming more and more rare in favor of modern, dumbed down movies for our modern non-thinking public. And comments such as that are proof.The movie took something so basic as reaching a verdict and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece.Anyway, onto the film itself. There was not much music evident with 12 Angry Men, but thats what made it so suspenseful.Performance-wise, there are 12 excellent performances. Particularly Henry Fonda as Juror #8, the only one to stand up for his argument against all the others. Joseph Sweeney was also excellent as Juror #9, the observant, elderly juror who soon stands up for Juror #8. I personally also enjoyed John Fiedler as the meek, more quiet Juror #2; Jack Warden as the witty, smart-mouth Juror #7; and Jack Klugman as the slum-raised Juror #5.I really liked this movie, regardless of when it was made. That should not be a factor when viewing a movie.This is definitely a classic. Those with tastes for good films should check this one out. It's well worth it and much deserving of its place at #12 on the top 250 (as of 6/4/08).10/10</fullReview>

The story is about 12 jury members, who meet on a hot sultry afternoon to debate the verdict on a young boy, who is destined for the electric chair if the Guilty verdict is upheld. How each of the jury members fights his own perceptions, biases and prejudices and ultimately decides on the correct verdict forms the crux of the story.

		<shortDescription>"Prejudice always obscures the truth."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems that the message of 12 Angry Men (above) comes across as the film's only weakness. It starts with the very close of a trial that we never see and convenes immediately into the jury room, where we spend the rest of the movie. It seems an open and shut case, and by a show of hands, there are 11 jury members convinced that the defendant is guilty, and a single man who believes not that he is NOT guilty just that there is a CHANCE that he's not guilty. The film's weakness comes in because it seems that every single person who believes the kid is guilty ultimately reveals that they have some kind of personal vendetta and want to secure a conviction regardless of the sureness of the truth. The problem here is that people who believe in guilty are bad guys (and they rarely let you forget this, as one or two of them increasingly show off as brutish jerks, while the calm, endlessly likable Henry Fonda heads up the good guy side. Maybe the movie should have been called 11 Angry Men instead.There is also a certain level of ham-handedness involved in the initial presentation of how little the case means to most of the jurors. The story is about how important such legal cases are, because the decision that they make in that room will change someone's life forever, and it is absolutely imperative that they make the right decision. But at the beginning, all of the jurors have their minds somewhere else. They're talking about sports or their jobs or some other casual subject, and it takes one brave juror to stand up to the rest and get them to pay attention and think about what they are about to do.Sidney Lumet, in his book Making Movies, gives us invaluable insight into his goals and experience making 12 Angry Men, including the positioning of the camera (watch for the appearance of the ceiling late in the film as the tension mounts) and his brilliant use of lighting. Late in the movie, as the jurors remain in the room until darkness falls outside, it is so gradual and so cleverly done that we don't even realize the movie is getting darker and darker until they flip the lights on, and when they do, it's not just the room that is lighting up.The performances themselves have not aged well, but it is a brilliant analysis of some facts that seemed to so obviously point to one foregone conclusion, although I have to say that the film's other weakness is that a lot of the facts that they re-analyze (or analyze for the first time) should have been ridiculously obvious in the original courtroom trial. The jurors question for the first time, for example, the eyesight of the case's key eyewitness, who claims to have seen the murder take place at night and through the windows of a passing elevated train. I should hope that such a situation would have been scrutinized more closely by even the most inexperienced defense attorney, but maybe that person was secretly hoping for a conviction, too. At any rate, the film is a brilliant achievement, given that it is so engaging even though it literally never leaves the room. It reminds us of the importance of certainty in trials, even when the result seems completely obvious. The end of the movie is perfect, as there is only one way that it could really end (and I don't mean the jury's final decision), and yet it is not predictable. This is one of Lumet's most glowing achievements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1957 is a miracle year.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the other great events and movies I may not know, since I was born in the 80's, I was awed by the two greatest productions of this year. The bridge on the river Kwai and 12 Angry Men. Both of them has enough power to blow you out of your mind and possibly your seat, but hopefully not your window :) This production is of course not a very big one, not involving any CGI or action sequences. But, it just proved again a movie should essentially be justified by its story, not the visual effects, unless you can make all the visual effects a part of the movie, which will not be discussed here. 12 Angry Men is, to my surprise, not really a "court" movie, but instead, a jury room movie. 99% of the story was told in the same room, showing 12 men talking with each other in probably the real time. When I realized this, I was fearing the next 90 minutes could be a boring torture. But I was sooooo wrong.The interactions of all the characters are simply awesome. Henry Fonda is not less and not more than what he intends to be--a good guy. Thruogh the 90 minutes all he was doing was to bring justice and truth back to the eyes of jury, I was surprised by how advanced the director's cinematographic and editing were. The atmosphere of the jury room got more and more intense and it seemed the truth and righteousness was being enforced by some unseen hands. people may become stubborn, some of the jury even was so negligent that they never really cared about the death and life of the accused. But, this is still not the concentration of the movie. The movie, is a 1 and a half hours miracle about fate being changed, not about stubborn people's mind being changed.Simply brilliant. And truly meaningful. The movie inspires people in many ways, including being a good man, which is most wanted in this century, I mean the 21st century.10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Courtroom Drama at It's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too much we often think that courtroom dramas are full of suspense and sometimes an overkill of information presented, but this film has stood the test of time and become the classic courtroom drama.A man's life is on the line, and twelve men must decide his fate, send him to the chair, or set him free. They were the chosen few to serve their community, and ultimately serve the accused. A doubt of guilt can change even the most unlikely of outcomes, and that is what we see in this film. Raw emotion is let loose, as one by one, each man finds that the accused is too, human.The jury was hung because of one man's belief that there might be some reason of not guilty. Standing by that, he tries to convince the other jurors as well. Starring Henry Fonda and directed by Sidney Lumet, this is one great film you should see. Only one word can describe this film, excellent, and that's the icing on the cake.</fullReview>

The actors don't just play, they really LIVE, the characters a real people - I forgot it was Henry Fonda, I looked at him only as Juror #8! The same with the rest of the players. I re-watched the scene in which Juror #10 gives his irritated speech about the poor, and the rest stand up one by one and turn their backs on him, and it was one of the best movie scenes I've seen in my life. The tension, the atmosphere - perfect. Absolutely perfect. I just didn't expect that, I just decided to see this movie for fun, but now it right in my personal top 10, and very high! Great job, Mr. Lumet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men does not obfuscate its theme with superficial clash-and-bang, chill instilling spoofs which leave viewers tremulous after the feature like sweet chocs leave children appeased yet inevitably desirous of more. Exploitation of special effects and the plethora of augments which bog Hollywood main-stream projections leaving the essence of the plot line non-existent or heavily in question is not exercised in Sidney Lumet's sublime and profound production. 12 Angry Men plays spontaneously in accordance with the nuances of a dozen jurors who have, placed before them, a case which involves powerful yet questionable evidence against a young man who presumably murders his father. Eleven of the jurors find the testimonials of the only two alleged witnesses incontrovertible while one dares to differ and hence through impartiality and a strive to revivify the loose pieces of evidence which feebly serve to incriminate the accused, bolsters the rest of the reluctant jurors to spend several hours of self-sacrificed time for arriving at the most logical conclusion. The performances in the film are starkly genuine and each actor fits his respective role like a glove. No other film of it's classical era and genre may best serve to enlighten, entertain and stupefy you than this internationally loved and strongly enduring saga of courage, recalcitrance and what it means to indulge a reasonable doubt in a situation of life and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine example of the golden age of Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recently my housemate and I had a film marathon involving SCANNERS and TRUE LIES, two films I have seen before and will see again. After these two he suggested '12 Angry Men' a film I had never heard of before and wasn't really in the mood for. I was very wrong. The film itself is excellent and a true calling card for the classic and noir period. A period where anger is displayed through shouting, not shooting, and this shouting is done using the English language...not a flurry of abuse we are so used to these days. I am blathering I know BUT this film surprised me, made me laugh, worried me, interested me and angered me, all the things that a very good film really should do.The fact that all of this came from a film where the characters are in one room for 98% of the run time is an even bigger example of the timelessness of the piece. I will be watching this again.dan'SOB SOB! NOT GUILTY!'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film's budget must have been miniscule, but nevertheless it is more interesting to look at and listen to than 98% of movies out there! The personalities in this film represent a microcosm of American, and the attitudes contained therein. There are leaders, skeptics, ignorant ones, and those who care about justice and the American way. This film is a celebration of the American justice system. This is a film where the story is capture by great dialogue and great monlogues. The shots that capture the subtle emotions and movements of the characters are magnificent. No over-pretentious or over melodramatic ending, but a satisfying one nonetheless. Here the American Justice system is put to the test and the patience of 12 angry men is put on trial on one of the hottest days of the year...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A trial is held, the accused being a boy who is suspected to have killed his father. We don't see how the crime was committed, instead we hear how it happened a little bit at a time when the juries are talking.At first, all juries seem convinced that the boy did murder his father. They all vote on guilty except one jury who seems to think otherwise. He comes up with logical theories that slowly turns other juries' opinion on whether the boy could really have committed the murder.Juror #8's theories prove that the court's decisions can always be wrong, no matter how many distinguished and intelligent people have worked on the case. The conviction of the boy by other juries show how easily people can be swayed and follow general public's opinion even the juries. Juror #8's analytics of the case ultimately show us that anything done by humans can always have errors, even when a life of a human being depends on the cost of the errors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful and biting tale of average America. 12 angry men is a story about 12 jurors in post trial deliberations regarding the fate of a young ethnic man for the murder of his father. As the story unfolds, we get to see how each juror decides guilt or innocence in a true testament to the intellectual diversity of 50s America, and indeed present day America. I can give current names to each juror from people I know personally. Made prior to Bill of Rights reforms and Miranda rights, the way people make decisions on guilt of innocence is timeless. Stereotypes, ethnic hatred, past fraternal experiences transferred onto the defendant all masterfully depict human frailties. In the end one lone voice of reason tries to Socratic-ally make the jurors look within themselves to identify the flaws in their decision making process. Innocent until proved guilty, the human condition, society in general is on trial here. This movie has a place in everyone's collection. This is real life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Ensemble Performance in Still Potent Jury Room Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the recent deaths of Jack Warden (just this past week) and John Fiedler, only Jack Klugman survives from the original 1957 movie cast of this blistering, uncommonly well acted drama, a triumphant first feature for now-revered director Sidney Lumet. Written by veteran TV scribe Reginald Rose, the story takes place almost entirely within the confines of a Manhattan jury room. Already overheated by the scorching weather, the twelve men are locked in heated debate over the fate of a ghetto youth accused of murdering his father. Over the course of ninety minutes, we get to know the individual personalities of the jurors in ways that surprise even themselves in a most claustrophobic setting.The chief battle occurs between Juror #8, who believes a comprehensive discussion of the evidence is necessary before coming to a verdict, and Juror #3, who is convinced it is an open-and-shut case. The drama unfolds as the others move from one side to the other, as questions of objectivity and neutrality are put to the test with each character. It certainly helps to have a sterling cast of familiar faces inhabit the roles of the nameless jurors. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8 with his becalming dignity constantly stretched by the ongoing pressure of a fast verdict. Never the most subtle of actors, Lee J. Cobb is a blustery force as Juror #3 as he slowly reveals his own personal issues leading to his seemingly intractable guilty verdict.E.G. Marshall plays the cold-blooded elitist stockbroker, while Edward Binns is the inarticulate house painter intent on maintaining a sense of fair play in the room. Warden is a small-time hustler only interested in making the baseball game, Fiedler (later memorable as the meek Mr. Peterson on "The Bob Newhart Show") is the eager bank teller who demands to be heard, Martin Balsam is the overly accommodating foreman uncomfortable in his role as the foreman and Robert Webber is the glad-hand pre-yuppie willing to go with the crowd.The most vivid impressions are left by Ed Begley's unapologetic racist, George Voskovec's dignified watch maker, Joseph Sweeney's seemingly befuddled senior; and Klugman's shy juror who more than anyone else, comes to empathize with the accused. The film's one slight flaw is that it tips its hand at the outset with the tone of passivity emanating from the judge and the wide-eyed fear in the accused's face. The black-and-white film comes in a clean print on the 2001 DVD but little else except the original theatrical trailer. A masterful work of economy and escalating dramatic tension.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the all time greatest character-driven works in the history of film making. It's even more remarkable when you realize nearly the entire story (with the exception of a prologue and epilogue each less than a minute in length) takes place in one room.Henry Fonda, as the lone juror who stands for the acquittal of an accused murderer, is probably the best remembered performer, but his 11 co-stars turned in astonishingly powerful characterizations as well. It's a who's who of TV and film heavyweights, and no one misses a beat anywhere.The Black &amp; White filming style echoes the story's simple, one-act-play origin, aiming your focus on the actors and their high-intensity lines all the way through. Clever elements like an oppressively hot room and later a thunderstorm add some symbolic salt and pepper, but the actors are all commanding your attention so well that you don't even need such measures. The jurors come from all walks of life, with their own views of the world and life itself: the result is a fiery encounter with sparks everywhere. You are drawn in from the start, and each character becomes a real person.Bigotry, broken families, ambivalence, self-focus, patriotism, loneliness, fear, confusion, apathy, pride, arrogance; these are just some of the elements explored in this microcosmic analysis of the human condition, and what makes us who we are. The court system is held up as a high, lofty principal, the integrity of which must be fought for if it is to work.A great artistic endeavor, with one of the finest scripts ever written. Everyone should see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an exciting analysis of character this film could hardly be bettered. From the bored judge through the scared teenager to the twelve jurors, there is no chink of characterisation which is missing. We know nothing which is normally known, someone's name, their occupation, what their interests are, and so on. But each person in the room is required to open himself up to the gaze of the other eleven; we have prejudice, contempt, alienation, cooperation, cogent analysis of circumstance, violent emotion, vacillation and even humour despite the looming death penalty. This is the king of character analysis films and the screenwriter Reginald Rose is a genius.</fullReview>

Almost the whole movie is shot in a single room and thats where lies the command of the director over his craft. The performances of everyone is outstanding. Every person is shown to be a different character and has portrayed the same with at most sincerity. The other reason why this movie stands out i feel is that one is never bored or lost track of the plot even once during the whole movie in spite of most of it being shot in a single room. Also the manner in which the lone juror convinces others of his belief is different for different characters and is superbly brought out.

		<shortDescription>One of the best, if not THE best, courtroom drama in the history of cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's "12 Angry Men" is a film that would never appeal to me because of its old age and its black and white film, but once I started watching this, I couldn't help but get sucked in with everything unraveling in the jury room. There are no small characterization among the 12 jurors, with each one having a lot of resonance and importance to the story, something I found very well done thanks to Reginald Rose's script. Even though I think each of the 12 jurors are very well-characterized, the two that stood out in my mind are Juror #8 (played by Henry Fonda) and Juror #3 (played by Lee J. Cobb). Juror #8 is the main protagonist out of the 12, simply because he's the one who stood for the 18 year old Hispanic kid, who's convicted of murdering his father, from the very beginning. His determination and graceness carries throughout the film, and Henry Fonda played wonderfully in this role. Lee J. Cobb's Juror #3, the main antagonist of the film, is the definition of arrogance and ignorance. This is the film that should make Lee J. Cobb as one of the biggest defining actors in Hollywood history, and his performance as Juror #3 is very, very memorable. One of the big reasons why I didn't really enjoy watching "black and white" movies are that they feel too slow and have too much reliance on talking, but this one is an exception. Even though the movie is all talk, I found that the script is very, very well written and kept the tension going among the 12 jurors and its final outcome. Each character is distinctly different, with some similarities but also some differentiation, which makes each of the characters believable and relatable in one way or the other. The story, although strictly a courtroom drama, really gives a rather worldly aura within the interaction between the different jurors, since each juror has their own story to tell in relations to the conviction of the 18 year old Hispanic boy. Even though this is the only film I saw from Sidney Lumet, I can tell that if this is one of the movies considered classic, then I've missed out on others as well. He has done a very good job with keeping the story flowing and doesn't direct any jarring moments within the only place the jurors are in throughout the whole movie (the jury room). He kept the jury process interesting and engaging, something other courtroom drama didn't really do right. All in all, this should be the film that set the standard of courtroom drama. I don't think any film surpass "12 Angry Men" in that regard, so I think this should be on any serious film collector's collection. Sidney Lumet's masterpiece garners a 10/10 and is in my opinion the best courtroom drama ever filmed (unless I've missed out on others).</fullReview>

Always focusing on the struggle at the time and not cluttering the movie with the externals. It invites us to join struggle that happens once the trill is over. The writing and acting draw us into that conflict. I am particularly enamored over the black and white photography and the one room set. If color had been more widely used at that time, it would have changed the entire feel of the movie. I typically say that one must suspend their disbelief for movies.

		<fullReview>In my continuing quest of watching IMDb's top-rated films, I rented "12 Angry Men". Currently, this film is ranked #18 on the list. With names like Reginald Rose, Henry Fonda, and Sidney Lumet, the movie seemed very promising. "12 Angry Men" was also another example of bringing yet another well-received teleplay to the big screen, as had been done very successfully with Rod Serling's "Patterns" and Paddy Chayevsky's "Marty".Others here eloquently provide detail on the plot and characters. Simply put, the movie is filmed almost entirely on a single set, the jury holding room of a courthouse, where a jury of 12 men are deliberating the fate of a young man accused of murder.Many plays and musicals have been adapted for the screen and the list of failures is long. A notable recent example for me was "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead". Film viewers do not have the same expectations of a presentation as do theater viewers. In film, the expectation of greater variety and coloration is a prerequisite due to the viewer's previous experiences. Therefore, the danger of becoming "stagebound" can ruin a film's reception. For a play such as "12 Angry Men" where the focus is declamatory, this is an unavoidable danger.Happily, I found the film to be a resounding success. The strength of Rose's adaptation is complemented by Lumet's probing camera, which delineates the characters not only through impressive tight-focus shots, but through body language, gesture, and facial expression. The ensemble acting, underpinned by Henry Fonda's performance, is superb, as one would expect with such brilliant character actors as Lee J. Cobb, E. G. Marshall, and Ed Begley Sr. The storyline moves propulsively to a logical but powerful conclusion.I can't really think of any flaws. Some confrontations involving prejudicial statements are a bit obvious, but are unfortunately as relevant today as then.I wouldn't rate this as #18 on my list - I found the aforementioned "Patterns" to be a more engrossing film - but it's undoubtedly close to a classic. Kudos to all - I give it a 9.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deserves a perfect ten out of ten and has every chance to be in the list of all-time classics. It deserves the eighteenth rank it got in IMDb's best movies list. To summarize the plot: it is about twelve jurors on a murder trial. Eleven out of twelve think the defendant is guilty of murdering his father and one of them thinks, "Element of Doubt" still remains. The movie is about the character study of all the twelve people in that room trying to sift through all the evidence. The twelve men jury represent a cornucopia of Americans: the bigots, the prejudiced, the cool and calculated, the timid and the self-aggrandizing gloaters. It shows how some people get carried away by some outward appearances. At the end of the movie, we do not know if the defendant is actually guilty or not. We just know that there exists an element of doubt in the evidence provided. It shows how a careful evaluation reveals there could be something beyond what is obvious. As an academic researcher, I have been taught that most of the times, the most obvious solution could be wrong and this movie bears testimony to this fact. I think every jury member should be recommended this movie before he/she decides on the verdict.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a fine film with a terrific cast. Its Spartan set serves to draw the viewer into the intensity that churns throughout the deliberations of the twelve men constitute the jury in a criminal case. It is hard to imagine a simpler story line: the twelve person jury has retired to deliberate the fate of a young man charged with murdering his father. One of the number (Henry Fonda) votes "not guilty" in the first vote. The other 11 jurors, more or less convinced that they are discussing an "open and shut" case, immediately set out to prove him wrong. Instead, one expresses doubts about the evidence and proceeds to convince the other jurors, one by one, of the flaws in the evidence and the existence of a reasonable doubt as to the guilt. Nearly all of the action takes place in the jury room, or in the restroom adjacent to it. There is no recreation of the crime other than those portions of the evidence "acted out" by the jurors in the course of their deliberations. This film does not emphasize the police work, or the work of the lawyers in the trial, or of investigators, or forensic evidence. Instead, the viewer is drawn into the drama of twelve jurors trying to decide what is the right thing to do in the case. Each in turn reveals a bias or flaw in his logic that has caused him to view the evidence in a particular way. In the end, each is confronted to identify his blind spot and acknowledge that it is that blind spot that caused him to think the defendant guilty rather than a careful examination of the evidence. One just wants to get to the Yankees game, one believes if an immigrant is charged with a crime he has to be guilty, and so forth. There are two dramatic moments that stand out above the rest. The first is the speech by Ed Begley in which he reveals that his determination of guilt is based on nothing other than blind prejudice. During his speech, the jurors leave the table and turn their backs on Begley, who in the end acknowledges his bias. The second is when the final holdout juror, Lee J. Cobb, comes to grips with the fact that he hopes to punish the defendant as a means of vicariously punishing his own son, who has apparently rejected Cobb. Of course each of those instances are high melodrama -- would that racial or ethnic prejudice was as easily identified and eliminated as it was in the film -- but each is played out with sufficient intensity as not to seem hokey or contrived. The film does show its age in a couple of respects -- there are no women on this jury, and no people of color -- an all white male jury in late 1950's New York is pretty unlikely. Nonetheless, this is a superb film with tremendous performances by the ensemble cast. On another level, "Twelve Angry Men" betrays a kind of pre-Vietnam, pre-JFK assassination innocence about the ability of American ideals to triumph over all sorts of biases if only people are made to confront those biases. That idea is of course harder to sustain post-Vietnam, post-JFK murder, post-Watergate, but it is worthy of noting that not too long ago, it was still believed that such a triumph of ideals was possible. In the polarized nation we live in now, where the more obvious people's biases become, the more tenaciously they cling to them, the underlying message of "Twelve Angry Men" just might be one we need to hear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 jurors decide the fate of an 18 year old accused of murder who faces the chair. As the title implies there is tension and anger aplenty in the jurors room as the all-male cast goes at it including Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Ed Begley and Jack Klugman. A great cast and great script directed by Sydney Lumet in his first film. Lumet would go on to have a string of hit films in the 60's and 70's including The Pawn Broker, Fail Safe, Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and Network but has been fairly inconsistent since. Lumet certainly knows how to get the best of his cast when he has great actors to work with and 12 Angry Men must have required some strenuous rehearsals. A remarkable screenplay from television writer Reginald Rose who had originally written this for television in 1954. Like the film Marty that had also been a 1953 teleplay that was adapted to the big screen in 1955 by it's writer Paddy Chayefsky, Rose does the film screenplay based on his television teleplay. This was only the second film that Rose wrote a screenplay for and he would only do a handful of movie screenplays in his career which was mostly television work. Polish-born cinematographer Boris Kaufman who was a veteran of Russian, French, Canadian and American films does the photography here. It was nominated for three Academy Awards including including major awards in Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay but amazingly no nominations for any of the ensemble cast. Fonda, did win a Bafta and Jussi Award for Best Actor and was nominated for a Golden Globe and Cobb also got a Golden Globe nomination as supporting actor but the large cast must have canceled each other out when it came to nominations for the Oscars and all the other various industry awards. Passionate, gripping, intense, compelling drama. It's obviously dated with it's all-white, all-male jury and may be a little too heavily centered on the jury room with not much room for anything else but it's great character development and holds up well. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

Directing his first feature film, Lumet does a fantastic job of building the tension, with virtually all the action taking place inside a steamy jury room. As the calming voice of reason, Fonda leads a great cast, a motley crew of jurors composed of characters from all walks of life: the meek (Fieldler), the hothead (Cobb), the thoughtful old man (Sweeney), the poor (Klugman), the disinterested (Webber). We get to know each juror over the course of the movie as Fonda makes the case for a reasonable doubt. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One angry woman vs. "12 Angry Men"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men (1957)**** In 1957. following five films were in the competition for the Best Picture Academy Award: David Lean's "Bridge on the River Kwai", Joshua Lagan's "Sayonara", Mark Robson's "Peyton Place", Sidney Lumet's "12 Angry Men" and Billy Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution". Pretty impressive list. Not surprisingly, Oscar went to Bridge?The last two (12 Angry Men and Witness for the Prosecution) were both exciting and intense courtroom dramas. 12 Angry Men, written by Reginald Rose, was about 12 jurors with not an easy task ? to decide whether a young man is guilty or innocent on the charge of murder. Their decision must be unanimous. Witness for the Prosecution was a complex, unpredictable and full-of-surprises mystery from the novel written by famous Agatha Christie. Both excellent movies.Somewhere I read that Agatha Christie once said something like:12 Angry Men is an awfully stupid movie because it is not operating with the facts but only with the jurors' presumptions. I don't know whether she really said that (she'll excuse me if not) but this is rather pseudo-argument.Although it is true that the jurors are operating rather with "ideas" than "facts" in this film this is certainly not a flaw or weakness.Almost everything seems clear after the trial and jurors vote 11:1 for "guilty". Only, juror #8 (Henry Fonda) votes "innocent" not because he think he is but because he think that the boy deserves some discussion. Slowly, toward the end, one by one, all judges change their votes as a result of a long, intense discussions and quarrels.These discussions are the battle of nerves, personal observations, prejudices, moralities ? in a word ? characters. Because there is a little fact, jurors are forced to project their own perspectives. This is very significant, since it is happening in all courts and among all judges.While all the judges, one by one, reveal their thoughts, there is absolutely brilliant, detailed and consistent character development in this film. Also, since the judges are from the various backgrounds there's a superb representation of American society. In addition with the great directorial effort from Lumet (in his debut!), who made great atmosphere using special lenses, long cadres and extracting the maximum from the actors, we have a truly unforgettable film.Agatha Christie maybe created the great plot (also clever dialog) in Witness for the Prosecution, but "12 Angry Men" is digging much deeper.</fullReview>

We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human. It's the true whodunnit without Hercule Poirot. This is the element that is most obvious; that 12 men can sit in a single room for the entire movie and interact and still keep us totally occupied. Enough has been said about this. I just wish that contemporary film making could take a bit more from these masterpieces; let the fine actors that we have do their individual things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so good every time it's on I MUST! watch it. Black and white adds to grittiness of the movie. You can almost feel the closeness and heat of that jury room. Outstanding performances all the way around. This picture should have won The Oscar and everybody in it deserves an Oscar especially Lee J. Cobb who steals the movie from Fonda. Jack Warden is also a standout. THere is the scene where Ed Begley is going off on his racist tirade and if you notice(and this a goof)Lee J. Cobb is nowhere to be seen. Where is he? Then he's back. You eagle eyes at IMDb should check it out. I've sent you guys goof before and you have never acknowledged them. They are there but you guys won't send me an e-mail confirm or deining it. C'mon guys what's the fun in that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the 1997 TV version of this movie in 1998 and i was thrilled by the way the story is told in this movie. I saw this version a few years later and were more thrilled by this one, as it is so extremely realistic in its way. The clue sits with the actors and the director who can make such a movie out of only a few film sets. Yes the whole movie is filmed in a single room with 12 men in it, and the tension rises for every minute, and for every minute something twists and turns.It's about 12 men who are about to vote for the chair on a man on trial. But one of them want to hear more about the case, can this man alone make all the others turn their statement from guilty to innocent ? This is one of the best movies ever made, and proves that the storyline is what make great movies. See this, and enjoy.</fullReview>

Because it's THAT hard to isolate one great performance. They were ALL great.Every role had something in it worth watching.As of today (Feb. 2006) only the two Jacks (Klugman &amp; Warden) are still with us.This film deserves to be in a time capsule.

		<fullReview>When I was in junior high school I found this story in the back of one of the unused books in English. I can remember being so enthralled with the story that I read it all through class and then took it home to finish. Seeing a true to the story film version is wonderful. Didn't they really know what acting was about back then? When the acting had to stand out because that was what you came to see. Man I love the golden age of film. If you liked this then check out DOA that's another wonderful flick with a good message. I think that 12 Angry Men really showcases what being on a jury can be like. It generates feelings for these men and their story and it really does say a lot about the justice system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twelve great actors, one superlative director, one gifted cinematographer, one hell of a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much has already been said about this magnificent movie by IMDb reviewers but I would like to make one other plaudit, the creative synchronization of camera, script, and music that intensifies the drama almost to the breaking point. The outstanding acting by a handpicked cast has already been noted. Not one of the twelve gave a mediocre performance. It would be hard to say which one was best. Even the ones with the fewest lines shine as few Thespians can on the big screen.Oscar-winning cinematographer Boris Kaufman focuses in on the heart of what director Sidney Lumet and writer Reginald Rose are attempting to convey to the audience through the brilliant acting of all concerned. Watch as the jurors vote to make it six to six. The camera hones in for just the right lighting, facial expression, and angle to show the anguish and torment in the souls of these twelve angry men. It flashes to the key juror #8 (Henry Fonda) from time to time at just the right moment for the full effect of his deep conviction that the eighteen year old should have a fair consideration of all the evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty of killing his father. The use of shade and shadow, especially when the thunder storm crackles outside is used to show the tempest that rages inside the jury room. The heat that eventually makes even juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) sweat complements the heat of the arguments and debates that sizzle throughout the room.All this is simultaneous with a musical score by Kenyon Hopkins that matches mood to action in a perfect blend of all essential elements making this one of the best Hollywood films ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best things about the movie is the way the temperature rises along with the tension, until the rainstorm begins - and with the rain, the jurors are themselves prisoners until they can agree a verdict. And the way the characters interact is as good as any movie I can think of. And Lee J Cobb's performance is stunning - as different from many other roles he played as can be. His portrayal of anger and frustration is outstanding. Henry Fonda is as assured as usual - the voice of reason - but Cobb plays a man driven by his own demons who finally breaks, and as he does so, the jury are at last speaking with one voice. Keeping the cast almost exclusively in the same room serves well to heighten the tense animosities which stretch and test the will of each participant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Low on special effects but big on acting. This film is just great. Te atmosphere is steamy, the dialogue is great. Sometimes the simplest premise is jut the best. Henry Fonda was brilliant in "On Golden pond ", In Twelve Angry Men he touched the stars. This film though was not just a way to promote Fonda, the supporting cast are absolutely superb and must have been so easy for the director to work with. If anyone knows a film with a simpler series of sets building slowly to a crescendo due to the superb dialogue, please let me know. I end up sweating just watching the persuasive talents of the main protagonist of the brilliant movie. Please, watch this film and assess if the American way of Justice is the best</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twelve Angry Men is a testament to what a good director can do with little more than a good script and a room full of fine actors. Almost the entire film takes place in a single room - the jury room of a murder trial during deliberations. There's no need for spoilers here as the plot is obvious once you know the premise - the various characters try to convince the others as the balance ebbs and flows toward guilty or not guilty. You'll probably even quickly guess the final result, but as is often the case, the journey is more interesting than the destination. There aren't any gunfights, chase scenes, eye candy, or special effects bonanzas - just the dialog between the jurors. 12 Angry Men was made with 12 Fine Performances by 12 Exceptional Actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 angry men was a unique movie I ever saw, it was such a simple plot and extremely low cost movie marvelously done. I was told that this movie is showed in most top business schools to teach MBA students the leadership skills and the power of discussion. Lot of people would think how boring a movie would be if the whole movie is all about the jury discussion but it isn't. It keeps you engaged and you never even get chance to think that you are bored. An Indian movie "Ek Ruka Hua Faisala" was also made on the same plot and inspiration. That was also a very popular movie. Henry Fonda's role is so impressive and he did it right. I would so watch it even if you don't like the kind of movies where you have to put yourself while you are watching them, watch this one. This one is very very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Soft Sell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I made $26,000 selling marmalade." These are the words of Juror #7 as played brilliantly by Jack Warden in Sidney Lumet's classic, "12 Angry Men." Why did I post this quote, of all quotes? Because I am a fan of film titles, and this quote is a conscious reminder of the title, which is more importantly a reminder of what is really at work here: not a trial being decided by jurors, but an argument among men.While I suspect that most who might read this already know what I am talking about, for me this is a fresh idea. I look at the writing credits at the top of the IMDb page, and I see Reginald Rose is credited both with story and screenplay. Story? What story? Yes, it may have been quite an original idea, having the entire movie take place within a jury room, but that story is inconsequential and totally beside the point. We are not meant to understand the trial, which is more of a subplot. Was the defendant on trial guilty? Well, there was reasonable doubt, but likely the answer is yes.What we are meant to understand is the men. The trial is the background, it is what necessitates the characters' behavior, but it is not what makes the characters. The characters were just itching beneath the surface, and the trial is what makes them scratch.This brings me back to my quote, which I think was actually the most perfect one in the whole film, because it summarizes the film's truest philosophy: these are men who are faced with a tough decision, and their character -- questionable or not -- is brought to light because of it. It is refreshing to see a film that loves its characters enough to bring their worst traits to the forefront while at the same time not neglecting their humanity and thus, their propensity to be fallible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>INTP wins the day!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie about characters. "Personalities" come in second.The architect, an archtypical example of the Myers Briggs INTP type, saves the trial from going into disaster owing to a lack of consideration of key points.At this point, let me quote Jean Kummerow (et al), famous authors in the subject of this kind of type analysis. It refers to the Henry Fonda character's personality."INTPs are known for their quest for logical purity, which motivates them to examine universal truths and principles. They are constantly asking themselves and others the questions 'Why?' and 'Why not?' Clear and quick thinkers, they are able to focus with great intensity on their interests. They appreciate elegance and efficiency in thought processes and require them, even more so, in their own communications. They may be seen as unwilling to accept what everyone else regards as truth. While often low key in outward appearance and approach, the INTP is 'hard as nails' when challenging a truth. INTPs do not like to deal with the obvious. They are at their best in building conceptual models and developing unusual and complex ideas." This is what Juror 8 demonstrates right from the beginning. Not every INTP exhibits every feature listed above, but enough to get that point across. I recommend you conduct some research into Myers Briggs personality classifications if you are interested in understanding humans from a scientific viewpoint. There are "tons" of stuff on the web about this.I haven't bothered to fully assess the personalities of the other jurors. But on a second viewing, it could be interesting. We know nothing about the personality of the accused. We don't need to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a classic 1957 black-and-white movie, directed by Sidney Lumet, produced by Henry Fonda. Henry Fonda is also the lead star in the movie, playing the character of Mr. Davis who is one of the jurors.The movie shows how a person can keep a cool level head and still manage to convince even the toughest of people about something that is right.The movie also is intense in the fact that Mr. Davis manages to break the prejudice of 2 of the jurors. One of them was heavily prejudiced against slum-dwellers and feels the boy is "automatically guilty" since he is a slum-dweller and so according to him violence runs in his blood. Another juror is heavily prejudiced against unfaithful kids, because his own kid had deserted him and run away from home about 2 years back.A classic must-watch movie. There are many things that we can learn from this movie. The moral of the story is in a way to be simple, cool, sensible and level-headed.An interesting fact is that of the entire 94 minutes of the movie, 91 minutes are filmed completely in the juror's room and only 3 minutes are filmed away from the room.A pleasant change from modern day Hollywood movies,which seem to be overtly obsessed with intense computer generated graphics, loud background music, things blowing up everywhere on the screen, aggressive angry characters, etc.In "12 Angry Men", there's no overt aggression, no fight scenes, no fancy graphics, nothing. It just displays sheer amazing individual acting talents by all the actors.A must watch and a definitely recommended movie for your private collection.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 angry men is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most important American films ever. Ed Bagley is perfect as a rather ruthless, and somewhat, bigoted jorur. Henry Fonda give a rather fine performance as a cool under fire juror who is one the only ones to actual have an idea of what a juror should do. The way he baits at times the other juror members is amazing. Jack Klugman, in a small role, actually shows a true dramatic talent, serving him as one of the most versatile actors ever. This role, despite how small it is, Klugman gives a better performance then his more celebrated role on TV's The odd couple. My personal favorites of the movie are E.G. Marshall and Joseph Sweeney. Sweeney, in his last movie, leaves on a high note a wise old man. E.G. Marshall has a slight arrogance about him, and seems like he'd be the last person that Fonda would get to swing his way. Marshall almost upstages everyone else, despite like Klugman, playing a small role. Without a doubt, this movie is a must have for anyone collects.</fullReview>

If this is liberal - then shouldn't we all be liberals? Fondas character represents everything that could be great about the united states. Sad to say the America of today is more represented by the other members of the jury.Today there is no room for ambiguity. Those courageous enough to be publicly un-certain - are mocked.

		<shortDescription>And the verdict is...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet sits on my list of underrated directors alongside (among others) Joe Johnston and Brian DePalma. Their talents have either been abused or misunderstood, but this is not such a case.Spoiler minefield ahead...Courtroom dramas aren't interesting genres. Despite whatever plot twists are thrown there is always the 50/50 chance on verdict. In that case, this is probably the most advanced in its class.So here we have Henry Fonda as the lowly juror disputing all the facts. Everyone is convinced. Court adjourned. This is your typical Grisham novel or TV drama.What changes it is how we are presented this information. At this point in time, audiences were still trying to separate the "fourth wall" of stage from the fluidity of the cinema. 'Streetcar' was noble, this is professional.Now just think. If DePalma had done this today we would've probably entered the heads of each man and had an examination of the evidence in their imagination ala 'Mission Impossible'. We would probably also have a detached camera from the proceedings (hence "impersonal").Lumet obviously killed himself trying to make us latch onto the characters and think for ourselves. This is one of few examples where the method actually works: making faces cinematic without resorting to montage.Reiner didn't learn this lesson, Parker went the other way. Spike Lee used the heat inciter for 'Right Thing'.Final Analysis = = Learn from this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this film for the first time yesterday. For it's age, it's remarkably current as far as juror psychology goes. From the guy who wants to send the kid to his death because he has a baseball game to get to, to the old man with a perspective on life that can only come with age who has all the time in the world to discuss the case, this movie accurately portrayed how juries around the US deliberate cases every day. (or at the very least, how they should deliberate their cases)It also brings up the interesting notion about how picking the right lawyer can mean all the difference. Had the defendants lawyer been more astute as to the details of the witnesses testimony, I don't think the prosecution would have had a case to stand on. In this movie, it was pretty much up to Fonda's character to do that work for him.And on a side note, it was nice to see the actor who does the voice for Disney's Piglet in a pre-Disney acting role. When I first heard him speak, I KNEW that just HAD to be the voice of Piglet. Turns out I was right. Very interesting. :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** Here be spoilers **A young boy is accused of murdering his father. Evidence strongly points to him. The jury is sent out to make a decision, and they must be unanimous. As they sit down to vote, there are eleven guilty and just one not guilty. One man has reasonable doubt that the young man is guilty. The jury start to discuss the evidence at hand. Tempers flare, people shout and in general, the room contains twelve angry men.This is a masterpiece. A little slow at start but rapidly catching up, and most of the movie is very intense. You could actually cut the tension. As the story is in real time, you don't miss anything and can follow everything that happen. The tension comes from, that in their decision, lies the fate of one mans life. So simple, but at the same time very complicated. The director has done a great job along with the actors. All twelve people act very well within their character, and as they, and the camera move around I actually got the feeling that being in that room, wanting to take part in the discussion. What more can a movie-maker aim for. With the acting and the time-independent (the issue of evidence and life and death is just as real today, I hope) issue I really got involved with the movie. And the suspense kept growing. Not in the way that anyone was in danger or if any time limit would pass, but the simple matter of somebodies opinion and the change thereof made it so. Who will change their opinion next and why? It really seemed as a study of people.Great movie, action and suspense, great directing and acting and a very interesting topic!9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can you believe that there is a successful movie that has none of the major Hollywood tried and true methods to create a lasting memory? This film is a major triumph that still creates a stir in me every time I see it. It's power is not in the visual images created, (although much of the cinematography is imaginative, especially the last shot from the coat closet, even with the challenge of one major room), but in the drama created by the tension of men coming together from all walks of lives to judge another human being. They bring their prejudices, their fear, their life experiences, their lack of interest, and their anonymity into a room to make a decision--that's when the real story starts.We all think about the possibility of having to face that day--some relish the opportunity while others fear making a bad decision. It's one reason this film resonates with so many people. It's a common experience that brings out different emotions in different people. The remake, although not as effective because of the lack of originality, is also good and brings in other points of view, including racial issues. Both lack one thing--a female's point of view! But that creates even more tension. After all, men don't want to deal with their emotions the same way women do. Besides, we would have to change the title! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry White Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's hard to believe this movie is almost 50 years old...except that no women were on the jury. There was a minority juror, a foreign born citizen, a blue collar type, and several professionals, but no women which was really strange. (What? Like women could have been less logical or emotional than these men...most of them were idiots!) The characters were all something of a stereotype of themselves, but sometimes that is actually how juries are picked. Lawyers want a great diversity on a jury and I think that is why the court process works. The other problem I had with this movie was that unlike a Hollywood drama, where one guy is condemned by his fellow jurors for clogging up the quick trip home, in reality juries take their chore very seriously...at least that was my experience. Those are not serious flaws with the movie, however. Jurors do get angry and emotional. It's stressful. Everyone is acutely aware that someone's life is depending on your being open minded and paying attention. A lot of folks on the IMDB kept writing that the kid in this movie was obviously guilty or obviously not guilty, but you have to remember that the judge is not asking you to decide if the person is innocent or guilty. You are asked if you can decide that beyond a reasonable doubt. So it's never so easy as take a quick vote and go home. You look at all the evidence and try to use logic to make your decision but in reality it is still a gut level decision. It's not crystal clear...especially when the lawyers present the jurors with so called expert trial witnesses. These people get paid to mess with jurors minds. At any rate, during the trial I was on, the jurors were on their toes enough to know when they had been snowed by expert witnesses.The synopsis of this movie has been discussed in great length, so I will just add a few personal comments. The script is exceedingly well written, directed and performed. The dialogue was magnificent. It felt like you were watching the deliberation in real time from the way it was filmed. Riveting cinematography. Few movies can carry an audience for that long with just one room and a few characters. ?My Dinner With Andre' comes to mind.The Lee J. Cobb character was so emotional and so over the top...he was difficult for me to swallow, a little too Freudian for a modern audience, but that is forgiven given this movie's age. The Henry Fonda character is the one all defense attorneys want on the jury. The supporting actors were all fine to watch. My favorite lines was: "Pardon. But...Oh, pardon, pardon.' `What are you being so polite all the time for?" "For the same reason you're not. I was brought up that way."8 ? out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent if dated examination of personal prejudices, selfishness, hesitance, past mistakes, and responsibility when lone juror Henry Fonda tries to get his fellow jurors to take the time to talk about the trial a little more before condemning a boy accused of murdering his father to death by vote of "guilty".Remade as a TV movie starring the late Jack Lemmon (in the Fonda role), the late George C. Scott (in the Lee J. Cobb role) and Tony Danza as the guy who just wants to go to the ball game. The TV movie had a few modern updates such as making the jury more ethnically balanced, a Hispanic guy on trial and a lady judge (Mary McDonnell of "Dances With Wolves"). The prejudice examined in the remake was more racial, where as the prejudice of the original film had more to do with where a kid was raised and how the young and the old differ.Both are great, however, with a hot, stuffy atmosphere that'll make you sweat even in the middle of winter. Fonda delivers one of his best performances as the one juror who's taken into consideration the fact that they have another human being's life in their hands and is unhappy with how the trial was handled. The other angry men are good as well, but Lee J. Cobb stands out in particular as the stubborn one who condemns the suspect not so much because he thinks he's guilty but more from his own failed attempt to raise his own son.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always loved this movie. I read a review from another subscriber that dissed the newer movies like the LOTR Trilogy. He recommended that many new movie fans watch the old movies. Some young people I know will not watch some movies because they are in black and white. A person that I love has said that it is difficult to watch older movies because you have to pay so much attention to the dialogue. This is really sad because this person is extremely intelligent and reads the classics all the time. I loved when my 22 YO daughter watched Psycho(1960) for the first time a few years ago and was completely fooled having never heard about it. So my friends maybe there is hope. Maybe as time goes on the lure of crashing cars and explosions will be less attractive. The accomplishments of special effects will always be just another facet in the diadem of great movie making.Nobody has ever done Frankenstein better than Karloff. King Kong is creeping up on 75 years and the special effects are still "special". In the Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) they accomplished the "effect" of arrows striking the villains by having the master archer of the daytwang real arrows into stunt men wearing breastplates and the score was written to be in musical tune with the dialogue. AND! it was in color!All the way back in 1938!!! I have luckily played Juror # 3 in several stage productions and know every word of dialogue in all of the versions(stage, tele-play and screenplay) and in my opinion this is a masterpiece. This movie is simply brilliant from every aspect of film as an art. There are no explosions,curse words, car chases or machine guns. But there is unbelievable tension and real violence. Plenty of naked hatred and prejudice. For those of you who have not seen this and are wise enough and maybe old enough to appreciate it please watch and enjoy. For those of you who need hate and violence to get cranked up this movie has all of that without all the phony pretense. But you have to be willing to listen.That means shut your mouth and open your ears and pay attention for a whole 90 minutes or so - in a row.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a good example of "Less being better". "SPOILERS AHEAD! I have seen this movie a million times and every time I see it I notice something that I never noticed before. I just saw it again on SHO direct and for the first time I noticed a woman on the screen. She is walking very slowly in front of the court house in the last shot. Even though the movie was essentially shot in one room, I wasn't wanting for other scenery. Something that happens to me while I look at one room movies. The movie is about 12 jurors who decide the fate of a 18 year old kid who is accused of knifing his father to death. Listening to the jurors you get the idea that this kid has had a lot of problems in his life and he is either a Puerto Rican or some other type of latino and poor. I say PR because this is NYC in the 50's. And some jurors refer to him as "those people". We get to see people who seem like normal folks coming out about their hatred about poor ethnic people. We have a man who for some reason is using the defendant for his own agenda. We find out later it has something to do with his son. We have a juror who is so worried about a baseball game he is willing to go along with other jurors so he can go to the game. There is a ad exec who is a idiot and a stockbroker that is uptight. I think this really is accurate about what type of people get on a jury. What I also thought was interesting is how the witnesses stories was refuted. I don't think the witness's meant any malice but they wanted attention or to be important and they taylored their story for that affect. It also touched upon how bad a poor persons lawyer could be. If it was not for Henry Fonda and the John Sweeney character that kid would of been toast. The jurors also wanted to throw in the towel very quickly. The scary part is this. I have heard that many times there is a lone juror who wants to talk it out but because this person is alone they get intimidated by the other jurors and they back down. In this movie these jurors even accuse the Jack Klugman character of changing his vote because he is said to be like "those people". This happens in real life especially if the defendant is a minority and there is only one of that minority on the jury. If a Asian is a defendant and there is one Asian on the jury they are made to feel they better go with the other jurors even though they might feel the other way. Mr Lumet was not just making this stuff up. The remake was OK but why did they have to remake it? In the remake they changed the racial makeup but there were no women on the jury!! HUH! This is one of my favorite movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: Better than Runaway Jury</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen plenty of classics, and I have to tell you, a lot of them have aged. But 12 Angry Men stands the test of time.I saw this film for a class in business school, believe it or not, as an example of communication and negotiation. Throughout the film, the main character uses various ways of building rapport, convincing people, and debate. It's really astonishing.The film does a good job of setting up personalities quickly, using generic characterizations that make it easy to follow all of the 12 characters. Unlike Runaway Jury there isn't a lot of action, but there's plenty of tension and this action film junkie found it to be accessible and very engaging.Who should see this film:-- Everyone who has an interest in classics.-- People who are curious about classics but want to avoid the boring ones. Take a chance on this film.12 Angry Men still packs a punch; I'll give it a perfect 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say about a film that, deservedly, has such a high place on IMDb's list of the top 250 of all time?This film says so much about human nature, and the ways in which we come to form opinions, and in some cases, are bullied out of doing what is right. Although this film was released before I was (so to speak), it holds up beautifully 47 years later, and I hope that audiences can still relate to it 147 years after the release...Let me qualify that: I hope that, as a society, that the average Joe/Jane is not as prejudiced or judgmental as many of the jurors in this film. Yet, I hope that audiences can always watch this movie and admire the simple courage of Fonda's character (as well as Sweeney's and Klugman's) and the wonderful acting of Lee J Cobb, among others.Simple, brilliant film-making and acting!

		<fullReview>A staggeringly good film, Twelve Angry Men pits Henry Fonda against the rest of his Jurymen in an attempt to prove a young accused murderer's innocence.First it's a great story. Its hard to go wrong when you have a great story to start with handed to you by a writer, or in this case a playwright (many have managed to do just this though). Lumet does an excellent job with the excellent tools he had to work with. He captures the claustrophobia and sweatiness of the piece perfectly, and uses cinematic tools like cuts and zooms only when appropriate. Otherwise he lets the actors do their thing. And it is the acting which raises this one to the next level.Fonda is good here but in reality he is like the control subject in an experiment. It is the quality of all the other actors in the piece which really makes this one stand out. Every single one of them portrays a character with perfection. When you have a film set entirely in a few rooms - essentially a play adapted with camerawork, then you need to have good acting. And boy do we get it. This is a film with eleven best supporting actors and no extras. While none of the eleven might be considered a "star" in their own right perhaps, the proximity of the piece leads them to act off each other and give the performances of their lives.There have been films with a lot of talented actors in them sharing a billing before and since, however, there has never been a film with such an ensemble of excellent acting on display at once in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This classic film will need no introduction to most film fans but somehow it had managed to pass me by. I was aware of its reputation and so was expecting something very special. I was slightly disappointed, but not excessively so. The acting is sublime, but pointed. The camerawork is perfect, getting progressively closer to individuals as the story unfolds. The script is paced to perfection. The plot is convincing. However, it's all a little too contrived; obviously this has to be the case. The film can only support one scene for so long, and we have to reach the opposite conclusion within that time. Still, you have to wonder exactly how poor the defence attorney must have been to miss all these important doubts on the prosecution case. Maybe that's the point - all over the democratic world, people are getting screwed over by disinterested attorneys because there is no juror #8 in every jury. I prefer to think that this is, of course, symbolic, or even didactic. A reminder to everyone of the meaning of 'reasonable doubt' and 'guilty', and a lesson in how juries should reach verdicts. In this respect it's very important. And to remain gripping and entertaining to the end is a testament to the justified acclaim Lumet's magnus opus receives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My absolute favorite movie of all time. Stars Henry Fonda and a variety of big stars as jurors forced to decide the fate of a suspected killer. Henry Fonda plays a juror who decides that the suspect is innocent and must face scrutiny from the other members of the jury and must battle them to prove the suspect is not guilty. Fonda truly shows a hero who tells viewers to fight for something you believe and fight against the odds even when people are against you. This is my favorite movie of all - time because of the conflict, struggle and tension between the men, along with the dramatic camera angles provided by the great Sidney Lumet who sets the entire story in one room where tension and anger begin to rise between the men in isolation. Henry Fonda is a great compliment to this movie giving an unbelievable top - notch performance displaying why they call him "The Every Man".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Look Into the Jury Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men, I first saw when I was in law school a few years ago. I was blown away by what I saw. From a cinematic point of view, this movie has everything. The performances are top-notch, the writing is tight and fluid and the direction makes the viewer feel as if they are juror #13 actually sitting in the room.From the legal standpoint, this movie should be shown to potential jurors to better understand what it is they are to do once they go into the jury room. Obviously, a jury like this one is a defense attorney's dream, but the vision of how jury deliberations play out has never been more wonderfully recreated than in this movie.The remake that was made a few years ago was good, with fine performances by everyone, but the original is always better. 12 Angry Men, set entirely in one room for the duration of the film, with the jurors being the only actors seen on screen is one of the best dialogue driven films ever made. The characters and their traits come out through the deliberations, but we never learn the names of any of them, except in the last moments of the film. It is not about the characters, it is about the dialogue. I have yet to see a movie that can mimic this brilliance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is one of the movies which doesn't particularly divide audiences: virtually everyone agrees that this is a masterpiece. What is amazing is that the film is set wholly in one location, yet for its entire duration it maintains suspense, interest and topicality. Not a line is wasted, not a character is underdeveloped and not a single minute is surplus to requirement. Twelve jury members retire to a jury room to debate the innocence or guilt of a young kid accused of murdering his father. Eleven of the men are ready to return an instant guilty verdict. The one thorn-in-their-side is Henry Fonda, who isn't totally compelled by the evidence he has heard and who wants to debate the case a little more. Slowly but surely, he raises points and possibilities which get the other eleven men considering whether or not the murder is really such a straightforward open-and-shut case. Sidney Lumet directs the film with claustrophobic brilliance. The sweltering hot weather adds to the mens' frustrations and leads to some vociferous and provocative confrontations. Fonda is excellent as the liberal jury member who dares to invite ridicule for his seemingly untenable opinion, but he is upstaged by the extraordinary performance of Lee J. Cobb as the most aggressive and sharp-tongued of his rivals. There are superb performances also from Jack Warden as a juror who isn't especially bothered about the verdict as long as he can get to the baseball match on time; John Fiedler as a softly-spoken juror whose opinions often go unnoticed; Martin Balsam as the self-appointed spokesman; and Robert Webber as a rather self-conscious ad executive. Indeed every juror is played to perfection, and in some ways it is unfair to single out one above the rest. The script by Reginald Rose is pure genius. The whole story is told via talk - there's no direct action and no fancy flashbacks - yet it is enthralling from first minute to last. See 12 Angry Men. This is what film as a serious medium is all about!!!</fullReview>

Although it is a cliche a film like this would simply not be made today by a major studio. Shot on one set, with no soundtrack, and not a handsome, or for that matter young, face to be seen it would be shoved out as an art film and seen by a few thousand people or make a lovely little TV drama. One also wonders if the modern equivalent of such a cast, could bury their egos enough to deliver such great ensemble acting.The ethical, democratic, and political questions raised by the film are too numerous to mention.

This is a movie from the time when people actually cared about things like characterization and dialogue. The movie effectively generates sympathy for most of the characters, even the unlikable ones.

Lumet makes stunning use of depth of field and plays with the size of the room to add magnificently to the tension between these 12 men. Lee J. Cobb should've gotten an oscar for this, and it's yet another blow to the academy's credibility, he made you despise him for 90% of the movie and at the end you almost wanted to weep for him, that takes true talent.

		<shortDescription>Always watch the classics!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen too many classics in my time and I am particularly fond of this one. When it comes to the justice system and political jousting, this is probably the best movie ever made. Jury deliberations are always held out of public view and it was interesting to see how they could possibly go. Granted that this movie is a work of fiction, I found it to be one of the most realistic films of all time as well. This is a dramatic legal classic and I can see where Scott Turow and John Grisham got some inspiration for their respective career choices maybe.Here are my reasons (some spoilers may be revealed): (1) The performance of Henry Fonda anchored this rather extraordinary piece of celluloid. It was one of the first film roles that really preached political correctness and it was done with both levelheadedness and style. At the time, Fonda took on the underdog character in a completely new and different way and that made it the best performance in the movie. (2) This was a movie filled with a lot of excellent performances and the next best one goes to E. G. Marshall. To me, he was the actual conservative of the movie (sorry Mr. Cobb). His views were exactly opposite of Fonda but he kept a sound mind. He logically challenged Fonda at every turn but he never lost his cool. While Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb played the "conservative" roles (more like fascist bigots in my opinion), Marshall kept his emotions in check and kept with the cold logic (much like Fonda) and that is why I found his performance to fit the bill of true conservative. (3) Another great performance was done by Joseph Sweeney. He proved that old men know their stuff. He reminded me of my maternal grandfather who is a very learned and observant man himself. Sweeney definitely stole a few scenes from both Fonda and Marshall. He definitely should have been nominated for a supporting actor Oscar. (4) Keeping with the same logic, I really liked George Voskovec. He provided the outside perspective in the movie. The tense scene he had with Jack Warden was the most emotional moment in the film next to Lee J. Cobb's breakdown before the end of the film. Granted the nationality of his character was unknown, it goes to show that people of all ethnicities share the liberal views on very tenuous issues. (5) The fifth best performance goes to the man who played Quincy for seven seasons on the show of the same name. What made him stand out was the fact that he didn't vote not guilty right away even though he was a slum survivor like the defendant in the murder trial. That is a point that those of the same background will always feel sorry for one another. That role was put into the movie to reinforce the sense of reality that the movie was trying to portray. (6) Even though I haven't seen a lot of his films, I found Sidney Lumet's direction of "12 Angry Men" to be Oscar worthy. He definitely cared about this movie and it was maybe the best film he ever had the chance to helm. (7) This movie was spectacularly well-written. Some of the scenarios couldn't have come about without a great writer to do it. Reginald Rose did a great job in coming up with an excellent screenplay and an excellent set of circumstances to play around with. His talent is evident with the fact that the old man pointed out the last fact and the leader of the non-guilty side didn't. (8) The cinematography made me feel the heated claustrophobia that the jurors were suffering through. Throw in a few lighting switches and a small change in dramatic effects and you have an emotionally-charged picture. I was really intrigued by the close-ups on some of the actors. You could really sense the raw emotion all those men felt as they debated away on such a weighty decision. It was beyond words at some moments. (9) This truly was a summer movie. The heat coming into a confined space and the rain coming down at night signaled this thought. I am not a big fan of typical popcorn films and I believe this a needed reprieve from that. I watched this film during a summer thunderstorm and I had to smile at the poetry behind it. It will make anyone blink a couple of times. (10) Not only is this a summer film, it is a time capsule film. Nowadays, no one could get away with making a film about a jury filled with only white men. Men and women from all standings would have to be thrown into the mix to satiate the public and the hounds of political correctness (aka most of Hollywood anyway). I wasn't offended by this movie at all even though it lacked politcal correctness in terms of the times we currently live on. At that time, it was legally acceptable to do as such and the times eventually change. This film captures the late fifties' mentality on the legal system, political correctness, and class struggle perfectly. Ten reasons give this movie a score of ten.Overall, I found "12 Angry Men" to be a classic that everyone from all walks of life should watch. Not only does hit hard on the times in which it took place, it makes a lot of good points on the unfairness of the legal system and fallability of mankind. All sorts of political opinions and logical paths were followed but it was easy to understand and it made "12 Angry Men" all the better. It should not be missed! Here ends my rant!</fullReview>

I didn't need to have any fears about this one!It really is a courtroom drama with a difference. We don't see the presentation of the case, there is no damning evidence produced at the last minute by sleight of hand, we don't have the oh-so-intense barrister getting the hard-headed witness to crack on the stand (but don't get me wrong, I loved "A Few Good Men"!)What I like most of all is that, just like the jury, we don't ever find out if the defendant really is guilty or not.As a film, this is a work of craftsmanship. As so many have said, when you can't bank on special effects or locations, it's down to great writing and great acting, and this film has both in spades.It's basically a character study, and a fabulous demonstration of group dynamics. Whatever your preferred genre, this film is a must have your collection.Dare I say flawless?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the first time I read the play my sophomore year in high school, I was blown away by the power of this play. I felt in love and inspired from the play and went on to read it 5 more times. And when I watched the movie I was even more impressed. The makers and actors of 12 Angry Men did an excellent job in bringing the drama, emotion, and power of 12 Angry Men to life. This film is a undeniable classic packed with Hollywood legends. Everyone should at least see the movie and if they desire, read the play. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry men is a seemingly simple crime-drama from produced in 1957. A jury of twelve men are sent to deliberate the guilt (and subsequent possible execution) or innocence of a young man accused of killing his father. 11 of the men, with varying degrees of intelligence and seriousness, vote to find the young man guilty.Henry Fonda portray's the 12th juror, who has a reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt. He votes not guilty, in a situation that demands unanimous consent. This is where the great interest of this movie comes from, because you know that each of the other eleven men will have to be broken away from and convinced to totally reverse their stance. It is the inexorable grinding away at their initially implacable facts and ingrained prejudices, which make this film so interesting to watch.Henry Fonda does an acceptable job of portraying the 'rebel' juror, though I felt that had the supporting cast been weak, his performance would have had much less of an impact. Fortunately, he is surrounded by a strong cast, and together they make for a very compelling and in its way, suspenseful viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though this film was made in 1957, the issues it raises are still relevant to us today. Racism is still a widespread problem in North American society, especially in our judicial system. Often people's judgments are affected by cultural and racial factors, whether consciously or subconsciously, and this movie captures this aspect of human nature perfectly. The acting was very good, with Henry Fonda and Lee Cobb having the stand out performances. They pull off their roles as the two polar opposites very well, and the other 10 characters fit in-between them on the personality spectrum. As the movie progresses the tension increases, and the characters struggle with their own convictions. The jury room seems to close in on them as they all take their turns debating and stating their opinions. Even though there is no action, and the plot is pushed forward solely by dialogue, the movie still totally engrosses you as a viewer, which establishes it as a true cinema classic. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much you can say about a movie that takes place in one room for the whole movie. I thought it was a good movie, not a great movie though. I liked how the one juror stood his ground the whole time and was able to persuade all the jurors to do so as well. Considering the other jurors thought that it was an open and shut case as soon as they entered the juror room to vote. There were so many distinct and different personalities in all the jurors; that's what made the movie so interesting. There are not many 1950 movies that got my attention like this one. It kept me on the edge of my seat, and kept me thinking all the way through the movie. (Was he guilty or not?) I like how Fonda stayed with his instincts about the flaws in the witness's testimony all the way through the movie. I also like how the director made it seem like you're the 13th juror. It had the camera at everyone's eye level around the juror table to get the feeling that you're in the room with them, it really gets you involved. Even though the movie is half a century old; it's still as relevant today as it was fifty years ago. I'm sure there is juror rooms today that go through the same kind of controversy as the movie did. And that is why I give the movie an 8/10.</fullReview>

Courtroom-based dramas don't usually strike most viewers as films meant to be highly enjoyable, not as far as fun is concerned. But the riveting, character-based performances of the 12 jurors create such a strong, kinetic force, the viewer can't help but keep his eyes and ears glued to the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Room</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of this film is famous: one man tries to convert the 11 other jurors in a jury room. Superficially, that's all the film is. And it works magnificently on this level alone. But mixed in with that one notion (which is, I should say, remarkably carried out), we've got sprinklings of messages. What democracy really means, the notion of a fair and just trial, the stupidity of racism, etc.At the opening of the film, we're inside the courtroom (everything but the opening and closing -- maybe 120 seconds in total -- takes place within the jury room and its adjacent bathroom) and the judge seems blas about the jury. "Just go in and do your thing...whatever." It's just another case with a fairly predictable outcome, he thinks (we assume). He reminds the jury that their conclusion must be unanimous and as they walk into the jury room, a few of them take a glance at the man on trial and the camera shows his face, looking at his only hope to save him from the chair (he's on trial for murder one).As the jurors file into the jury room, over the credits, we see Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), who seems uninterested, looking out the window. The others are mostly talking about simply being in a jury room but Fonda is actually thinking about the case. He's slow to move, contemplative. Juror #7 (Jack Warden) is anxious to get out to his baseball game he's got tickets for.There has been talk, like Roger Ebert's, of how the camera starts out at an elevation and slowly comes down by the end of the film. I didn't notice that, but I did notice just how creative the camera does move about in a very constricted space. I don't think it's ever in exactly the same place, at the same angle.The first jury count, of course, has them at 11 to one, in favor of guilty. What makes this film great is that the lone man who says not guilty, Fonda, isn't sure the young man on trial is innocent -- he's just not sure he's guilty.The straight racism of Juror #10 (Ed Begley) is obvious and the film deals with it. I don't know what the times were like in 1957, but I would have assumed that the order of the day may be to bring racial issues up but not deal with them directly. This film does and it comes out on the right side. The film isn't dated at all in its politics. If it were made today (I haven't seen the TV remake, although with a cast that has George C. Scott and Jack Lemmon, I'd like to), Juror #10 may be less obvious a racist, but this is a minor, if even, a complaint. There are still people like him, who'd believe that murder is inborn to specific ethnicities. What's sort of funny is that I couldn't tell what the man on trial was. Maybe Italian or Greek.We get a good sense of each of the jurors, and indeed by the end we could probably list them off by their number (they never really say names, it's usually, "Hey, you there"). Part of this is due to that amazing camera. It really lets us know these people and it doesn't cut back to the "overview shot" or something so we can just get a good look at everyone together. When there is a wide shot that shows the entire room, some jurors are up walking, getting a drink, one may be in the bathroom. It's not a condescending camera that says, "Here's everyone. We'll give you some time to get all of them straight."The entire film -- aside from those estimated 120 seconds -- is shot in real time, or as close to real time as you can come without making a film with one continuous, unbroken shot. Within the jury room there are no edits for time lapses, just for cutting to a different angle or juror.The film acknowledges how evidence is all subjective ("There's a difference between a slap and a punch."). Each juror saw the same thing in the courtroom (we hear the evidence and the case only through the jurors recollections) but comes out with something different. That's part of what makes movies in themselves great: we all see the same movie and, when one is good, we all leave with something else, specific to us.Fonda is the leader in the film, almost made into a holy figure. He's passive in the beginning and he's the one who presents the other jurors with his feelings as to why the young man may not be guilty. That's what Fonda does, brilliantly. He talks out his feelings. He's not in possession of some scientific fact that he plans on systematically informing the jury of, he just needs to take some time to sort out the facts, as he heard them, in his mind. Of course he's noticed things the others haven't and he's given the case more thought than maybe most would have. But it isn't a one-man mission. By being the one to stand up, he lets the others come out and say what they've seen. He gives them the chance to think and feel things over. While Fonda is obviously the protagonist, the film doesn't shy away from fairly showing other considered theories of those who are against him. At first Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) is the common sense antagonist, but later Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall) has intelligent deductions as to why Fonda is wrong.All of the technicalities of the film are fine. The acting is first-rate -- I was especially interested in Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney), who's made into an almost goofy old man with a strange way of showing his untold wisdom. And I now understand why Henry Fonda appealed to so many. Lee J. Cobb is terrific as the easily angered brute who isn't quite that simple. The picture on the DVD was incredibly crisp.This is the type of movie they should show in American History classes. Hell, show it in any country (like mine, Canada) where democratic notions are held dear. In this room there is a microcosm of judicial, political, and human existence. A masterwork.****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me one of the things that makes a film a good one is how much it makes you think and how much you find yourself discussing it afterwards. My wife and I spent a great deal of time following the film discussing it. What makes this film so good is that it reveals so much of what we are as individuals and the prejudices that we carry. What else it shows is how much passion that can be expressed during arguments. Think about a big argument you had with someone. Remember how you passionately tried to persuade them how WRONG they were and how RIGHT you were. In passionate argument logic can sometimes get thrown to the wayside. This film has that and you can see yourself in these characters. You get to see how rediculous it can get when you argue a point without solid reasoning. Again, that is what made this film so good for me. You can analyze it so many ways. This is definitely worth the investment of time to see. For provacative thought and excellent acting I give this film 8 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can a film about 12 men sitting in a jury room deliberating the fate of one young man accused of murder be as exciting as any action film you've ever seen? Maybe! This movie takes place almost entirely in one room, but there is more going on in that room than you'd ever believe. This film fascinated me from beginning to end. I've seen it three times recently and it seemed just as fresh and gripping the third time as it did the first. What makes this movie so great? First of all, the script and the characters are intricate and well developed. Second of all, the acting from the ensemble cast is uniformly riveting. Third, the camera work in this film is the best you'll ever see anywhere. Fourth, the movie has something to say about about prejudice and justice without being preachy. It simply is on a search for truth. For my money, this is one of the finest dramas ever made. Henry Fonda is right on target as the architect who has reasonable doubts. Each of the other 11 actors give stellar performances of unique men who open up like books as the story proceeds. You'll be thinking about this movie long after the jury has reached a verdict. This movie is as relevant today as it was 45 years ago. Don't miss it. I give it a 94/100! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hooked to it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I took the DVD of this film along with a couple of other movies from library, I postponed seeing this one after reading about the movie in the back cover of DVD. It had been mentioned that all but 3 minutes of the movie has been shot in a room. The movie was black and white and there was no female cast!!. Finally when I found some time when there was no other thing to do, I watched this movie, my god I was hooked. This movie is a great lesson to new directors and screen play writers as to how a great movie can be made without all the gorgeous locations, millions of dolllars, graphic special effects etc. Infact once the cast get into the jury room there is not even a back ground score. All natural sound recorded at the set. As some body else had mentioned Lee J cobb steals most of the scenes, but Henry Fonda's performance is great as a soft sell/submissive player. He carefully releases one card after other from his hand at precise moments.For example he does not tell any one he has a switch blade knife untill others really push him and challenge him about the rarity of the knife. That is a genius. Infact I watched the movie two times back to back and I could not help but marvel where all this talent nowadays. I was tempted to watch it third successive time but did not do it because it was late.A must watch. Don't miss it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple Yet Powerful; Movie-Making At Its Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Modern movies have convinced us that if a movie doesn't have big budget special effects and lots of action it's not worth watching. If you want to be healed of that viewpoint, "12 Angry Men" is the tonic. Here we have the simplest of movies. Except for the opening and closing couple of minutes this entire movie is set in a jury room, as 12 men debate the fate of a young man charged with murdering his father. Is he guilty or not? Will he be executed or not? The 12 jurors debate the case. And that's it, basically. And it's powerful and fascinating and you won't take your eye off the screen from the moment it starts.Henry Fonda put on an excellent (if, I thought, a little bit too preachy) performance as Juror Davis, the lone hold out as the movie starts, the vote being 11-1 in favour of guilty. Davis may not be convinced of the young man's innocence, but he sure isn't convinced of his guilt and he sets out to convince the others to give the kid a break. As good as Fonda was, though, Lee J. Cobb stole the show as Juror Number 3, an angry, hateful and vengeful man who lashes out at the "bleeding hearts" as they start to be convinced by Davis' arguments. An excellent supporting cast (including the likes of E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden and Jack Klugman among others) also put on wonderful performances.I thought the movie was summed up perfectly at the very end. As Davis is leaving the courthouse, he's met by Juror McCardle (Joseph Sweeney). They introduce themselves to each other (they are the only two jurors named in the movie) and then go their separate ways. These twelve men who held the life of another man in their hands didn't have a clue who each other were and would probably never see each other again. But for this brief period of time they could hold us fixated, even if we didn't know who they were.Movie-making at its finest.10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 10th-grade class just watched "12 Angry Men" this week in civics class since we've been studying about the US judicial branch, and our teacher wanted to show us how prejudice can effect a verdict. But anyway, as for the movie itself, I really enjoyed it. It's about a jury trying to decide the verdict of a murder case where a teenage boy stabbed his father with a knife. At first the jurors all have a "let's get this over with and go home" attitude and the vote is 11 to 1 guilty, but the one juror who questions the kid's guilt presents his arguments and suddenly all 12 jurors are arguing and debating over the evidence. The whole movie, except for the first and last scenes, takes place in the jury room, in a claustrophobic Hitchcock-esque manner which leaves the drama of the movie entirely up to the talent of the actors. The actors are all excellent and bring the dialogue to life as the jurors' personalities clash and they review the evidence over and over to ensure justice. When I think of "classic Hollywood movies", it's movies like this that come to mind. I reccomend "12 Angry Men" as entertainment and also as a reminder to us all to take our duties as American citizens seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the term masterpiece is often bandied about capriciously, in the case of director Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men the word can be most aptly applied. It is absolutely marvelous to behold the layers of twelve distinctly different men peel away to reveal their fundamental cores as they fulfill their civic duty as jurors who must decide on the fate of a young man accused of murder. The characterization and interaction of the twelve men will fascinate any viewer who enjoys films that explore the triumphs and failings of the human condition. Intriguing premise, perfect casting, intelligent dialogue, and superb direction all make me give 12 Angry Men the the highest possible recommendation. 10/10.

		<fullReview>This is certainly moviemaking reduced to its simple and best elements. Nothing elaborate set-wise, or costuming, and no gee-whiz special effects. Just excellent screenplay, directing, and acting.The cast is very, very special. Their chemistry is all the more remarkable for the diversity of the people and the personalities brought into conflict over the need to reach a verdict in a seemingly simple, open-and-shut case that proves to be a bit more enigmatic and complex than what appears at first glance. Only one of the cast is a bona fide superstar. The rest are character actors, but of exceptional quality, and they all hold their own in comparison to Fonda's performance, which is its usual top-notch quality.Movie fans will recognize many familiar faces. A youthful-looking Jack Klugman turns in a surprisingly good effort as an up-from-the-streets juror who makes important contributions to the deliberations. Others have noted the strong performance of Lee J. Cobb, whose initially overbearing and confrontational but ultimately quasi-tragic character elicits both disdain and sympathy from the viewer. I also liked E. G. Marshall's character as the last guilty vote holdout along with Cobb's character, but is ultimately convinced to vote not guilty. His conversion is simply and quietly but powerfully expressed, "I'm convinced. I now have a reasonable doubt...", and he holds his ground against Cobb's protestations. A nod also goes to Martin Balsam as the patient but often exasperated jury foreman.Fans of classic movies should definitely consider adding this to their collection. I have the remastered DVD version and it is a visual treat "in glorious black-and-white", which fits the scenery and tension of the jury room perfectly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fonda tried his only attempt at producing with this tense, claustrophobic drama. Though the film was initially not very successful and Fonda did not recoup enough money to draw a salary for it, it was a work close to his heart and has since gained an almost legendary status (only slightly dimmed by the endless mediocre stage versions that pop up everywhere from high schools to church basements.) The story concerns the deliberation of twelve jury members in the case of a Puerto Rican youth accused of knifing his father to death. Fonda picked each of the other jurors from among the best actors that New York City and Hollywood had to offer. Some went on to greater fame. A few are virtually unknown today, but all do a fine job in the film. As the film gets under way, the jurors take a vote which tallies 11 guilty and 1 not guilty (Fonda.) He must attempt to sway the remaining jurors to his viewpoint or risk a hung jury. Each of the jurors fits a certain "type". Some are meek, some loud, some wealthy, some poor, some ethnic, etc... Scoring especially well (though their high volume bombast can be rough on the ears at times) are Cobb, Begley and Warden. However, the quieter ones are no less effective. Marshall is excellent as a carefully behaved upper crust man. Webber is at his most handsome as a snappy ad exec. Fonda underplays his role, allowing the audience to project its feelings onto his familiar face. There is a lot of the expected discussion and rehashing of the evidence, but the film is also punctuated with a few piercing dramatic moments and somehow manages to create and build suspense in a story where there isn't a lot of doubt as to the outcome. The film captures a sort of old world class and respect and dignity (even with the underbelly of life that gets exposed in the story) that is mostly absent from today's movies and today's world. Whenever a man gets agitated, someone politely suggests that he calms down and typically, he does. Today there would have to be a fistfight and all sorts of extra melodrama to keep audiences watching. However, for the patient and appreciative viewer, this film satisfies greatly. An interesting point is made at the end....that after all the deliberation and drama, the jurors never even knew each others' names and from here on will likely never see one another again. It's a thought-provoking and intriguing story with lots to offer. Should be required viewing for anyone about to sit on jury duty as it illustrates the dangers of preconception and going with the flow.</fullReview>

Although a scholar of cinematography and a director whose art has spanned 6 decades, Lumet never tries to show off by using unnecessary aesthetic panoramas. Perhaps never better seen that in this classic and again in "Network" 20 years later, his dialogues are magnificent. He must go down as perhaps the greatest Director in terms of his ability to draw truly masterful performances from his actors. Cobb, Klugman, Begley Junior, Balsam, Finch, Beatty, perhaps even Holden, Dunnaway and Fonda deliver their finest performances on the silver screen under his direction. Mr. Lumet I take my hat off to you. Were you to combine with, Terence Mallick, and to incorporate his masterful aestheticism, (the ying and the yang), the outcome would doubtless be an unparalleled masterpiece.</fullReview>

It was refreshing to see especially when compared to the lack of any manners or social conscience of the cast of modern movies. Today's heros are selfish mean-spirited thugs who have no redeeming qualities besides getting the money or the whorey babe at the end of the movie. The quality called "an edge" in so many characters in modern movies is a result of the writing of Hollywood hacks who don't know any better. I believe it reflects the values of the Hollywood culture and it is no wonder independent movies are popular. See "12 Angry Men". The movie is well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERSWhat is great about 12 Angry Men is its very basic structure while keeping you engaged in the flow of the deliberation. Nearly the entire movie was set in a jury room during a discussion of a murder case. Henry Fonda has a nagging feeling that the kid is not guilty and has to argue masterfully to convince his fellow jurors (some are harder than others). What makes this film great is the same reason people like to see comeback wins in sports and why impartial sports viewers tend to root for the underdog. Throughout the whole film, you have a feeling that Fonda is going to win, but seeing him do it is exciting. When I watched this movie, it seemed 30 minutes long and my friend and I were getting vocally excited about Fonda's quest for justice. This film is worthy of all its praise and has aged wonderfully.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the evolution of DVD people like me are getting the chance to watch films they would otherwise never be able to see. 12 Angry Men is one such film, and I rented it purely on the basis that it sits so highly in the IMDB Top 250.I'm glad that I did, as it is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The basic plot revolves around a jury deliberating on a murder case that will send the accused to the electric chair, if he is found guilty. A preliminary vote is taken, and all but one of the jurors vote for guilty.Over the course of the movie the one juror who votes not guilty (Henry Fonda) makes his case, and the other jurors being to realise that the verdict is not as clear cut as they first thought. One of the interesting things about this movie is that each juror has their own reasons for their opinion, be it the facts of the case, or personal prejudices, and over the course of the movie these are confronted and explored.Despite being set in a single room, this movie is constantly entertaining, due to the acting and direction. The film feels incredibly tense and claustrophobic as a result of this. It was only afterwards I found out that Sidney Lumet also directed Dog Day Afternoon, another great movie that is based entirely in one setting.In an age of special effects and the constant high budget dross being pumped out of Hollywood, it's refreshing to see a movie based purely on dialogue and acting ability. There have been too few of these in recent years, although a few do come to mind- Glengarry Glen Ross, Swimming With Sharks, Usual Suspects, Memento.Many people today may see the date this movie was made or the fact that it is in black and white and not bother watching it. If they do they are missing out on a classic. I'm actually surprised this film hasn't been remade over the years, but maybe it's for the best that it hasn't.Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Simply one of the greatest movies ever made and proof that great movies do not necessarily require extravagant settings or spectacular action.The screenplay by Reginald Rose is first-rate, Lumet's direction is brilliant and all twelve actors have got meaty rles which they carry off superbly. What makes it so good is that the characters are believable, not the usual Hollywood stereotypes. All the performances are terrific, with Lee J. Cobb perhaps as the stand-out.A must-see. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NO SPECIAL EFFECTS, JUST SPECIAL ACTING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love watching movies from 1957. Beside the fact that this was the year I was born, there were some great movies from that year. "Bridge on the River Kwai" is one and "12 Angry Men" is another. No special effects, no lavish sets, no tropical backdrops. "12 Angry Men" depends on real acting and intellegence for success. A open and shut case brought to the jury room for quick debate, is set in a stark, black and white setting. Most of the movie takes place in a small, plain room, with no air conditioning. Not exactly the formula for a entertaining movie. But the cast, led by Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb, bring color and intensity to the screen. Unlike so many movies of today, filled with physical violence and explosions, this movie is filled with verbal sparring and explosions from within the heart. Watching the movie, I felt like I was closed in that small room with the jurors. The movie has the feel of being shot in a couple of hours, instead of the weeks it actually took. This is remarkable because the scenes seem seemless. The movie was a bomb in 1957, but compared to today's formula of sex, aggresion and rock and roll, "12 Angry Men" is a blast from the past. It is 'the bomb!'</fullReview>

Some scenes they don't stop the camera for about 6-7 minutes and it not just one guy, they go all around to every guy in that room saying different things. In this movie some times you will think he got that guy good, or good point but I wouldn't recommend you to rent this I think it is safe to say buy it.

		<shortDescription>A Who's Who of Character Actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another classic film which I am certain nobody realized would be a classic when it was made. I doubt that director Sidney Lumet realized fully what he had in the cast he assembled, for many of the names were not yet household words in 1957, the year 12 Angry Men was produced. The names are impressive: Henry Fonda, Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Robert Webber, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Edward Binns, John Fiedler and a very young Jack Klugman are the players we recognize today as belonging in the Who's Who of American character actors of the era. Edward Sweeney and George Voskevec, capable artists in their own right, round out the cast. The story intrigues. Except for short sequences at the beginning and end, the story takes place entirely within a stuffy jury deliberation room. A jury of 12 men is charged with determining the guilt or innocence of a young man accused of murdering his father. In the beginning of deliberations, only Fonda believes the young man innocent. The story's brilliance comes in how it progresses to 11-1 for a guilty verdict to finally a 12-0 vote for acquittal. Along the way, we are introduced to each of the jurors in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. The reasonable juror portrayed by Fonda, the hot-headed ultra conservative played by Cobb, the shallowness of Warden's character, and E.G. Marshall's thoughtful stockbroker are a few examples of character development within the setting of a jury room on a hot night.We learn much about the background and psyche of each juror as we progress along and the talents of each cast member shine brightly within the framework of an interesting story, a story which contains more than a little bit of social commentary on the times in which it was filmed.  12 Angry Men is a must see for anyone interested in the human psyche and social commentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest pictures ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Looking at the lists from over the years of the American Film Institute (best movies, comedies, thrillers, and passions), I've come to the conclusion that they know what they're talking about. However, they did make one mistake: the failure to recognize '12 angry men' as one of the best motion pictures ever made. Quite simply, '12 angry men' is perfect, or very close. It's the story of a court case, in which an 18-year old Hispanic kid is accused of killing his father. What's very interesting is that, with the exception of the first two minutes and the last 30 seconds, the entire movie takes place in the jury room. The twelve jurors are discussing the case, and the bottom line is that every single solitary shred of evidence points to the direction that the kid is guilty. At the preliminary vote, eleven of the men vote guilty, and the twelfth man (played by Henry Fonda) votes not guilty. And then the fun starts. The film progresses with the eleven men convincing Henry Fonda that the boy is guilty ("they proved it a dozen different ways in court. Would you like me to list them for you?"), and meanwhile, Henry Fonda tries to convince them that there is enough reasonable doubt to consider that maybe the boy didn't commit the murder after all. There are several things that make this movie so good, and perhaps the most impressive is the fact that the acting performances are perfect; all twelve of them; a feat almost unthinkable in today's cinema. Each of the twelve men have a different personality, and you'll remember every one of them. The one that really stands out is Lee J. Cobb, because his character is very complex. He starts off polite and pleasant, and as the film progresses, starts to become 'excitable', as one of the characters calls it, and seems to suddenly be personally involved in the case. "12 Angry Men" is riveting, exciting, fascinating, and one of the greatest motion pictures of all time. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's an illustration of the difference between theatre and cinema. This is the definitive cinematic "performance" of Reginald Rose's play; the one or two trivial flaws are of no consequence whatever. On the stage, they WOULD be of consequence. As E.G. Marshall performs the role, Juror nr. 4 is so humourless and anal that you start to wonder if he's really all that bright (and the story requires that he really IS all that bright). And Henry Fonda tends to play Juror nr. 8 from moment to moment, in effect contradicting himself (if you find yourself failing to warm to him as much as you should, this is the reason). THE two key performances, in short, are weak. On stage this would be fatal. On the other hand, with STRONG performances all round, "12 Angry Men" on the stage could not possibly go wrong, however much the director takes it upon himself to stuff things up - just as the stage director of "Don Giovanni" can make a donkey of himself by setting the action in present-day Darlinghurst, if he likes, and, with sufficiently good musical performances, the opera will not be harmed.If you exclude Ed Wood movies and the like, "12 Angry Men" was shot with as much economy as any other film in history, with roughly HALF of the exposed footage making it into the final cut (I find this hard to believe, too, but it's what the director says, and it's not inherently impossible). No doubt accounts for the odd touch of unpolished acting here and there. What's amazing is how perfectly Lumet has paced the action, how RIGHT each shot is.Lumet conveys the confined space all the more effectively by including thirty seconds, perhaps a minute of footage of the outside: the opening shot where we track into the jury room, and the closing shot in the open air outside. These moments - which established there was a wider world while cutting the jury room off from it - were crucial.</fullReview>

I almost got up from my chair just like the rest of the jurors. I've been watching dozens of classics in recent months, and 12 Angry Men is the best pre-1972 movie that I've seen.The 1997 remake is supposed to be very good as well.

It is amazing how such a limited cast (just 16 people) can be so great and make this movie really shine. But, I think that is the mark of really great actors. I am no fan of Henry Fonda, but I do think this is his best work. The rest of the jurors are also extremely good. The mark of a good actor I believe is making us understand the character from the start of the movie. We know what each juror is thinking from the start of the movie. We don't have to have extensive character development because the characters are already developed in our minds. This movie could NOT be done properly today, and any director who has thoughts of doing a remake should rethink it.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, it's only a movie, and what happened in the jury room, with one man really standing up for what he believes is rarely documented anywhere in the real world. We need some more juror #8's in this life, or the juror #8's need more recognition. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent "jury room drama" - ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Especially in our current state, the focus is more and more on special effects and visual appeal than on strong plots and good acting. While many great movies have told their stories through visuals, "12 Angry Men" takes the opposite approach, telling the story through its characters, creating the feel of a stage play.The premise is that a young minority boy is charged with murdering his father. Every jury member except one (Henry Fonda), believes that the boy is guilty. Fonda doesn't necessarily believe him to be innocent, but rather that he just isn't sure. He begins his attempt to point out how he feels and why he feels that way. Through this, he reveals the insecurities and prejudices that are within everyone.The acting is first rate, from the angry, stubborn Juror #3 to Fonda, who creates a sense of integrity that he does so well. Each man has a unique angle, and every actor portrays them well.The story and script are as close to perfect as can be. I don't mean that the movie is perfect, but rather that this is a premise that is difficult to execute. It would be easy to write this story so that it would not flow well, but it flows smoothly. Perhaps one of the best screenplays of all time.The themes of this movie - it is more or less a character study - are beautifully written in. They never become heavy handed, but are still easily seen. Every man on the jury has some reason to quickly decide guilty, whether it be indifference, their own personal struggles, or prejudices.This movie is not a masterpiece of visual achievement. It takes a rather unique approach to cinema, and makes itself a masterpiece in its own way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I first saw this movie when it came out on TV about 40 years ago, I have watched it numerous times. It is a movie that never becomes stale or dated. It was one of the few movies that I actually bought on VHS. Although I have seen only (or mainly) the B&amp;W version, I think that color would detract from the starkness of the scene, the seriousness of the role these men play in the life of one young man. The ensemble play of these very differing characters is remarkable, and there are many moments that are unforgettable: E.G. Marshall taking off his glasses and massaging the bridge of his nose, thus unwittingly raising another point of doubt; Lee J.Cobb vehemently condemning young punks and at last breaking down over his own failure as a father; the old immigrant who brings a totally different perspective to justice. The slow character revelation is outstandingly written and directed and had the movie not had the blockbuster action picture "Bridge on the River Kwai" to contend with, it should have won numerous awards. Although there is virtually no real action in the movie, the tension is unrelenting as the jurors try to decide whether there is reasonable doubt. A film to savor again and again. I have not seen it for a little over a year now. I did not see the TV movie version and would like to compare the two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have taught "12 Angry Men" in high school literature classes afew times and I think it is safe to say that the film version is betterthan the written play. The characters are more sharply drawn as humanswe can relate to. (Yes, I really teach literature, even though I enda sentence with "to". My 8th grade English teacher would have a fit.)The dialogue is sharper. And, especially when seeing it several times,the film leaves the viewer with more questions than answers about whatconstitutes justice and what is or could be the best possible legalsystem. As a movie fan, not a literature teacher, I have the followingcomments. In "12 Angry Men" Henry Fonda seems to be playing the samecharacter that he played quite a few years earlier in "The ImmortalSergeant": the seemingly timid, reluctant hero who rises to theoccasion with dogged determination and emerging powers of persuasion. Even the mannerisms and the phrases he uses in the two films aresimilar. In "The Immortal Sergeant" he is the corporal and thereforethe ranking member of the squad after the sergeant is killed. When hissquad on patrol encounters an enemy implacement, he proposes to attackit instead of simply passing it by. (sound like "Saving PrivateRyan"?) When challenged with someone speaking in an affected Britishvoice, "But my dear fellow, what possible effect could our attackingthem have on this campaign?", Henry Fonda responds, "Probably none atall, I don't know. But it seems to me ..... ("our job is to win thewar")" In "12 Angry Men", Fonda uses the same character to say, "Well, Idon't have anything brilliant, but ....." My other observation is that "12 Angry Men" has one of the greatestunderstated insults of all time incorporated into an etiquette lesson: "Pardon. But..." "Oh, 'pardon, pardon'. What are you being so polite all the timefor?" "For the same reason you're not. I was brought up that way."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twelve Angry Men was on again and for the umpteenth time I just had to watch it. No action, special effects, naked women, scary monsters or aliens. Nope none of that stuff. Instead you get a superb, if not great story with some of the best acting from different and varied actors that I have ever seen. Truly a magnificent masterpiece. It is hard to believe that 12 men in a claustraphobic jury room would make for an entertaining and engrossing movie.But, it does so brilliantly. There is no courtroom drama with lawyers that packs the punch that this movie does. It makes for a bit of a civics lesson as well. You can't help but feel locked into this room with these 12 guys with radically different lives and personalities. I think it would be interesting to see a 12 angry women passing judgement on an accused rapist. I think this story is timeless and will always work because of the basics of the story. Great hard hitting writing, great powerful dramatic story, great direction,great performances and acting. After viewing it last night, I'm going out to buy it. This movie isn't a rental, it is without a doubt a buyer. There aren't any better than this in this genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>`Twelve Men turned into twelve clawing animals'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&lt;&lt;POSSIBLE SPOILER WITHIN&gt;&gt;No film is perfect, and indeed it is a rare jewel to find a film where there are even one or two perfect scenes ? the point where everything is in harmony ? script, direction, acting, camera, and lighting. Twelve Angry Men is mostly made of these jewels, and is up there in my top ten films.Part of the Sidney Lumet's skill lies in his ability to realistically capture rapid exchanges between characters, whilst keeping a larger perspective and not losing orientation. By using a range of editing and camera techniques ? fast cuts, close ups, low camera angles, high camera angles the film is very dynamic and fluid. All of the characters are given enough room to breathe, which is no small feat with such a large group. Indeed many of the great directors openly admit that they find scenes involving interchanges amongst groups of people extremely taxing, Frankenheimer and Kieslowski spring to mind (Kieslowski even went so far to say that's why all his films have so few characters.) Echoing the core theme of the film, we are given different perspectives of the set - one time we may feel like a lingering voyeur, hidden at the back of the room, another a lonely juror being stared at by all the others, another pressed close against a jurors face ? feeling his emotions boiling over, clouding his judgment. It is this wide variety of techniques, and of course a magnificent script that makes the film infinitely enjoyable.Henry Fonda's juror seems to know all the evidence's weaknesses from the start, however he only drip feeds the other jurors one idea at a time. He seems to have that perennial quality of heroes ? an almost superhuman ?knowing' quality coupled with great hubris or modesty, signified by his reiteration that he doesn't 'know' that the evidence is wrong, just not beyond reasonable doubt. All of the other juror's are played excellently, I particularly relished the old mans performance.I have a few ?minor' criticisms of the film, but they are just that - minor. I think the racist juror's outburst is a little too over acted; this does however give the opportunity for a wonderfully stylized rejection by the other jurors.Some of the films highlights to me are near the end when we realise that the last stubborn juror wants to punish the accused as a proxy for his son. (Some people may have picked this up earlier though). Also the superb final shot where the old man asks Henry Fonda's juror his name.Another interesting point that I only realised after finishing the film for the first time was that there were no female jurors.On particular historical interest is the original theatrical trailer, complete with studio hyped commentary such as `Twelve Men turned into twelve clawing animals', and a surprising injection of a James Bond / Mission impossible like tune midway through. . I've only brushed the surface of some of the film's great aspects, there are so many impressive things it would take many pages more to discuss all of them. Whether you're in the mood for a comedy, a drama, a thriller, or even a light philosophical view on justice this film fits the bill.- enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Jury room thriller like no other!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Justice, racism and social differences. These are the issues explored in "12 angry men", a film by Sidney Lumet about a Jury that has to decide the future of a young man accused of murdering his father.Set in New York in 1957, this film, even though the script is groundbreaking, could have been a boring piece of cinema if it were not for its director; making his feature film debut, Sidney Lumet shows his expertise in the craft of cinema by maintaining the tension throughout the entire 90 minutes of film -and considering that it all transpires in just one room it makes it even more amazing.The handling of the camera is superb, it makes you feel you are inside that jury room with the rest of the jurors. The acting is exquisite; Henry Fonda plays the only juror that believes the accused to be innocent while the others try to convince him otherwise. And that is the genius of this film, through those arguments between the jurors we are shown the differences of the characters; the guy from the poor neighborhood, the working man, the rich guy, the old man that nobody pays attention to and so on.The dialogues have an incredible depth, dealing with issues such as justice and racism in a very subtle way and yet the plot never becomes a boring speech about political correctness. Although the stars of the movie are Henry Fonda (My Darling Clementine, Grapes of Wrath) and Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront, Exodus)- actor gods walking amongst men-, the supporting cast is so well put together that becomes the foundation of "12 angry men".This film It is one of those rare opportunities where the three most important elements of a movie come together. They are, the script, the director and the acting. In this case they combine so perfectly with each other, they bond so well that it is impossible to divide this film into those three elements. You see the movie as a whole, as a well oiled machine where each and every gear contributes to make this classic something to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 angry men is my all time favourite film ... the basic story evolves around the Jury discussions in a murder case, there are no action scenes, special effects, music score etc ... but its totally engrossing is acted superbly. This is a REAL film with a good plot and clever character development. It shows all sides of human nature, as each character comments on the case and we build up a picture of them and their personal views/feelings. There is hostility, racism, selfishness, anger which is subtlety developed during the film.The directing is very clever with lighting changes and close-ups of the Jury in the room which add to the tense atmosphere. I like the way Henry Fonda finally sways them all around to his way of thinking, he does take a chance on the first vote - luckily the old man comes to his rescue, the old man helps him again later on by spotting the'glass' marks on the witness, this is key evidence ... In some ways the old man becomes the 'hero' of the film aswell !?Anyway I don't care what anyone else says, the film stands tall on its own and does not require special effects/action scene frills to make it good. I would rather watch this any day than some blockbuster effects film that lacks a decent storyline but survives on its 'good special effects'.....This is a real movie ... a gem</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific film and highly recommended (WARNING: Possible spoiler contained within)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny how time changes your perception of things, such as "12 Angry Men." When I saw this magnificent movie oh so long ago, I thought this film was made by some bleeding-heart liberal who wrote about empathy for an obviously-guilty Latino murderer getting in the way of deciding the verdict.But in watching it again and again, I saw that such was not the case. Rather, it was Juror No. 8 (Henry Fonda as Mr. Davis) who -- after deciding a thorough review of the evidence, even for argument's sake, was appropriate -- reveals holes in the prosecution's case. Today, I'm amazed still at how Mr. Davis manages to debate his cause against impossible odds. Slowly, but surely, he manages to sway the other jurors his way as he exposes what was thought to be an open-and-shut case.In addition to the carefully crafted character study of the 12 jurors (which range from caring, intelligent, empathetic and responsible to egotistical, impatient, arrogant and merciless), there are other things about "12 Angry Men" that, though they don't seem to surface, it makes this marvelous film unique. For example, one may make the case that some prosecutors -- in a rush just to punish defendants coming from a minority, disadvantaged background -- sloppily and haphazardly assemble their case, while some defense attorneys take a lackadaisical attitude toward their client's case. One wonders how this case could have played out had Mr. Davis been the Latino's defense attorney, exposing seemingly inconsequential details -- such as the mechanics of knife-fighting and the poor eyesight of one of the witnesses.This is simply one film you always look forward to seeing time and time again, whether in a classroom setting, a team-building seminar for work or just during a night of relaxation. Everyone plays their parts so brilliantly one has to wonder if they could ever play another type of character in other films. Simply put, the cast became the very characters they play, the very essence of this film.Please, run -- don't walk -- to the video store to rent "12 Angry Men." It's near the top of my all-time favorite films' list, and I give this a perfect 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

Each time I see different nuances in the characters and the acting that I might have missed previously. The characters are so well crafted and 3-dimensional that by the end of the film you also feel as if you have been locked in the jury room along with them. Words can hardly do this film justice.

The movie had a lot of strong feelings shown with no strong language. It shows what good writing, acting and directing can do to show people's feelings without resorting to vile language.

		<fullReview>After the success of 'The Wrong Man', Henry Fonda went on to lead the cast in this staged film '12 Angry Men'. In 'The Wrong Man', he shows that he is at the peak of his form as a screen actor and does not need to rely on technicolor, special effects or costumes to display his acting talents. In '12 Angry Men', he continues this tradition by displaying his pure acting genius as though he were acting on stage. No exotic locations. No beautiful scenery. No technicolor. Not even a score. But just a good story, good direction, good acting and a brilliant film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>EXCELLENT...no other word for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely give a film a '10.' But, this film with absolutely no weak spots deserved it. Everything works. All of the actors are great. The film has a darkness to it, a quiet gray sense of hopelessness, as boring as a New York summer day, hot, humid and dark. The weariness fades as the various members of the jury reveal bits and pieces of themselves as the plot unfolds and the wave of change sparked by new awareness begins to sweep the dreary juryroom. The jurymen begin to lose their apathy, antipathy and conflicted, convoluted attitudes. As the action goes on, each man must confront himself, his own values and his own fears, prejudices and weaknesses. The ending is a triumph for all of us. Reginald Rose not only put together a flawless thriller but look at that cast. Not a cull in the bunch. Several went on to establish themselves as character actors, e.g., John Fiedler, Robert Webber, Edward Binns, George Voscovec and Joseph Sweeney. Some others were already stars in their own right, Ed Begly Jr., Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda and others, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall and Martin Balsam went on to achieve stardom in films and TV. All were veteran character actors who add a ring of credulity to their roles. Rarely, indeed, only in a great once in a while, does it all come together as is does in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful screenplay, great acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Talk about a simple film! 12 guys as jurors are in one room for all but maybe 3 minutes of the film. In 90+ minutes, they talk through the details of the murder case, some aforementioned in the courtroom and some underlooked, to either determine a verdict - which must be unanimous or else the trial is "hung."The fact of a unanimous vote being required makes the foundation for a very gripping film. However, with no visual flashbacks or anything, if one is going to be successful for a film with such a monotonous setting, some guidelines are required. 1. The running time must not be overlong. At some point, we'd feel as frustrated as some of the jurors. 2. The screenplay must be first-rate. and 3. The acting must be believable.This film passes all three criteria with flying colors. The running time is barely over 90 minutes, ample time to throughly develop every idea. The script was great! The details of the case are thought out wonderfully. And the character development: It's amazing what you learn about all 12 men, without learning their names! While I won't reveal the outcome, I will say that the way the momentum swings is almost like watching a football game or something. The final point about the screenplay (as well as the acting) is that it's all very believable. It sounds like a conversation I might expect to encounter in 1957 in a jury room. Even in 2001, however, the substance of the movie is still valid. The situation in real-life still occurs.One final thing about the acting. While all 12 men did great performances, I am continually amazed by Henry Fonda. He is one of the few men of his time I have seen fit each role he plays to a tee.. without ever overacting.In summary, this is a movie that very deserving of the praise it receives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so very underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stiffed for some Academy Awards by the masterpiece "The Bridge on the River Kwai" and unfortunately left off of the AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, "12 Angry Men" has its rightful place as #25 on the Top 250 list on IMDB - it deserves it. A fantastic film from start to finish, "12 Angry Men" had me glued to the screen, taking in every line of dialogue. Going by the KISS theory (Keep It Simple, Stupid), the entire movie takes place in the jury deliberation room and has a very small cast. Very intelligent and over far too fast, "12 Angry Men" is a real classic. Let's hope its legacy will live on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sidney Lumet: Political Filmmaker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realized, watching "12 Angry Men," what an intensely political film it is. The term "ahead of its time," is one I try to avoid, since no person, whether artist or businessman, is ahead of their time. They are, inextricably, unavoidably, a part of their time. But this is a film made in 1957--that's a pretty long time ago, culturally speaking--and it's still inarguably timely. The lead character, Henry Fonda (Juror #8), tries to force people out of making a decision based solely on race and personal convenience. The jury is deliberating a murder conviction, a young immigrant accused of stabbing his father, with ample circumstantial evidence that any "good" citizen could stand by if they needed to justify their vote. Most of the jury member want to get the decision over and done with hastily; they have personal errands on their minds, games they want to watch, people they prefer to see. And it's hot that day, very hot--air conditioning is not an option. Under these conditions, Fonda asks much of his fellow jurors: he asks them to put aside thier usual concerns for their own schedules; he demands that they dislodge many years of easy prejudices corroding their judgment; he pleads that they take the time to try and reconstruct other people's points of view, something most of these men clearly don't make a habit of. It's poignant toward the conclusion, after the men leave the courthouse, when one man admiringly asks Fonda his name. They exhange surnames, and then part, realizing either that they're incapable of small talk with each other after such a momentous moral experience--or perhaps that they have nothing in common now that they've emerged into the light of day.I don't think Lumet is viewed as political filmmaker as he truly is. "12 Angry Men" was his film debut, an astonishing accomplishment. But think of many of his subsequent films: a documentary on Martin Luther King's journeys; "Serpico," which charts the crusade of a copy compelled to question an entrenched system that wasn't working very well; the "Pawnbroker," is another powerful film, about how a concentration camp survivor tries to avoid dealing with the moral complications of the outside world once he's back in it; "Dog Day Afternoon" is about a character who is fed up with not having enough money for all the human responsibilities pulling at him. The protagonists in these films are all people that confront or have confronted systems of discrimination, be they racial or economic. And there is nothing more political than examining tyrannies. It's a brave body of work, one to be admired, and "12 Angry Men" is a great place to start.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film you wish wouldn't end! Excellent acting by all involved, especially Fonda. While it is a courtroom drama set in a jury room, in a lot of ways it is also a detective story, as the jurors try to piece together what exactly happened the night of the murder and find out it isn't as clear cut as they thought in the court room. 12 Angry Men shows how people from different backgrounds and with different personalities view justice, and how those opinions come out in the confined space of the jury room. Even after watching it and knowing what the verdict will be, you'll want to see it again in the future for the great interaction between the characters. The authentic locations add to the inherent realism; you can feel almost feel the heat and humidity in the jury room. Turn up the air conditioning and enjoy this movie!</fullReview>

For the record, a twelve-man jury debates on an apparently open and shut murder case. But the film is much more than the sum of it's parts. You hang on every word, the single set location becoming gradually more claustrophobic as the story gradually unfolds.Each actor has a moment in the spot light that they make their own. The performances are at once clearly defined each actor right at the core of their character, and at the same time so believable that they appear naturalistic, that by the end, you don't even realise you haven't learned a single name!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a fan of old movies, but this film was very compelling and excellenly directed. Unlike other legal dramas, the entire film takes place in the juror room. The beginning of the movie starts out with the jurors leaving to deliberate, and a single shot of the man whose fate they have to decide on. I normally would have been bored with a film that takes place in a single setting, but the director does an incredible job of presenting the different characters, and brings a lot of personality to every one. The viewer begins to understand each of the jurors as the movie progresses, and their reasonings for their verdict.The other great thing about this filmn, is that none of the facts of the case are presented in the court, and all of the knowledge the viewer has about the case come from the jurors. As they present their arguments, we begin to learn more about what might or might not have happened. At the end of the film, we still don't know what actually happened, which shows that the movie isn't about whether or not the man is guilty or not, but the reasoning and logic that produces the final verdict given by the jurors. The tension in the jury room is amazing and you find yourself siding with certain jurors, almost as if you were actually in the room.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody should see this movie. I first saw it in my 12th grade law class (that was more than 10 years ago) and I just finished watch it again. Fantastic! I think it truly shows us what a great debate can do to the understanding of a case. It's justice at its best. We all have prejudices that we must try to put away when making a decision like these men have to make. Why not try to apply this decision making system in our daily life. Maybe then, we would live in a better world.You can feel the tension in that room. First of all, almost all of the action is in the jury room. It's also almost in real time, so you can follow exactly what happen in the hour and half that the men spend in that room. Another thing, it's the hottest day of the summer and the fan isn't working until almost at the end. I find also interesting that these men, at the end of the movie, know a lot about each other, but they don't even know each other's name. That's why jury #8 asks jury # 7 his name when exiting the court building at the end.Truly a classic to be watch by everybody.Out of 100, I gave it 89.

		<fullReview>Anybody in the world who wants or needs to learn something about the concepts of justice, democracy, freedom of speech, fighting against prejudice, reasoned thinking and plain common sense, should see this film. Which means that everybody in the world should see this film. And not just once, but every so often, so that we can keep reminding ourselves of how important these ideas are for a human society to work. Because, using the metaphorical space of a jury room, this is what this film talks about. Many others do as well, but none can reach the viewer as convincingly, with the power, the directness and heartfeltedness of "12 Angry Men". And that is simply because it is so unbelievably good. This is a masterpiece on not only one but two accounts: Artistically, as the perfect script, the perfect cast and the perfect direction simply cannot be improved upon; the film grips you from the first ballot count to the last minute with such vice-like grip that you almost feel like you are right there sitting in the room with the jurors; and ideologically, as this unsurpassable quality and capacity to absorb the viewer gives it the strength to drive home a moral lesson worthy of a Martin Luther King or Nelson Mandela speech. I hope one day this film will stand alongside "Catcher in the Rye" and the like in children's school syllabuses the world over, as I consider it one of the great Works of Art of the century and essential viewing for any person who wants to improve his or herself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the strength of this film, apart from the excellent acting, direction and script is the fact that it dares to tell it's story in such a unique way. The viewers sees none of the trial - we have to listen to the jurors to find out about the case. The action barely leaves one room through the entire film. In this way, the film allowed itself to live or die by the strength of the acting. This was a bold move but it works. All twelve men give excellent performances and though I have tried, I think it is impossible to pick out one or two that really shine. Everyone is brilliant.The script is economical and rich. So much is said and we know a great deal about twelve men in such a short space of time. This is superbly done and really helps to involve the viewer.The direction creates tension easily and also shows the claustrophobia and boredom of the men.The best courtroom thriller ever made, which ironically doesn't really take place in a court room.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a film that takes places almost 100% of its entire time in one room with 12 actors, it is a brilliant piece of work not just for its great acting, but for its relevance.Anyone seeing this film today, can remark on how the wheels of justice are no different than the trials of today, that people are filled with good faith, that there are people who are innocent, that there are times when what you see is not the entire truth, that people are cruel, that people are bigots, that people are heartless-disconcerting and these things still haunt us in our present lives, but mostly that someone can stand for their beliefs when everyone is against them and overcome them.So perfectly portrayed. Looking at this film you will see that it is timeless, and that is what makes a film a classic work of art.Rating 10 out of 10</fullReview>

Or I could say that this has to be one of the smartest scripts ever printed. Or I could tell you the direction is worthy of the utmost praise.

		<fullReview>This is one of the most flawless and well acted films i have ever seen - never less then compelling from start to finish.All twelve actor deliver Oscar worthy performances.Sure - Fonda was given first billing - and rightfully so as he was clearly the main character in the film -but 3 other characters steal the show.Ed Begley (Juror 10) an excellent portrayal of a racist bigot and his racist tirade at the end is one of the highlights especially when everyone gets up and leaves the table - (except Warden and Marshall - who are disgusted but can bear to hear it.)E.G. Marshall (Juror 4) - The most intelligent juror that maintains his guilty plea to the end whilst the other 2 have prejudices. He will not be swayed by Fonda - and he genuinlely believes the boy is guilty - great acting by marshall.Lee J Cobb (Juror 3) - I was blown away by the stunning emotional, electrifying performance that Cobb effortlessly gives - some actors can shout - but Cobb can SHOUT like no-one else - "Everything in this case HAS BEEN TWISTED" Oh so realistic - and his final tirade was the best moment in the film.A brilliant character study - and the epitome of great acting10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective twist on typical court room dankness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we think of when a movie is set in a courthouse it is either A Few Good Men or the latest John Grisham movie via book. 12 angry men is set in the deliberations room after a trial has taken place and focuses on what matters. The 12 men who will decide this boy's fate. All but one is ready to convict, reasons ranging from their own child's disobedience to wanting to catch a baseball game. This movie is very effective at creating memorable characters. Having seen this movie several years ago and just recently reviewing it, I could distinctly remember all 12 jurors and their personalities. One can't help, after viewing the film, at how original and brilliant it was for its time. More recent courtroom dramas are all about an obvious unfair trial as in a black man on trial for something NO jury would convict him for outside the Deep South. This movie has one main set, which is the deliberations room and rarely strays from it. The long shots of what seems like 5 or 6 minutes happen regularly in the movie giving you the feeling that you are there. What draws me to this movie is that it is about fact and remaining objective. It doesn't have anything to do with prejudice on account of ethnicity, creed, or color. It deals with a child and whether or not he should be put to death. Movies don't need a big budget, fancy sets, or Will Smith to be great. Clever dialog and memorable characters work much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is one of those black and white classics, It's a great film With Henry Fonda,(Meteor) and Lee J. Cobb(The Exorcist) It's about a court case, in which a boy was accused of murder after he killed his father. Then the Jury, the twelve angry men, have to decide his sentence, Be is he Guilty or not Guilty. There's questions all through the film about whether if he did it or not. You want to know if he was Guilty or not? Well then watch the film, you may think its some old black and white dribble, but its more than that!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERSThe notion of a ninety-five minute movie featuring twelve middle-aged men in real-time, almost exclusively on a single set, isn't one that sounds promising. Yet 12 Angry Men does exactly that, and works as a masterclass in film drama.There are some nice subliminal moments, such as Rudy Bond as the bored judge, obviously resigned to what seems a cut and dried case. Dialogue and characterisation is well noted, despite occasional leaning in the latter stages towards platitudes ("Wherever you run into it, blind prejudice always obscures the truth" says Fonda commendably, but embarrassingly). Direction is where the film truly excels, though, with Sidney Lumet's camera waltzing constantly around the set, though never so that it's showy. A nice trick that I wasn't aware of was his gradual moving in of the set walls as the film goes on.For notable moments, it's interesting that the "good" juror from step one, Henry Fonda, leaves the room wearing a white coat, and passes the dark coat to the "bad" juror, played by Lee J. Cobb. I'm not suggesting this was a religious reference, but it is nicely symbolic. Also interesting is the step count Fonda does when he assumes the role of the elderly witness. While it's timed at "41 seconds exactly", in actual fact it all takes place 10 seconds quicker.There are perhaps times when character flaws are presented too readily, or too obviously, and the "vote count" is increased with unnecessary regularity, dissipating the tension somewhat. As the film moves on, Fonda's inevitable moral victory becomes more obvious, though this is a minor flaw and detracts little. The sweat, then the rain, and the excellent black and white cinematography all go towards making this a very special achievement. A mainstream film, though not a dumb one, cruelly overlooked by the Academy, who nominated it three times, but failed to give it a single Oscar.Versions of the film that wouldn't have worked:TWO ANGRY MEN: Henry Fonda tries to convince one other man that the kid is innocent. Only lasts ten minutes.TWELVE MODERATELY ANGRY, BUT NOT ESPECIALLY HEATED MEN: Twelve blokes sit around and calmly discuss the issues, while being polite and getting to know their feminine sides.THE TWIST ENDING: Henry Fonda turns round and says "I was only kidding, I think he's guilty as Hell really - let him fry!"Twelve Angry Men is a textbook example of good filmmaking, and an exceptionally good movie. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably Lumet's best picture. The film is not about story, it's about 12 characters, 12 very different people deliberating a straight-forward murder case, but as the picture goes on, things are not clear cut.The film features 12 fantastic characters, each one is different, each one has different reasons for their answers. Henry Fonda is brilliant, maybe not his best role, but still fantastic.Lumet's direction is not gimmicky. The director puts us in the film, you are part of this jury, we are number 13.The film is shot in black and white, perfect photography.I can't say too much, just watch it because it's a masterpiece derived from a simple story. This is a character picture.Enjoy.</fullReview>

There are also great performances by notable actors such as Martin Balsam, Lee J. Cobb, Jack Klugman, and John Fiedler. "12 Angry Men" proves that you don't need a fantastic scope to have a great movie: all but a few minutes of this takes place in a jury room, plus it's in black and white. All you need to create a classic is great actors, and a magnificent script. "12 Angry Men" has both of these, so I strongly recommend it! It's a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twelve Angry Men is a movie about a jury deliberating what appears at first to be a simple airtight case of murder. It ends up being an exploration of the psychology of the jury members. This film encompasses prejudice, stupidity, flippant behavior, and a few others. It revolves around the one juror, (Henry Fonda) having the guts to stand up to the crowd &amp; voice his uncertainty with the conclusion that the others have reached. It then delves into this man's ability to turn the others to question their own understanding of the case by exploring the "facts" by using one's mind.Excellent psychological study. I hear it has been remade but I haven't seen the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie Made me Happy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 ANGRY MENAs the rain fell I realized that I wouldn't have to go to work. I checked through the movies that were coming on and noticed 12 Angry Men. In a film class I took last semester my professor showcased Sidney Lumet and showed us a bunch of his movies. However 12 Angry Men wasn't one of them. I saw Dog Day Afternoon (1975) and Serpico (1973) and was entertained by both of them. Having the chance to see the 1957 classic 12 Angry Men was right up my ally. It is always interesting to watch a directors first movie.As I began to watch 12 Angry Men I felt a strong vibe that I would be in for a treat. The movie began only steps away from where the movie would virtually take place in it's entirety. Character development was illustrated artistically and without the aid of a single name barring the closing seconds of the film. With twelve men in a hot room, Sidney Lumet did everything right. His camera gracefully wheeled around the room capturing the actors as best as possible. The movie began with an eleven to one vote on sending an eighteen year old kid to the chair. As the movie progressed the number reversed itself slowly. Henry Fonda was the one that everybody first looked at and felt angst against. He was the only one holding them away from breaking out of a hot room filled with 12 men. Fonda showed strength and confidence in his belief that chance is worth a lot. This takes a great stake in any case but with the life of a man on the line it's the greatest stake of all. Fonda supported his belief that it was possible for this young man to be innocent with a host of supporting evidence. As he went through his arsenal he swayed all eleven other men to agree with him that the young man should not be killed. The cast around Fonda was amazing. The film portrayed a theater like essence and each character took the stage and performed with consistency and great poise. Each time a character came to a point where they may have seemed to be stumbling they were picked up by another character.Watching this movie did a lot more for me then mostly all the movies that are being released in today's age of movies. I had the pleasure to see Sidney Lumet speak at Al Pacino's birthday party at Lincoln Center and although he only commented on Al and his ability, I am now fully beginning to realize just how good of a director Sidney is himself. A tremendous eye and ability to get the best from his actors makes him one of my favorites.12 Angry Men is not a good movie but a great movie. Shot in black and white and within the confines of a few rooms and a short closing shot outside the courthouse, Lumet mastered what he had to work with. With two weeks of rehearsal the actors polished their roles and the film eventually turned out to be a success then and now. This is the type of movie I would recommend to someone that isn't only interested in special effects, sex or explicit violence. The movie was well written and directed and should be viewed by anyone who enjoys theater. If I were asked to elaborate on why I rate this movie so well this is what I would say. The movie had twelve men at each other's throats. Each man began with a vote and all but one changed his mind. For a man to give up his initial decision a lot must happen. For some of the men in this movie it wasn't so hard to change their vote. For other's it came down to extreme matters. Some of the men were attracted to sending this kid to his death because of other reasons. The last man to change his mind was obviously torn by the the case because he and his son had gotten into a fight and have since not spoken to one another. This silently played a roll in his head throughout the movie but was finally captured when he ripped up a picture of him and his son. As he changed his vote ending the drawn out debate of this kid's fate, he shed his own tears over the loss of his son.Another man who was slow to change his mind, based the case on himself. He figured in his head that the alibi that the young man had was not sound. Yet when put under the spotlight by Fonda he found himself in a hole. He eventually went on to change his vote but was stuck on his own belief for a while. Once a man decided to think one way he is usually in it pretty deep. For him to change his mind and say uncle he must be proven wrong or embarrassed. I can't say enough about the characters in this movie. They all had something unique about them. They all played an important part and shed new light on the matter at hand. I wonder to myself just how many characters a movie can have with them all showing importance. In this movie it was clear that 12 men was right on the money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a masterful look into the workings of trial by jury. At the movie's opening all of the jurors are ready to send the defendant to the chair...except one (Fonda). He takes it upon himself to try to convince the other jurors that there is reasonable doubt that he committed the crime and thus potentially save an innocent man's life. Having never served on a jury, this movie made me think about how an innocent person can be saved by thoroughly examining all of the facts, rather then jumping to false conclusions.

		<fullReview>A very good film that seems more suited to the stage. The story is simple yet concise and thought-provoking. A teenager with a history of crime behind him is charged with murdering his own father. Most of the jury, the dis-interested judge and several witnesses are all of the same mind - guilty!!Its left to one man, Number 8, (Henry Fonda) to use his liberal sense of justice &amp; circumstance in defending the boy against impossible odds - especially when faced with one of the biggest cynics of the jury, Lee J Cobb(his best performance by far)Lumet directs with great aplomb, the routine story is given extra life by the wonderful characters who really give a tour-de-force performance, and perhaps makes us feel guilty when we decide individuals in modern society are instantly guilty based purely on their ethnicity, social standing and other inner prejudicesBut what I admired most was the camerawork. 90% of the film takes places in the juryroom where the 12 men (no women, no blacks - this was 1957!) deliberate. With a clever combination of lighting &amp; tight camera angles you feel as if you can smell the clamminess &amp; claustrophic atmosphere of that intense little room.A weak point could be directed at Fonda for playing the whiter-than-white liberal rising above the savage right-wingers, and to be frank I didn't rate his performance much above mediocre - for me, his best role apart from On golden Pond would be Once Upon A Time in The West!The true acting honours really go to Cobb and especially, Ed Begley, playing the racist redneck to a tee.***/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry Fonda's best role. Gripping, dramatic, an extraordinarily powerful film more truthful than any documentary. It is also an important primer on the prime directive of American jurisprudence: that we as a nation prefer that 100 guilty men go free than that a single innocent person be convicted. The concept of "guilt beyond a reasonable doubt" is nowhere defined in the American legal code or Constitution. This movie does it for us. It also makes clear why no one, not even the President of the United States, may commit perjury without deliberately working to undermine the very basis of our legal system.</fullReview>

Although it is Fonda's film as the Man in the white Suit the ensemble give a structure and balance that is required in such a claustrophobic setting. Lumet's direction is first class and not even Citizen Kane rewards repeat viewing as much as this. The premise is simple but the execution of such a tight script with no gimmicks is inspired.

		<fullReview>Henry Fonda stars in this electrifying drama that takes place almost entirely in a closed jury room. A teenager is on trial for the murder of his father and will get the chair if found guilty. The jury takes an early vote and it seems that Fonda is stands alone in voting "not guilty." Now, he has the challenge of trying to win the others over to his side. A tight script and an explosive performance by Lee J. Cobb make this a true classic. Fonda is great as the mild-mannered protagonist to Cobb's fiery antagonist. A great cast fills out the rest of the jury, including John Fiedler, a very young Jack Klugman and Jack Warden, Robert Webber, E.G. Marshall, and Martin Balsam as the head juror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems as you grow older, you can appreciate older films more. That does not mean that when I hit the age of 65 I will appreciate a film like Citizen Kane, but now that I am in my late 20's I have a desire to see some of the greats from years past. Just five years ago I was too narrow minded to want to even try to appreciate older cinema and some of the screen greats. But today I rented the 1957 classic, 12 ANGRY MEN and was not only pleasantly surprised, but I truly liked it and thought it to be quite a good film. What's quite fascinating is to see the change in political and social climates since the days of black and white film. In this film, there were no black jury members, no women, and no swearing. This was also, to be fair, probably the worst handled case in the history of trials next to the Warren Report. Questions that today would be common place were avoided like the plague. Evidence was not handled properly, very little effort was put forth by the defense to come up with a defense at all and witnesses were never thoroughly interrogated or cross examined to refute what can only be regarded as flimsy testimony. But, not only was I not around in the 50's, I have no idea what the North American justice system was like back then, and perhaps that is what makes this film so interesting. So I can only say that it is possible that a case could be handled this poorly, given its circumstances. You would have to compare and dissect what society was like back then to get a true appreciation of what was and wasn't possible. To talk about the film, yes it was very enjoyable. It was a great film that unwound piece by piece all of the apparent infallible theories that pointed to the guilt of this kid. The writer should be given a lot of credit for that. But having said that, a film like this would never see the light of day with today's fickle audience that would rather see a film like Con Air than High Fidelity. I am not critisizing today's audience for that, just pointing it out. But the 40's and 50's were different. Spielberg and Lucas and Don Simpson and Joel Silver were just little tykes then. It was a different time. A film that only talks and has no action was perhaps a possible sell back then with a cast like this. Lee J. Cobb and Henry Fonda and Jack Warden must have been at the height of their popularity so that immediately leant credence and respect to the project. But it wouldn't matter who did this film in today's age, it would not work. Again, not a critisism, just an opinion.I think it is important to go back to the roots of cinema every once in a while to view some of it. You come across gems like this and you learn to appreciate them. 12 ANGRY MEN is a fascinating film and it is one that serious lovers of film should watch every now and again to feel the aesthetic of film before special effects started to replace a good script and a good director. Tarantino would appreciate something like this. In his version of 12 ANGRY MEN, the 12 jurors would probably have names of colours and at the end they would all have grabbed Henry Fonda's knife and tried to kill each while uttering the F-Word in, but a film that prides itself on dialogue more than action is what he is all about. This could be a pioneer of a Tarantino film project.12 ANGRY MEN is a great film and it is one that HENRY FONDA should have been proud of. A wonderful experience! And it is great to see some of his work, other than On GOLDEN POND.9 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic 50s classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is such a great movie. To think that a movie, set almost entirely in one room with nothing but twelve male jurors deliberating on their verdict for a murder trial, can be thrilling and exhilarating even though you know from the outset how the denouement will unfold! Incredible. Aside from the great performances (by each of these great actors) the standout in Twelve Angry Men is Lumet's subtle pacing and tension-building. Lumet gently leads us in to the crucial characteristics of the jurors. The interplay is wonderful and the slow realisation that there is more to this trial than previously seen is deliciously unfolded.Atmosphere is as important as character. Watch the jurors sweat in stifling heat and then delight in the rainstorm. All the while, Fonda remains cool and calm in his white suit. A ticking clock, a wall-mounted fan and a dozen heated debaters are perfectly exploited to portray this study in prejudice, justice and humanity. The interlaced moments of comedy are very welcome too and always appropriate to the progress of plot and character.This film writes the cinematic book on claustrophobia, perspiration, dogmatic bandstanding, small-mindedness, the power of reason and measured persuasion, the mundane games played by truly bored jurors and ultimately the belief that justice will prevail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, juror #3, LIGHTEN UP!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly a true classic, "12 Angry Men" is one of the best dramas ever filmed. In this movie, everybody can feel the tension, not just by the jurors themselves, but the viewers as well. Henry Fonda does a great job as the good-hearted juror #8, and Lee J. Cobb is equally great as the bad-tempered eight juror. As juror 8 is trying his best to find the reasonable doubt to spring off the young defendent accused of murder off the guilty seat, juror 3 and a few other jurors want to see the kid hang."12 Angry Men" is practically my favorite old movie (I like a lot of new stuff), because even though its atmosphere is very old-school, its got the same dramatic intensity found in current dramas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard to imagine how a movie that takes place in one room can be so entertaining. The script, and the excellent acting make this a must see. I have watched this movie over and over and never get tired of seeing it. These twelve men, all from different backgrounds gather to decide the guilt or innocence of a young boy accused of murdering his father. "On the surface he appears to be guilty" is quoted by one of the jurrors. Henry Fonda isn't so sure.. the eleven others seem to be sure of his guilt. Throughout the 90 minutes these 'Twelve Angry Men' hash it out. They discuss, argue, fight, and even threaten one another until a verdict is finally reached. This movie is truly a masterpiece. A must see for all movie enthusiasts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately the film is a marvel to watch and to appreciate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of setting a film in one room for 90 minutes during a trial on the hottest day in New York. Is an incredible challenge to any scriptwriter and director Potentially a disaster waiting to happen. Lumet's direction and Rose's script give the film an atmosphere which drips with sweat and tension. Boris Kaufman's camera work, forever up front and direct with his in you face shots gives the film its claustrophobia and tautnessGiving that this is Sydney Lumet's first film, makes the film an even bigger accomplishment. And is the seed from which the majority of his films have explored. All dealing with the law and those that brake it and corrupt it, all delivered in fine taunt thriller form, with which he has become synonymous whether for, ?Serpico', The Anderson Tapes', ?Dog Day Afternoon', ?Q &amp; A' and most recently ?Night Falls on Manhattan'.To make it truly captivating which it is, is a bonus especially as we didn't see the crime so even we cannot as the audience make an opinion . We are in the same boat as the jury. The cast is led by Henry Fonda who honestly cannot say the young black is guilty, so the story goes from their. From the script and its tackling of the American law and how on the surface a man may seem guilty, but is innocent until proven guilty. The films genius lies in Rose's script, and its imaginative use of the various members of the jury which fuel the narrative. Then how each member maybe swayed or has certain prejudices which come to light throughout the film. In doing so makes it compelling and a stunning piece of ensemble cast acting if their ever is one. Each have their moment to shine, igniting the story further, giving the film an impetus. Without which the film would have become as static as one would think because of its one location. Ultimately the film is a marvel to watch and to appreciate on every level of film making</fullReview>

It stars a great Henry Fonda trying to defend the boys life against the prejudice of many of the jury men. J. L Cobb is magnificent as an angry man who effortlessly ignores any argument that the defendant shouldnt "fry" in the chair. But as the film evolves, we learn that he has some built up anger towards society and that failure in life leads him to act the way he does. When he collapses in tears, muttering the words, not guilty, I had a tear in my eyes. Ronald Emmerich could never have made this. Its great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film. I've only even seen parts at different times. I always meant to sit down and watch the whole thing, but too much to do lately, I work. Luckily, AMC is showing it often, so maybe I'll see the whole thing.But for now - here are my thoughts: Henry Fonda is superb - did the kid really do it? I still don't know. But the character actor suppport is audacious! Everyone is in there - Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, Sr., Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, E.G. Marhshall, what more can we want in black and white? That's when the camera operators show their greatness.I think 1939 was the greatest film year of all - Grapes of Wrath, Wizard of Oz, and the very special Gone With the Wind.I watch old black and whites whenever I can - Bette Davis, Claudette Colbert, Veronica Lake (So Proudly We Hail), Lauren Bacall, Clark Gable (my favorite), Humphrey Bogart (Deadline USA'52 is a favorite besides Casablanca), James Stewart (FBI Story one of his best here), they are all the greats. Not one to touch them these days. Curiously, though - I like the new Drew Barrymore. She's become a woman.Carol Young Foley Just my picks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"12 Angry Men" is one of my few very favorite classic films. It has a great dialogue, especially the arguments between #3 (Lee J. Cobb) and #8 (Henry Fonda). The setting might be a bit atrocious, but the atmosphere and the tension between the men make up for the droll backdrop. Cobb has probably the best role there, because he really fights for his right to accuse the defendent of guilty and to shove the young punk into the electric chair, while Fonda also does great as he struggles to convince everyone else to find the reasonable doubt for the defendent. The direction of the movie is excellent to compare with the performances. It's very tight, yet it adds to the gloomy atmosphere inside a humid jury room. Put simply, "12 Angry Men" should have won best picture '57 all the way. A lot of people would agree with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not big on watching old movies, for many reasons. Black and white does not bother me, but the poor film quality and the cheesy special effects (like using iguanas with stuff taped to them for dinosaurs), when there are any, are very distracting. However, my biggest problems, and really the only ones that prevents me from watching a lot of them, are the overacting and the hokey dialogue. This movie is one of the few of its day that I have seen that does not suffer from these problems (the others being mainly Hitchcock films- there was never any hokeyness in those). Instead, it is a great character study. The dialogue is believable. Really the only thing that makes this movie unrealistic if it were to be set in the present day is the absence of non-white jurors (of which the remake took care of) and of women (which the remake did not address). Other than that, this movie could easily have been made in 1999 instead of 1957.So for those who shy away from old movies, don't avoid this one, because it is easily one of the best films ever made (hence its ranking in the Top 250 on this site). Yeah, so it's in black and white- so was Schindler's List, and parts of the Blair Witch Project. There are no phony special effects to make fun of, no stilted dialogue, and no bad acting. All in all, I give it a 9 (the only movie I've given a 10 to is Schindler's List). That's saying something from a person who tends to abhor old films.Do not watch the remake: watch the original.</fullReview>

The intense setting, the biting dialogue is all well complimented by perfect casting, each of the twelve is right on target, from Robert Webber to John Fiedler and everyone in between.This film stands alone.

		<fullReview>'12 Angry Men' is what good, quality film making is all about. It doesn't rely on lavish sets or special effects. It is a dramatic piece which needs no more than a stage. Though it is the script and performances which what carry it along. Performances by two of these actors, Henry Fonda and E.G. Marshall are unrivalled. Now I won't bother telling you what it's about. That's for you to find out, but what I can tell you is that this film despite its low budget gives us more than a few things to think about. What is justice? Could we in deciding the life of another remove all our prejudices and resist the herd mentality? But as well as a superb script, which gives the film so much intensity and passion, there is the amazing camera work and the little known trick whereby throughout the film the director (Sidney Lumet) had the walls of the already cramped set moved in very gradually so as to increase the tension. It is all these things which makes this film so good and relevant even now. I have as yet not seen the remake of this film and so therefore cannot comment on the quality of it. But as far as I can see how can anyone improve on perfection?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I have a couple of problems with this movie which keeps this from being a classic for me. First of all, I recognize that this is a different time than now, but I find it hard to believe that a defense lawyer would allow such obviously prejudiced jurors like the ones played by Ed Begley and Lee J. Cobb onto the jury. Even if he was just the public defender, it seems to me he'd have some sense. Also, again even though this was a different time, I read an article by Alan Dershowitz who points out there's no way Henry Fonda would have been able to bring a knife into the deliberation room. Nevertheless, this is still a good film, because it really explores what reasonable doubt truly means, and it showcases some excellent acting.

		<shortDescription>Defines the word "classic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My definition of a classic is anything that stands the test of time. Whenever it is measured against the yardstick of greatness, it always measures near the top. 12 Angry Men is a classic in cinema, but really stands out in my mind as an acting standard; something you measure all other efforts against. We watch the full spectrum of possible emotion evolve in these gentlemen throughout the 90 minutes we're given. I believe the only special effect was the sound of rain. Watching the talent saddens me a little as I realize the number of these fine actors no longer with us. Measuring this group against any other and my opinion is you will not find it near the top of greatness; but at it's pinnacle. To those that made this movie possible I'd like to thank you for the timeless gift.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have to wonder if the contemporary movies we enjoy today would not be so enjoyable if they did not have any special effects. Not that such movies are bad in and of themselves, but lately the trend seems to be to err on the side of dazzling high tech illusions rather than on the side of good acting. Twelve Angry Men shows that there is no substitute for good acting.As viewers, we're not being asked to solve a murder case here. The focus is on the jurors, their personalities, prejudices and conflicts with each other while they deliberate. The actors were so convincing in their roles I often associated some of the characters with people I have known. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant and humane film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am writing to express disagreement with the previous commentator who suggested that the film casts doubt on the jury system. The jury system is democratic, in that it allows the defendant to put their case before twelve ordinary members of the public and not an arbitrary, draconian body.Henry Fonda's character demonstrates that through the use of reason and not reaction, a jury can uphold humane values. All of the indifference, contempt and inflexibility is swept away by the patient and thoughtful reasoning of Fonda. The film is cinematically superb and has a timeless and beautiful human message that we must never lose sight of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will not waste your time by telling you that 12 Angry Men is a great film. That would not be to do the film justice. It is one of the finest works ever. The force that drives 12 Angry Men is the fact that the entire movie takes place in one room, and is entirely one scene. There is a jury room, and an adjoining bathroom. there is a quick opening in a court room, but beyond that there is nothing. That leaves 12 great actors in essentially one room for 90 minutes, and asks them to carry the movie. Through the great acting of Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, that is achieved, and so it is that you have a cinemtaic masterpeice.</fullReview>

I've seen 12 Angry Men many times since 1957 when it was first released. It is in black and white which seems to fit the film perfectly. Note the great use of close-ups used by Sidney Lumet.

		<fullReview>This film starts out and you have no idea how the heck the movie-makers were going to make a full-length piece out of it. And yet they did. And how. Henry Fonda plays superbly well, as all actors, in this argumentative arm-wrestle between heart and brains, the 'heart' being the humane aspect and utter respect for others, and 'brains' being the logical, cerebral but ultimately lazy approach to problems. There is a very, very strong morality in this film, and unlike what you'd think, it is very, very subtly implied, carefully placed throughout the genes of this masterpiece, and very strongly executed. This film is pure acting where film is closest to acting on a theater stage. This film is asking philosophical questions with purpose and meaning and depth rather than fancy intellectual babbling. And it is a grande analysis of the psychology of men, on many different levels and in a plurality of examples. And never in excess, or exaggeration. Not one over-dramatic scene. Just right. Brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film so good, you'll feel like you've gained insight into life and humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a film that's so good and so powerful that, as the credits roll, you actually feel like you've gained a deeper understanding of humanity, our justice system, and life in general. I mean it. It's really that good. Twelve jurors of varying ages, personalities, cultural backgrounds and social standings enter a deliberation room to determine the guilt or innocence of a troubled teenage boy accused of murdering his father. It's quite a simple premise ? a jury's deliberation ? one that occurs daily all over the United States. But the film manages to wring every last drop of tension, drama, and social commentary from this commonplace scenario that it's impossible not to viscerally experience the true weight and implications of such a task ? to search for the truth in a case of life and death.First things first: let's just appreciate how entertaining 12 Angry Men is. This is a film that takes place entirely in a single room, and tells its story completely through dialogue. And yet, it manages to be significantly more absorbing and enthralling than your average film with dozens of different locations and set pieces. The dialogue is so well-written and the characters so well-realized (and acted) that you become completely swept up in the proceedings. The pacing is also pitch perfect. The film rises naturally to a few emotional climaxes and confrontations, which are punctuated by quieter moments as the characters (and we as the audience) catch our breaths and process what has developed. And for a film that takes place entirely in such a confined space, there are a pretty incredible number of interestingly-composed sequences and long takes as the camera maneuvers from character to character and the drama unfolds. So yes, 12 Angry Men is a superbly entertaining film that absolutely flies by over the course of its brief hour-and-a-half running time. But it's also so much more than that. It's a film about "truth": its elusiveness, malleability, and vulnerability to the subjectivity of the human mind. Yes, there is a single objective truth to this, and likewise any real-life case; but the jurors don't know it, and neither do we. The objective truth isn't the point. The point is the impressionability of the "truth" ? how it morphs in the minds of the characters (and in ours) over the course of the film, and how significantly it can be informed by our emotions, past experiences, memory (and its limitations), prejudices, and a myriad of other factors. The film is able to crystallize both the beauty and the folly of our judicial system. The beauty, as Henry Fonda's character points out, is that the scales are heavily tipped in favor of the innocent, that no man can be found guilty unless that guilt is beyond any reasonable doubt. The folly? The subjectivity of reasonable doubt, and the unavoidable reliance on a human jury who are influenced by all of the aforementioned factors.But ultimately, 12 Angry Man a film about us ? people. Each juror in the film has a unique personality, temperament, and background which informs his opinion and motivates the role he plays in the story. Every juror gets his time to shine and the result is an ensemble that feels both diverse and extremely well- balanced.The strength of the characters in the film and the way they play off of one another is key to perhaps its most important theme: the danger of assumption, and the ease and quickness with which we judge one another. We watch as the jurors expose their biases and prejudices through their assumptions and judgments of the defendant, as well as one another. But even beyond that, the true brilliance of the film is that it subtly provokes the exact same snap-judgments from us as we watch. It's extremely easy to start to view the more critical jurors as the "good guys" and the dissenting, guilty-proponent jurors as the "bad guys." To invoke a psychiatric concept, we engage in splitting ? seeing some of the jurors as "all good" and others as "all bad." We automatically begin to judge the seemingly more prejudiced and willful jurors, confining them to a box of our construction without knowing barely anything about them.But in its revealing final moments, the film snaps us back and urges us to look beneath the surface of those who we judge and ask an important question: why? Why does one juror spew prejudice and anger while another sits silently? What drives them to act in the way that they do? No one is born prejudiced, bigoted or racist. These are things we learn and which become incorporated into our personalities often through no fault of our own. The angry, prejudiced juror isn't inherently "all bad," but simply reacts in a way that is informed by his accumulated life experience (much of which is subconscious). Of course, that doesn't mean that people can't and shouldn't be held accountable for their negative attributes and beliefs ? we can always introspect and take action to improve our worst qualities. But that isn't the point. The film simply asserts that we should strive to understand before we judge, as understanding and empathy fosters connection where judgment simply divides. As Juror #3 ? who we've likely judged and grown to despise throughout the film ? weeps over the torn photograph of himself and his estranged son at the conclusion of the film, the message couldn't be clearer.12 Angry Men is a masterpiece. It is a film that marvelously succeeds on all the facets that every great film should. It's fabulously entertaining and engrossing, fantastically shot and acted, perfectly paced, and extremely thought-provoking. An undeniable classic whose themes will never lose their relevance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men: A Classic Work of Genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film.12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as "the boy", and the witnesses as "the old man" and "the lady across the street".In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Many movies don't hold up very well. This isn't one of the movies. 12 Angry Men is about 12 angry men that sit in a court room discussing whether or not a boy should be considered guilty or not guilty. Simple right? Well, this boy is being accused of murdering his own father and is also going to be given the death sentence. Seriously, what's not to love about this film? I really loved how it doesn't show you the court case which saves time and most importantly, gives you a neutral view of the case. This also makes what the dialogue a lot more interesting. The more they discuss the case, the more you learn about it. This is even more genius because you don't even know if the evidence they are discussing is factual. I also loved how distinct all the men were. Especially for a black and white film, it could've been very difficult to tell who's who but by not giving them names and instead giving them each their own personality. The guy with the high pitched voice, the guy who gets mad all the time, it's easy to know who's talking and what their stance is on this case. Honestly the only thing that bugged me about the film was the unoriginal soundtrack/score. It didn't fit very well and sounded clich. 9/10 - Amazing. Just watch it.</fullReview>

Critical thinking by Henry Fonda enlightened indisputable evidence supporting the integrity of the defendants statement.

		<fullReview>Now I just can't get over how long it took for me to finally watch it, and it just reminds me that life's too short to not watch movies that can potentially end up as one of your favorites.I've wanted to watch it for a long long time due to the fact that I had watched all movies on the top 250 top 20 except for this one and I found that very disturbing. The motivation was just not there (I guess it's because it's from 1957 and in black/white). I usually love old movies once I play them, but until then they don't tempt. My point is, don't be fooled by these things - it's pretty awesome if you're the kind of movie watcher that pays attention to characters in particular. If you like a lot of action in form of things that break and a shtload of visual effects, however, this is not for you.A guiding instrument in terms of 'good movie'-measurement is the nearest watch you have (that's if it's not obvious to you whether you like it or not). If you feel the need to look at it all the time, you're bored. I didn't look at my watch once during this one. Both the storyline (especially so early in movie history), the static setting and the non-given information such as names are controversial but yet working. It doesn't lack motion nor drive nor even personal motivation from each character which is something that mediocre movies often lack.At first I gave it 9/10 simply because I have some favorites that I like more, but then i thought 'what does it (not) contain that should make me give it less than 10?' It's not visually stunning, but for me that's not necessarily a condition. The acting, the story, the dialog, the characters and the dynamics of it just played and I totally recommend it to anyone who likes classics and/or appreciate the spoken word more than or just as much as physical combats. In conclusion (just to be really deep): Like all good movies it makes you feel</fullReview>

It is the type of films that you begin thinking that you are going to be bored, and after some minutes, your curiosity begins to grow until the moment when you fall in love with it.

A wonderful script, perfect performances and a great direction. The unique thing that somebody that likes cinema can say about this film is that it is a masterpiece that need to be seen more than one time to really see all the nuances and to really appreciate it as it deserves. It is in the Top 10, but maybe it should have a better position. If you like thrillers, justice films and you like interesting dialogues, this is your film.

		<shortDescription>Timeless classic. Not by accident.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a subjective review, so it shows only my opinion about this movie. This is a very exciting story about 12 jurors quarreling over the fate of the accused, but it's more profound than that. The main character (played by Henry Fonda) is the only one, who believes that the accused guy is not guilty. He tries to convince the other jurors to agree with his opinion. The brilliant thing in this is that the actual happenings are not known for them(nor the viewer), so even we can't be sure, if they make the right or the wrong choice. As the story progresses, the viewer himself is to be convinced by either side. All of the jurors have personalities, not one of them is trite. It's a great achievement for the movie to build up such characters in very little time.The atmosphere is great as it draws in the viewer, and the talent of the actors are shown clearly, because the film doesn't have corny action, or gore like many of them nowadays, it's just pure acting, and directing. I can not mention a mistake, not even by today's standards. There have been so many attempts to make something perfect, but this is one of the few ones in my opinion, which really is. It was made by little money, in b&amp;w and it only adds to its charm. I give this movie a 10/10, one of my personal favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know you have a great story when there's no need for location changes, special fx, or gimmicks. 12 Angry Men takes us on a journey by examining what is truth vs perception of truth when personal viewpoints, emotions and prejudices are attached. You are left asking yourself how hard is it to be truly unbiased while someone's life hangs in the balance. Are you sure what you believe is what you believe under intense scrutiny and in the presence of undeniable truth. The cast is excellent and each character is markedly different from the next which makes every bit of dialog and interaction be it verbal or non-verbal very tense at times and also suspenseful. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8. He soon becomes the ringmaster of this jury room circus. His chief antagonist will be juror # 3 played by Lee J. Cobb. These two couldn't be more polarized on the issue of guilty or not guilty. Each argument that is presented by each juror must be examined, re-examined, and proved without a reasonable doubt. Layers of the proverbial onion are peeled back until we are left with nothing but raw unadulterated truth. It may very well be the truth not about guilt or innocence, rather truth about ourselves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cheesy, predictable, classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is an undeniably great film, whose simplistic directing and predictable plot ultimately take it away from a 10/10.The story focuses on one man's struggle to convince a jury of 12, 11 of whom disagree with him on the verdict, to acquit a young man of his father's murder.Instead of spending this review describing how important this movie is, how well-thought out the script is, or how impressive the individual acting of most jurors is, I shall attempt to pinpoint the movies very significant weaknesses.First, and most importantly, the movie has some of the most disgustingly heavy-handed, and cheesy moments I have ever seen in a film of this caliber. 1. The scene where the German corrects the racists' English. 2. The scene where Juror 8 calls Juror 3 out on his exclamation of "I'm going to kill him!" 3. The scene where everybody gradually stands up to show their backs to the speaking Juror 10. Juror 10 then goes down to sit in the corner, like a naughty kid, never to speak again for the remaining duration of the movie. 4. The sweating Juror 4 as Juror 8 proves him wrong, despite him apparently "never sweating." 5. Juror 3 finally giving up after a long tirade at the end of the movie.Secondly, the movie is extraordinarily caricatural in its portrayal of some of the characters (in order of submission to juror 8): Jurors 7, 10, and 3. They were all under developed and largely portrayed as either bigoted, stubborn beyond reasonable doubt (pun intended), or frivolously disinterested beyond belief.Finally, the extraordinarily simplistic camera work was useful for setting the tone. However, the fact that no characters outside the shot in any specific scenes were allowed to butt in on conversations made the entire movie seem very preachy with only the characters being convinced to change their votes one by one involved in any one scene at a time, along with Juror 8, and occasionally Juror 9. Furthermore, the focus on certain characters led to unbearably long monologues that were hardly believably in a 12-man jury debate. (Renoir in "Rules of the Game," in 1939, had already innovated far beyond this type of constrictive and simplistic camera work and directing.) The anarchy that would have been undeniable in a similar situation therefore end up having to be portrayed through unbearably loud and plainly stupid caricatures listed above^.In conclusion, the movie is a great one, but it has undeniable weaknesses that are so strong, they take it away from a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pound for pound, Sidney Lumet still has the finest filmography of all the New York giants (sorry, Marty), and to think he began his features career with this brilliant character study is to blanch at the man's gifts. Set in a single jurors' room over the course of a long summer's day and evening, Reginald Rose's scenario started off as a teleplay?just as Lumet himself came from the quick-fire world of live broadcast drama. But the director seized on the technical freedoms allowed him by an ace cameraman (On the Waterfront's Boris Kaufman), ratcheting up the claustrophobia with every close-up. Often, these dozen jurors seem on the verge of blows; the movie, dealing with a murder trial, is about persuasion, but it also showcases New Yorkers' distinct talent for coexisting in tight quarters.Yet who would mind such company? Justly, 12 Angry Men is celebrated for its uniformly terrific cast, chiefly Henry Fonda's soft-spoken advocate and Lee J. Cobb's resistant blowhard, racked with daddy issues and not about to let an ungrateful teen go free. A closer look at the performances reveals a minimum of Method fussiness, the grace notes of Jack Warden's jokey baseball fan and Robert Webber's Mad Men?esque smoothy landing in quiet harmony. Meanwhile, too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet's window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can never be tired of watching this. A classic to say the least. Limited space. Limited cast. Limitless entertainment served with anxiety. The movie says/teaches how to preciously make use of resources at ones disposal. It's a text book to carve a beautiful movie out of simple things.The movie relies totally on arguments and counter-arguments. It means so many words, dialogue, exchanges. One has to be attentive to catch up all the action. But one doesn't worn out of this attention we have to pay. This movie rings up the curiosity in you. It invokes the mindfulness in you, with out tiring you out.The countless revisioning of each act from each individual and the difference each argument brings to our perception about the occurrence of those acts is truly remarkable. This movie is timeless. It's equally impactful in these modern times, and is potential enough to invoke the debate on the wrong and the right and our perceptions and excuses about them. It's a technically strong movie with no minute detail being left out that is canvassed with excellence. Endearing performances, impeccable screenplay, intellect in dialogues and yet with their subtlety make this movie a colossus classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Room Powerhouse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Making a movie of a stage play is difficult enough. After all, movies are supposed to have many scene changes, whereas plays typically have only a few. This one, however, has basically none, except for a brief opening and close. Besides, most movies have eye appeal, usually good-looking people, especially girls. This one, however, has none. Just 12 ordinary looking guys, without a girl in sight. So how do you hold audience interest with such a spare format. Above all, you better have darn good actors and a darn good screenplay. Good thing the movie does.I like the way director Lumet keeps the jurors moving around in the little room. That way there's some action, and often the movement is expressive of how the juror feels about the deliberations. No doubt about it, the cast is a powerhouse of familiar faces from that period. Some low-key their performance, like Fonda, Balsam, and Klugman; others are familiar loud- mouths, like Begley and Cobb. So is the kid guilty or not. If so, it's 10,000 volts in the Big House. Besides, it doesn't help the kid that he's a poor minority, at least in the minds of some jurors. No doubt about it, for better or worse, there's a basically liberal sentiment at work in the screenplay.As the script shows, most of the guys just want to get back to their routines even though a lot's at stake. Besides, the evidence appears open and shut. So, on first ballot, it's 11 for guilty and just 1 for not (Fonda). What is he, a trouble-maker or something. No. He just thinks the evidence is not as damning as first appears, and they all need to examine it more closely. Good thing he's not running for office. Showing how the 11 get eventually whittled down to 0 is what the movie's about. In the process, some like Begley and Cobb reveal a lot about their private selves, while others are simply open to the doubts that begin to open up.The deck is somewhat stacked in terms of likability. The biggest holdouts for guilty are the least likable, except Juror #4 (Marshall) who operates on logic alone. Fortunately, Fonda's low-key, reasonable manner is not off-putting as a know-it-all; instead, he's mainly a catalyst sparking contributions from others. I guess my only reservation is with giving the jury only two choices?"guilty" or "not guilty". Seems to me, on the basis of the evidence, the proper conclusion would be "not proved", since the kid may well have done it. However, the evidence does not prove that he did, at least not beyond the metric of "reasonable doubt". All in all, a nice plot twist.Anyway, the movie's a showcase of ensemble acting that rivets audience interest despite the limitations in staging. Too bad it wasn't recognized at the time as the classic it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fireworks From Start to Finish</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's some wonderful acting in Welles' "Touch of Evil" (1958), especially between Heston and Welles. There the characters don't duly wait for space to say their lines, they're impatient, try to cut into the conversation and steal that moment or two in the flow of conversation they know they won't be granted otherwise.In this film Lumet goes as far one can go in this respect. The characters are no longer characterizations, they're real people, interacting with passion, conscious of their space not only in the room but in the conversational dimension, just like we are in real life.The cinematography corresponds to this intimacy. The air is full of emotion, presence. I often consider Dreyer's "La passion de Jeanne d'Arc" (1928) as the ultimate close-up, but it might as well be this one. I have never felt having been transported to a place with such frenetic control, oxymoronically speaking. This is fireworks from start to finish. Then again, the cinematographer is one of the great masters of cinema. Consider that this is the man who shot all those amazing interiors in Vigo's "L'Atalante" (1934), it's not entirely shocking that there's so many visually preternatural things transpiring. Moreover, here one may find the cr?me de la cr?me of any version of Sherlock Holmes ever made, a whodunit in which logic is overturned by logic, emotion by emotion, recollection by clarity. A wonderfully executed study of thought guided by prejudice and assumption and of thought guided by passion for lucidity. The Region A Blu-ray released by the Criterion Collection is great not only for having impeccable image quality but also for the brilliant extra material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing you could blame 12 Angry Men for is its predictability with this scheme that repeats itself until the final outcome, offering no surprises. The rest is top-notch and we are certainly in front of one of the best, if not THE best closed-door feature ever made, a very difficult genre as it happens.The script relies on very well written dialogues, powerful, striking, captivating throughout the movie, and well developed characters that each have their own psychology. It is played by convincing actors, Henry Fonda on top of the list.One can easily appreciate the difficult task that falls to the members of the jury and the ease with which an error is possible, even though some demonstrations are a bit far-fetched.As for the direction, it is very good considering the limited possibilities offered by the set. The shots are intense and emphasize perfectly the oppressive atmosphere and the important choice the jury has to make.</fullReview>

A murder case jury about to vote guilty is convinced otherwise by one doubting member (Henry Fonda).Though unconvincing in detail, this is a brilliantly tight character melodrama which is never less than absorbing to experience. Acting and direction are superlatively tight, and the film was important in helping to establish television talents in Hollywood. In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".</fullReview>

The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda.

		<shortDescription>A Flawed Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time about a year ago and rated it 8/10 then. Having re-watched it today I have felt the need to knock another point off.I really enjoyed this film. I love the premise of having an entire film shot predominantly in a single location in real time. In a lot of ways it is more of a play than a film and this gives it a unique twist (although I am aware of plenty of other films that adopt the same technique).The positives points of the film are: Character development - We get to know the characters at the same time and to the same depth as those in the room, no more, no less. We are given limited knowledge about them, their backgrounds, their prejudices and are encouraged to judge them in similar vain to how they are judging the defendant on the limited information they have about him. Very clever and the mix of personalities from the shy, retiring to the clearly angry and racist rings true of the likely cross section of personalities that would be found in a real jury room.The message of the story - I think it rings true today just as much as it did in the 1950's. Trial by jury is a flawed concept and people can be easily manipulated by fellow jurors and lawyers alike. I particularly like how juror 12 flits between guilty and not guilty and how they are all too eager to make a snap judgement without thinking in the first instance. This is a common problem - these people are not lawyers, they do not think like lawyers and will always struggle to set aside their personal feelings and prejudices to look at the facts in the cold, hard light of day taking account of the reasonable doubt issue. The manner in which this film uses its limited set/time frame to achieve the very real feeling of manipulation is impressive to say the least.The acting - All of the actors play their parts perfectly. You find yourself wanting to know more about them but realise the premise is that you are in the same shoes as the others. To be given such thinly created (in the best sense possible) characters and still want to know more about them (where did the racist undertones come from, what happened between juror 3 and his son, why is juror 8 so eager to prove the reasonable doubt?) is impressive, especially in such an ensemble piece.So where does it lose points? Simply put I don't like the way that the "innocence" is proved. It flys in the face of the proper court process and is just a little unbelievable and all too conveniently pieced together (do you really think they would be paying such close attention to a witnesses nose??). I understand the need to create the reasonable doubt but feel that it was done too easily with each juror falling into place far too quickly. I was also disappointed that juror 3 gave up his convictions. It would have been a much greater triumph, in my eyes, if it had been a hung jury. I agreed with juror 3 and empathised with the choice he had to make and felt that the "honorable" juror 8 bullied his opinions on everyone else.The point of the jury is to consider the evidence put before them and to make a judgement on that basis. They should not bring in numerous assumptions (and that is what they did) which colour the evidence they have been given. Doing so will always create sufficient doubt to acquit the defendant. There is too much danger in doing so and I do not believe that in a room of 12 strong characters no one would raise such an objection.Or I may be missing the point entirely! Maybe the manipulation by juror 8 is the whole point....In conclusion, therefore, I can see why it is a classic but am at slight pains to understand its high position in the top 250 given the nature of the perceived flaws. Having said this I suggest that if you enjoy thought provoking, well scripted and acted drama this film is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I say GUILTY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is about twelve men who were jury in a case of murder.In the beginning only one man said the words not guilty ,but after a long and "convincing" dispute all the other men changed their minds and voted for not guilty.Now if it wasn't for the nice performance that Lee J. Cobb showed nobody would be thought of defendant's guilt.I'm not saying the other actors weren't good but i think that Cobb has stolen most of the scenes. What i didn't like was that the evidences strongly suggested the boy is the murderer,and suddenly from nowhere Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) has brought weak points of view which couldn't so hardly prove the accused was not guilty and to quote Juror #10:"I don't understand you people! I mean all these picky little points you keep bringing up. They don't mean nothing."'makes me think he was right.But the way the script is written at the end they let you make the decision you think is right since they are not showing any scene that would suggest the murderer(at least i was expecting that). Anyway,i have to say this was my first black &amp; white movie that i saw and i can't say that i didn't like it,actually i loved it and i would recommend it to any of you who wants to see a good drama movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Scathing Indictment on the Criminal Justice System, and One Hell of a Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The one reality of this film is that the kid probably did kill his father. Yes, Fonda's character is very skilled at manipulating the facts in the jury room, which does create enough reasonable doubt in the minds of a confused jury. Fonda truly does have the "soft sell." Of course, Fonda's acts should have been carried out by the public defender who was representing the kid, if they had, the district attorney could have countered all of them. But the fact that the public defender did such a poor job, it ends up actually handicapping the prosecution. Everything in the jury room is left to speculation, because it could not be fully uncovered in the court room. All of the points made by Fonda could have easily been addressed and most likely shot down by the DA. If anything, they could have been explored. I think this movie speaks towards the poor defense that most poor/minorities get when their lives are turned over to public defenders that are working 10 cases at one time. This is after all a Warren Era case. In the end, we have a jury trial, in which the Prosecution presents an open and shut case. The defense is too incompetent to make one valid argument for not guilty. However, the case gets re-argued in the jury room, by twelve amateurs that don't really have all the information they need to properly asses the facts of the case. The reality is, that if the kid had had a good defense attorney, he would have been found guilty. But the bad job done by his ill-prepared attorney created the perfect conditions for one juror to raise reasonable doubt. Now, if that is not an indictment against our criminal justice system, I don't know what is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry Fonda is my personal favourite of the classic cinema era in the 1940's (The Lady Eve, The Grapes of Wrath etc.). Sidney Lumet grabbed the point of film-making in this movie, made a genuine, unprecedented and essential classic masterpiece. What is virtuosity, if not shooting a meaningful discussion in the 90% of a movie in a room?! There is no strong acting or outstanding camera work, but everyone shares equally in setting up this incomparable courtroom drama. What an editing, what a great simple base story! The release year of the film is 1957 and I think it is a perfect timing because from my viewpoint it refers to communism, and people's disbelief in it. I mean by that that not everything is what is looks like, and it is easy to agree with the majority on obvious evidences. We have to get to behind reason, to search for the reason of the reason, and to always think before we leap. Stubbornness is not the answer for a complex issue.I would not spoil any film lovers upcoming experience by writing a word about the plot. Enjoy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic, provocative writing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You wouldn't think that 12 men in a tiny room would produce so much drama, so much passion and such a compelling film. But 12 Angry Men is a unique film. It's a roller-coaster ride that never leaves the jury room. 12 Angry Men presents us with a jury that has been given a murder case. A man has been stabbed to death and his son is the prime suspect. As these strangers take an initial vote to see where they stand, a lone juror stands between them and a quick conviction. Deliberations begin; sometimes civil, sometimes heated as the 12 men attempt to reach a unanimous decision.I truly admire this film for what Henry Fonda's character represents. He is an idealist. He has convictions (no pun intended). A lone juror standing between eleven men and an easy guilty verdict. He believes in a jury system where they discuss the verdict, not just vote. It would have been so easy to simply agree with the room. The boy is probably guilty. Everyone seems to know it. But he wants to talk. Discuss the case for an hour.The collection of jurors is perfect because they are so 'imperfect'. A collection of businessmen, laborers and immigrants that makes this jury what juries should be; a representation of society. Every character has his own perceptions, his own biases; and those opinions are brought out through magnificent dialog that is under-appreciated in today's cinema. We know very little about the jurors, in many cases we don't even know their names. But we know many of their occupations and, more importantly, we know their beliefs, manifested in the stance that each character takes, or doesn't take, as they discus the trial.As excellent as the casting is, I credit the writing for instilling the drama. Every sentence is constructed flawlessly. The flow of this movie is brilliant, again considering that virtually every passionate scene is delivered within a confined space.This film is simple and real. The jurors get emotional, tired and frustrated; as would be expected locked in a room for hours on end. We understand the stress these men are under. We understand the anger each character is feeling, justified or not. We feel uncomfortable during a racial tirade, as though we were in the jury room unable to escape his bigotry. I think movies that make us feel uncomfortable have succeeded admirably.In a world where special effects, explosions and profanity are commonplace, excellent writing and flawless delivery is missing; or extraordinary when displayed. A movie where 12 men never leave one room would probably never hold today's audiences. That is a shame. Movies that stand the test of time, as this one has, do so through the emotion that is expressed by the characters and empathized with the audience.I will leave the bulk of the plot of this film for your enjoyment, although the logic with which Henry Fonda's character reviews the prosecution's case is deliberate and fascinating. The characters are the plot. They drive the story by their actions and words. That is the focus of this film; action and words. Brilliant words.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>~SPOILER WARNING~I first saw this movie in 10th grade about2 years ago, and now I have the movie I could watch 10 times if I wanted. I think this movie deserves more credit than it's given, specifically because the meaning of it goes much deeper than a simple jury trying to decide whether a youth is innocent or guilty. Human nature and emotion is shown on many different levels, ranging from personal prejudice to calm indifference. All of the Jurors are interesting in their own way, but I think it's particularly because of his apathy that I find Juror #7 the most captivating. It might be due to his incredible lack of interest or to his constant humor that serves to ease the situation, albeit for a short time. He's not a *bad* person, but his character and some of his dialog (i.e. "I got a different method. Laughs, drinks, jokes...tricks..." at least I think that's what he said; I wish there was a script I could look at)suggests that his character leans more toward cunning and, of course, trickery. I feel bad for Juror #3 at the end when he breaks down after tearing up the picture of him and his son. It's gotta be one of the more emotional scenes in the movie (which is saying something, considering that the whole movie is largely about human emotion.)All in all, I'd give this movie a 10/10.</fullReview>

But I don't think it should be held up as an example for real juries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no adjective to qualify this extraordinary all-times classic, which demonstrated that there is no need to spend heavy sum of money to make an useful film. The life of a young man likely to be innocent is an enormous responsibility for any jury in the world, and the plot goes around this issue. People in the jury do not necessarily think in the same way, some may favor what the supposed evidences showed in the process, others do not think too much and go behind the wave of the opinion of the majority, while others may be going deeper into this matter and not accepting all testimonies as good evidences. Furthermore, majority always tries to convince that minority who really analyzes each evidence and its truth. That's what we can see in "12 Angry Men", which was filmed in a room with the participation of only 16 actors, some of them playing outstandingly like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Jack Warden and Martin Balsam among others. It is a paradox to note that such an excellent material only got Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for best director (Sidney Lumet) and actors (Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb). However, outside US the film got all the merits it deserves, as BAFTA in UK, Bodil in Denmark, Golden Bear in Berlin Festival, Blue Ribbon in Tokyo, and Silver Ribbon in Italy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw it in an 8th grade Civics class and it has been my all time favorite film ever since. Most court dramas show you the trial, the lawyers, the witnesses, and the verdict. This takes a trial from a unique prospective, from the jurors who actually make the decisions. It runs the full range of human personalities. Juror 1 was thrust into the position of foreman; he struggles to lead as near chaos seems to erupt around him. Juror 2, a small weak individual who gets kicked around for most of the film. Juror 3 appears to have no personal feelings in the case, but frequently loses his temper. Juror 4, a cold, endifferent, arrogant stock broker who doesn't even sweat, practically a robot. Juror 5 came from the same background as the defendant and is desperate to appear unbiased. Juror 6, a simple construction worker who wants to see justice done. Juror 7, the class clown of the jury, appears to know right frome wrong, but just wants to get to the baseball game on time. Juror 8, the central character, a passionate, progressive thinker who believes in the power of one individual. Juror 9, a wise old man who brings a unique prospective to the case. Juror 10, white trash, pure and simple. Juror 11, a foreign immigrant who believes in truth, justice, and the American way. Juror 12, a business man who at times finds himself in over his head. It may be possible to predict how one of these personalities might vote, but this film shows that you cannot predict how they will interact with each other and how this interaction will affect the outcome.</fullReview>

(Even Jack Klugman from this movie got his own TV series on the subject called "Quincy", which was mostly about freeing people falsely accused, and nobody calls Klugman a bleeding heart.) *Some* of those thousands of shows are more interesting and plausible than 12 Angry Men. But as Isaac Newton once said, "If I have seen farther than others, it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants." People who nitpick and point out flaws in this script are failing to note that this show is one of the "giants" upon which all modern scripts are resting upon.I did a calculation and found that the average number of *movies* that these 12 actors have been in is 66.75. At random I took another contemporary movie that was similarly rated, ("Sunset Boulevard") and came up with the number 79.08 for the top 12 actors. Hmm. Maybe I should go watch Sunset Boulevard. Maybe it's more fair to compare "12 Angry Men" with a modern movie instead. A similarly rated Drama, "Schindler's List", scores only 46.41. Of course, these films are getting the benefit of the statistic because I'm counting only their first 12 actors, not the ENTIRE CAST.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent copy of the last half of Kurosawa's Ikiru.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film, but watching Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru, one of the best films I've ever seen, kind of ruined it for me. Basically, the entire film seems to be borrowed material. In the second half of Ikiru, a group of individuals argue back and forth about the intentions of a character who passes away. In 12 Angry Men, the jury argues about the guilt in a case. It's not the same situation, but it's basically the same type of storytelling. The problem is that the second half of Ikiru is so much better than 12 Angry Men, I was kind of left wondering what is so great about 12 Angry Men in the first place. I'd recommend seeing 12 Angry Men first if you haven't seen Ikiru, because it simply can't compare to Kurosawa's masterpiece. Good, but it is unquestionably outclassed by Ikiru.I'd give 12 Angry Men about a 7.5 to 8/10, but I'd recommend you also see the far better Ikiru, easily a high 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Make that 13 Angry Men! (include me) From the opening pan of the courtroom and the shot of the wide-eyed "victim" (all ready for his painted-on-velvet close-up), I knew where this movie was heading. Henry Fonda, in his white suit was liberal political correctness personified. I'm not taking anything away from the plot and the characterizations and the impressive acting all around, only that the intentions were so blatant and the action so manipulative. Would Hollywood ever have made a movie where the direction of the action moved from innocent to guilty? Not on your tin police badge! I hoped that at least E.G. Marshall would have stuck to his guns (so to speak) but the plot had him cave because of Fonda's evidence of litte dents in the side of the nose from glasses. Ugh. Now we all can go home and feel better about how good the good guys are and how bad and corrupt the system is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men was the highest ranked films in the imdb "Top 250 Movies of All-Time" that I had never heard from. That was my main reason for renting it.Before I go on I must admit that I like black and white movies much, and if you don't then reconsider watching this movie, 'cause there isn't much action to divert you from the fact that it is in b/w.This is one of the few movies witch I'd say you ?d have to see before you may saying that old movies aren't as good as the new ones.The movie is about one man who stands up to eleven other men and tries to turn them over to his side one by one. He does this by questing facts and using sentimental reasons. The film gives a clear view of how it can go and how it should go in murder cases. Except for the first few moments, the film is played almost entirely in one room witch is actually too small for twelve men. You see the evolution in people and the way they think and act.The cast is very small ant that makes it possible to identify yourself with every one of the jury members.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Architecture Of the Human Face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this film, and watch it whenever it's on. It was adapted from a television play by Reginald Rose, and directed by Sidney Lumet. A deceptively simple story of twelve jurors who must decide the fate of a very young man who may or may not have killed his father. These men are a cross-section of American and in particular New York society, circa 1957, and range from the working to the upper middle classes; from the highly sensitive to the appallingly crude; and from those who think they're smart and perceptive and often are not, to those who think little of themselves and who really ought to rate themselves more highly. The play is so intensely written, and Rose had such an excellent ear for dialogue, that one often finds oneself caring more for the jurors than for the outcome of the case they're deliberating.At the start of the film, there is one holdout for not guilty against the eleven who believe, with varying degrees of sincerity and seriousness, in the guilt of defendant. It's the job of the lone juror to convince the rest of the logic of his position, which is one of reasonable doubt. It's here that Mr. Rose, or rather his lead character, plays fast and loose with the rules of evidence, as has been pointed out over the years; and while I'm generally a stickler for rules when it comes to matters that plays and movies are often reckless with, especially where medicine and science are concerned, I make an exception in this case due to the excellence of the writing, and of the movie as a whole. If ever there was an actor's film, it's this one. Every actor gives a superb performance. Some characters are better conceived than others, and thus John Fiedler, as the milquetoast of the bunch, and Ed Binns as the working man, are at somewhat of a disadvantage, no fault of the actor. Ed Begley's character, a bigot, starts out interestingly, then descends into somewhat of a cliche, which is too bad in way, since Begley was at the top of his game at this stage of his career. Martin Balsam's sighing self-pity is put to excellent use in his performance of a man who likes to coach football. George Voskovec is magnificent as a foreign-born watchmaker who challenges Jack Warden's loudmouth salesman. I've never seen Warden better than he is here. His character is a jerk and a joker, borderline Runyon, or rather the way Runyon types often are in real life: insufferable. Warden plays for effect rather than charm, and has a way of making other performers look good in their reactions to him, which tend to be unfavorable. E.G. Marshall is imposing as the icily superior stockbroker, oozing contempt for others while maintaining a facade of fairness. Not a bad man, just a snob, of the sort one encounters often in the real world, seldom in the movies. Lee J. Cobb is the juror with a deep personal involvement in the case, and becomes in time the nearest to a true villain (albeit a pathetic one) of the piece; while Henry Fonda's dissenter more or less wears the white hat. Cobb gives the sort of highly charged, emotional performance he gave in On the Waterfront, a bit quieter here, and not so malevolent. He was brilliant at conveying the demons of men who don't know they have demons. Fonda manages to be saintly with becoming sanctimonious. His character has the thankless job that liberals often take on, which is that of defender of the damned. One senses at times that the man would rather be elsewhere, that he's a tad too retiring for the this sort of thing.What I remember most fondly about the movie is its exploration of the architecture of the human face, often in close-up or medium shot. We see old faces and youngish ones, the craggy and the smooth, the granite-jawed and the slack-jawed. There are anxious faces with eagle eyes and lazy ones with drowsy eyes. Some faces smile automatically, others benignly, some not at all. With so much emphasis nowadays on action pictures, it would be good for young directors to study 12 Angry Men, to see just how much action there is in the human face. I'll take this one over Pearl Harbor any old day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An acting and writing tour de force!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 ANGRY MEN is quite simply a film masterpiece. You might not know it from the description--12 jurors who are complete strangers to one another are collected in one room to decide a murder case. 11 believe the defendant, a young boy from the wrong side of the tracks and living in the slums, is guilty, beyond the shadow of a doubt. The last one, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), believes there is a reasonable doubt about the boy's guilt. How Juror #8 eventually gets the other jurors on his side is the point of the entire film, and it almost entirely takes place in the one small room. Hardly splashy, with no special effects--just 12 actors, a script, and the camera.Sounds boring? This film is anything but. Reginald Rose writes a great story, and though you sometimes get the feeling that this film is meant to be a play, that's largely due to the slightly claustrophobic feel of having the entire proceedings of the film take place in one room. Works for a play, but in a film, one expects cuts to other places, wider shots etc. Still, even this counts in favour of 12 ANGRY MEN, because it forces one to concentrate on the case, the dialogue, the actors, the characters. Of course the film is talky. There's hardly any action. But it couldn't be more well-paced or timed. In fact, it's exciting, in its way. Every time a new vote is called, every time a vote changes to 'not guilty', the audience feels the triumph of something, some 'je ne sais quoi'. Director Sidney Lumet does an excellent job of manipulating the black and white medium he chose for this film, making the film timeless (even more so than the 1997 TV remake with Jack Lemmon in Fonda's role--yes, the jury is no longer one of '12 Angry White Men', but colour still dates a film in a way black and white doesn't). The character study is really what makes the film: you'll recognise everyone in that jury room, from the non-strident nonconformist (Henry Fonda) through to the man who has such great difficulty separating his personal emotions from the facts of the case (a stunning Lee J. Cobb). There's the bigot (Ed Begley) who realises that his words will always fall on unsympathetic ears; the flighty guy who just wants to get to his baseball game (Jack Warden); the shrewd old man who shouldn't be discounted just because of his age (Joseph Sweeney); and the stuffy intellectual (E.G. Marshall) who isn't too uptight to change when he realises he's wrong. That's only half the cast of characters in this film, and aside from the rather unfortunate foreman or Juror #1 (Martin Balsam), every single character is well fleshed-out and a believable person. You can understand the reasons why they change their votes; it's all perfectly within character. Quite an accomplishment, to bring to life 12 men in the space of one and a half hours. Much credit, of course, must go to the writing of Rose for real, credible characters and dialogue. One remains riveted to the film even though it's mostly talk and no action; that's surely an indication of how great the writing and acting in 12 ANGRY MEN is.Henry Fonda does a fine job as the man who initially stands alone with his own reasonable doubt. As usual, he underplays his character rather than grandstanding it, thus allowing for his fellow actors to shine in the showier roles. All of them turn in brilliant performances, but of particular note would be Cobbs, whose final impassioned stand as the odd man out (in a complete reversal of the beginning of the film) is simply stunning. Marshall and Sweeney are excellent in their roles as well. This is most certainly one of the best films ever made: understated, underplayed, but definitely not over-rated. You've heard about 12 ANGRY MEN, I'm sure--so if you haven't seen it, why not? You're missing out on a great script, a great cast, and a great moral about the value of democracy in the American judicial system (one that isn't hammered into the audience--it's made with no self-congratulatory fanfare). Watch this--it's worth it.</fullReview>

I personally watched this in grade school as a class requirement, and had to write an essay about it. I can only hope that schools continue to show this to kids in high school.

		<fullReview>Actually,I seldom saw movies produced by Hollywood before 1980's.So I draw some conclusions that American movies are simply action or sex movies with shocking pictures.My compatriots often laugh at them as no deep contents.But as I see some films which are not so popular in my country,they enlighten me a lot about America nowadays as well as before."12 Angry men" doesn't begin with ferry scene,but very fascinating subsequently,it raises my blood pressure,and exits me very much.I have ever read about novels written by John Grisham such as "the runaway jury"and know something about jury system,yet no concrete comprehension.I hold the marrow of America jury system that if there is no enough evidences to prove the suspect guilt,he is then innocent,even if there is a 11:1.It's a pity I don't know the end of the story but I believe "12 angry men" is one of the best Hollywood works. I imagine its final result is like the Shawshank Redemption,which moves me and encourages me.Another thing I'm still wondering is that why western people have involved in democracy for centuries and still have a strict law ;on the contrary,Chinese citizens are familiar with being ruled but not caring about the law.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aside from being extremely predictable, this was a pretty good film. A murder has taken place and a young boy's life is on trial. The film focuses on the twelve men that make up the jury. In the beginning, they are fairly certain that the boy is guilty of the crime. In fact, eleven of the twelve men believe he is guilty. One man, for no particular reason except for a hunch, feels that the boy is innocent. This, of course, causes a lot of turmoil amongst the other men. They must stay cooped up in that hot, cramped little room until they can all agree on the same verdict. The lone man slowly begins to question the facts. Pieces of the puzzle begin to fall into place and one by one, the other men begin to see the light. They too start to believe that the boy is innocent of the crime. In the end, all of the men end up changing their minds and an innocent boy's life is spared all because one man put a little more thought into the details. From the very beginning of the film, it is quite evident that all the men will change their minds in the end. The interesting thing is seeing what it is that actually convinces them to change their minds. The fact that almost the entire film was shot in the same room was quite effective. It allowed the viewer to feel as though they were actually a jury member taking part in the trial. The viewer never really gets to see all the details of the murder. When the members of the jury try to envision how long it would take an old man to hobble down a hallway, or what a person with poor eyesight would see through the windows of a moving city train, the viewer must try just as hard to envision such things as well.Throughout the film, the director used a technique where he kept changing the depth of field. Although subtle, it was also very effective in creating an ever increasing sense of discomfort and aggravation. All in all, this film was very well written and I quite enjoyed it. (Although I must add that the reason why the last man changed his mind was a little too emotional and hokey for my liking, by hey, whatever works!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great, but not without shortfalls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Superb camera work, dialogue, and acting. Cinematically, the film is top notch. Certainly a film that would not or could not be duplicated today. A sweat-shop of emotions, ideas and interactions and a personal favorite of mine (I purchased the DVD). All the positive points have been covered here so I won't repeat them.But the film does have a problem or two, which have become more evident to me with each subsequent viewing. Firstly, it is awash with political correctness and character stereo-typing. The `hold-outs' for a guilty verdict are depicted as bigots, authoritarians or dumb sports nuts (E.G. Marshall is the lone exception). The film, bordering on greatness, cannot seem to shake the `liberal' (good) vs. `conservative' (bad) overtones, which is truly unfortunate. As a result, the movie becomes more `preachy' than introspective or instructive. It is also predictable.A second problem is the actual arguments made that sway the Jury. Real juries do not (hopefully) reason in such a manner. For example, Fonda takes testimony from an eyewitness to the killing and calls it into question because of some vague assumptions: 1) The witness (a woman) had marks on her nose that resemble those made by eyeglasses - so the assumption is she wore glasses. 2) People normally don't wear glasses to bed - the assumption is she mustn't have either, therefore 3) She couldn't have identified the killer as she rose from her bed and looked out the window! As Lee J. Cobb CORRECTLY pointed out, perhaps the marks were made from sun glasses or reading glasses..who knows, she may have had her glasses ON when she saw the killing (of course none of this is brought up in court). But because of this convoluted logic, another 2 or 3 jurors are swayed to the `not guilty' side. There are other examples equally as egregious.Finally, the scene where Ed Begley spouts his bigoted nonsense and the jurors leave the table one by one is absolutely horrific and non-believable. It is these `chinks in the armor' that again, hold the movie back from it's full potential.Criticisms aside, the acting is wonderful. Lee J. Cobb should have won an Oscar. E.G. Marshall is excellent. Jack Klugman and Martin Balsam are also very good. Fonda is adequate, but not at his best. Jack Warden and John Fielder play their `character roles' well as one would expect. (One down-note - I thought Joseph Sweeney as `Mr. McCardle' was terrible).All in all, a great movie, even with it's blemishes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A guide on how to make a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is not often that you come across a thriller movie with no action sequences that blows you away, but that's where the brilliance of screenwriter Reginald Rose comes in play. The movie is set in a single room where 12 jurors are locked until a decision is made on an apparent 'open and shut' murder case. In the process, the movie touches on several pressing issues: why it is important to question the obvious; troubling sense of priorities of men who value attending a baseball game more than the life of a man; how questioning the facts, eliminating possibilities and being unprejudiced are the necessary qualities of a decision maker. The movie brings to the table 12 men of varied characters and lays bare each one in the limited screen time through just dialogue and no use of flashbacks. Even before the debate starts, we get a sense of an impending situation of a deadlock with the clever hints of a hot afternoon, faulty air conditioning, a locked room all adding to claustrophobia. Lumet used special lenses which make the room appear smaller than it actually was and throughout the course of the film adjusted the lenses to make he room appear even smaller, adding even further to the claustrophobia. A masterful performance by Lee J Cobb playing a self righteous juror having troubles with his teenager son steals the show as he acts as a nemesis to Henry Fonda, who also gave a wonderful performance. A perfect mixture of writing, direction, camera-work and acting make this movie a masterpiece of film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Succinct, extremely intriguing and enlightening, 12 Angry Men revolves around a jury of twelve men who are tasked with the responsibility of deciding the fate of a young boy charged with the murder of his father.The movie, almost completely shot in a small jury room, manages to keep the viewer engaged throughout. The movie begins at the end of the trial, where the judge solicits a unanimous decision from the jury and sends them off to discuss the case. An initial vote, reveals that eleven out of the twelve men are convinced that the boy stabbed his father to death, beyond any reasonable doubt. Only one man persists with the vote of not guilty, much to the consternation of others. His sole purpose being to have a proper debate before sending a man to his grave. The movie follows the course of the discussion, as it evolves and the evidence and testimonies are carefully scrutinized. Preconceived notions, prejudices and personal histories rise to the fore making things complicated. The movie brings out the fallacies of the jury system and at the same time questions the reliability of testimonies and other such evidence. It also preaches the virtue of standing up for what one feels and at the same time accommodating others point of view. Putting aside ones biases and examining facts objectively is shown to be a praiseworthy trait. Some brilliant acting performances and a great story-line make it an absolute must watch. The aggression and temper of Lee J. Cobb is well contrasted with the calm and open-mindedness of Juror number 8 played by Henry Fonda. The meticulous logic applied by E.G. Marshall's character, the insensitivity shown by Jack Warden's and the huffing- puffing Ed Begley are all quite believable. This short drama left me mesmerized and wanting for more. A movie not to be missed.</fullReview>

The Film starts of with The trail of 18 year old boy who is Convicted of murder of his father.The Judge Seems bored because all evidence points to Boy being guilty.After this The Case is sent to a jury room of 12 members who need to vote on it and decide if the boy is really guilty.The Law states that all 12 of them must vote the same.Everyone thinks the case is one sided except for jury #8,our protagonist.Ever One is taken aback by his vote.jury #8 explains that there might be a probability that the kid is innocent but even he is not sure.Rest of the story revolves around the arguments they have and the conclusion they arrive at.The main strength of this Movie is Its story and its characters.As we progress through the story we get interesting details about each characters and makes them unique and realistic.The Films also has a very interesting Mystery which is revealed bit by bit as the Story progresses.This makes it far more interesting.The director of this film did a great job in showcasing all these characters without getting clumsy and also interweaving a great story. The Cinematography and Score of this are also excellent and improve the film.Though this film excels in almost all aspects it sometimes feels unrealistic in some parts as characters suddenly remember minute things that happened during the trial 2 months ago and this makes a case for the jurors.Despite this slight flaw 12 Angry Men is a timeless classic which goes on to prove that Big Budget and CGI Are not required to make a great movie.All it requires is a strong Script and characters to carry it.</fullReview>

There are 12 jurors and each of them is random people, they aren't related so each of them has a different personality but they united for a reason they have to decide if a 18 year old boy killed his father.When i watched 12 Angry Men i saw 12 different characters from my daily life because the acting was so perfect. We can also realize that how hard is to debate objective and this movie is also a stunning criticism to the American Jury System. If you planning to watch it, there is one important thing that i can recommend: Pay attention to jurors , try to understand their feeling , i can assure you that they will match with the people in your daily life perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ever-timely call to the human conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No matter how prejudiced, preoccupied or plain angry you are, there's always a reason to slow down, step back and take a second look at things that seem obvious on the surface. That's basically the message of 12 Angry Men.It's been more than 50 years since this film was released, and obviously the rules of cinematography have changed since then. Now such theatrical films may feel somewhat odd or staged, and, indeed, 12 Angry Men is more of a play than a film. However, it's a rare occasion when the pure idea professed by a film becomes a manifesto that goes beyond a particular epoch or style, acquiring that kind of topicality that lives forever as long as there is a mankind.There's no point describing the events of the film, for they only serve as a means of delivering the film's message and call to our conscience, waking it up from the heavy dreams of our compromise-ridden lives. But it's the actors' work that turns the slow-paced narrative into a vivid showcase of emotions and characters. And even though Henry Fonda is the only big star of the cast, I can't say that the job is done by him alone. On the contrary, it's the men his characters confronts that really give the stage enough diversity and naturalness to feel real and true.The expected happy ending of the film doesn't really chime in with the gloomy cinema trends of the modern cinema. However, the hope that it brings has a deep symbolic meaning. 12 Angry Men isn't about opposing good and evil people. It doesn't divide us, instead, it tries telling us that, despite how we look and act right now, there's something good and honest and kind in all of us, and the future of this world, represented in this film by the life of a young boy tried for murder, depends on our ability to stay true to those sides of ours and find them within, however muddied they might be. Each of those twelve jurors had certain principles that he was ready to put above his personal fancy. And I can only hope that in the world of today our own anger, vanity or indifference are still not strong enough to make us lose our light completely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bona Fide Masterpiece And One Of The Greatest Films In Existence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One room. Twelve men. Debating for ninety minutes. That's it. That's all there is to this story. And despite that, what 12 Angry Men accomplishes with such minimal setting is something that majority of films fail to achieve with their big budget &amp; lavish production. It beautifully demonstrates what all can happen when a flawless script, a capable filmmaker &amp; a committed cast come under one roof and work in perfect harmony, for 12 Angry Men is one of the greatest achievements in the history of filmmaking.The story of 12 Angry Men takes place inside the jury room where a group of twelve personalities from different backgrounds gather together to decide the fate of an eighteen-year old boy who's accused of stabbing his father to death. With the preliminary vote indicating that most of them have already made up their minds &amp; consider the defendant guilty, one juror sets in motion further discussions regarding the case by voting "not guilty". The rest of the film follows the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict.Directed by Sidney Lumet in what's actually his directional debut, 12 Angry Men sets up its premise relatively quick and once the discussion begins, it's an extremely gripping, thoroughly absorbing &amp; thought-provoking cinema from that point onwards, keeping a firm grip on the viewers' attention and never letting go until the very end. Written by Reginald Rose who also scripted the teleplay this film is based on, the screenplay packs an incredibly lean plot that gives each character their fair share of screen time while moving the story forward simultaneously.Production design team doesn't have much to do as majority of its plot unfolds in a single location. Cinematography is expertly utilised as the camera slowly n steadily brings the characters closer to the screen as the plot progresses and doesn't move around much, remaining static for the most part. The black n white imagery also plays its part by giving a timeless sense to its tale. Editing trims all the excess fat to leave behind a lean story which is methodically paced from start to finish. Music is only intermittently used and has a very muted presence in the final print.Coming to the performances, 12 Angry Men features a powerful cast in Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden &amp; others, all playing their part with utmost sincerity. All the twelve characters are relevant to the story, each one of them is given a distinct identity and the actors chosen to bring these scripted people to life do their job with effortless naturalness. Fonda &amp; Cobb are the definite standouts in my opinion but it doesn't mean that the contribution from the rest of the cast isn't up to the mark, for every one of them chips in with a measured performance here.On an overall scale, 12 Angry Men commences Sidney Lumet's now-celebrated filmmaking career on an astonishingly high note and is possibly the greatest directional debut in film history. Original in content, accomplished on all scales &amp; full of twists n turns, this is easily the greatest courtroom drama of all time, one of the greatest films ever made, and remains one of the most engrossing, entertaining &amp; emotionally rewarding films in existence. Thanks to its universal appeal &amp; timeless story, it has valiantly stood the test of time for nearly six decades and is destined to do so for many more. In short, masterpieces doesn't get any more simpler than Sidney Lumet's magnum opus. One hundred percent recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great. It displays the prejudice, conceit, narrow-mindedness, arrogance, impatience and vicious stubbornness of human modern condition, even in this so-called enlightened country.While Henry Fonda's character might give us hope for rationality and cool- headed deliberation in times of stress and in the interest of justice, that his is an overwhelmingly lone voice in a crowded room, is truly disturbing.Sometimes it feels as if the movie is shot in real time. the jurors are all defined in terms of their personalities, backgrounds, occupations, prejudices and emotional tilts. This is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language, not action; where the defendant has been glimpsed only in a single brief shot; where logic, emotion and prejudice struggle to control the field. It is a masterpiece of stylized realism--the style coming in the way the photography and editing comment on the bare bones of the content.</fullReview>

Also , it displays the notion that 100 convicts may escape trial but we need to make sure innocent is never ever get convicted. Suspense is maintained throughout the movie and with the series of logical discussions that takes place with great dialogue delivery will not let you get up from your seat anytime during the movie .

		<fullReview>12 Angry MenWritten by Reginald Rose and directed by Sidney Lumet. 12 Angry Men is about a jury who starts off 11-1 for guilty of a murder case. It's up to Juror #7 to show reasonable doubt. The film is an ensemble cast with great direction. Wide shots inside a jury room allow for whatever the main focus of the shot to also include the acting of others behind or along side. Continuous acting, and if in the hands of a different director like say Scorsese or Spielberg, I would have imagined one long 90 minute take.Juror #7 played by Henry Fonda, best know for The Grapes of Wrath and Once Upon a Time in the West, is the main holdout who goes on to try and convince the other jurors who have their reasons to think he's guilty. Some are just going along with the crowd, some have personal issues, and some just aren't convinced. Fonda does a great job acting as an every man with some doubt. Juror #1 played by Martin Balsam, best known for Breakfast at Tiffany's and Psycho, is the person who is in charge of voting and for the most part keeps his opinions to himself. Juror #3 played by Lee J. Cobb, best known for The Exorcist, is by far the most interesting if not most stubborn character in the film. He yells, is arrogant, and has it in his mind that the boy murdered his father. It's not until the final minutes of the film that you get to know more about his character, but boy is it worth it.Juror #7 played by Jack Warden, best known for All the President's Men, but I first saw him in Problem Child as Big Ben. He plays a baseball fan that just wants to get out of the room as soon as possible so he can go see a ball game. It was great seeing him throw in little chimes every now and then as jabs towards the other jurors opinions causing more...anger. See title.This film lost three Oscars to The Bridge on the River Kwai. A movie that's now on my to see list. With it's wonderful acting it only makes me want to see the other more. Verdict: Best ensemble cast movie I've ever seen. For a movie that doesn't change location, it has surpassed Reservoir Dogs and Saw. That means a lot. Go rent/buy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story begins in a New York City courthouse, where an eighteen-year-old boy from a slum is on trial for allegedly stabbing his father to death. Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion?with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only "not guilty" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first.</fullReview>

The director is perfect to find out the reality. the human emotion might kill the body. But heavenly soul judges decide on the base their brain. All the character in the movie is as live. You may find inside your society where for lack of time of the politburos are killing man. As a scholar of social right it is a guide to me to evaluate the life of creatures. Where all the judges are same except one and one is working for life and justice, the one is the best. No need to be a maximum. It is democracy , where peoples good is remained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never seen such an amazing film, with so much drama and intensity. A true masterpiece. The plot is. A young boy 18 is accused of murdering his father, and the film starts with him in court. The judge the asked the 12 jury members to go to the jury room and decide if the boy is guilty or not guilty. And if the boy is guilty he will be sent to the chair. So the 12 men go to the jury room and all vote. Every man but 1 votes guilty. Except jury number 8. He reason for this is that he doesn't want to send a boy the death without talking about it first. He can't decide something like that in 2 minutes. So after this the 11 other jury members are angry and are telling him why the kid is guilty. And I listened to the other jury member explain why there believe the kid is guilty, I though he must be guilty they have given a lot of reasons why he is. So not only is Jury number 8 trying to change there minds he is also trying to change mine. So jury number 8 sets on giving reasons why he think the boy could be innocent. He forces on the small details, the details no one thought of before, little things that slipped peoples minds. And slowly he starts changing there minds and mine two (I mean at first I thought he is 100% guilty, but after listening to jury number 8, I now think he is not guilty). And the kid is found not guilty. This film is great because it takes place in one room, they are in the court room for the first 3 minutes. But the rest takes place in the jury room. You would think because of this it would make the film boring, but its is not. The acting is amazing, the drama is great, the story telling is wonderful. And the film being in black and white makes it so much better. This is the best film I've seen so far, and probably ever will be. ONE OF THE BEST FOR SURE.</fullReview>

With a low budget and a simple premise, strong acting, sharp directing and flawless writing really make this gem come together into something special.It respects your intelligence enough to let you slowly piece together the evidence, and throughout the movie you'll see the gradual change in all of the characters. And with just the characters and a room, it feels like all twelve of them are fleshed out and believable. It's an essential watch for anyone who likes psychologically engaging movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a classic, the only way to describe it. From the start you get a sense of claustrophobia that the jury would be feeling from sitting in the cramped jury room, and the tension gradually increases as the evidence of the trial is revealed, arguments are put across and the characters allow their own personal views, and in some cases prejudices, cloud their judgement. The acting is what makes this movie such a great one, Henry Fonda as the lone dissenter is magnificent, as are the rest of the jurors, particularly Lee J Cobb as the infamous volatile emotionally unstable juror number 3 and E.G Marshall as the cool and rational juror number 4 who judges on facts. The ending is wrapped in tension as the jury nears its unanimous verdict, and one feels a sense of relief when they reach it. All in all this is a must see for movie lovers, and the fact that its stood the test of time is an indication of how great it really is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a NYC courtroom, a first degree murder case against a poor 18 year old boy with a troubled history has just rested. The 12 men of the jury are sent to decide the seemingly open and shut case. They hold a vote and it's 11-1 guilty. Henry Fonda is the only not-guilty vote. He's not sure and wants to spend time discussing the case.This is the classic stage play. I say this meaning it's a bunch of characters in a room. The characters don't even have names. Lee J. Cobb and Jack Warden have the flashiest roles. Henry Fonda is essentially the lead as the central heroic role. He has the nobility. The roles are all filled with first rate character actors. This is an actor's movie. The only drawback is the cinematic potential. In the end, it is 12 men around a table in a room. The visual opportunities are limited. Despite that, the debate interplay is engrossing and the movie is satisfying.</fullReview>

Despite how there is largely only one set and one set of characters, the film is still very entertaining. I was engaged throughout. The characters were all well-realised and despite how there are a lot of them, I didn't confuse them or mix them up. Well that's not true. I did confuse them once or twice, but this didn't majorly detract from a powerful film about courtroom justice.I think what I loved the most about 12 Angry Men is how SPOILER ALERT it is never actually revealed whether the defendant is guilty or innocent.

A Jury to no surprise a Jury of twelve Men, sit and await due process, they joke and make small talk in the jury room, the ramble as if the just left the theater. Discussing impressions, of the prosecuting attorney, oh, "how he did a good job, then to baseball talk." Instructed there's no rules we can do it this way that way, then get out of here.11 to 1 by vote, sparingly by just one hand a debate of his life begins. They decide to go around the table to the reluctant hand, most knowing how to start or what to debate not being objective, buying what has been sold by the prosecuting attorney, and what the witnesses swore to no one yet to see any wholes or room for error. They discuss an agreement, or a possible motive; "but what does that prove?" The eleven goes on to discuss his pass how it may be indicative of the current event, giving their own experiences as if they are indicative. The one tries to speak and his word are twisted in fallacy trying to convince a quick decision. The reluctant hand argues for the boy, the boy whose life is at stake, arguing the whole case is based on two witnesses, and that the boy's attorney didn't try to rip the prosecution to shreds. Then they discuss the facts of a knife used in the murder and its rarity, insinuating that the boy never went to see a movie or was at the known alibi, of the boy. The 12 men argue back and forth and the reluctant hand slams down a knife to all surprise, claiming he went for a walk in the boys neighborhood and bought the same knife for just six dollars at a local store, despite it being against the law to by a switch blade knife.Then they agree on a secret vote which returns a turned vote, meaning they must yet debate again. Then the one who changed his vote explains it's not easy to stand alone and that the reluctant hand didn't say the boy was innocent, but that he wasn't sure; and obviously he wasn't the only one. They go on to talk about the witnesses, how they said this and said that, critical thinking questions are asked and men begin to think. They role play time scenarios to make sense of their disputes and one man brings up a theory of one assumption bringing forth doubt. Opinions change and awe hear arguments of the duty and responsibility that they have. The men demonstrate the way the knife was used, one man show the way a switch blade would have been used; and states the boy wouldn't have had the skill that was needed to commit the murder the way it was committed.Note from the Author/Publisher Dear readers, my name is Gabe and this is of my story, not only about a journey from, street art documentary, to arts marketing, but a story emphasizing, "Never Give Up-Just Keep Painting!"

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men, directed by Sidney Lumet, is a taught and tense thriller without any guns, bombs or violence. I instead, it focuses on twelve men, locked into a room to decide the fate of a man on trial for murder. It is the hottest day on record outside, and tensions mount as the agendas of each man are exposed, analyzed and ultimately dealt with in one way or another. At the beginning of the film, eleven of the twelve men vote for a guilty verdict, but one man holds out, and upholds the principles of the system he is a part of.This film is pretty flawless. It is a dramatic look at the court systems that existed in the United States in the '50's. Eleven men are willing to condemn another to death with little thought, but one needs to convince the others they are wrong. It is also well set, with the hot and humid environment and the booming thunder and pouring rain of a summer storm playing in the background outside, as the men inside struggle against there inner prejudice and demons. The film is wonderfully directed, shot and acted by an all star cast from the 1950's, including the great Henry Fonda. Each character is unique, a real individual, with their own prejudices, flaws and quirks. Each one tries to make the others see their way of thinking, or to speed up a conclusion.I could go on, but much more and much better reviews have been written already. Suffice to say, 12 Angry Men is a classic American film. It is towering in its simplicity, and tense as anything else. Truly one of the great films of the last century, and one that every film lover should see, and every film collector should own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Remake of the 1954 Television Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the classic 1954 television drama of the same name, TWELVE ANGRY MAN was director Sidney Lumet's first feature, after a career in television. It was also the first (and only) film that star Henry Fonda also produced, apparently he grew quite frustrated with the responsibilities associated with the role, even though he enjoyed the acting task.Shot in only nineteen days after an intense rehearsal period, TWELVE ANGRY MEN makes effective use of the confined space of the jury- room. Lumet employs different types of shot to convey the increasing sense of tension, ranging from the close-up, the two-shot and the tracking shot as well as the basic shot/reverse shot sequence. Through such strategies we focus on the jurors' faces as well as their reactions to one another. It's clear, for example, that Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) cannot stand Juror #8 (Fonda); not only are they ideologically poles apart, but Juror #3 cannot stand what might be described as the "bleeding heart liberalism" that prompts Juror #8 to question whether the accused was guilty or not. Juror #3's frustration is signaled as his face becomes more and more contorted and his voice rises into a high-pitched scream as he discovers that no one appears to listen to him.The shot/reverse shot strategy works most effectively in the confrontation between Juror #4 (E. G. Marshall) and Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney), where they discuss the effect of wearing glasses. We watch Juror #4's air of self-confidence gradually evaporating from Juror #9's point of view, until Juror #4 is forced to alter his judgment.Stylistically speaking, the film is divided into three movements. In the first, Lumet shoots most of the action from an aerial perspective; this has the effect of belittling the characters, almost as if their discussions were unnecessary in light of the verdict. In the central section the characters are shot from eye level; hence we become more and more interested in their reactions to one another. In the final act Lumet photographs them from below, with the camera looking up at the characters; as we see the ceiling of the jury-room behind them as they speak, we feel that the situation is becoming more and more claustrophobic as previously-held prejudices are broken down and the characters' true natures revealed.The film comes to a dramatic climax - which is not in the 1954 version - as we understand why Juror #3 has been behaving in such extreme fashion. The reason has little or nothing to do with the case in hand, and everything to do with Juror #3's familial struggles. In light of his collapse, Fonda's long speeches (delivered slightly earlier on) about the importance of fairness and tolerance appear even more pertinent.Even after nearly sixty years, TWELVE ANGRY MEN still packs a punch, not only in its analysis of the American judicial system and its emphasis on being innocent until proved guilty, but also for its stylistic brilliance, as Lumet shows just what can be done with a confined setting, a superb photographer and a brilliant art director (Boris Kaufman, Robert Markel).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't watched a film like this in years, it feels like ice cubes constantly slipping down my back, and it still have its wonderful impact on me although I love commercial films and am all for new filming technologies. I feel obliged to praise it without conservation.This is a typical example of minority influence: a single person sticking to his point gradually change everyone's opinion. The process is more than intriguing. I initially feel like the guys that vote for guilty are the kind of guys that vote for Donald Trump: ignorant, single-minded, stubborn, indifferent, selfish, occupied by stereotypes and prejudices, and always ready to comply. But as the film proceed, I gradually feel the warmth and intelligence that they possess, and to watch this amazing glare of humanity gradually brought out by the architect is most pleasant. It is a grandiose fight between calmness and arbitrariness, indifference and mercy, critical thinking and groupthink, equality and prejudice, "supposition" and "facts". The most startling technique this film uses is the transformation from above eyesight wide-angle shots to at eyesight level close-up shots. This change of distance between the camera to the audience makes the tempo tenser, and attracts significantly more attention to their points. Like many, I was not into the film in the first five minutes, but the longer I watched, the more my emotions were swayed by different points of view. Yet I wasn't even aware of it before I read it here. It is a very startling invention indeed.My favorite shot in the movie is when the man talked about how "they" are born to be villains, or how "they" naturally have the violent tendencies, all the juries walked from their seats one by one to show quiet disagreement. The impact was like shoving a bottle of icy soda into my chest, I was so touched that I started clapping my hands. Although racism might be a reason why all of them vote for guilty in the first place, the knowledge eventually dawned on them that this is wrong. My psychology teacher taught us that prejudices often occurs unconsciously. As soon as it is dragged from the shadow of unconsciousness to the level of reasonable judgment, its flaws immediately reveal themselves. The man remained silent for the rest of the film.Although I wonder whether they caught the true murderer or not, it is fairly clear that the boy wasn't necessarily the murderer. He could be, but he didn't deserve to be sent to death sentence immediately. My friend said that she suspected the murderer to be the architect, I'd say is fairly reasonable, or why would he bought an identical knife in the neighborhood? But anyway, the architect successfully avoided murdering an innocent boy with silence, I will give him a round applause for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Initially the movie started with one of the jurors questioning the alibi of the prosecuted kid and then there are the rest of the jurors turning a blind eye to the mundane matter until they are utterly convinced and quit being petulant and more serious cumulatively.Governed with profound analysis of the investigations at the crime scene they not only prove to themselves but to the entire audience the actual unrealized truth of the situation at hand. The overall cast of the jurors is absolutely pristine and I bet that halfway through it you wouldn't shut this movie to do something important, you will see how potent this movie is.

		<shortDescription>Greatest Courtroom Drama of *ALL TIME*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the greatest courtroom drama ever made. Instead of focusing on the courtroom itself, this focuses on the jury's deliberations. Despite this it is one of *THE* most intense movies of all time. That the director &amp; writer(s) were able to do *so* much with just 1 room &amp; 12 characters (except for a brief courtroom scene at the start &amp; an occasional appearance by the bailiff) is just amazing. You see the vote start with 11 guilty, 1 not guilty and slowly change to the final verdict of 0 guilty and 12 not guilty.The movie stars some of the best known actors of all time, as well as a few that hadn't "made their mark" yet, but would come to do so. The jurors are (from 1 to 12): Martin Balsam (jury foreman), John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec &amp; Robert Webber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best films you'll ever see. Almost the entire film takes place in a small jury room, and the dialogue and plot are excellent nonetheless. What is reasonable doubt? Is it easy to condemn a man to death? These are just a few of the tough, not-easy-to-answer legal questions proposed in this film. Furthermore, what is the motivation of a jury? Do they want to be there? You'll recognize many of the actors, including a young Jack Klugman and a young Jack Warden. Lee J. Cobb is brilliant, and his passion as an actor once again shines in this performance. The film is in black-and-white, which heightens the tension of the situations. A viewing tip: watch the intricate nuances as the director captures the developing interpersonal relationships between jurors. It's one of the best aspects of the film.</fullReview>

The plot is not entirely plausible, and dialogue was often quite preachy. So preachy at times I thought the courts could use the movie in their instructional and "inspiration" videos on the jury system!Good acting, mostly, though some of the actors playing the minor characters irritated me, by soapboxing.The movie did bring back some memories.

		<shortDescription>Best Jury Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is primarily about acting and dialogue. Most of the action takes place in the one room on a hot summer day.There had been plenty of courtroom dramas before, but 12 Angry Men was perhaps the first to have all the action take place after the trial, in the jury room. It unfolds in approximately real time, and the characters are known only by their juror numbers. One of the things that the film has been most widely praised for is its visual style.The movie doesn't become boring to look at even though it's set in one room.It's a story that by all rights should be visually static (one room) and dramatically boring (all the evidence has already been presented), but it's exactly the opposite. Just like the criminal case it addresses, it demonstrates that appearances can be deceiving.</fullReview>

The movie is a true classic and rivals many of today's much higher budget action filled flops. The plot line is simple yet elegant; in the way it portrays one mans defiance to social pressure and compliance. The movie is one of great significance to film itself.

		<fullReview>I kind of feel like i'm in no position to judge this film, because that is what a review is after all, judgment. The reason i feel unworthy of reviewing this picture is because it is one of the best films ever made and i can not say that about too many films. This film is a study on the nature of man and all of what he thinks. It's a study on why we take action about pretty much anything. Beneath all the convincing and lecturing, the main character shows more than that: the psychology of the masses, the prejudice and it's roots, the mixed feelings of thinking that you're doing good even when not sure if you are and so many more. I don't really want to get in to the story of the film, not only because the film offers a quick and grabbing pull into it's universe, but also for not wanting to ruin the experience of meeting the cosmos that Sidney Lumet orchestrated for the audience. This is one picture that deserves it's place in the books of cinema history and in my opinion, a great 1957 masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie in question, 12 Angry Men, is an exceptional movie about 12 jury members who cannot decide upon the verdict for the convict. This movie is an example on how the little details are important, in this case, in a murder case. The jury member played by Henry Fonda has some good and valid points on how a detective should've solved the case. Also, if you watch closely, the clothing wore by Henry Fonda is made out of white cloth, and his character is trying to save the life of the convict, which means he is shown to viewers as an angel of mercy, while the jury member played by Lee J. Cobb is his antagonist,sort of like the devil.</fullReview>

As I first watched it in a speech class, I did not understand until I took upon myself to watch it. There are a few things that could have been done differently; the room could have been a little bigger to make it seem more real. Of course this movie is old, so you can tell some of the fake things from the real stuff. In the middle of the movie; I got very upset because of the multiple decisions and debates going on which set up the climax. Overall, if someone is looking for a great movie to watch not only to catch up with history, but to just have a lazy day, it is a black and white movie.

This movie will make you think more than almost any other and it does so in a way that leaves you unsure of who really is to blame.The movie mainly takes place in one small room where a jury is seated for a vote they assume will be unanimous, little do they know the power of doubt. The protagonist of the film seems to be a run-of-the-mill guy, albeit a compelling one, who enables the other members in the jury, and the audience, to understand how true justice cannot be decided without arguing both sides.Truly, the movie is extremely interesting and enjoyable. It deals with real issues that will always be present in society and does this with such grace and finesse, I often wonder if any movie will be able to handle these issues as well.

		<shortDescription>A Hot Debate over the Jury System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listening to people talking for an hour and a half in only one scene, it is strange that I don't feel bored at all. Every single line is logically composed with its special meaning. What strikes me most is what one of the jury said, it almost summarize the whole film:"We have a responsibility. This, I have always thought, is a remarkable thing about democracy. That we are... What is the word? Notified. That we are notified by mail to come down to this place to decide on the guilt or innocence of a man we... we have never heard. We have nothing to gain or lose by... by our verdict. This is one of the reasons why we are strong. We should not make it a... personal thing." This film also reveals that sometimes we don't treasure our right. At the start of the film, almost everyone is impatient and wants to get out of the room as soon as possible. But we should not forget that it is our right but also responsibility at the same time, and our decisions directly have influence on the fate of another man. The film also repeatedly reminds us that, as a jury, another point to bear in mind is that a man is not guilty until proved. The presumption of innocence is the basic principle of modern legal system of criminal procedure.But sometimes because of prejudice, we always jump to the conclusion before we see the evidence. Just like one of the jury said:"Some of the time... I tell you. It's always difficult to keep personal prejudice out of a thing like this. Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth."It's been a wonderful time for me while watching the film. Thanks the cast for their amazing performance. Each of 12 jury represent one type of people and the audience can find their own reflection in them. For these who plan to watch it, I can assure you that you won't be disappointed, and I will recommend this film to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most engaging and tense movies out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This debut feature is a gripping and engaging courtroom drama which is very effective. After I watched it once, I wanted to watch it again.A boy is accused of murdering his father. The twelve jurors retire to the jury room to determine whether he's innocent or guilty. Only 1 of them thinks he's not guilty and he has to persuade the other men why he thinks so.I personally found this to be extremely amazing. The movie was able to keep my attention for the whole way through. It was interesting seeing the men say counter arguments back and forth. Also, 1 of the jurors appears to be a sadist who just wants the boy to be put to death regardless of what evidence he's presented with. In my opinion, he is the best character in the movie because his acting performance makes him a very convincing character.Speaking of the acting, it was strong on all parts. As I said, Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) gave the best performance in the movie. However, there are several more actors who did a great job as well. Jurors #8 (Henry Fonda) and #9 (Joseph Sweeney) gave exceptional performances and the other 9 jurors gave convincing performances also. I don't think that they could've given a much better performance.Also, I found the movie to be very easy to follow. It gives a brief explanation of its plot at the beginning so everyone knows what's going on right before the 12 jurors meet. Also, the movie was very well-written. The fictional murder case set up was well and it contained a lot of elaborate plot points to it which were brought up during the movie.I can see why this movie has gotten as much praise as it has now. It is one of the most engaging and tense movies I've ever seen. The tension doesn't really come from action like many other movies do. The tension comes from the arguments brought up and how the jurors behave. I just watched this movie yesterday and I already want to watch it again. So far, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and it might even had the ability to become my #1 favorite. I'll just wait and see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film provides audiences with a white knuckle thrill ride that they can't turn away from. But there are no car chases and punch ups, in fact the entire movie takes place in one room, and the narrative simply follows a discussion between 12 angry men. So how could it be so enthralling to watch?Well, unsurprisingly, it's really the dialogue. The writing in this film is genius. Every time I watch this movie I am gripped by every word, even when I already know what is about to be said. It is some of the most provocative dialogue ever put to film. I literally get goosebumps at certain parts of this film because it is so intelligent and it gives you pleasure as a viewer that you can just relish in the brilliant and thought provoking debate that is being presented to you. The fact that the film seems like an adrenaline ride is a real testament to the screenplay that Reginald Rose created. As I said earlier this movie takes place in one room, the audience is given one environment and it never changes. The writing is so clever and so thought through that despite the never changing surroundings of the room the audiences never loses focus, never loses interest. It is simply delicious writing.The performances are of course fantastic as well. Each of the 12 men have their own personalities and their own personal thoughts on the case at hand. Each actor really captures their character to the extent that the audience can start to put together a picture of what kind of man each of the men really is, despite the fact that we never even learn such basic information as their names. Henry Fonda however does stand out as being especially powerful as Juror #8. I'd like to just quickly say that Juror #8 is probably the most underrated movie hero of all time. Fonda brings a degree of charm to his role which makes him extremely likable for audiences and so you find yourself strongly rooting for him, just another element that takes the audience deeper into the world of the film.Frankly this is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is such a simple concept and because of that it was possible for all of the aspects of this film to be executed to very a high standard. This is one of those films that everyone has to watch at some point in their lives, and despite the fact that it was made in 1957 I promise it won't seem dated when you watch it if that's something you might be cautious of going into this movie. The fact that it was made such a long time ago shows it stands the test of time. Simple. Genius. Immortal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh man! The court cases!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From this film everything we watched later involving court cases derives. What I meant by this, after so many people watched they demanded films to be created showing court and court cases over and over again. Even because of that, later real court cases were televised like OJ Simpson case. Even Roman Polanski was offered to return to the USA for his always incomplete pedophilia case, but he refused. Only rarely people distinguish between film set and real life, and he Mr. Polanski is one of them at least I presume.If you did not watch this film yet it is a must see for you, there is no escape! You might be selected for a jury one day! YOU! And you might want to wish to get some blood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 angry men is a courtroom with 12 men discuss the murder and voting if the defendant is guilty or not. First I forced to watch this film but after a few minutes I start liking it more every passing minutes. It will help me in my presentation ( The mock trail ) so it really helpful if you have a presentation for the mock trail.. me and my classmates enjoyed it and helped them. Mr.King forced us to watch it on purpose, he wants us to know how to discuss an argument or a case. I recommend to anyone has to do a presentation for The mock trail watching this movie. And see how voting is changed from a side to another.4CAbdulrahman Abdulaziz</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, we agree this's old movie. This movie was produced more than fifty years. We can't comparing this movie with any movies made after 2000C or 1980.Second, I didn't like it. Because in first part I felt bored. Just 12 men tolling shot story and make it long. All of them was in one location. It's a small room for all of times with a lot of sweating :). Anyway, I saw this movie in Mr. King class. I think he liked this movie to much. I saw him passion when he a play it to us in our class. But when he do it again and again I see a good part of all parts in this movie. It's a story. I think we lost this kind of stories in modern movies. 4C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be quite frank, i was forced to watch this movie. My English teacher played around 20 minutes a day of this movie. It was quite boring at first, but it kept getting more interesting by each passing minute. And now that it ended, i can without a doubt say it was worth watching. i will do my very best to avoid spoilers. The movie is about a boy who is being prosecuted for killing his father.At first the evidents seemed very convincing so there was only one possible outcome. However, one of the jury had different opinion,he voted no So obviously, the rest of the jury were angry and upset. They thought the evidents were very convincing so they were shocked when one of them voted no So they began their task to convince him C4</fullReview>

Even the subtle cinematography shines. The director does a great job at creating a tense and claustrophobic mood. The crescendo of the action creates a sense of impending change that characterizes the film. Another interesting concept is that our perceptions can sometimes be so different even when exposed to the same material. We bring our life experiences into making every decision we make and in the case of this film that can have catastrophic results for someone else.

My problem is I'm puzzled that this film has such a high ranking on IMDb ? I can think of at least 10 better films (in my opinion) that are ranked far below this one. This is a classic film and I think it's well made and still holds up after 50+ years. I guess I just had high expectations for a movie in the IMDb top 10. It sounds silly but I think I would have enjoyed it more if was rated 200th !-Randawg.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice courtroom drama, a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This courtroom drama is rated second in AFI's 10 Top 10 Courtroom Drama, behind the classic To Kill A Mockingbird. Although the movie is not as great as To Kill AMockingbird, it does boast of excellent acting skills and a nice view of how the human mind works.Most of the entire movie took place in the jury room. The total time spent outside of the jury room was three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the movie and the time in the Jury room exposes you to how judgemental the world is.This drama film was adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose, whose screenplay for 12 Angry Men was initially produced for the CBS program Studio One in 1954.The film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt that was brought up by one of the jurors. Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) was the juror that brought up the basis of reasonable doubt. He was the movie's protagonist.Juror 8 had the herculean task of proving to the others that his reasonable doubt was valid since In the United States (both then and now), a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous.As the movie went on, you will see how some of the jurors were seeing things from the view of juror 8 and how some remained adamant.The movie's main antagonist was juror 3 a stubborn disrespectful man, who no matter what some of the others were able to prove stood his ground, by doing so he kept some of the jurors at his side of the defendant being guilty.'12 Angry Men' was remade for television in 1997. Directed by William Friedkin, the remake starred Jack Lemmon as one of the jurors. Most of the action and dialogue of the film are identical to the original. Although there was no smoking in the jury room and concentration shifted to income and pop culture.12 angry men's teleplay has been adapted to many TV series over the years some of these include Hancock's Half Hour, Picket Fences, Perfect Strangers, Family Matters, The Dead Zone, Early Edition, The Odd Couple, King of the Hill, Matlock, 7th Heaven, Veronica Mars, Monk, Hey Arnold!, Peep Show (TV series), My Wife and Kids, Robot Chicken, and The Simpsons.The movie is exceptionally captivating and you will not regret the time you spent watching this movie.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Acting, casting, dialogue, superb in every way.I've served on a criminal jury case in Manhattan on Center St, (exactly where backdrop shots are supposed to depict) and these things can get quite heated.Great performances all the way around; some jurors making more noise than others, just like in a real jury room.Problem starts with Henry Fonda's "do-gooder" character.Raises the old "It's not his fault- he had a rough childhood" nonsense. C'mon! Does anyone really believe that garbage, then or now? Slowly, Fonda tries to give defendant/punk every possible benefit of the doubt at every turn, though evidence clearly shows otherwise. One by one, jurors unfortunately cave in until he gets his wish of a "not guilty" verdict.In this era, people were already starting to make fun of social do-gooders (West Side Story: "Our mothers are all junkies- are fathers all are drunks; goodness, gracious, naturally we're punks!").I'll bet Fonda would have felt right at home on the O.J. jury.Though I didn't see this movie till I was in my forties, and Fonda was long gone, I was somehow hoping that punk who the jury freed would find Fonda on the subway platform, try to rob him, pull out his switchblade, and well, you know.Now THAT would have been some ending, and a just one too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Movie Twelve Angry Men was a good movie. The plot of the movie was good. It was interesting to watch. What I didn't like was the movie was black and white, the actors were not that good at acting, and there wasn't any woman juror in the movie. The interesting part was how everyone thought the boy is guilty at the first except no.8, without even thinking and knowing anything about the case. But they changed their mind after talking and arguing with each other. And it was surprising how the boy was described in the written play actually he is totally different. He looks like an innocent little boy in the movie. In the movie the acting wasn't so good for example how the jurors were arguing and talking, it looked fake. It's a 50's movie that's why the sound system wasn't that good either. Also the jury room looked fake, how the inside of the room was. Altogether the movie was good but I didn't like the way it was made. And the most important thing was there wasn't any action in the movie which didn't impress the audiences. But definitely I would say it was better than the actual written play. So you can see what's going on in the movie instead of reading and imagining on your head.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About the film Twelve Angry Men, i like actors' performance, montage and the story.In the movie, juror #8 and juror #3 are good actors. For example, when juror #3yells to juror #8 "i will kill you, i will kill you." he shows character's anger clearly, so people will like this movie much more. Also, when everyone says no guilty, he look like a wounded child, he know all of juror #8 say is be possible, but he doesn't want to lose he face, still says guilty, he doesn't want admit he is wrong, so he covers his shame with angry.For the montage, i like the scene links the part. For one thing, before raining the atmosphere inhibits very much, director used rain to dilute this atmosphere, get everyone cold down, to get every one calm. In conclusion, actor juror #3's Splendid performing skill, movie's scene links and the story, i like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An outstanding reenactment of writer Reginald Rose's superlative 1954 "Studio One" drama. Director Sidney Lumet shows how the boundaries in cinematic art can be stretched both ways; necessarily minimalist, he moves the actors and cameras in the jury room like a finely tuned ballet. Dependable Henry Fonda gives his best, and it's one of the most convincing "Best Actor" performances ever committed to celluloid. The supporting cast is perfect.No matter how you feel about the film's thought-provoking thesis, you are captivated by juror Fonda's determination. When he introduces a switchblade into evidence - during deliberations! - like the pounding of a gavel, you know Fonda's intentions are premeditated; and, watching him unravel each juror's mind - along with your own - is truly stunning. Anyone interested in becoming a lawyer should consider Fonda a study model. The defense rests.********** 12 Angry Men (4/13/57) Sidney Lumet ~ Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G.

		<fullReview>Eleven jurors in a murder trial feel an 18 year-old is GUILTY for killing his father and should receive the death penalty. Henry Fonda's character is the LONE JUROR, who feels that the boy is innocent. The brilliance of this movie is how close to "real life" it is - full of adult material, which was unusual in those days. How many of us, who have served on jury duty, have faced these types of people? I know that I have. The room is HUMID and HOT and you know that it is going to be even MORE HOTTER during the ninety minutes of deliberation. Fonda is wonderful in how he is capable of presenting the "what if" arguments and his own investigative speculation into the case, which is also a drawback to the film in that such speculation is not permissible under current legal proceedings. None of these jurors know each other and they come from different backgrounds - one is an architect (Fonda), while another is a calm, observant older man (Joseph Sweeney). These two are capable of dissecting the facts of this case better than their fellow jurors. The other ten jurors are either unconcerned, unwilling, inpatient, bored, selfish, prejudiced, or sadistic, or they simply don't care. Each character brings with them different backgrounds and education. Obviously, those who are better educated, or older and wiser, (Fonda and Sweeney), tend to be more careful and analytical in their decisions than the sadistic businessman (Lee J. Cobb), the prejudiced garage owner (Ed Begley), or the selfish salesman (Jack Warden) - the WORST types of jurors that one could ask for in a legal case. The football coach, (Juror # 1 - Martin Balsam), who is the overseer of the jury proceedings, is likable, but would prefer to be elsewhere. They are anxious to come to a conclusion and be on their merry way, especially Warden, who has to be at the ball game on time.The shy, uncertain bank clerk (John Fiedler) is willing to go with the flow of the others. The advertising agent (Robert Webber) is the same way. These are also poor qualities for a member of the jury. The confident broker (E.G. Marshall) is certain the boy is guilty based on the facts of the case. His argument would be more relevant in a true legal proceeding. The self-conscious common man (Jack Klugman), the dependable painter (Edward Binns), and the careful, East European watchmaker (George Voskovec) are more willing to compromise with Fonda. How will it play out? It depends on those jurors who are uncooperative and uncontrollable, especially the sadistic Cobb. "Kids these days."Score: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 men in a jury room: no women in 1957, of course. Fonda played it great, as did the screenwriter: no pressure, just let them come to their own conclusions. Put enough pressure on the bastards, so they show their asses and then the nice guys will see the light and change their verdict.Loved that they showed the equivocator and the one who wanted to get to the ball game, so he voted not guilty .....but were also shown up for what they were. The prejudiced guy making his bigoted pitch, with all the folks standing up and turning their backs: obviously, this was not Birmingham jury. When you look at the lynchers who were acquitted by all-white juries, you know that Henry Fonda couldn't have made a damn with them.When I was attacked on the Boston Red Line by a drunken thug who took my Peace sign and jammed me in the stomach with it, then ignored by the MBTA police on the platform, I knew how it must feel to be a black man in 1950s Alabama and try to get justice.When we went to Quincy court, the cops all circled round the guy and read his girlfriend's testimony to the clerk. It wasn't even carried over to the D.A. When I objected that the testimony presented wasn't even mine, the clerk said, "It doesn't have to be. You may be the victim but you're only a witness as far as the state is concerned. And the cop could use anyone's testimony." But the impression was that it was MY testimony, not the thug's girlfriend's. So this was an idealization of justice moving along toward the correct verdict. . The jury foreman was key: if he had been dictatorial, it would never have gotten to the point of free exchange. Because he was passive, Fonda was able to take over. I doubt that this was at all realistic. THat's why they choose jurors without college educations: so the ignorant can be swayed by the lawyers. These jurors were evenly divided, with the less well educated being the more ethical, interestingly enough. Lee J Cobb, as the father of the estranged son, and the last holdout, did a magnificent job as a bitter angry man, who would have liked to send the kid to the chair out of his own anger. Fonda was great as the Jesus figure. Too bad he couldn't have brought a little more of that to his daughter, Jane. The weather also starred in this movie: the heat added to the pressure. When Fonda helps the various jurors open or shut the windows, he also subconsciously makes them his allies in his fight for truth. The screenwriter did well to keep him neutral. He doesn't know if the kid did it: he just wants them to discuss the situation before they kill him. In the course of the discussion, the jurors actually create a trial that didn't exist. Interesting legal question: can you judge a man by the inferences you draw from what may or may not have been said at the trial? In other words, is it 'legal' to use means other than what the defense did to acquit the defendant? A trick that wasn't used: no body died. I thought for sure the old guy or the angry guy would have a heart attack in the heat, and they would have to bring in one of the alternates, adding to the character study. Great movie. I"m sure when I see it again, I'll find even more in it. But I did love how the Casper Milquetoasts were empowered to find their own voices.Easy to see why this is one of the greatest movies of all time. The writer was magnificent and i don't even remember his name.!!!!! Fonda without a good script would be Paris Hilton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now I have a reasonable doubt!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a film made only in a room that looks hot and humid and only on a budget of $349,000. The twelve jurors must decide unanimously on a case of first degree murder whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. When they walk into a jury room which is both hot and humid they become acquainted with the personalities of their peers at first.Then they do a vote with the motive of finishing that taken-for granted murder case.However right at that moment they realize that one of the jurors doesn't like the quick open and shut situation of the case and he says "it needed to be talked" based on his reasonable doubt! Because it's not an unanimous voting the case need to be talked then a whole set of serious arguments ensues.Sifting of the evidence disclose the errors of the prosecution's case, the doubtful representation by the defendant's court-appointed attorney, and the true inner-deep character of each of the jury members.Well that's what I love just a room twelve people..one man a lone dissenter force the others to think why they vote yes why they don't no.He forces them to share a responsibility and he is even tactful enough to mention that the accused kid has been subjected to violence..that he needs more than just a fair-looking trial before sending him to the chair.Henry Fonda as the cool,calm and wise questioning one dissenter is just awesome the other 11 days are good too but Joseph Sweeney as the wise and observant elderly man named McCardle caught my attention too! Last but not least the run-time of the is about 90 minutes so after getting engaged in 90 minute of fighting arguments you feel like you have watched a game where the winner is humanity of course!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is incredible. This shows the progression of conscience during the film and how the will of a man can still be changed in debate. I am currently doing a course similar to legal studies and we watched this movie in class and I was totally enthralled. I must comment that usually law movies would often be either not enough about the law or to "legal" and thus become over exciting or on the tedious side. This movie is not about the court this is about what happens behind the closed door of the jury room. which certainly opens the eye to people that don't know much about what goes on in the court system. I highly recommend this movie to all interested in law movies though I am still yet to finish the movie in class it looks very enjoyable so farIf you liked this I also suggest seeing movies based on some of John Grishams novels such as The Pelican Brief starring Gene Hackman and Runaway Jury with Dustin Hoffman Gene Hackman and John Cusack and lastly The Rainman</fullReview>

The most amazing aspect of this movie for me was the framing. The most wonderfully beautiful images are on screen during this movie. For me, the issues for this movie come from the script. Some of the dialog isn't too great or well delivered. The acting is only OK. I really look for acting in these older movies because I sometimes feel that it holds movies back. The acting in 12 Angry Men does not hold the movie back, but it could be better. On a whole, this is a wonderfully artistic and moving movie. It covers many interesting topics about life and death, and Mr. Lumet is on the top of his game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective and gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes a particularly effective film to remain compelling even when one has seen the film multiple times, or at the very least, knows the outcome of the story. Sidney Lumet's 1957 film "12 Angry Men" fits this definition to a tee in that I have seen this movie literally dozens of times over the last twenty years of my life and yet, when I watched it again last night, I found myself in the same state of tension and awe as I did the first time I saw the film.The story is simple; 12 men are thrown together because they sit on the jury for a trial that involves an 18 year old boy from the slums of New York who is accused of murdering his father, who had beaten him all of his life. The boy pleads not guilty, but because of two eyewitnesses, the jury convenes to the deliberation room strongly convinced of his guilt; except for one man, played by Henry Fonda. At first, he is ridiculed for his stance, until he slowly is able to convince some of the others that perhaps there are some aspects of the case that cast some doubt on the certainty with which they all began. Because, like most juries, there are many differences in background, social standing, etc. among them, tensions rise to a crescendo many times throughout the film, causing some of them to look introspectively at themselves and each other in order to truly deliberate the fate of this young man.The brilliance of "12 Angry Men" can be explained in three parts. First time director Sidney Lumet, at the time a television director, simply does everything right in this film. The setting is simple; most of the action takes place in the jury room, with the exception of some establishing shots telling the viewer where they are, and the plot is pretty straightforward. It is something that happens daily, multiple times, all across the United States. But there are some wonderful elements that he introduces into the scene to further the claustrophobia and tension: He makes it the hottest day of the summer, and for most of the film, the fan doesn't work, so you can literally see the sweat pouring off of these men and soaking through their shirts. He also uses some tight close-ups of the actors at times, particularly when they are giving dissenting opinions or are in a state of emotional discomfort.Secondly, the film's script is absolutely first-rate. Not only does the story come together like a thousand (very small) puzzle pieces, but also the clever way it does this never fails to astonish me. One would think that sitting and watching 12 guys talk about a court case while getting in each other's faces for an hour and a half wouldn't be compelling, but the intricacies of each juror, the way each of their backgrounds and prejudices are revealed is fantastic. There is nothing corny in the script, no placating moments where someone just suddenly "sees the light" ? every time one of the jurors changes his vote, it is because there have been solid questions, answers, etc. have been revealed. In other words, no one gets from point A to point B without sufficient effort.Finally, "12 Angry Men" features what is probably one of the greatest casts ever assembled. Henry Fonda, who usually plays a pretty good guy (with a few exceptions) plays a quiet hero in this film. He doesn't preach, he just simply is the only man in the beginning to say "I don't know." His obvious relief nearly every time another juror is swayed is conveyed with a simple look that clearly shows admiration for said juror. The antithesis of Fonda's character is Lee J. Cobb's juror. He is a loud, crass man who refuses to even consider that the defendant may be innocent, even when he is faced with facts and being in the position of the minority. I merely single those two out because they are probably the most central, but every single actor in the film did a brilliant job, and really managed to give their roles depth and character, something that is not easy when you're sharing screen time with 11 other great actors.There is really absolutely nothing bad to say about the film "12 Angry Men", a film that has been praised by critics and the public alike. It holds a very high place on the IMDb Top 250 list (I believe it was #20 the last time I looked), which is extremely encouraging to me. When the movie going public is rating films like the Lord of the Rings trilogy over films like "Seven Samurai" and "Citizen Kane", it is great to see that a "small" movie like this is met with such esteem and recognition. "12 Angry Men" definitely holds a place on my short list of "Films I Think Everyone Should See" because I think it really teaches the audience something about first impressions and the concept of justice, not from a lawmakers standpoint, but from the perspective of public in general. 9/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic film, which overwhelms with its deep simplicity. Four settings in a 90 minute masterpiece, with about 85 of them in one room. Twelve jurors, which all have a deep, round character, although each only talks for a mere 5-12 minutes. At the beginning the ballots are 11:1 for guilty, and at the end they are 12:0 for not guilty and you are convinced yourself, convinced of what? Convinced that this is a brilliant movie.At the beginning you think, how will we be introduced into the case, how will we see who committed the crime and how did he do it. After half an hour you don't care about it, you want to know how the remaining 8 people will be convinced. After one hour you want to know why the remaining four jurors are not convinced yet, and you are now, without even having noticed it introduced to at least 10 minor details of the case. And only after the second viewing did I even notice that I'm exactly at the same point where i was after the very first scene, who committed the crime, this is the only question that remains open.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest works in film history</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes, unfortunately not very frequently, there are movies that are as close to perfection as possible. "12 Angry Men" is one of these. The basic idea is as simple as brilliant: director Sidney Lumet puts in his debut film 12 men together in one (resp. two rooms) and then during the whole film they stay in this place and discuss whether the accused boy is guilty or not, and in the same time they decide on his life. This last point is actually the critical aspect Lumet brings into this play-like movie. But no matter how simple the idea is, it is certainly not easy to realize it and to make out of this a good film. Lumet has made a fine work. It is just incredible and amazing how well he has managed to create such an intense and involving drama. One possible reason why he has succeeded so well is probably because he was supported by such an excellent cast, above all and of course, Henry Fonda, who gives here one of the best performances of his long career. But lets not forget the other actors like Martin Balsam or Jack Klugman. All in all this film is (and will always remain) one of the greatest directorial achievements in film history, with only one scene that somehow disturbs (but not very much): the very last sequence outside the building where Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) reveals his real name. In fact, he should just have been Number 8 and the whole action should only have taken place in these one or two rooms. Apart from this detail, "12 Angry Men" is a film you must have seen and it is even today very underrated.Rating: 97MarSco</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a movie that has basically 3 settings and only 14 cast members, it probably cost more to buy the cast than it did to buy the props. It still was one of the greatest movies ever made.12 Angry Men is a story of how a boy is charged for murder and 11 jurors are convinced that he is guilty...the 12th juror isn't sure. What happens is Henry Fonda has to convince the 11 jurors one by one that the boy is innocent.The cast was incredible, Juror #1 was the take control Foreman. Juror # 2 was the mousy kind of guy. Lee J Cobb as Juror #3 did a brilliant job. Even though I'll always remember EG Marshall for playing Upson Pratt in Creepshow, I also admired his calm and intelligent character of Juror #4. Jack Klugman's Juror #5 was convincing as the street bred man. The working class Juror #6 I can relate to because my father was the same way. Everyone knows Jack Warden for his role as Big Ben Healy in Problem Child, and he was just as funny as the wisecracking Juror #7. Henry Fonda as the hero of the movie, Juror #8 was important giving his role as the good guy in many movies. Juror #9 as the wise old man did a nice job. Ed Begley made me laugh with his performance of the racist Juror #10. Juror #11 I couldn't relate to as an immigrant watch maker but he did play a vital role throughout the movie. Robert Webber as the advertising exec Juror #12 rounded out an all-star cast with style.Great plot, great movie... 10 out of 10</fullReview>

This film shows how very talented character actors can be. Every single one (especialy Cobb en Warden) are excellent! This is a wonderful and gripping film. Although the remake (with Jack Lemmon) is very good, the characters in the Lumet version are much more lifelike and help to make the story so gripping, funny and poignant. Somehow it is a shame that actors like "The Immigrant or McCardle" were not used more often in movies. A virtual masterclass for ensemble acting. A true movie masterpiece.</fullReview>

Fondas performance as well as the brilliant supporting roles played by bigots and indifferent individuals is a wonderful snapshot of actual society. The sauna like conditions in the jury room had one almost perspiring, and the tension and anger portrayed in those scenes has never been bettered by any modern courtroom dramas since.

		<shortDescription>One of a kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I echo every comment I've read up to now on why this is such a great film. Here's mine.Classic films need to have everything going for them: superior acting, compelling story, amazing direction. Notice I left out special effects or genre-specific idiosyncrasies like dramatic chase sequences in action films or singing and dancing in musicals. Depending on the type of film, these elements are definitely needed, of course, but what propels any film into classic status is the absolute necessity of the basics I first mentioned. Any deficiency in one category automatically downgrades my rating to just a very good movie, no matter how big the explosions or realistic the gore (I love horror movies, too).As any film buff knows, most movies are adequate to downright terrible. However, even the bad ones can be entertaining in a fast food, disposable kind of way (we all have our guilty pleasures, and I know my list is rather long...lol). It's when we come across a movie that fires on all cylinders that truly inspires joy, and reveals why great film-making moves us.12 Angry Men is one of those rare movies for me. It's almost disarmingly simple and straightforward. It's drama frighteningly intense. I understand why some may view the film as dated, or have a problem with the era from which it was made. I take into account all the cultural differences between then and now (the all-white male jury, the American slang, the one-dimensional setting) but none of it matters because the story, direction, and acting are so good. The morality of the story is the focus, not the backdrop.I don't see this movie being irrelevant 100 years from now. In fact, if present social trends continue, it may be even more important, considering how we seem to be careening to a less moral, instant gratification society where personal responsibility is secondary to selfish needs. Movies like this may become a beacon for thoughtfulness and sanity. But I digress; apologies for soap boxing.As much as I hate lists, I would easily place this movie in my Top Ten of All-Time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ostensibly, 12 Angry Men is a chamber piece about twelve motley jurors who are stuck with deciding the guilt or innocence of an eighteen-year-old kid who is charged with the murder of his father. It's actually more than just that, though. It's an examination into the unknowability of the truth, and a character film that cross-examines the lives of men from all walks of life.When the film begins, the men take a preliminary vote. The results show that there are eleven men who think he is very obviously guilty, and only one man (Peter Fonda) who thinks that there is a reasonable doubt of his guilt. Of course, most of the other men think he's crazy for even suggesting innocence--half of them are already out the door and ready to send the boy to the chair."How do you know?" Fonda is consistently asked.His response is the same every time. "I don't know anything, I'm just saying we should ask some questions, that's all." The story unfolds magnificently and cleverly, a smorgasbord of personalities clashing and interacting with each other--all within the confines of a stiflingly hot sixteen by twenty-four foot jury room.The performances in this film are amazing. Each juror comes across as a man who has his own reasons for deciding the guilt or innocence of the alleged murderer, and the method with which each man ultimately decides are all unique to his person.12 Angry Men comes across as a bit of a tribute to the American justice system as well. Careful not to claim perfection for it, director Sidney Lumet simply portrays it as the best system we have available."What if you convince us all and we set a murderer free?" one of the jurors asks Fonda. Fonda doesn't answer.A friend noted that she felt that the motivations for some of the juror's final conclusions came on a little strong, most notably in the case of the biggest advocate of the accused's guilt, who is played by Lee J. Cobb. Cobb seems to have some inner demons with his son, who he reveals he hasn't spoken to in years, and it's clear that at least several of the jurors begin to suspect Cobb's feelings aren't due to the facts but are the result of personal issues towards youth as a whole. I disagree with my friend. When critiquing a film, it's certainly important to gauge your feelings on the subtleties brought forth by it--in this particular scenario though, I feel that the complaint is a reach. I never found the scenarios that were brought forth by any of the characters was too heavy-handed or polemic. Quite the opposite--I viewed the story as the simple unfolding of a murder case that was to be decided by twelve very different individuals, each with his own background and story to contribute.12 Angry Men is a straight-forward and fascinating story that is well-directed, well-acted, and makes a valuable point. I can easily add this to the list of my favorite films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most important for everyone to watch. Sidney Lument directs this film with great treatment. Hardly any musical score, and about 95% of the action taking place in one room is very hard to do, but he pulls it off. And I have to say, this is probably one of the greatest ensemble casts ever put on film. All 12 jurors are excellent. Henry Fonda delivers his performance in the every man feel he always performs. Lee J. Cobb delivers his best performance in his career. E.G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley, and Robert Webber are just a few of the other names that lead the cast with their roles. Why were none of these actors up for any Oscars for this film? It's still a mystery to me. I believe all actors of today, especially all the new actors from the past ten years, should watch this film, and see how the old pros did it. They just don't make 'em like they used to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It has been said that an actor's performance can be elevated by the presence of a great actor. The greatness of 12 Angry Men somewhere lays in this theory, times twelve. I would be at a loss to identify who is elevating whom, certainly Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda and Ed Beagly Sr. are among the truly greats, to single them out as the pacesetters might minimize the skills and abilities of journeymen like E.G Marshall, Jack Klugmen, Martin Balsom or Jack Warden. Obviously John Fiedler or Robert Webber are not names usually associated with the aforementioned and possibly the proof of this theory however I am reticent to apply this to them, so perfect were they in their individual numeric places.What movie aficionado can remove from memory the old man's affinity and identification with the stroke victim witness "I believe I know this man better than any of you", his unexpected gesture of support for the Fonda character with his "not guilty" verdict and subsequent explanation as to why. E.G. Marshall's perspiration as he tries to remember a second feature. The broken and silent bigot (Ed Beagly) sitting slumped over and alone. Everything Lee J. Cobb said or did: Knife in hand directed at Fonda's heart, held back by a man who is basically good but threatening still by a lifetime of mistakes and disappointments.Ninety six continuous minutes of this, one moment no greater, no lesser than the other. No actor's performance eclipsing another's. The director's skillful climactic, anticlimactic meeting on the steps of the courthouse between Davis and McCartel. My apologies to the director, writers and editors, but this movie was made great by the acting. It will never be better than in 12 Angry Men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This should be called 12 Wonderful Men because it is as fine a movie as any I've seen. They are 12 real pros who want to do a good job. I can't imagine directing 12 strong actors, I can't begin to imagine what a job that is. I had heard so much about Diner I thought Diner was going to be like this, and Diner couldn't do the job properly with four men, let alone 12. I got the impression that Martin Balsam was the big name in the movie and that the foreman role was considered one of the top billing ones, I don't know. I noticed his name was first on the credits, I didn't know if that was star power or some other order. The last shot was beautiful with good spatial relation, with a rainy day and people just walking along. Ordinary every day life, which is what I'm interested in and where I have the most fun. Well, glamorous things are fun too, but so are ordinary every day life things. The old man was fantastic, they all were. I had to take the movie in small doses, it was almost too much for one sitting. One of my favorite scenes is where someone drinks from a dixie cup, then crumples and throws it. It was all good, a fine movie that shows you how acting is done (Martin Balsam always shows you how it's done, and now there were a whole group of actors showing us).</fullReview>

Cobb and Jack Klugman, while the other cast members are also convincingly real.

Sure, there are dated elements to the dialogue and we've come quite a long way technologically with which to please the visual sense. Further it seems that our "eyes" have grown accustomed to jump cuts and when they are lacking, well, it's sort of like the analogy of a fast food meal versus a sit down dinner. While a burger and fries are fine, even fantastic at times, it sure ain't a meal you'll never forget. With films like this you have to slow yourself down and appreciate the manner with which it is told. Thoughtful framing and movement of camera subconsciously underscore the message.

		<fullReview>The concept behind this film is so simple and yet it is brilliant. Set almost entirely in one New York jury room on the hottest day of the year as twelve jury members discuss the case of an 18 year old man accused of murdering his father. A guilty verdict would mean the death penalty. On the face of it, the case seems simple and eleven of the jurors vote "guilty" but one man (Henry Fonda) dissents and tries to talk his fellow jurors around. The events of the film take place in real time and as the film progresses more and more of the characters of the individual jurors and their individual prejudices are revealed.This film provides gripping drama, brilliantly scripted (from a television play by Reginaled Rose) and performed by a brilliant cast. This is justifiably a classic of cinema, much more than a legal thriller it is also an exploration of individual morality (witness the casualness with which some of the jurors are ready to condemn a man to his death). If you have any interest in American cinema, superb acting or just want a great piece of entertainment, don't miss this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie at least a dozen times, but never tire of watching it. I think it should be a requirement that this movie be seen by every jury, before jury deliberations begin. It is a blueprint for how it should be done. If all juries watched it, I think it would help them to really think about all the facts presented, and help them be better jurors. They could not help but to consciously fight against preconceived opinions and prejudices within themselves and from others. Lee J. Cobb just rips my heart out, and I cry right along with him at the end, every time. It is obvious that the majority of IMDb voters are youngsters with computers and internet access, who probably have never even seen classics like this, as evidenced by the huge difference in the number of votes cast. In the hundred thousand range for movies like Lord Of The Rings, and in the twenty thousand range for this movie.

I had recently seen an episode from "Hancock's Half Hour" entitled 12 Angry Men which involved Tony Hancock trying to convince a Jury that Sid James was innocent. The episode was excellent and then after looking in the paper I noticed that this film was to be shown. I thought it only right to see the inspiration behind the aforementioned episode. I must have been 15 at the time but from the moment Martin Balsam first asks the members of the Jury to raise their hands I was hooked. The highly talented cast give superb performances that are enhanced by the excellent camera work, brilliant script and thought provoking subject matter. I recently saw the remake starring Jack Lemmon and thought it to have some great twists on the original. Particularly on Ed Begley's character from the original film. All in all though, what makes the original is the intimacy the camera has on each member of the jury, the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie and the tension between the characters. Sidney Lumet has created a masterpiece here and thoroughly deserves to be in the top 100 movies of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is easily one of the best courtroom drama's you could ever watch. A mighty directional debut for Sidney Lumet, who was also associated with such memorable films as; Murder On The Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon and Network. It's a story about 12 jury members deliberating on the fate of an 18 year old boy (on trial for the murder of his father). One man stands alone (Henry Fonda) trying to convince the other 11 not to be so hasty with a guilty verdict. It's quite amazing how the story unfolds by only verbal context, there's no flash backs on what went on in the courtroom or the presumed scenario of the murder. All is done by script alone and to this basis the viewer has to pay particular attention. The cast is superb, not big stars at the time, but in later years very well known. I was intrigued with the 12 characters, each one of them a different personality who come from a different walk of life. They were all strangers, the viewer is never told of any of their names, only at the end we hear the surnames of juror # 9 and juror #8 This film gives a indispensable lesson in characterization there's so much to like about 12 Angry Men??I highly recommend it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To me, this film is probably as close to perfect as any film ever was. The emotion, the story, the acting, etc. Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb squaring off. Different jurors harboring different beliefs, goals, views, etc. And even though this film was made close to fifty years ago, it is still as timely as ever. That is why I was so confused that somebody tried to shoot a re-make? Blasphemy! And by the way, that remake really sucked! Of course, after the first couple of times I saw this film, I was confused. I really though the kid did it. I still kind of think he did. Of course, that is the whole point of the film. Maybe he did do it, maybe not. The point of the story is about everybody getting a fair trial and a fair jury. Moreover, I will always remember the courage of Fonda's character, standing up to those eleven others, will very little to cling to. And how the jury ended up having to do what should have been done in the court room all along, try the case. Perhaps the main point of the film was to indict a society and criminal justice system that had lost it's way, if it ever had a way. But the lasting legacy of the film, is the fact that it just might be the greatest movie ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, I've never been the type of person who is impressed by flashy set designs, special effects, non-stop action, etc. In fact, the most important things for me in any type of story (film, television, play, novel) is characterization. I'm a sucker for good, complex, three-dimensional characters. And dialogue. Boy, do I ever go crazy over good dialogue. This is most likely why 12 Angry Men is my favorite movie of all time. Twelve men, one room, fabulous acting, fabulous cast, fabulous dialogue. Brilliant.The cast itself is enough to drive you crazy. Henry Fonda, one of my favorite actors of all time, leads the pack, with Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, Jack Klugman, and E.G. Marshall putting in excellent performances too. In fact, this is one of Lee J. Cobb's best performances ever. He's tremendous in this role and you really just can't help but like him in the end. E.G. Marshall puts forth maybe the best performance in the entire film with his calm and intelligent character as the perfect balance to Cobb's angry and out of control character. Also, notable performances by Joseph Sweeney and John Fiedler, who are both entirely endearing.There's not a lot to say about this amazing film. Anyone who has any interest in the American legal system should definitely watch this. If you appreciate good casting, excellent acting, and first-rate dialogue, you won't be disappointed. It's odd to think that a movie about twelve nameless men sitting around in one room talking for most of the movie could continue to be interesting the whole way through, but somehow they do it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing Sidney Lumet's version of Reginald Rose's play several times I can still claim that this is one of the best movies ever made, not just because of Rose's screenplay but also because of the outstanding cast (Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Lee J Cobb, E.G. Marshall and of course Henry Fonda to mention a few).'12 Angry Men' takes place in almost only one room, but still it is so far from boring. It was Sidney Lumet's first movie for the cinema, and it looks like that he already then had as much or even more experience and knowledge than any other director.The TV-remake from 1997 is suppose to be good, but I don't think it can match this version even if it contains some real good, heavy names such as Jack Lemmon and George C Scott. Sidney Lumet's "12 Angry Men" is perhaps one of the most perfect movies ever done, I can't find any real weak spot in it. With this movie, Henry Fonda won much respect from me.Rating: 10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the day before I watched this for the first time, I had watched Clockstoppers. Diametrically opposed schools of thought here... Clockstoppers had a horrible story and some neat effects--basically they took a crap script and threw a ton of money at it. Ended up with something you could sit through without getting TOO uncomfortable...12 Angry Men? Golden. You just can't replace an amazingly well written story with effects. This movie is an amazing example of that. This film had me sitting at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next...With Clockstoppers, I was spending more time figuring out what to watch next.12 Angry Men? At the end of the film, I was trying to figure out when I could watch it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, in fact, my all-time favorite film. You can teach an entire course in film making from this one production. The camera is used as a thirteenth, silent juror. When the old bigoted juror goes on his tirade all the other jurors turn and or leave the table, including the camera. Henry Fonda gives his finest performance here when he must timidly vote against conviction then lead the group through strength of character to set aside their presumption of guilt and grant the defendant a shadow of a doubt. It's as gripping a drama as I've seen. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only thing this film has going for itself is that it is original. I do admit that. However, the film is horrible. The dialogue is pathetic, acting is weak. And if you ever have to wonder what the ending will be, you must have something wrong with you. So the film becomes and hour and a half long movie showcasing a weak dialogue that will lead to the inevitable. After Henry Fonda's first line, you will know what the ending is. I wouldn't doubt if people walked out of the theater after the first 2 minutes of the jury discussing things.The whole thing is cheesy. Even if you appreciate films that are not for the popcorn chewing crowd, you will still hate this movie if you have any respect for film. This film is pathetic. The inspiration for this film probably came from a man who was bored out of his mind while he had jury duty. He came up with the plot in 36 seconds and wrote it down and miraculously got the 6th best film rating of all time (as of June 2016). This film belongs in the bottom 6 films all time.On "12 Angry Men" being a fantastically pathetic film, the verdict is: Guilty!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry Men (1957) stands out for more than one reason, it was based on a teleplay by Reginald Rose, and was the first feature film to be directed by Sidney Lumet. The story deals with a court case relating to murder of a man by his son. 12 members of jury are sent inside the jury room to deliberate over the case and determine whether the boy killed his father or not, we as viewer are unaware of the court preceding that happened before the deliberation. However before the start of discussion between the jury members a preliminary vote is taken to find out where everyone stands, 11 jurors call the defendant guilty without a second thought which leaves only Juror no 8 (Henry Fonda) with reluctance to call the boy guilty so early and without discussion, everyone else believes the case to be open and shut and pressurize the remaining juror to join their side, juror no 8 however has other plan. What follows is an amazing interplay of confrontation, clash of personality and display of bias in the cloak of logic. The screenplay is tight to the extent that you don't want to miss a single scene or dialogue, and mind you maximum movie takes place inside one room with an occasional shot of doorway but believe me you don't mind that a bit, in proverbial terms it is the place where "all the action happens". The beauty of the story lies in the way Juror no 8 kept insisting on the need to communicate with each other as there is no other way to reach at a logical and fair verdict, he himself is not 100% sure if the boy is innocent, but believes in the principal of American Criminal Law, one must be convicted of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, i.e. to say that even if there is shred of a doubt that the man may be innocent than he should not be convicted of the crime. Everybody is reluctant to give the boy the benefit of the doubt because of their own reasons, some are convinced the boy is guilty, some are biased and some just want to get over with it so that they can continue with their plans. But what juror no 8 starts catches momentum and people slowly starts to see the light of reason and their conviction that the boy is guilty slowly starts turning into that maybe the boy is not guilty; every evidence presented during the trial is examined and re-examined, the previous notion that there is no doubt that the boy committed the crime is subsided by maybe the evidence was misinterpreted, mind you nobody is absolutely sure that boy is innocent but it is the possibility that the boy may be innocent that starts driving them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless movie that captures the essence of filmmaking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to the age of this movie, I was skeptical when I first approached it. I see that in some cases, movies of a certain age are held on a pedestal even though they have either been bested or have not aged well. Thankfully, this movie is neither. 12 Angry Men is a premise that is not easily done. A movie that takes place mostly in one room is not that exceptional, but 12 Angry Men is handicapped even further because we know nothing about the characters, not even their names. Nevertheless, the cinematography, writing and acting in this movie are nearly flawless, and have aged like fine wine. Having said all this, the movie is not without errors. The writing feels to be forced at some points of the movie, and the leaps in logic are sometimes hard to fully get behind. Nevertheless, 12 Angry Men is one of the best examples of how timeless a movie can be, and how limitations can help a film become a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Cinema's Best Courtroom Dramas!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is one of best courtroom dramas in the history of cinema. Even though it is an older film, it is also a refreshing take on courtroom dramas. On the surface, this film is a pure drama about the courtroom, but it goes much, much deeper than that. I was discussing in an earlier review (Dial M for Murder) about the use of a single location. Well, this film inhabits that single location very much so, and the film is actually famous for that. Outside of three minutes, the film takes place in a single New York City courtroom. That works very well in this film takes to the expert directing by first-time director Sidney Lumet and veteran cinematographer Boris Kaufman. The film is expertly shot and the use of the focal length's shots allow the audience to feel more of each character's feelings. Lumet later discussed how a "lens plot" occurred to him. As the movie progressed, he changed the lenses to longer focal lengths, in order for the background to gradually close in on the characters. A very good technique I must point out.Another thing that made this film an interesting addition to the courtroom dramas is we don't know much about the case, only through secondhand evidence do we piece together what is going on. All we know is that a Spanish-American boy is accused of murdering his father. Other than a very bored-looking judge who assumes he knows the outcome of the case, we learn the case through the eyes of twelve jurors. In most courtroom movies, it's clear they like to come to a final verdict. This movie is very different because we don't know whether the boy is guilty or not, although we can assume based off the events of the movie. The movie is all about reasonable evidence, a very important study in criminal justice. Through the evidence depicted in the case, did the boy commit the murder or not? In the first few minutes in the jury room, it's clear that the majority of the jurors believe he is guilty. However, there must be an unanimous vote before they can issue their decision. The problem is that one juror, Juror #8 believes the boy is not guilty. This is where all the fun begins. The film is based on emotion, logic, and even prejudice to describe what is going on. This particular juror does not sway from his opinion, even though the other jurors are growing more angry, more restless. But as Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) describes why he believes the boy is not guilty, and he presents an admirable case why, people begin to agree with #8. There are a few arrogant jurors who refuse to move their votes for their own reasons. For example, Juror #10 (Ed Begley) is an extreme racist, as seen in a massive prejudiced rant in which the reaction of the other jurors proved to be one of the most powerful scenes of the movie. Then there is Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), who is just a very angry man in general and he gradually becomes angrier as more people side with #8. Then there is Juror #4 (E.G Marshall), a man with wire-rimmed glasses who tries to avoid emotion in this thinking with only the use of logic. I think it was a wise movie not to give the character names. It makes each character much more powerful. I could actually remember the juror by their numbers, That's a testament for how great and unique each character is.In the 95 minutes the film runs, we become invested in each character very much so. Whether he is a racist bigot or whether he is a man who simply believes in what is right, we truly sympathize with them all. That is what you can attribute to a wonderful cast. It's interesting, because there was only one bankable star here (at the time), and that was Henry Fonda who played Juror #8 very well. He presented his case as believable as he can be. The rest of the cast were some of the best actors of New York City at the time, such as Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Ed Begley, Joseph Sweeney, Jack Klugman, E.G Marshall, John Fiedler, Edward Binns, Robert Webber, and George Voskovec. They all perform very well in their roles. They need to be angry, and they certainly did get angry.Sidney Lumet is one of the best and influential American directors of all time. This was is first feature film, and he knocks it out of the park from the very first scene. In each film he does, he always has something to say-usually something controversial. Not so much in this film, but in subsequent films. He does talk about how emotions can cloud the thinking of people, and cause them to think and act irrationally. As some of the conversations and rants in this film will point out.12 Angry Men, based off a television play, ended up being one of the greatest courtroom dramas ever made. It came out at a time where lavish productions were aplenty. Despite the critical acclaim of this film, the movie actually wasn't a box-office hit when it originally opened. But enough people have seen this over the years and to see how great this film is. It spends 92 minutes in a room filled with a table and twelve men, and somehow we get incredibly tense moments that added up to be a very powerful, influential film.My Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Innocent unless proved guilty" IS a founding father principle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Film "12 Angry Men" is an amazingly written classic film from the year 1957. This wonderfully created suspense drama is about a jury of 12 men that must come to a unanimous decision to either send an 18 year old boy to the electric chair or to let him free. The young man was placed on trial after supposed evidence was found and eye witnesses saw him murder his father with a knife. At the beginning of the jury meeting, 11 jurors immediately vote to send the boy to the electric chair, while the twelfth is simply hesitant to send the boy to his death without talking about it. Angrily and almost against their will, they discuss the murder case and all the events that take place, and slowly but surely find reasonable doubt in all aspects of the "Evidence." For example, 2 witnesses were brought to the court to testify against the boy. One witness saw the murder from across the street as a train was passing by, and the other was in a room below and heard the scream as someone yelled "I'm going to kill you!" As the Jury discussed both aspects of the witnesses, they decided that it was impossible for the witness below to hear the murder taking place as a train was going by right outside the window. As more and more doubts filled the room, one by one, the jury members started changing their votes to not guilty. Each member of the jury has a different back ground and each seem to find a personal connection to a different member within the trial. One Juror has glasses and identifies with the eye witness who also wears glasses but realizes that when she saw the murder from her bed while looking out the window, she probably wouldn't have been wearing her glasses which would have made it very difficult to see. Another Juror is a father with a bad relationship with his son. He identifies the most with the murder victim who was stabbed "supposedly" by his own son. He tends to be more ruthless with the young man on trial and is the very last Juror to change his vote to not guilty. I think that this strategy naturally makes the audience try to identify with one of the characters. We tend to ask ourselves, if I were in this situation, who would I be? Would I vote guilty or not guilty? We all like to think that we would be the first one to vote not guilty. Compassion wins the star role in this film. There may be many different kinds of moral statutes that the film makers lead the audience to believe, but they all tie back into this one simple concept. One of our greatest and most noble examples of compassion is the biblical reference to Jesus Christ. In some ways, this movie can be related to that seeing as the main character can be seen as a savior for the young man on trial, but because of the very real human element in the film, this is clearly the exact opposite. The first juror may have all the compassion in the world but that just simply doesn't do it justice. He must also convince his fellow 11 apostles to have this same kind of compassion which eventually saves this young boys life. Compassion is what makes the audience identify with the main character, not justice. If all 12 jurors had walked into the room, quickly voted that the evidence was good and that this boy was without a doubt the killer then it wouldn't have been in justice or ruthless in the least. After all in the minds of 12 imperfect people, this was a case where the killer was proved guilty. Granted the movie would have no plot and it wouldn't have been nominated for 3 academy awards, but it would have been just in the eyes of the legal system. So why does the audience vote for this random act of compassion? Is it just? This film has been numbered among the great drama classics in history. Not because of its amazing CGI ability to make super robots fight aliens, nor its Megan Fox type lead female role, but because of the film makers ability to creatively persuade its audience to be morally upright. We as Americans are always trying to better ourselves. It's in our blood. However, sometimes we try to focus more on the qualities that will benefit ourselves, instead of helping other people. We try to lose weight, we try to be funnier, be interesting. All of these things are great to a certain extent, but what these brilliant film writers are doing is trying to help us realize is that being American is not about us. It's about helping us to become our best selves in order to help other people. Sure, being determined, skilled compassionate, etc. can help us personally, but how can we take these personal strengths and apply them to be the best Americans we can be? The main character said it best when he announced, "wouldn't you want someone to do the same for you if you were in his position?" The room may have been silent, but the audience already knows the answer to that question. The "anger" portion of this movie is not so much anger as it is a character development struggle to become a better more compassionate individual. The argument in this film is one that we lack in today's modern cinema. If the new and upcoming film makers want to learn from history, then they need to take a blast to the past because films like these teach us to be American, be just, but more importantly, to be compassionate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece of debate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men, a classic movie that is truly one that can be enjoyed by anyone no matter what genre of film you might prefer. The film is one of thrills but done in a way where it is all in the dialogue and the body language of the 12 men set up to decide the fate of a young man who is on trial for the murder of his father. The movie also explores the 12 men's lives and also any prejudices they hold against the young man on trial, different perspectives are had throughout the movie not just on the murder itself but also on the man's back story as a child and how his father brought him up. A masterpiece simply in the way that it entices the viewer so that your focus is never lost and draws you in as you explore the case in one room with one table and 12 chairs.It can't be easy to create something so astounding from 90 odd minutes of people sat in a room talking, but this achieves it and achieves it pretty fast too, it doesn't take long before you're drawn in yourself and want to know more. Sidney Lumet directs and does a fine job, he is the person really responsible for making this feel so damn well exciting I guess and combined with Reginald Rose's story and script it makes it so much more of a classic. Lumet gets the very best out of his actors and really pulls the strings, even little things like when the men move around the room; it makes what they are saying that little bit better.Henry Fonda as juror number 8 really leads the cast, after all his character is the one who at first wants to talk about the case and debate it when everyone else thinks the kid should fry. Fonda is absolutely brilliant in his role; his calm demeanour mixed with his impassioned speeches on the case make his character one of the true good guys of cinema. Lee J. Cobb's character stands out a lot because of his overall anger at the boy involved in the case, Juror number 3 who Cobb plays is one of the stand outs because of his behaviour during the debating being done. Each juror is different, from the angry to the very meek, the guy who wants to get out of the place for a baseball game to the guy who grew up in a slum just like the young man on trial did. They each bring not only different personalities but back stories too with some loud mouths and some quiet and really indifferent to the case and that together is another reason why this is flawless cinema.12 Angry Men deserves its place in the classics of cinema, not just for its acting or its directing etc but mostly because it's a story that all can enjoy and I think most who watch this can say they at least wanted to see how it ends. As said before it cannot be easy to create something like this, all in the same room and not make the audience bored by it all, but it has enough great things in it to make it more than just a good or great film, it's pretty much perfect. Another thing that this film does which is fantastic is you start to visualize the case at hand, I mean sure you listen to the jurors talk but sometimes it makes you start imagining all the things going on that the case entails, from the murder, the train and to the old man's story, the film never fails to bring new things up and shake the case about a little.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be in everyone's top ten list of greatest films of ALL TIME.....by Sydney Lumet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films rarely get this uplifting and brilliant. I cannot think of the last time I was so intrigued by the flawless plot, dialogue and acting since 12 Angry Men. For such a simplistic story set in one jury room, it is surprising that Sidney Lumet can drain you of all your emotions and leave you on the edge of your seat with suspense, mystery, and some of the best acting your bound to ever see grace the silver screen!When a boy is on last day of trial for killing his father in the heat of domestic arguments, 12 jury men are forced to present a verdict in which if guilty, is the one way ticket to the electric chair for the boy. When the jury men decide to quickly end the discussion and raise their hands to find out who thinks the boy is guilty, only one jury man (Henry Fonda) doesn't put his hand up. Trial and Character revelations, doubts, and possibilities follow.So masterfully crafted is this film, that every time I watch it, only gets better. It includes some of the best character development I've ever seen. Sidney Lumet is an expert in this field and this is by far his greatest contribution to Hollywood history - one of the most important contributions to world cinema. However it was Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb who really made this film legendary, with their incredibly realistic performances. Casting was genius. And the dialogue was astoundingly riveting up until the brilliant finale. What really impressed me personally also was the camera angles and movements that made the film so suspenseful. Black and White made the film all the more powerful. And the music was minimal, which gave the film a more atmospheric experience, like you were their in the jury room with them - and you just feel that tension really built up as the movie proceeds.This inexpensive film, with such a simple setting had the world talking, the academy awards nominations rolling and Henry Fonda at his complete best form. I have rarely been so hypnotized by a film - 'Lawrence Of Arabia' and 'It's A Wonderful Life' are other ones that come to mind. This is a definitive viewing for anyone who loves film. It sums up everything I love about film. Everything from a technical point of view to superb acting and a simple yet complex character driven story, it's platinum and is most definitely one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time - bar none! A statue should be erected in Sydney Lumet's honor....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a 22 year old movie lover, born in 1993 and I was sure I only cared about movies in colour, made after a certain point in time. Yet I recently decided to watch as many movies as I cold from the "top 250 movies voted by IMDb users" as I could, but held out on this one because it was old and not in colour.Never have I been so wrong, and never have I been so glad I gave a movie, I probably otherwise would never have watched, an honest chance. I have also never written a movie review on here because I didn't think I was qualified, but this movie deserves all the praise it can get.This movie might just be one of the best I have seen, and there are multiple reasons for that.I personally like when someone is able to take a simple concept and make it interesting and much deeper than it first appears, especially when it come to movies, and especially when it also involves analyzing the human psyche / the way humans think.This movie does not only do that, but at the same time presents an excellent variety of 12 everyday but still VERY different characters, all with different viewpoints and ways of thinking, all of whom is set with the difficult task of deciding if an 18 year old boy from the slums is guilty of murdering his own father or not. And all this, the entire movie takes place in single room with only these 12 characters and a table between them.The 1 hour and 36 minutes this movie is just flew by, I was that taken away by the characters and their arguments for the young boy being guilty or not guilty. To me that is fantastic movie-making, and the kind of movie i will let myself be inspired by if / when I myself become a director.10 / 10, I recommend this movie to any serious movie lover, and it absolutely still applies to a modern audience, I am a good example of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 angry men makes one satisfied viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men is an interesting choice for one of the greatest American films of all time given its simultaneous abstraction and straight-forwardness as a film. It concerns a group of twelve jurors who are retired to reach a verdict on a murder case involving an eighteen-year-old living in the slums of New York, who is accused of murdering his father at their home. We are immediately taken into the New York City courthouse, where the twelve jurors are sent to their private room to discuss the case and come to a unanimous vote in favor of life or death for the boy. All but one juror is positive beyond a reasonable doubt that the boy in question is guilty and deserves the chair for his crimes.The man is Henry Fonda's character, a man who, like all but one other soul in the room, remains nameless until the end of the film. While he doesn't entirely believe the boy's innocence, he is unsure that he is guilty and feels it is wrong to jump to a decision about a young life so quickly without at least talking over the facts. With that, the jurors are forced to divulge some sort of conversation to get on the same page in favor of one side or the other. During this time, the New York City heat is sweltering, the fan in the room isn't working, and one juror cannot wait until he is released so he can go to a baseball game in the evening. What would normally be a quick meeting between twelve men turns into a bitter, but rational display or exchanging facts about the case and going against groupthink by providing logical alternatives to the events recounted by the witnesses.Fonda's character is called a lot of things in the film and many of them are accurate to his persona, albeit in a bitter, shortchanging manner. He is referred to as a "golden boy," sympathizing a young boy in the slums who has ostensibly taken on a life of savagery if he is in fact guilty. His character basically recites the same dialog repeatedly throughout the film, stating how he is not totally sure if he indeed not guilty, but can't be certain that he is guilty, leaving a reasonable doubt on his mind that he is too ethical to override.One of the many intriguing things about Fonda's stance is his ability to go against the grain; the slightest doubt in his mind, at first, the commonality of the boy's alleged murder-weapon, a pocketknife, leads him to stall an otherwise unanimously convinced jury that the boy on trial is guilty. How many people, even if they had the slightest doubt in their mind, would challenge eleven other men who have raised their hands in favor of the boy's guilt and subsequent death? Most people, including myself probably, would bury our skepticism under our own volition of self-deprecation: "maybe I missed something," we'd think, "maybe I'm just way off," we'd add, before humbly raising our hand in a delayed fashion to make what looked to be a hung jury a unanimous vote. If Fonda's character would've done that, 12 Angry Men would be a depressingly common and pointless short film; not one of the greatest works of American cinema.The key to the film's renowned qualities lies in a few places. As stated, the first is the plausibility to believe the jurors become wrong-headed once they begin agreeing with Fonda's character. Some would argue that having these characters basing an entire trial/murder on the happenings of scattered incidents that were relatively minor in the grand-scheme would result in a miscarriage of justice. Film critic Mike D'Angelo says that these twelve jurors would probably be the same ones who would acquit O.J. Simpson of his murder charges. The fact is, we don't know at the end of it; we weren't there, we were never destined to be there, and all we know is that one person is dead, one person is about to own or disown responsibility to that death, and there is reasonable doubt lingering in the room like fragrant cologne. The correctness or morality of the jurors' decision isn't so much in question, for I'm sure a dinner conversation between two people who viewed the film disagreeing with the jurors' decisions could indeed occur with both parties having enough well-founded evidence.This brings me to the other noteworthy element about the film, which is its ability to operate in several different genres. The attributes of the film I just mentioned, leading it to be discussed and interpreted in a number of different ways, makes it a biting mystery, while the rapid-fire, investigative dialog in the second and third act turns the film more in the direction of a suspense film or a crime-drama. Finally, there's the inherent melodrama of character relations, with numerous not getting along with one another and the hard-headedness of other jurors standing in the way in preventing what could be a potential miscarriage of justice (Ed Begley's character, for example, who remains incorruptibly certain that the boy is guilty).Finally, above all in some minds, there's the sheer entertainment value of 12 Angry Men. This is a film that further proves my point that a film that takes place in one room and is heavily built on character relations and character development can be just as gripping as a film predicated upon large action setpieces and costly displays of action. As droll as the film may seem, this is one of the most entertaining courtroom-dramas I've yet to see with some of the most ambiguous questions about rebelling against groupthink, the analysis of justice and legal practices, and the sheer impact and significance of reasonable doubt(s) I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men is a fine depiction of reason and argument along with marvelous direction and acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie opens with the scene where a boy is convicted of murder by the court and the court asks the jury members to give their verdict. The way the opposition lawyer presents the case, it looks like an open-and-shut case. The boy is guilty is what everyone thinks.The jury room consisting of 12 jurors has to arrive upon a decision which seems quite easy- the boy is guilty of murder. For the next 80 minutes, the audience see nothing but a jury room and 12 jurors arguing to reach a decision. Now that's where the surprise and twist takes hold gradually.Henry Fonda playing juror#8 has some "reasonable doubt" over the boy's situation. He bases his claims on reason and logic and as the movie progresses, more and more jurors get convinced that the boy isn't guilty.In the end, all of them get convinced by the arguments posed by juror#8 that the boy is innocent. The way the discussions follow, gradually and pacing up finally culminating every juror into one and only verdict- not guilty.This movie has a simple storyline but with marvelous dialogs and acting. It is one of the most brilliant form of art ever produced by Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The human mind is trained to identify good or bad storytelling as one's been told stories one's whole life. 12 Angry Men tells you a story and hits it out of the ball park.If you ever feel that a 1950s movie will be boring and cannot be compared to the present ones, let me tell you something. I was of the same notion while people urged me to watch this movie and boy was I glad I finally listened to them.12 Angry Men is a storytelling masterpiece with a fantastic script. It does have great acting but the dialogue and the narrative convinced me that this was the greatest story that was ever told via motion pictures.If you think old movies are dull and not worth it, just spend 2 hours of your day (preferably uninterrupted) and watch this film, you are going to find a new love for movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great movie with great special effects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all i want to say that i absolutely fell in love with this flick. it is a very high budget very long and very entertaining action movie. the shooting just doesn't stop no matter what you do. the special effects are absolutely breathtaking, way ahead of their time if you ask me, CGI and very advanced animation technology makes this movie worth a look. I was a bit disappointed by fonda's performance in his role as the big hero, and found his acting rather stoned. Was he supposed to resemble a retard or a tree, i don't know. Anyway, this is the film that lead to the production of Rambo first blood, commando, snake eater series, nemesis, hercules in new york and dozens of great romantic Oscar winning pellicles. Have you not seen this movie, i feel sorry for you AND highly recommend that you leave it on the shelf. don't waste your time with this,try lorenzo lamas's movies. They are much better and do not match the exceptionally wonderful cosmology of this film. Hope this helped you out! cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High drama in a New York City courtroom with a man's life hanging in the balance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Given what at first glance seems to be an open and shut case by The State of New York vrs George Savoca in the murder, by Mr. Savoca stabbing, of his father. As the foreman of the Jury juror #1 Martin Balsam takes a vote from the 12 jurors including himself he gets an 11 to 1 vote for the conviction of Mr. Savoca. The lone dissenter is Juror #8 Henry Fonda who wants the defendant, who if convicted automatically gets the death penalty,to at least have his case reviewed and debated before he and the rest of the Jurors make a decision that may very well cost Mr. Savoca his life. At first the debate goes nowhere until it becomes clear that the switchblade that Savoca was accused of using to murdered his father was not that unique. The fact that Juror #8 produced an exact same switchblade that he bought in a store some two blocks from the Savoca's home changed all that. Slowly one after another the men on the jury change their vote with Juror #9 and #5 Joseph Sweeney and Jack Klugman being the first two to change their vote from conviction to acquittal. The entire murder case hinged on the two eye witnesses, a lame old man and a near-sighted middle-aged woman, to the murder who lived across the street from the building where the murder was committed. The witnesses testimony was taken apart by both juror #8 and #9 when it was discovered that the old man couldn't have gotten, as he testified at the murder trial, as fast to the window to see the murder committed. As for the woman who was asleep, the murder was committed after midnight, she could not have gotten out of bed and seen, from some 60 feet away, through the windows of a passing fast moving subway train the killing without having her glasses on. The film "12 angry Men" ends with the only holdout of the jurors to acquit Juror #3 Lee J. Cobb breaking down and finally voting to acquit Mr. Savoca. Fine courtroom drama that is as thought-provoking now as it was back then on the screen in 1957 with every one involved giving Academy Award caliber performances even though there were a number of factors that were overlooked by the jurors that may well have proved Mr. Savoca guilt. The knife that killed Savoca's, the same kind of knife that Savoca said that he had but lost the night of the murder, father was found on the street outside his apartment. Even though Juror #8 bought an exact copy of the switchblade knife, that Savoca was said to have used, in a store not far from him home it still didn't prove his innocence. The fact that Savoca couldn't explain where he was convincingly the time that his father was murdered, he claimed he was in a movie-house where no one working there or any customer could identify him. Being the one and only suspect in his fathers murder with a motive to boot, he got into a fierce fight with his father and said that he was going to kill him a few hours before Savoca's father was murdered. It was the eye witness testimony that failed to convince the jurors that had them vote to acquit him. As convincing as the movie was in the jury acquitting Savoca in real life the jury would have in all probability have ended up by not coming to a verdict and ending up a hung jury. Two of the jurors #10 and #7 Ed Begley, Sr. and Jack Warden were more or less motivated to vote for acquittal by being intimidated and pressured by their fellow jurors then by the testimony. Juror #3 Lee J. Cobb was so unstable and emotionally screwed up that it's a wonder that he ever got on the jury in the first place unless he was such a good actor that he fooled the State prosecutor when he was paneled by him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>still good, but overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, I know, "12 angry man" is a classic. It deals with a topic that was and may still is very important. It was truly ahead of the times. Also the characters were very well portrayed and although the film is very minimalist it delivers the plot very well and it is worth watching, no doubt. But I think the movie is overrated. Its plot line is very very straight so that you know the end right when you start watching. There is no real turn, that blows you away. It is quite simple. Also I wasn't moved as much by this film, I wouldn't be thinking about it if I weren't writing this review right now. So don't get me wrong, I think the film is totally worth watching, but #9 on IMDb of all times? Don't agree.. There are a lot of movies which are ways better then this one, movies that blow you and your mind away, movies you are thinking about for years. I don't count this movie to those..</fullReview>

The acting is superb, the writing brilliant, and I cant give enough praise for the camera staff. The story is almost too good to be true yet after seeing this film you're going to believe that it is very possible.Many actors and filmmakers today should learn that special effects, fancy music, and expensive budget doesn't make a good movie.

He starts with nothing but sharing his thought over the issue and needs to discuss a little further and what happens next is intense, compelling and above all logical. One thing which strikes me most is the level of responsibility when everyone else has different thought.

The stellar cast, amazing dialogue and expert cinematography make this movie just as exciting as a James Bond flick. Henry Fonda, as well as the rest of the cast play their parts with a passion that is seldom seen in today's age and each character is so different from the next that almost anyone watching can relate to one or all of them in one way or another. This movie was released many years before I was even a notion, but it's near perfect production transcends any and all barriers of time and can be enjoyed just as easily today was it was back in the the late fifties. If there was ever a movie that should be on your list of pictures to see before you die, this should certainly be high on the list. If you haven't seen this movie yet then I would highly recommend you do so. If you already have then find someone who hasn't and enjoy it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men, 1 Fantastic Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Sidney Lumets classic masterpiece, 12 Angry Men, starring Henry Fonda as Juror 8, tells the story of a jury's decision for a Young Latino Man convicted on murdering his father. The Jury, filled of the 12 Angry Men, then vote, discuss and debate whether this boy is guilty and whether he should face the Electric Chair.Firstly, all praise has to go to the minimal Cast. There may be few, but those few actors perform some of the greatest performances of All Time. Henry Fonda stars as Juror 8/The Architect, the member of the Jury who wants to convince the rest of his Jury's Peers that the man is not automatically guilty because he's Latino. Henry Fondas fine performance is very memorable, and his character is very lovable. One of the great things about 12 Angry Men is the great display of character development. The change of the Jurors is breathtaking and some of the greatest character development in Film History.The Film, completely in black and white, asks a very important question. Should someone be guilty because of a stereotype? The Film deeply explores the questions that come up about stereotypes, and how stereotyping can make someone choose a bad decision. The film shows how prejudice is a lethal trait, and how holding onto the past can make you make bad decisions in the present.12 Angry Men deserves all the praise it can get, and if you disliked it the first time, I recommend a second viewing, and watch out for character development and how prejudice affects decisions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is excellent. 12 angry men is a spellbinding step into the juridical world of ethical choice making that many have to go through their life. This movie hits hard on many levels, the directing is masterful, making each viewer feel personally invested into the murder, the ethical choice of choosing on the fate of someones life and hoping that the people you are watching will do the right choice and deciding if they actually do the right choice or if they have all been duped by doubt. This movie is minimalist staying principally in one room, with 12 characters deciding the fate of a human being. The film traverses many genres: from the courtroom drama, to the detective drama, to the ethical character(s)portrait rendered by conversation and relation that each character has with one another and excels at each giving the audience a refined viewing experience, with little to no flaw.</fullReview>

This is a truly fantastic movie with a great script, great acting, and great cinematography! Fonda does an amazing job of really convincing you that the case isn't what it seems. By the end of the movie, you enjoy all twelve of the character's unique personality and view on the case. It's a truly unique film that can teach us a lot about how less is more when it comes to film making. The cinematography is also something to note. As the movie begins the angles are wide and high, but as the movie progresses, the cameras get lower and closer to the actors'faces. It truly gives a sense of tension and claustrophobia. To conclude, this movie, one of the best B&amp;W films I've ever seen, is a masterpiece, deserving to be re-watched over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this book because the story is interesting me, also I like some parts of film, such as: the actor, some details and so on. But I was more likely with the written play, because it was fun that you could imagine what the story was acted, and it was better then the film, because you could use your brain to work on and to know what story was talking about and how they acted. Also, I like juror No.8 in the written play, because he was smart and brave. For example, juror No.8 was the only one to find out the problem of witness's testimony and acted hoe witness could did it. Another example, juror No.8 still insisted his vote, and he changed juror's vote and he saved the accuser's life at the end. I did not like the film because it's black and white, do not have good action, and have a lot of arguing. Also, sometimes the film is not connecting to the book and the film will add something that not belongs to the book. For example, the book did not talk about juror No.3 was crying and changing his vote at the end. And juror No.9 walked to juror No.8 and introduced him then the end. For other reason that I did not like the film because of juror No.3 because his act was so exaggerate and he cannot without his personal emotion. Such as: in Act 2, juror No.8 said that you want to see this boy die because you personally want it, then juror No.3 started to shouting and slapped on the desk said, " I'll kill you, I'll kill you."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would be considered politically incorrect today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a classic of a film this is with some of the most talented of actors of the day. 12 men all from different backgrounds (stock broker, businessman, watch maker, accountant, architect, blue collar, salesman etc...) sit on jury to decide if a young boy should go to the electric chair for a crime he may or may not have done....the killing of his father. First most of the men (11 of them) are ready to convict either to get out of the cramped hot jury room or they really believe the boy did it. One man, Fonda, is convinced the boy is innocent or at least wants to talk about it before they rush and have a young boy die. "it's not easy for me to send a young boy to the chair without talking about it first" says Fonda. As the film continues Fonda slowly gets the other Jurors to see the flaws in the case and raise their doubts if the boy really committed the crime. One man is left (Lee J Cobb) who wants to see the boy burn based not on the evidence but personal feelings of his son that ran away from home years before. In the end however Cobb concedes and says the boy is not guilty. The boy may or may not have committed the crime but the point was that the case against him was weak and flawed. This film would never be accepted today for several reasons. First all the jurors where white men which would offend many people and I think it's crazy. Today it would have to have these types of characters: Angry black man or some other minority who has a problem with white people, bitter white feminist woman that hates men, a clueless white guy that everyone else on the jury would throw jabs at, single mother and anyone else that would fit the MTV Politically correct nonsense. It would lack the power 12 angry men had because it would spend too much time preaching about the injustice of the bankrupt lives of the jurors and it would lose focus. I'm sure the name of the film would be something like, "12 angry people." In any case 12 Angry Men is a powerful film and goes down as one of the best in film history. If people get offended today by it only because of the actors used they should stick to watching Michael Bay movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"12 Angry Men" is an outstanding achievement. Why? Like in the movie, I'm gonna tell you why I think so:1.It's from 1957, it's old. (Many, mostly young, people find this negative. 2.It's in black and white (Even more doesn't even bother to try and see such movies) 3.It has a very simple plot. 4.It's shot almost entirely in a single room. 5.The budget's as low as 340.000 dollars (Citizen Kane, 16 years EARLIER had 690.000) 6.It was Sidney Lumets, the director, first movie. and 7.It consists almost entirely of dialogue.And STILL; The LOWEST average score is 7.8! (By girls under 18 of course)Throughout the feature, there is a great tension. There is so much we want to know, so much that fixes my eyes on the screen from the first minute until the end. Did the boy do it? Can number 8 convince the rest? Can he convince me? Who will be the next to have doubts? Will number 8 come up with more excellent deducing? This is the proof that great movies can be done with very small resources. All you need is a great plot and good actors. Astoundishing! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie in school (I think it was 7th grade). If I were a teacher I would have kids watching movies all the time!!! Anyway, this movie is a drama, and the 12 Angry Men are jurors in a murder case(I guess this was back in the day when women didn't serve on juries?). The movie is about one Juror (#8) and his attempts to convince the other 11 that the young man accused of murder is not guilty.I don't know if this is considered a spoiler or not but the best part of the whole movie is the dramatic exchange between Juror #8 (the guy who thinks the accused might not be guilty) and Juror #3 (the bombastic juror) near the end of the show.**warning don't read if you don't like spoilers. While I'm not sure if the following is a spoiler, the IMDb is pretty strict about spoiling movies in reviews. They say I will be blacklisted. Whatever, you've been warned, now back to the best part of the movie.**Juror #3 says, "I'll kill you!" or "I'm gonna kill you" or something like that and Juror #8 says, "You don't really mean that do you?" Then Juror #3 gets this wonderful sequence of expressions on his face of anger turning into confusion turning into disgust turning into defeat turning into confusion. Yeah, I think he shows confusion twice. He's initially confused at the rapidity and perspicacity of Juror #8's retort and then finally confused about how he could have been wrong all along. What is so brilliant about this sequence (aside from the wonderful acting - reminiscent of a scene in an episode of Quantum Leap where Sam sings "Imagine" to his younger sister and her expression goes through a sequence of changes - but boy is that way off-topic) is the setup and payoff. Juror #3 is so convinced the accused is guilty, especially since the accused was heard by someone (it's been a while since I've seen the movie so forgive me if I'm not entirely accurate here) to have said, "I'm gonna kill you" or "her" or whatever. Then Juror #8 lays a trap for #3 and he walks right in - and it's some good viewin'. See I didn't even spoil it all that much. I didn't even tell you how it ends. It ends well. Oops did I spoil it? 8/10</fullReview>

Even with all the testimonies not as reliable as they seemed in the beginning, who else could have done it?Although very interesting from a sociological as well as psychological perspective (it was the Freudian epoch, you can tell by every second line), 12 Angry Men leaves a bad taste in your mouth because in the end Henry Fonda saved a murderer, AND HE KNEW IT ALL THE TIME. He was just against the death penalty, and very cleverly persuaded (manipulated) the jury employing group psychology. However any reasonable member would have sticked to his opinion. Some of them just wavered to easily, which is another flaw of this still quite good and interesting classic. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Twelve Angry Men is a good film, but not deserving of it's high IMDB ranking, in my opinion.It is a compelling film, and viewers will definitely want to stay until the end, and the performances and direction are generally fine, however:1. As others have mentioned, it is a simple film, and predictable - perhaps I'm expecting too much from a film made in 1957, but I think not - of course these flaws are due to the story and the script.2. I'm probably all alone on this one, but I find Cobb's performance to be way over the top - the quintessential example of a great stage actor overplaying a role on the screen.3. It has repeatedly been mentioned that this film may be the best example of an ensemble cast and group dynamics - I believe Glengarry Glen Ross and many other films dwarf 12 Angry Men in the ensemble category, and Glengarry in the group dynamics category, though I realize the relationships are different - and GGR isn't even in the top 250! (possibly due to profanity)To sum it up, seeing 12 Angry Men ranked in the top 30 films makes ME angry .</fullReview>

Eyewitness testimony is dismissed because witnesses may be lying even though no evidence is presented to support them lying. Fonda's character accepts anything that suggests without evidence that facts are not as they seem. If one dismisses facts without evidence just because people may be mistaken - with no evidence that they are - no one can find anyone guilty and we have no jury system. As for the movie, it has every clich in the book. Supposition are created almost out of thin air, to support doubt. No evidence is presented for this. If one forgets the clichs and is ignorant of our jury system, the movie can be riveting, and make perfect sense. If you examine the movie, it makes a case for never finding anyone guilty. I loved this movie until I actually served on a jury.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a firm believer that classics were being appreciated by pompous people or the likes. I am writing this as a letter of apology for having this prejudice towards something I did not experience myself but judged it based solely on what society "told" me to think.These 96 minutes of dialog will make you think twice about more than just the film's story. I don't think that I have to mention that the story itself is so complex in its simplicity, that it can be seen as a timeless insight on one of the biggest flaws of society, modern or otherwise.I can't say anything more but I do urge you to see this film, regardless if you're 9 or 90. It left me with a grin on my face for hours - a beautifully written, filmed and acted picture. A masterpiece that does your mind in in the most delightful way.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is a deeply engrossing crime drama shot almost entirely in a claustrophobic utilitarian jury room which shows how one person with a conscience and critical thinking ability can make a difference to this society while also criticises how we are often biased by prejudice, bigotry, and conceit in making our decisions. This powerful film is a deep examination of human psychology which explains how we often judge an incident based on our own perceptual biases, close mindedness and own experience rather than the facts produced from that incident. A Hispanic teenage boy, born and raised in a slum, was accused of killing his father and was in trial. There were two concrete pieces of evidences which were enough to put the boy in the electric chair. But the final decision has to come from the juries and so they retired to the jury room after the judge asked them to come up with their verdict. It looked like an open and shut case until one juror (juror 8) vetoed and wanted to go through the facts again. Eleven members of the jury did not think otherwise and tried to convince him that he was wrong. Juror 8 did not have any concrete proof of otherwise but he raised his concern about the authenticity of the facts and incidents that has been produced during the case. Slowly, through his power of logic, patience and negotiation, he inspired the other juries to look into the facts from a fresh and different perspective. In fact he leaded them with some insights which seemed impossible to comprehend to the others. Inspired by his insights some of them started to delve into the facts, came out of their stereotypical mentalities, started to ask the right questions and finally came out with some startling perspectives which made their own earlier statements doubtful. The colour and pace of this black &amp; white film came from the cohesive storyline and the arguments and counter arguments presented by the juries. This is a drama where the characters flourished in their respective roles to their fullest extent and likewise this is a thriller where the excitement came through sharp arguments. The film never shows whether the accused is guilty or innocent, neither does it draw its curtains on finding the murderer. It does not show any arguments between lawyers, it does not even give away the names of all the juries. Even though the plot is centred around a murder, the concept is centred around unravelling the psychology of human decision making. Perhaps, these are the reasons why this film is so different from any other court room dramas I have ever seen. A perfect classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first watched this film on DVD about ten years ago after my manager at work kept going on about how good it was. At first I was a bit wary thinking it was going to be just another court room drama. When the movie finished I realised what a masterpiece it was. How a movie could grip the attention of the audience for over 90 minutes with the whole film taking place, with the exception of a few minutes, in just one room was remarkable. The actors, each with their various characters, were excellent and the acting superb.....One of my most favourite films of which I never get tired of watching....if you have not seen it, watch and you will be impressed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the rare gems of classic cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 angry men is a courtroom drama based on the premise that all defendants deserve a fair trial until proved guilty. The film is a very simplistic take on the presumption of innocence and takes place almost entirely within a small New York City court room as 12 men debate the fate of a young defendant charged with murdering his father. In the start all jurors think of the case as an open and shut case except one; Juror No. 8 played by Henry Fonda. But as they discuss the the available evidence, it turns out it is not simple as it seems to be. Most of the jurors are prejudiced and it takes the staunch effort from the character played by Fonda to induce logic and sense into the proceedings.The film builds tension through conflict among the jurors and the dialogue. The length is only 95 minutes but it feels as if it is shot in real time. The direction and camera-work is excellent. The jurors are all well defined in terms of their personalities, occupations, prejudices and the emotional reasons behind those prejudices. All the cast members make an excellent effort into bringing these characters to life.The movie is not about solving the crime although all the available evidence is heavily discussed, it is about the jury passing a judgment on the life of a boy. It is a take on the strength of the jury and their power to decide a man's survival and it performs this job in an excellent manner. The movie is a rare gem and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves great cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start by saying that twelve is my favourite number, but it wasn't just because of that that I planned to see this film, I had heard many people state it is one of the finest films in the genre, from debuting Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director Sidney Lumet (Murder on the Orient Express, Dog Day Afternoon). Basically the jury of twelve men (a jury is always twelve people) has just come from the courtroom after hearing the defence and prosecution rest their cases, and they are now the people who must decide the verdict for the case. They must determine if a young Spanish-American is guilty or not guilty of the first degree murder by stabbing of his father, and if they all unanimously agree to find him guilty he instantly gets sentenced to death. With a weak alibi of going out to the movies and not remembering what he saw, a knife he supposedly bought and lost, and a number of witnessed hearing screams, someone shouting the words "I'm going to kill you" and possible seeing it happen, it seems open and shut. All Jurors have immediately decided to vote guilty, one Juror however is voting not guilty until he clears up the facts, this is Mr. Davis, aka Juror #8 (BAFTA winning Henry Fonda, also producing). At first he is voting opposite to everyone else for the sake of conversation and discussion, deliberations however crop up and he slowly straightens things out and brings forward things that the defence, prosecution and ultimately witnesses may have missed. These include Juror #8 having the same knife as the boy and pondering the stabbing, the noises going on when the murder happened, the reason for the shouted words, the timing of the old man heading to answer the door, and most importantly, a key witness who chose not to wear glasses but marks on her nose prove she does. Slowly the Jurors, some wise, bright and empathetic, one or two arrogant, prejudiced and merciless, may be seeing that this lone Juror has some good points and brings forward some good ideas as to what may have happened. Juror #3 (The Exorcist's Golden Globe nominated Lee J. Cobb) and Juror #10 (Ed Begley) for a long while seem adamant to stick to their verdicts of guilty, but slowly the others: Juror #1 (Psycho's Martin Balsam), Juror #2 (John Fiedler), Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall), Juror #5 (Jack Klugman), Juror #6 (Edward Binns), Juror #7 (Being There's Jack Warden), Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney), Juror #11 (George Voskovec) and Juror #12 (Robert Webber), do start to doubt their decision is right. Being swayed by the very convincing predictions of the murder events, one by one the Jurors change their verdict to not guilty, until the final one sobbingly gives in, and in the end they all agree the boy should go free. Fonda gives a magnificent performance as the calm, collective and convincing lone voting Juror to turn the others decision, Cobb is equally fantastic as the one who takes ages to change the mind of, and the other actors all get their moments on screen as well. The one location film based on a play could have been a little dull, but director Lumet keeps you gripped with a marvellously worded script played out to perfection by the actors, with the addition of great camera work and set pieces as well, it is a brilliant classic courtroom drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Picture and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Henry Fonda was number 6 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men, Juror #8 was number 28 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes &amp; Villains, the film was number 88 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 87 on 100 Years, 100 Greatest Movies, and it was number 42 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers.

		<shortDescription>Rather disorderly than angry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The inflamed comments are probably Pavlovian responses to the movie's politically correct quotient. Quality performers meet deep message. The most obvious flaw in this supposed classic, one of the most super-estimated films in history was as follows: real juries are allowed neither to carry their own experiences nor to consider evidence not presented at trial. If the jury had acted in accordance with the correct legal procedure, there would have been no basis for the plot, therefore no drama, therefore no catharsis. An intriguing theme doesn't always result in a good production. What shall I call a movie including clichd, implausible characters, and a foreseeable twist (a 11-to-1 vote changing into 0-to-12)? Juries exist in order to allow the cold letter of the law to be broken, or temporarily suspended. That's what they're all about. That's their raison d'?tre. A judge can acquit a suspicious defendant for lack of evidence. A jury may convict him or her for "feeling his or her" guilt. The institution of the jury was thus an historical way to "humanize" lawsuits. If jurors were so one-dimensional, mindless and easy to persuade, courts should certainly keep them afar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best thing about this movie was watching the classic Hollywood and TV actors. The writing was good and is seldom found in movies today. Apart from that the film was nothing special.After 20 minutes I could already see the end of the movie. Also I thought it a stretch that Henry Fonda's character could be so persuasive simply by standing his ground and saying 'maybe he's guilty and maybe he isn't.'Perhaps its high IMDb rating is because a lot of people agree with the moral message it preaches. Maybe the moral message is 10 star but the movie is not. If you want to see a really good, classic, one scene, character study movie, check out Hitchcock's "Lifeboat".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>12 Angry Men: Improper behavior of a juror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is the utmost in entertainment as a character study, but only that, not as jury reality. It is fascinating due to the magnificent actors who portrayed the jurors. The viewer becomes increasingly engrossed in the dialog by their superb acting, which transcends the drab setting of the jury deliberating room. However, as a lawyer myself, the movie contains an instance of jury impropriety, which ruins the film from a legal standpoint.During jury deliberations, one of the jurors brought in an item identical to one that was introduced at the trial and showed it to the other jurors. This is a classic case of improper jury behavior! Jurors may only consider the facts, witnesses, and evidence presented at trial and what may or may not be inferred from them; not outside items that were introduced in the deliberating room, such as this "second" item. Reasonable doubt in a criminal case must exist itself, not be deliberately manufactured by a juror. Additionally, the movie takes a considerable "stretch of the imagination" to conclude that not one of the other jurors reported this behavior to the judge at the time it happened. The juror who mentioned that it was against the law was ignored.Despite the excellent acting, 12 Angry Men is disturbing even if it is "only a movie" because the legal content is pure fiction. The movie gives a distortion about permissible jury conduct and would never have ended the way it did. If the case had been real, there would have been either a mistrial or this juror would have been dismissed and replaced with an alternate juror who heard the trial and the deliberations started over again. Also, the juror would probably have received a stern rebuke from the judge when he was dismissed, mistrial or not. This juror (the late Henry Fonda) was not some kind of "hero" as the viewer is led to believe, indeed, he was quite the contrary. 12 Angry Men is not a movie for someone who may be called for jury duty for the first time, despite how it may seem to those untrained in the legal system. I have read that this is the only movie Mr. Fonda ever produced (as well as acted) and, perhaps, he let his personal feelings of justice interfere with reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Jurors(played by Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Vaskovec, and Robert Webber) all deliberate after a trial involving a young man charged with murdering his elderly father. Initially, 11 of the 12 find him guilty, but the one holdout(Fonda) makes his case for further deliberation, and gradually persuades the other men to his side. But the question still remains: Was the defendant innocent or guilty? Though undeniably well directed and acted, with an engrossing narrative, the one flaw is the Fonda juror, who is just insufferably sanctimonious! His argument of "It's Possible." to argue reasonable doubt is absurd, since if taken to its logical conclusion, would never lead to a conviction, since "it's possible" that it was the evil twin, or "it's possible" that it was paranormal in some way! It's more a study of how one strong-willed man can persuade weaker-willed men to his way of thinking, which does not inherently mean a morally just outcome! Still, a compelling film that does provoke much thought and argument, and can't be so easily dismissed, though it is overpraised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fonda/Lemmon,a few words about the two sides of a coin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The real themes of 12 Angry Men (1957) are overlooked.This film is about a distant and glacial intellectual,a man who is not at all "popular" and "approachable",and it is not the "nice",ordinary and popular guys who take the truth's side.The ordinary people seem ready to vote without thinking;not so with the architect.The architect is an intellectual,and a man of thought;Fonda was ideal for characters of men with a deep and rich interior life.It is very significant that the script chooses this architect to stand for the thought and for the mind's vigor.This intelligent man has a cultural identity,he is an architect.In a certain sense,he is the only character to have a biography:his biography is this strength of his mind.Fonda takes his character above the script,and gives an intense and compact life to this architect that began by being so distant and cold towards the other 11 angry men.12 Angry Men (1957) has a profound signification,and some of its moral themes remind of those Sidney Lumet treated in The Hill (1965) also (the strength of the individual,the freedom not to conform,etc.)."12 ..." is much better than "The Hill".12 Angry Men gave Henry Fonda one of his several wonderful roles (he was wonderful in Fort Apache,1948,in C'era Una Volta Il West,1968,and a man of urban charm).The main merits of Lumet's "12 ..." are:Fonda (an actor of fineness and distinction) and a very unconventional and courageous conception that goes against the cheap populism).This is not a movie that flatters the average man (as do so many directors from Capra to Ramis);on the contrary,it affirms the right and value of the lonely and thinking man.Lemmon made the architect to be a reasonable,phlegmatic and experienced fellow,and a consummated gentleman ;instead,Fonda's architect is much more than that.In other words,Lemmon's creation is lacking the metaphysical depth and charm that only Fonda knew to give his character.Lemmon made a slick oldster,a little exhausted.Fonda made an intellectual of an ardent fascinating force.Lemmon made an average bourgeois,while Fonda made a humanist intellectual.Lemmon is humane and reasonable,an oldster in reason,distinguished by his urban charm and reasonableness;Fonda is a humanist,and a subtle reasoner.The William Friedkin remake missed entirely what Sidney Lumet's movie had to say:the story of a honest and gifted intellectual that stands against the waves of imbecility.Lemmon chosen an erroneous path,and his role is therefore mistaken:he made the architect to be a "popular" man,a politically correct generous;this is not the case with Fonda ,who seized exactly the characters peculiarities.In Lumet's film,the architect is from the beginning a lonely and somehow enigmatic man,not at all a "popular" figure.I don't know how Lemmon managed to misunderstood completely his part,especially that he had before him Fonda's amazing example. Lemmon made a huge final error:when his adversary is "defeated",Lemmon has a victorious smile.This is awful.Now this makes Lemmon a triumphant Pitecanthrope,and this is extremely wrong and proves that he did not understood his beautiful role.The movie was not about personal triumphs,as Lemmon seems to have thought.So,Lemmon made his character a "popular" man,and allowed himself a wicked,triumphant smile at the end,when his enemy is defeated.It was not a very good idea to remake "12 ..." with Lemmon,who did strive to make a character with popular appeal,in a movie that no one of those implied seems to have enjoyed.The elegance is lacking from William Friedkin's movie. Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men is a movie that each actor looks pleased to be in,while William Friedkin's film is one that none of the actors seemed happy to be in;this is the difference between the two movies.So,the Fonda version deserves the praise also for deftly avoiding several mistakes that the uncouth ulterior version made.I have seen first the Jack Lemmon/George C. Scott/Mueller-Stahl/Hume Cronyn version,then Lumet's film,and I can tell that,although the subject is poor,the script is excellent,and the lines extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They certainly don't make films like this anymore. For a start they wouldn't have anything to spend the huge budget on and where would they use the compulsory CGI.I thought I was going to like this and I was right. Despite being set in the one room for the majority of the film the tension keeps your eyes on the screen and the story keeps your mind active trying to make up your own mind as to whether or not the boy was guilty.As some others have mentioned the only problem I have is that I still felt the boy was guilty at the end of the film and that it was a bit unrealistic how some of the jurors suddenly caved in and changed their vote (especially the one who couldn't recall some detail from days ago, so that proved the boy could be telling the truth about not remembering the films he supposedly saw. Doh!) Nevertheless, I tried to suspend this feeling of annoyance at the somewhat liberal preaching attitude of the film so I could appreciate its finer points which are many.I do wonder though, whether a darker ending where we see a closing shot of the accused with a kind of smirk on his face walking out the court insinuating he was guilty after all would have satisfied me more though and given more food for thought.I score a 9 though as its as classic as they get.</fullReview>

The convincing is totally linear, except for one jury member changing his mind (between the two votes 'guilty'/'not guilty') twice. I would have liked to see a script with a bit more thought behind it. Anyway, there's nothing wrong with the quality of the acting, the filming or the sound, and maybe the linear story is kind of unusual for a criminology drama.

Although the whole movie takes place in one room, and is just a bunch of men arguing, it still somehow keeps your full attention. As far as content goes, there isn't too much parents would object to. Characters discuss a murder, but that's pretty much it. It's appropriate for kids, although I'm not sure if many will like it since the whole thing is dialogue and it's rather slow-paced compared to most of today's films.

		<shortDescription>Everyone giving an honest effort to civic duty is a matter of life or death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is about the idea that everyone giving an honest effort to civic duty is a matter of life or death. It sets out to prove this idea with two external plots: one plot chronicles the journey of finding reasonable doubt for a Not Guilty verdict, the other chronicles the jury gradually giving an honest effort to the deliberation process. The result of these two plots, both of which end in success, gives rise to the idea that without everyone giving an honest effort, the democratic process would be broken.The movie is a short, confined story tightly told. It is an important story since the idea at the heart of democracy is a delicate one: that all members of society are innocent until proved guilty and that they each have the right to be judged by their peers. That 12 random people from all walks of life are the ultimate arbiters of what are life and death judgement is scary and liberating at the same time. It's scary in that each of us is a bundle of individual prejudices and hardened views that can sway our judgement. It's liberating in that these 12 random people need to unanimously decide on a single judgement despite their inherent differences.The movie highlights the democratic process by showing 12 specific individuals who are too busy and prejudiced from the get go to give the judging process an honest go. When only one juror stands between a death verdict and a long uncomfortable debate, the democratic process is on the verge of breaking down. By the individual standing up against his peers to insist on an honest discussion, he starts the process towards due diligence and evidence review that ultimately results in an unanimous Not Guilty judgement.The idea that it only takes one individual out of twelve to have the resolve for giving an honest effort to civic duty is a powerful one. It is the idea that the foundation of democratic society can rest on a single individual taking their responsibilities seriously. In fact it is the only foundation democracy can rest on.So the movie is about an important idea.But the drama of the story gets slightly repetitive in the second half, as juror after juror deals with their own prejudice. The story tries to give each juror a backstory that reinforces their preconceived notions and views, but having to do this for 12 people dilutes their power and makes most of them seem stereotyped and caricatured.But thankfully the filmmakers keep the story moving in a tight 90 minutes and don't ruin a good thing.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense Psychological Drama with Faith and Doubt to the Jury System</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Possible Spoilers Included)In this acclaimed classic courtroom film, a simple one-room setting creates an unbelievably intense psychological drama. The screenplay takes full advantage of the jury system; 12 jurors' personalities are incredibly diverse (though to the contemporary audience they are too homogeneous regarding race and gender); tugs-of-war among them take place in various forms (such as one-on-one, a group vs. a group, and one vs. the rest); and the group dynamics keep changing (e.g., a person on one side comes to be on the other). The process that one juror's initiation upsets the presupposed verdict suggests that the filmmakers have both faith and doubt to the jury system. Without the system, one judge's decision would never be based on anything similar to 12 jurors' varied perspectives, which in the film's case lead the verdict of not guilty. At the same time, the film portrays the arbitrary nature of the system; nothing but a chance brings Henry Fonda's Juror #8, who is the only one to believe the defendant is innocent at the beginning, to the jury.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lumet's courthouse drama wears its liberal heart on its sleeve. But there's some courage too in setting the action entirely after the trial is over: we see only the deliberations of the jury, trying to make sense of the evidence. In comparison to more modern (and histrionic) attempts to anatomise the legal process (such as the absurd Murder One), the merits of this judgment shine through: less really is more. The ensemble cast is excellent, and all the characterisations are well-conceived and executed, with considerably more depth than is common in films from this era. The only real failing is that the plot goes nowhere that you don't expect it to; but that's a flaw of many films far worse than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What could have been a great film exploring the personal prejudices and other troubling peculiarities of jurors during their deliberation of a murder trial, is for me ruined by the ridiculousness of a single juror eventually (and with considerable difficulty) convincing all eleven other jurors to completely dismiss the eyewitness testimony of a woman, in addition to dismissing the "ear-witness" testimony of a man.The woman who testified that she saw the boy stab his father, as far as we know from the film, did not have her testimony challenged in court, or if we assume it was, then it certainly wasn't disqualified or damaged enough, not enough to influence the eleven jurors who initially believed it.But a juror proposes that she could not have seen the boy stab his father, because she had these little marks on either side her nose. I find it ridiculous that a juror would bring up the marks on the nose, then conjecture the wearing of glasses, and follow that up with proposing the woman could not have seen what she said she saw (and again, despite her testimony going unchallenged or otherwise not refuted in court), and then the other jurors one by one agree, until they have all decided to completely dismiss eyewitness testimony!Likewise the "ear-witness" testimony, where a man who, apparently from what we know from the film, knew the boy and recognized his voice as arguing with his father upstairs, and upon hearing what sounded like a crash of a body on the floor, went out in the hall, saw the boy fleeing downstairs and outside, and then went upstairs to discover the stabbed father.His testimony was dismissed because he wears shabby clothes and is old and is probably just seeking attention!I like Henry Fonda too, but not that much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting..but bad deliberating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this flick is an attempt to depict how jurors should not deliberate, then I might give it a 10. I'd wager this is not the case, though. The extant the jury went to go from almost unanimous guilty from the start to unanimous not guilty boggles the mind when one considers how weak the alternate theories were against very strong evidence of guilt. And the last thing debated, the eyewitness's eyesight, which seemed to be the thing that mostly turned the tide, should not have been debated at all since the lady's eyesight was never a subject at trial.The burden of proof is on the prosecution and the defense need only find enough reasonable doubt equal in weight to the evidence of guilt for a not guilty verdict. But the doubt that the jury must find has to be reasonable. "...but is it possible?" is not enough, Fonda. It must be reasonable. The doubt found by the jury was no where near reasonable. Yet they found not guilty anyway. This is not justice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is a good movie deals with a murder case. 95% of the movie was shot in a single hall with 12 people as major cast. A boy will be accused for assassinating his father. the court will arrange a committee of 12 people to judge the case.this case is about guilt of the person. many logical things are in this movie. a wonderful screenplay is worth seeing the movie.the 12 people starts to study the case. at the beginning almost all the persons will agree that the boy did it for real. a old man raises against their decision. he brings the change of situation. step by step people jumps from the other side to the old man's side. they means to save the boy from getting into prison in a small age, even though the boy never murdered his father.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>important landmark movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the famous courtroom drama starring Henry Fonda, Martin Balsam and Lee J Cobb which takes place largely in the jury room where the twelve men are discussing the likelihood of the young outsider having killed his father. Of the dozen passing judgement, only Fonda has initial doubts, acting as the voice of conscience and coercion to change the minds of his fellow jurors.The film is rightly famous for its tight structure, economical script, and claustrophobic acting. Perhaps Cobb's character is too extreme and more than a bit clichd, but the types present around the table are well-drawn and convincing. Prejudices tumble out and coincidences jostle to turn the initial premise completely on its head. It is significant that on this hot day there are such a group of hotheads confined in one place.A remake forty years later was of some interest but this is the superior piece of the two. A gripping play, done with economy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hot, cramped, tedious and can last for several hours before a resolution is achieved...Now, take the life of a young man in your hands, 11 people ready to tear any of your ideas to shreds and you've become Juror #8 in Sidney Lumet's version of "12 Angry Men". To follow the seemingly apparent evidence and convict? Or question it, and unravel the many hidden layers concealing the possible truth? That is the conundrum thrust upon 12 ordinary men. Personifying our conscience and perhaps seeking an insurmountable solution to the case, Juror #8 sets forth excavating the grueling details presented. The prejudicial attitudes of the other jurors increase the complication of proving reasonable doubt, but eventually all but one succumb to logic. This in turn, creates a reversal of scenery as the wolf of the pack of 11 now stands in solitary, desperately clinging to his pride.An insightful, mentally stimulating, look into the emotionally charged process of a jury's deliberation before a verdict is handed down. A variety of cast ensures the perfect mixture of arrogance and ridicule spread into the atmosphere creating tension from the get-go. Although some characters are one dimensional; foregoing human reasoning to sustain their own beliefs, the story still connects closely enough to correlate with the audience. It is as if a fountain of human emotion and beliefs was divided to reveal each trait in man and allow a presentation of each in regard to one topic. This produces, not so much a humanly conversation between equals, but a decisive battle amongst human characteristics. Overall, this creates a well designed and intricate plot with which to absorb the viewer. A commendable aspect of this film is that because of a wide coverage of emotion, almost everyone can find a character with whom they share a close relation or system of beliefs, thereby making it a unique and appealing conversion when a point of view is presented to that specific juror. This film also encourages abstract thought which is a concept I find appealing because it allows one to see outside the norms of society and comprise their own solutions based not only on what they've been told, but the logic behind it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quickly goes astray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For decades now, films about 'social issues' have been problematic; making conscientious viewers believe they've thought deeply about a noble cause, and getting them to applaud themselves for embracing some progressive value that they probably already support*. This movie, in considering the responsibility of jury duty, neglects a finer point (&amp; a larger idea) which remains undramatised; the process of American justice is not designed to declare people innocent... it only concludes whether the prosecution succeeded or failed at proving a person guilty; this is reflected by the very specific terms, Guilty and Not Guilty. A suspect is freed when the prosecution hasn't made its case, not when the suspect is proved innocent. No one is ever declared "innocent." The difference is important (occasionally Not Guilty and Innocent are equivalent, but innocence is generally a higher standard). The jurors of '12 Angry Men' are confused about many things, but none moreso than this. The movie never clarifies this point. It would help these gentlemen immensely.At both ends of the spectrum - lynch mob to gee-whiz pushovers - the jury here utilizes thought-processes which are toxic to justice. The jerks are too interested in hanging. The 'bleeding hearts' - in the films parlance - are way too engaged in actively dismissing the whole case, not in merely detecting reasonable doubt. At one point Fonda has been able to discredit evidence (which is OK - a discovery supports this) and use a dicey method to disregard so much witness testimony (which is frankly, bizarre) that he might just as well start denying there was a victim, or that a crime occurred at all. "What if the victim isn't dead?" and "What if there was no body?" are only slightly more unreasonable than a few of his crazy, trial-negating suppositions.It remains a good idea for a movie. There are strong points (a moment when E.G. Marshall, as the reasonable opposition, quietly concedes is particularly powerful), and it's directed and shot well, but the script is so off-course that by the time the film ends most viewers will feel content that an innocent life has been saved, a moral determination not supported by the film, which is neutral concerning culpability. Worse, the offscreen case rings dramatically hollow when reassembled from the details we do get; it suggests some kind of flimsy, polemical courtroom, 'What on earth did these lawyers debate, if it wasn't the crime details? Was this a 4-minute trial?' I'm sure this movie had an impact on viewers likely to be called to jury duty, who WOULD prefer to wind things up so they could get to a ball game, but it does end up affirming that 12 people off the street are usually ignorant, and without some enlightened golden-boy on your jury (and a dramatic structure to reign them in) will hang your sorry ass. In a shocking example of tunnel-vision, the movie neglects to note that this nifty trick of persuasion might also be deployed by the morally un-righteous. To wit, couldn't just as interesting a scenario be imagined in which a juror whose motives are secretly nefarious, and who is intentionally trying to undermine the process, achieve the same reversal and get someone executed? Could one clever sociopath with a quick mind get a jury to reverse its verdict? That's a creepy, equally promising possibility which viewers aren't supposed to consider, but which is inherent in the premise, and which should have troubled a McCarthy-era audience. I think I'd actually like this movie if Fonda's moral value was left intentionally vague in the end, but it isn't. His righteousness is endorsed by heraldic music on the soundtrack and just so there's no mistaking his virtue, he walks away in a glowing white suit.This is only a good argument, not a good film. If you're the kind of viewer who prefers that there's no work to do to find a films meaning or your own nobility (Do you like To Kill a Mockingbird?), this is for you. There's no meaning to find, because none of it is hidden. It's all important on the surface. There isn't movie I love that's this overt with its meaning. 12 Angry Men is a nobility machine. Viewers are fed through it, and come out the other end righteous.(* Grapes of Wrath, Ox-Bow Incident, To Kill a Mockingbird, Call Northside 777, all of Jodie Fosters issue films, all of Kevin Costners issue films, etc.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Claustrophobic but compelling story of jury conflict after murder trial...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TWELVE ANGRY MEN is essentially a claustrophobic slice of jury duty, where jurors are herded into a New York City courtroom to discuss the facts of a murder trial of a boy accused of murdering his father.Gradually, with stark close-ups of sweating faces, we get to know the men after a brief round of small talk leads to the small details of the case after choosing a jury foreman (MARTIN BALSAM).Most of these fine actors are gone now, but interestingly enough the three who played the angriest men (LEE J. COBB, E.G. MARSHALL and ED BEGLEY) all died of heart attack several years after filming this one. HENRY FONDA, as the man who carefully reconstructs what might have happened, had a long screen career that ended after winning an Oscar for ON GOLDEN POND.Based on a TV play directed by Sidney Lumet, it's a faithful retelling of the tale, photographed with stark realism that catches the sweaty courtroom on a hot summer day and is basically a character study of each man, each one put under the microscope by a shrewd director who gets the most from his players.The tension builds from the disagreements that arise over deliberations until the final struggle to reach a decision depends on the vote of the one stubborn hold-out (LEE J. COBB). Fonda is the man who presents his own theory of what actually happened and is able to persuade the others, one by one, to his side of the argument.Extremely well done drama seems almost documentary in its display of jury room deliberations when tempers flash, where patience is strained and reason finally sees the light of day after Fonda (never convinced of the boy's guilt in killing his father) is able to present his doubts to the other jurors. Gripping stuff, well worth watching.</fullReview>

The 18 year old boy is accused of killing his father and if he is found guilty, he has to safer the consequences'. And that is death. I like this movie because one person (Juror. 8) convinced everyone and they all changed there mind. He was the only one that voted that the boy was not guilty in the beginning. But my most interesting part was when juror 3 changed his mind and even cried at the end. On the other hand, I did not like the setting because there was no woman in the movie. Lastly, 11 of the jurors were convinced at the end and the last person to change his mind was juror 3. There for it's an interesting movie to watch.</fullReview>

I didn't like it as much. Earlier this year we had watched 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' starring James Stewart. I found that one much more enjoyable since the characters did more then just sit around a table and discussing if a young boy really did kill his father or not. The story was slow, with a few surprises here and there but nothing spectacular. Our government teacher told us it was one of the best movies ever, according to the movie critics of that time, but I would have to disagree with the critics. It was just okay. Was it good to show to better understand the legal system? Yes. But, just for a movie to watch after a long week? Better keep looking.5/10</fullReview>

Compare a movie like this to something which is enjoyable on every level, has as a great story, possibly a great adventure, that might have a couple laughs in it, maybe visuals, maybe some other pleasant moments, that can move your heart, and make you feel moved after you've watched it. So the next time someone tells you go watch the angry man it's for EVERYONE, maybe you can learn something from it. just tell them: it's definitely not for EVERYONE. As great as it might be at what it's trying to do, it's still BORING to me.Maybe when I'm 100 I can watch it then and enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film may be described as a good one due to the outstanding ensemble cast of actors in it.I found that the film is definitely liberal-slanted. Conservatives are depicted as bigoted idiots. Henry Fonda, the juror who swayed all eventually, has a liberal, creative mind. He is really able to come up with creative ideas that leads to the acquittal of the defendant. Fonda is the dream juror for every defense attorney, as well as a nightmare for prosecuting attorneys.Lee J. Cobb steals the film with an outstanding performance as a hateful juror who allows his personal problems with an alienated son to feel that the accused is guilty. Ditto for Jack Warden, who really switched his vote in order to get to that baseball game.When viewing E.G. Marshall's performance, I could not help think back about his acting in the television series-"The Defenders." He is really the opposite hereEd Begley really spews out bigoted ideas that most of "these people" aren't any good and think nothing of a life. We are constantly reminded about the downtrodden, the abused child, slum and poverty living in relation to crime and other factors. The film is really a good psychological-sociological drama if anything.It seems as though the violent thunderstorm signaled a break in the action. When the lights were put on, the fan worked. Why didn't someone in the court tell the jurors about the fan and the light? Especially, as it was a sweltering day.As the jury foreman, Martin Balsam is supposed to conduct the agenda in order. Instead, he really allows the other jurors to dominate.Wouldn't you love to see the reaction in court when the verdict was read? How did the accuse react? The judge? The courtroom spectators?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie Ruined By Left Wing Bias and Smugness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>12 Angry Men is entertaining, mostly well acted, and worth a watch. It could have been far better but, from the outset, the film was designed only to take a pot-shot at the Right, and promote a Left Wing Progressive viewpoint as the absolute truth. This story is hardcore propaganda and, judging by its score on IMDb, has succeeded in fooling a great number of people. What is interesting to me is that the Left-wing's brainwashing started this early. Hollywood is still churning out the same bias today (go and read my Dark Knight review).The movie has a very interesting premise: An open-and-shut case is called in to question when one man on the twelve-man jury slowly convinces the others that the eighteen year old on trial for the murder of his father may, in fact, be innocent. That's got some real potential, hasn't it? Sadly, the gone-in-the-head Leftist who wrote this did what I feared he would: loaded the dice and peddled a Leftist agenda - namely one that excuses criminals of their actions and seeks to end the death penalty. That's the film's overwhelming goal. It wants the audience to come away from the movie, not with a greater appreciation of the legal system, but with the view that the death penalty should be abolished and that anyone who objects to this is a deluded, little bigot. Let's look at the facts we are given:-Spoilers from here on- 1. An 18 year old is on trial for the murder of his father. He has no alibi. The alibi he gave to police (that he was in a theatre the whole time) fell apart when he could not recall anything about the movies that were showing - even their names.2. There are two main witnesses: One saw the defendant leaving the scene of the crime (and heard the event); the other saw the murder take place through a window and identified the defendant. The defendant was also heard shouting in anger 'I'm gonna kill you', the same day as the murder.3. The knife (with a very rare design) used in the murder is the same knife that the defendant had bought earlier and was carrying around. His friends testified to this effect.4. The defendant is an habitual criminal who has had numerous run-ins with the law, including two arrests for knife fighting. He is said to be 'real handy with a knife'.5. The defendant has a clear motive: His father was repeatedly violent and abusive towards him, and had beaten him regularly (with fists) since he was five years of age, including the day of the murder.I was intrigued. Why does this one juror believe the defendant may not be guilty? How could he convince the rest that there is reasonable doubt? Despite the fact I feared these questions would receive fob-offs, I was still hopeful an intelligent investigation would be crafted around them. But no. Straight away, the film deliberately loads the dice by having certain jurors holding prejudiced or otherwise undesirable traits, while the dissenting voice is calm, collected, and supremely open-minded. That's clich, and a very common Leftist tactic (you'll see it a lot on shows like Star Trek).The film takes each of the facts above and finds an absurd alternate explanation for them, such as the knife could have fallen out of the defendants pocket and the true murderer used an identical knife (this is the fantastic explanation given by our Leftist hero). The film has a moronic moment where the 'hero' pulls out a knife he has bought (illegally), which appears identical to the one in question. The idea being that it isn't so rare, after all.Other silly moments include the jury discussing why the defendant would come home a few hours later if he had indeed done the crime. Not one of them mentions that the defendant lives there and would have to come back home in order to allay fears that he was the murderer. It's part of an alibi. What else is he going to do, disappear and hope that the police don't find that a tad suspicious? Nearly every explanation given in favour of the defendant is absurd or complete conjecture.When you string all the known facts together, the chances of them all being explained away in a fashion that exonerates the defendant is literally millions to one. It's so implausible that no sane jury would acquit. But the writer wants this to happen, so it does (and 12-0 in favour, just in case you missed the point). I love it when writers do that. Don't you? At one point, the following dialogue takes place:"No-one can know a thing like that; this isn't an exact science." "That's right, it isn't." Okay, then, let's just forget putting people on trial because we can hardly ever be 100% sure that they did the crime in question, can we? The number of victims created by having no deterrent, or by allowing dangerous criminals to go free, is FAR GREATER than the absolute minority case where an innocent person is found guilty. Some people cannot be reasoned with and are far too broken to be rehabilitated. They are like a dangerous dog. We don't try to change the nature of a dangerous dog because we know it's futile, and we know that by ignoring it, we are just risking more innocent lives. This really isn't rocket science, it's just that the Leftist types (who have a huge stranglehold on the media/TV) refuse to budge, and muddy the waters with their insane Progressive agenda.People cheering this movie are cheering for a violent thug, who got away with first-degree murder. It's not hip, it's just dumb. Wake up.My rating: 3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Juror #1 - a simple man who clearly does not understand the full complexity of the task that lies before him but is trying to do everything not to let anyone else find this out. He appears at ease only once during the film - when he talks about football. He has the misfortune to be selected foreman of the jury - a task he clearly does not relish.Juror #2 - a small, quite man, clearly unaccustomed to giving his own opinion much less to expecting his views to be of any importance. Apparently he finds solace in his job - he is an accountant.Juror #3 - probably the most complex personality in the film. Starts off like a pleasant self-made successful businessman, he analyses the case impartially, explains his arguments well and is reasonably self assured. As time goes on he becomes more and more passionate and seems to be somehow personally involved with the case. He also starts to show some signs of slight mental instability. Wonderfully played by Lee J. Cobb - this is the character you remember after the film is over.Juror #4 - self assured, slightly arrogant stockbroker. Obviously considers himself more intelligent than anyone else in the room, he approaches the case with cool heartless logic but (as one of the jurors says - "this is not an exact science") he does not take into account the feelings, the passions, the characters of the people involved in the case. He is conspicuous by the fact that he is the only juror that does not take his jacket off (it is a very hot day).Juror #5 - here is a man under great emotional stress. He comes from the same social background as the accused boy - with who he almost unwillingly seems to identify with. Paradoxically this appears one of the main reasons for him voting guilty - he does not want compassion to influence him - so ironically it does.Juror #6 - a simple man, quite readily admitting that everyone in the room is better qualified than he is to make decisions and offer explanations. But he really wants to see justice done and it worries him that he might make a mistake.Juror #7 - the only one that really has no opinion on this case. Literally throughout the film his thoughts are never on the case - he talks of baseball, of the heat, of fixing the fan but the only reason he has for voting this way or that is to speed things up a bit so he might be out of the jury room as soon as possible. Not an evil man he just has no sense of morality whatsoever - he can tell right from wrong but does not seem to think it's worth the bother.Juror #8- a caring man, has put more thought into the case than any of the other jurors. He tries to do his best even in the face of seemingly impossible odds.Juror #9 - a wise old man with his great life experience has quite a unique way of looking at the case.Juror #10 - the most horrifying character in the film. Votes guilty and does not even try to hide the fact that he does so only because of the boy's social background. The tragedy comes from the fact that his own social position is only a cut above the boy's - which makes him all the more eager to accentuate the difference.Juror #11 - an immigrant watchmaker, careful methodical man, well mannered and soft spoken. respects the right of people to have different opinion to his - and is willing to look at both sides of the problem. Loses his temper only once - horrified by the complete indifference of juror #7.Juror #12 - a young business type - perhaps he has his own opinions - but is careful to hide them. What he has learnt out of life seems to be that intelligence is equal with agreeing with what the majority of people think.The film succeeds in doing something very rare today - developing an intelligent plot while also developing 12 believable, memorable and distinct characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>12 Angry men is a film in which maybe those over 25 would enjoy. It explores prejudices and preconceived notions which people had in the 1950s. Actors such as Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, E.G. Marshall, and Ed Begley give good performances and make their characters believable. Without these good performances, it could have been a boring movie with meaningless discussions in the jury room and in the court room. These talented actors bring life to the movies. The movie could edit out 5-10 minutes. It is a classic so it warrants watching. Otherwise, a bit slow. The movie had a predictable outcome.Watch it alone for the performance of it best actor, Henry Fonda.</fullReview>

At first, the cold water is still and transparent, then tiny bubbles begin to form - yet the water is not even warm! It is the air coming out of solution! The bubbles grow larger and rise to the surface. Again, the water is clear, but movement can be detected. There are swirling convection currents forming. The water becomes hot. There is more and more movement, the surface of the water is clearly undulating, and the water is getting hotter. Bubbles again begin to form at the bottom of the pot. They expand and begin to rise, but collapse and disappear. The expansion and collapse of the water vapor creates noise and the pot begins to vibrate. Then traces of water vapor begin to rise from the rolling surface of the water. Finally, the bubbles of water vapor survive the journey to the surface and emerge - releasing steam to the air. How exciting! Somehow, I just knew how everything would turn out - just like watching water boil, or shaking milk (I was around before homogenized milk).I would recommend Andy Warhol's "Empire" to those who like this film. I won't give away the ending, but it's fairly predictable, and a bit longer than watching water boil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least at the lowest common denominator, we're all equal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, let's think about the premise of the first juror's "not guilty" vote. First, he claimed that they at least owe it to the boy to talk about it. That quickly turned into him apologizing for violence and denying the concept of personal responsibility upon which the justice system is based; "he probably did it, but he grew up in tough circumstances and we wouldn't understand because we're white so blah blah etc"; then THAT quickly turned into the assumption that the boy didn't commit murder. That's three different positions right there! Interesting how a hunch so quickly turned into an unfounded bias, which so quickly turned into what we're supposed to believe is an an educated, informed opinion. It's almost as if it was just a bias all along.Well anyway, the rest of the film is of course about the first juror tearing his way through the rest of the ranks of white middle-class suburbia (represented by 11 other men) and teaching them their original sin of privilege all with this wounded tragic facial expression of his. Much wooden dialogue and facial mugging ensues.The logical, unflappable businessman who's close to last in holding onto his guilty verdict is a cipher; he's the calcified rationale of conservative Amerika without any of the genuine bigotry. That he changed his verdict to innocent, leaving only a racist and a man with intense personal baggage on the opposing side, is meant to tell us that only racism or personal issues could account for continuing skepticism at utter stretches like the boy's knife conveniently falling out of his pocket, or someone else conveniently having the same kind of knife.That naturalized European immigrant character waxes poetic about democracy at some point, and if anything demonstrates the mob rule of democracy, it's the climax, where the final man--clinging to his guilty vote because of his complexes and projected father-son issues, of course--is stared into submission. The not-guilty voters pretend to expect a rational argument, but they don't really want or expect one. Their stares are full of piety, it's meant as a "baptism" for the man's white, privileged soul. He sticks to his story, states the facts, and the thinly veiled intimidation continues before he breaks down and is "saved" by his own conscience (an excuse for the filmmakers to avoid fessing up to the fact that if he hadn't compromised, they'd have to brute force him into it, meaning the case would be decided not through the judgement of each juror, but through pressure and coercion).So the immediate bias against the child was, through a litany of sanctimonious white guilt/class guilt scenery-chewing, turned into bias FOR the child--but nevermind that, that particular bias FEELS better, and if anything matters, it's feelings. Not logic or common sense or justice.Oh boy, and then there's that old bigot character. He's transparent in his prejudices, but he falls back on "I even have some (insert minority here) friends who are actually pretty good people! So I'm not REALLY racist!" That trope is still popular with leftists today, because it gives them a way to discredit someone whose unpopular or conservative opinion is not in fact based on prejudice; they can claim the lady doth protest too much and then the opposition has no recourse, because even talking about facts and statistics is assumed to be racially loaded. (Nevermind the fact that race and culture aren't the same thing, and that discouraging critical discourse about tangible attitudes and trends within a minority culture for the sake of racial sensitivity is a kind of racism in itself.) Anyway, when all the jurors started turning their backs in a display of solidarity against his bigotry, I couldn't help it, I laughed my ass off. It's so wooden, obvious and pandering. You know it was an excuse for the entire audience full middle class white people to air out their guilt and cheer--"truly, WE ARE the enlightened ones!" We all know that the boy did it. Any viewer who had been paying attention knows the boy did it; but to the audience in general, "a hispanic boy murdering his father" is a murky abstraction and an excuse to repent for the sin of being white. No wonder the babyboomers elevated this film into the pantheon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sense of Accomplishment?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I thought this film was brilliantly made. The acting was superb and that an entire film could be shot in one set, and that set being a single room devoid of everything besides a table, 12 chairs and 12 men, and still remain riveting from start to finish was astonishing. As a character study it is one of the best.That said, I had a deep problem with this movie. At the end of the day, what was accomplished? They most likely let a murderer walk. And after doing-so, walked-off self-contently back into their everyday lives, having avoided the discomfort of judging one of their peers. Fonda had no reason to feel accomplished. If they were too quick to judge him guilty, they were nearly as quick to judge him innocent. And I understand the time limits involved in concluding this one act play, that doesn't change the betrayal I felt by this self-righteous portrayal of 'justice' being served.The Shaw Shank redemption is very highly ranked here also. A similar vain, heroically casting criminals as victims.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't think this movie should be on the top 250, let alone the top 20.The acting was alright, but as for the plot, there wasn't anything incredible or mind blowing enough to warrant a basically one setting movie.The entire movie revolving around the one scene and circumstance got incredibly repetitive and boring. It seemed simply to me like just a short jury drama with nothing much else to add to it.Even at the end, after the jury switches its opinion completely, there was nothing great. To me, it was just an average boring argument between several people about a minor crime without even later solving the main crime itself.Perhaps this movie was good back then. Right now, it is 2013. And right now, if it was released, it would barely make a dent at the box office. I judge on this movie's entertainment value in the present, and in the present, it does not entertain me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film 12 Angry Men might have been very good cinema for 1957, but in the 21st century it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.The movie wears you down while characters spend more time bickering about bickering than actually going over testimony and evidence. It's like the Blair Witch Project, where the characters act loud and annoying, beating the audience into exhaustion. The characters in 12 Angry Men mostly argue with each other, often screaming, making the resolution more gratifying to the audience. It's a common trick.*begin spoiler alert* Maybe we've gotten spoiled watching too much Monk and CSI and Law &amp; Order, but as a legal drama the movie is confusing anyway. There's no discussion of blood trails or spatters. The defendant claimed there was a hole in his pants, but no pants were reviewed as evidence. Davis introduced a knife he bought as evidence in the jury room, which you can't do. The jury determined that the witness was nearsighted based on her nose. The jury decided a witness was incapable of running based on how he walked. The jury never discussed who else might have committed the murder. The thought-process behind the plot is so convoluted, it makes the whole movie frustrating to watch. *end spoiler alert*The movie is OK for 11 year olds so certainly carries a lot of nostalgic value 60 year olds, but it's flawed and doesn't hold up as a timeless film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>maybe in 1957 the characters in this movie seemed thick and nuanced but having seen this recently for the first time i was struck by how one dimensional each seemed. from the first few minutes of the movie you can easily decipher who's going to be a "bad" guy and who's going to be a bastion of choirboy-like fairness and innocence. maybe given the self contained nature of the plot there is much room for character development but perhaps something a little less like caricatures....the other thing that bothered me about the movie that pays so much attention to method of reason is the fact that early on in the movie it is stated that the knife had been wiped clean before the police got there. but according to witnesses the boy allegedly fled right a way. this seems a bit incongruent and yet no one in the movie has brought it up and no critical review of the movie seems to have brought it up. it would seem to be a major factor in the case and i can't believe it is overlooked. instead it's omission from discussion only makes the whole plot look as thin as the characters.........4 out 10 see it to know that many a critic has been fooled.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be rather boring and predictable. Sidney Lumet always had an agenda in his movie making. Unfortunately he never understood the word subtle. This movie is a prime example of his pretentious, preachy, sledge hammer approach to his message. From the very beginning one could figure out the ending robbing the film of any suspense. The characters were too broadly drawn to be believable especially the role of Lee J. Cobb. Where is the complexity? The explanations of the prosecution's inconsistencies by Fonda strain credulity and would convince no one. If you like the courtroom genre of films try Anatomy of a Murder or Witness for the Prosecution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twelve Angry Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Twelve Angry Men did not interest me as much as I thought it would. I cannot get myself to pay attention to old-fashioned movies, mostly because the older films are in black and white. With this movie being so old, the audio and sound system had very poor quality. I'm so used to listening and watching new movies with such amazing quality, that when I have to watch an old film, I lose interest very quickly. The actors in this film were not good in my opinion. They did not show different emotions to make the acting seem more realistic. Lastly, it was difficult to follow along during the film because the characters had no names. Even though I disliked a lot about the film; there are still a few things I enjoyed about it. One of them being the main idea of the film, I enjoyed the main idea because it was about a crime. Crime stories are one of my favorite genres. An interesting point that I noticed was that the movie and the written play reminded me of philosophy because the jurors would never know the exact answer or what actually happened. It was also brought to my attention of how often the votes changed throughout the film. This showing that there were good points and examples to cause the jurors to change their votes. Lastly, it's interesting that the only action that was given throughout the movie was Juror No. 10's yelling. This review shows what I enjoyed about the film, what I found interesting and lastly what I disliked about the film and written play 'Twelve Angry Men'.</fullReview>

There was no reason for making such movie and moreover no reason to share a place in top 10 list.I can not see even a single positive point about the film except few dialogues..few dialogues were excellent..henry fonda was average but unfortunately sidney lumet nowhere shows the direction which i was expecting from such a good director.just 12 jurors fighting on a murder and the life of the kid was in their hands. 11 were in the favor of GUILTY for the kid, while one was saying the kid on whom the blame was to kill his father was NOT GUILTY and after more than 1 hour of distracting and boring discussion the alone juror who feels the kid was not guilty was successful in changing the mind of other 11 jurors and in the end saved the life of the kid.Watch it on your on sake.. 3.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 12 Quarreling Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Life Is In Their Hands -- Dealth Is On Their Minds!" A tag-line of 12 Angry Men.12 Angry Men had 3 nominations for Oscars and won 13 other awards, but it does not mean that every one will like this movie. While the movie started with the dark and white atmosphere it gave me a tiresome impression. 12 men were just sitting in a room quarreling and sometimes murmuring and muttering. Are movies only providing human acting and talking? Teenagers like me like to have something much exciting, but not sitting dully in a room. Secondly, I wasn't engrossed in the Juror quarreling during the film. I don't think most of you are interested in others' affairs, especially others' conflicts. Also, as the tag-line shows, the life and death of the boy is in their hands, but how about the audience? It seemed that we have already been left out. In addition, Henry Fonda is a good actor, however, when the movie ends, I think everybody would have asked "Is that all?" I still had a hope to see anything unexpectedly broken out before the ending, but what a pity that it did not happen.It may be a great masterpiece to most of people but I hardly have a slight interest on it. My comments might have changed if the 'debate' had an unpredictable result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can anyone say overacting?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie on three occasions. It baffles me how this is considered a classic movie. I'm not going to go into the plot or storyline of this movie other to say it's about a jury deliberation in a murder trial. The premise for the this movie is O.K. but some of the script seems excessive or down right silly; take for example the man who is really upset with his son. He's mad with his own son so he's going to convict this other young man for murder???????? Awwww, but wait; Henry Fonda is here to comfort the guy and to get him to do the right thing. What B.S. Also take a look at the dummy that wants to go to the baseball game. Who acts like this in real life? Now maybe he does want to go to the game and is willing to vote with the majority so he can get going but this would be called a SECRET AGENDA with the emphasis on SECRET. He wouldn't be telling everyone; like I said, who acts like this in real life. The characters in this movie are totally unbelievable and everything is overacted. Just my two cents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I didn't like the choices that the directer made in this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the movie The 12 Angry Man, I didn't like the choices that the director made in the movie. First of all, the actors were overacting and they don't sound and their emotion doesn't look believable. For example, when the juror number 3 was having his moment talking about his kid who he "made the man out of him" by abusing him and later his kid punched him and ran away. His emotions and the way his voice sounded doesn't seem convincing to me. It seems to me like they are just reading their script out loud. Secondly, the camera angle wasn't good. The camera was mostly close up and it was quite boring. You want the audience to look excited or interesting so they will pay more attention to the main points but this movie didn't do that much of a good job. For example, in the jury room, when they were voting one by one, the camera was close up to them that I didn't get to see the reaction on other juror faces when they were voting one by one. I think it will be good to see other juror face and trying to make eye contact with juror to change their vote. Finally, the actor that they chose to play the role of the boy who was abused all his life and is a trouble maker, the actor looks nothing like his character in the play. So there fore I think the choices that the director made in this movie weren't that bright and it could have been better and more interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Liberal Propaganda Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, another Liberal "classic" with Henry Fonda, a true left winger showing all the right wingers where they went wrong!This all-star cast is really a play as the entire thing takes places in a jurors' room where 12 men determine the fate of a suspect charged with murder. Eleven of them vote "guilty" but Fonda holds out for "not guilty." The story is about him slowly convincing everyone else to see things his way. There are lots of familiar faces from the '50s: Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall, Jack Warden, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, etc. They are all interesting.Good for one look. As with most movies with political leanings (this one, All The Kings Men, The Manchurian Candidate, etc.) Hollywood is always ready for re-makes where Liberal causes are far more pronounced than they are in these classic movies. Only in the twisted mind of Liberals are we to have more sympathy for the criminal than the victim. Only in Hollywood are the defense attorneys always the good guys and movies end like this where nobody ever goes to jail!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely a masterpiece. It's bright and simple. Nothing is confusing. The actors are great, the script is great, the directing is great, everything is great. This movie goes to show that you don't need a thousand actors and huge settings to make an excellent picture. All you need is a good story and boy did Sidney Lumet have a good one or what. Fonda is great as the one juror who believes the accused might be innocent or is at least not convinced that he did do it. Lee J. Cobb is equally good as the juror convinced that the boy is guilty and whom Fonda must try to convince that he should try to consider the facts before just believing the D.A.'s word. The 1997 remake was also very good but movie buffs are strongly advised to accept no substitutes. See it at all costs.</fullReview>

The movie should have shown other places, because you get bored in like 5 minute of the same damn room, that you're in for the whole movie. We want to see other places which are more interesting! The actors are mediocre and make their characters seem just like some random person on the street, and not like a spectacular character who is larger than life in some way, and that's just boring ! The script isn't that good, they just talk back and fort and don't seem to get anywhere, everybody could have said what they wanted and been done with it in at least half the time. And let's talk about the ending, you don't even get any closure, you don't even get to know if the boy was the murderer for real! Then what's the point of the whole MOVIE? Where you're trying to find out if he did it or not. All in all, it's a pretty mediocre film, which would have benefited from some better acting at times and not being in black and white.I give this movie a 5/10</fullReview>

I feel robbed of my time and sanity by this experience. I could go on and on, and in fact I will because IMDb apparently requires that I take 10 full lines of text to communicate to you how utterly awful this movie is. How is this considered a great film? Was life really this boring in the 50s? I've always mocked people that enjoy the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but I'll take 9 hours of that over 90 minutes of this excruciatingly boring drivel any day of the week. Let's recap: only one set, no true rising or falling action, no satisfying conclusion, no compelling characters (because none of the characters are developed in depth), no meaningful relationships between characters, no romance, no action, no... anything. Words are inadequate to describe how betrayed I feel be the various friends and reviewers that have recommended this movie to me (and, yes, I am deliberately using the term movie instead of film). Do yourself and America and favor -- rent the copy of this movie from your local Blockbuster and put it in the microwave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe I was forced to endure this movie in a class I took at college. Synopsis: 12 men sit in a room and talk for the ENTIRE movie. It's about as fun as sitting in the doctor's office listening to the chit-chat of other patients. I know it's supposed to be good since it has the noble purpose of pointing out the already obvious fact that some accused people, if the jury does not consider carefully all the evidence, will be wrongly convicted. Also, some of the "evidence" presented to defend the accused is sketchy, at best. It seems too many jurors have taken this movie to heart -- in this country we turn people like O.J. Simpson out on the street.I might have liked to read this as a book, where I could at least dream up my own characters and give them more to do besides sit and talk. The two main characters were also pretty flat; one is your all-enlightened bleeding heart liberal who thinks a crack dealer that has been arrested 42 times will straighten up if given "just one more shot at 'rehab'." The other is the typical conservative loudmouth whose values are rock-solid and self-righteous and he's going to scream louder and louder until you agree with him. This movie isn't suspensful, it's laughable.Rating: 2/10</fullReview>
