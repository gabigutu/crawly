		<shortDescription>How terrible is wisdom...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... when it brings no profit to the wise? On the surface, that seems to be the moral of "Angel Heart." But look a little deeper -- the fact is, Harry Angel knew the truth all along, and here's the true moral:"However cleverly you sneak up on a mirror... your reflection always looks you straight in the eye."Much of the meaning in this dark tale lies in the above line uttered by DeNiro's character, Louis Cyphre. We can pretend to lie to ourselves and bury our heads in the sand, but in the end we know. And it isn't the knowing that hurts us, but all the hiding and lying that went on before.This film has been summed up many times before, so I won't do it again. It's also been said that the film was ahead of its time in 1987, and IMO this can't be emphasized enough. There's no doubt in my mind that it's been an influence on many a filmmaker and screenwriter. Among films of this type it's easier to follow than, say, "Memento," but more befuddled and confusing than "The Sixth Sense." You may or may not guess the ending, but if you're the type who's bothered by confusing movies -- simply read all the spoilers or the whole screenplay, THEN see the film! I guarantee you won't enjoy it any less for knowing.Cinematography 10/10, screenplay 7/10, acting 9.5/10, overall I'd give it about a 9/10. If anything makes this movie great (and qualifies it as a classic) it's the cinematography and atmosphere. It really is richly and gorgeously shot, and atmospheric to the nth degree. Watch it on a slow day when you have time to savor these things and aren't overly anxious to figure it out or discover the resolution to the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was stunned at what this film did to me. An absolutely brilliant display of psychological horror. Alan Parker made the scariest film of the eighties, maybe the scariest film of the second half of the century with this picture. The hell with "Psycho", "Angel Heart" is where it's at if you want horror.I don't know how Parker hasn't become the Hitchcock of his generation after this film. I know some of his other work - "Evita" and Mississippi Burning" are two films of his that I happen to think are pretty good. But they're nothing like this. What Parker does so well here, what he seems to get better than any other director I've noticed since this film was made, is how atmosphere makes a movie. He has a real sense of place and time that's a key component to making the terror of this movie real.Aside from Parker's talents, there are three performances without which the movie just wouldn't work.Robert de Niro gives the second best performance of his career here, right next to "Raging Bull", and even that's pretty close. I'm not even normally a huge fan of de Niro's - I mean, don't get me wrong, he's a legend, but I find most of the time that I'm less impressed with him than most people are. Not here. In this movie, de Niro makes the simple act of eating an egg into a treatise on mortal dread. He should have received the Oscar for this performance, no question about it.Lisa Bonet - what happened to her? Every couple of years I'll see her in something like this or "High Fidelity", and she's got all this charisma - she really is a superb actress. What she does here is really interesting because you can see that it's very underdone, a lot of subtlety. Which is a strange way to go if you're playing a voodoo priestess. But she's very vulnerable here. I think it's a shame she didn't become the star she could have. I'd love to see more work from her.Mickey Rourke is another resident of the "Where are they now?" file. I've heard more from him recently though. He's been making a comeback of sorts. He's actually the primary reason I rented this movie, because I saw him in Sean Penn's "The Pledge" and wanted to see more of his stuff. He's the third performance that makes this movie complete, and he's the one who really has the hardest job, who has to strap it to his back and get it across the finish line. His is also the most important job, because he needs to instill the terror in you. It's through his eyes that you witness these bizarre events, and it's his reaction that makes it all the more terrifying.Again, brilliant. Can't say enough about it. The last thirty seconds or so kind of sucks (those of you who've seen it know what I'm referring to), but I can just turn it off before that. Oddly, it doesn't ruin what's come before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alan Parker's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angel Heart" deserves to be considered Alan Parker's masterpiece. The direction is truly amazing, as Parker drives us deeply through a meticulously prepared dark atmosphere, full of allegories and secret hints.In "Angel Heart", we watch Mickey Rourke in his finest acting hour, who plays Harry Angel, a private investigator hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphre, depicted by the great Robert De Niro. Cyphre assigns Angel the task to find a guy named Johnny Favorite who has disappeared, with whom he has unsettled debts. The task is much harder than it first looks however, as Angel bumps into several murders in the process; and as if that were not enough, the quest makes him realize some very unpleasant truths about himself and Mr. Cyphre.As noted before, both Rourke and De Niro are excellent in their roles; a high mark goes for the rest of the cast as well, with Lisa Bonnet standing out as charming and apocryphal Epiphany Proudfoot. Yet, the 10/10 mark for this film is definitely credited to Alan Parker's direction: It is his masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not in the least surprised that other reviewers either love this or hate it to bits - I also bet that it's the younger users to whom the nature of the visual narrative of the film - the way it's all told to us, the viewer - may seem a bit dated. And to a point, they're right - "Angel Heart" is totally an eighties film, a film of the decade in which the movie world was discovering a new visual language in video and playfully indulged in experimenting with its new toy. It was literally speaking to a generation straight out of MTV classrooms and workshops and is in that sense very similar to stuff like "Betty Blue". And true enough, there is a lot to remark on what can today be seen as a slightly poseur-ish "one too many revolving fans, angularly lit staircases and heartbeat sounds in the soundtrack" kind of thing. However, "Angel Heart" does carry a tremendous amount of energy thanks to its imagery, which will stick to the viewer's mind in exactly the same way a sweaty shirt sticks to the body in sticky weather. Besides, the impeccably drawn cast led by Rourke does a truly remarkable job - that's beyond question - the sets are great, production design and cinematography are very evocative, the soundtrack is memorable and the story is one of the crucial ones. I personally love it.Give it a go by all means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, thought-provoking/smart, well-acted and brilliantly photographed and directed -- what more could you ask for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angel Heart is a winding psychological thriller that -- in 1987 -- was far ahead of its time. So far that audiences didn't `get it' and the film bombed at the box office. Only now are we beginning to see endings like this one surface in horror movies. Had Angel Heart been made a decade or so later, perhaps it would have succeeded.As it is, the movie ? which has a strong cult following and was recently re-released on a Special Edition DVD ? is nothing short of mesmerizing. I wouldn't go so far as to call it great, or a `masterpiece,' but it is scary, disturbing, influential, thought-provoking, and a lot smarter and more atmospheric than 99% of the rip-off horror movies being made today.It stars Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel, a private eye from Brooklyn in the 1950s who is hired by Louis Cyphere (Robert De Niro) to locate a mysterious singer named Johnny Favorite, who disappeared in the early ?40s and hasn't been seen since.Angel's journey takes him from the streets of New York to jazz clubs in Harlem and, finally, to the sweltering swamps of Louisiana. He meets a variety of characters, all of who have little to say about Favorite. All we seem to know is that he was a singer, entered the war, and was shot, had his face reconstructed, was taken out of hospital care, and apparently vanished from the face of the earth.I guessed the twist of the movie about seven minutes in, as soon as Robert De Niro appeared on screen during an extended cameo. But that's not to say that the movie won't affect you. Notorious when released for some controversial scenes (including a sequence involving Rourke and The Cosby Show's Lisa Bonet), the movie's moody atmosphere is its strongest element.The acting, too, is very strong. This is Rourke's finest performance, as Harry Angel, a scumbag detective with nothing to lose. On the new DVD, Rourke claims he wasn't very interested in acting at the time, and as a result `just showed up' and `memorized the lines.' I find that hard to believe ? Rourke's acting here is Oscar-worthy. His recent descent into self-loathing has caused his career to fall apart (he was never enthusiastic about acting and wanted to become a boxer instead); he shouldn't discredit his earlier work merely because he's upset with his life.The role of Louis Cyphere (get it?) is also one of De Niro's most ambitious performances; he delves entirely into character and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer.It was directed by (Sir) Alan Parker, the famous British filmmaker (of, among others, Midnight Express). Some say this is his finest film ? wonderfully crafted, beautifully shot, masterfully edited ? and I'd have to say that if it isn't his best, it certainly ranks somewhere at the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I recently blew the dust off of my copy and watched it again?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And I can't believe I never threw my two cents in about this one. When I first saw Angel Heart, I thought it was going to be your regular old mystery. Like a Mamet or Spillane yarn about a down on his luck private investigator drawn into a web of lies and deceit? Oh yeah, it IS like that? and then some. I was completely drawn into this movie. I found it perfectly paced. And just like other movies of this type, could not see the end coming at all. However from the beginning it felt like something was kind of different about THIS yarn. I couldn't quite put my finger on it. Kind of like the feeling you get as your walking out of the house and you just know you forgot something but you can't remember what. It was like that, a ?nagging at the back of your brain' feeling. And then, oh boy! When all is revealed you wish you would have just left without what ever it was you were missing, ?cause what you find is oh-so frightening. What a terribly wonderful story and what great direction. I can't think of anybody better that De Niro for the roll he played. If you own it: watch in again. If you haven't seen it, you must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do not go much for that Parker kind of stuff("Midnight express" ,albeit technically breathtaking was a little racist,"Shoot the moon" was a big bore,and you've got to be into Pink Floyd to appreciate such a work as "the wall")"Angel Heart " is a different matter,because it deals with the horror and fantasy genre.Against all odds,for someone who had never tackled this difficult genre,Parker succeeded magnificently.The screenplay is first-rate,with a strong story,with an ending you'll never guess (and I will not reveal it of course!)Including drugs,voodoo,sabbath ,intense love scenes,featuring a wonderful cast:Rourke,who had never been better (and never would)and a frighteningly deadpan DeNiro cast as Louis Cipher,this movie takes us along in a meandering,labyrinthine investigation in which private detective Rourke will find so dreadful things he won't escape unharmed. The supporting cast is excellent:Charlotte Rampling stays only a few minutes on the screen ,and yet,we remember her and her tea.The same goes for the junkie doctor.I'd tone it for one thing:the elevator scene might have been borrowed from an old French movie,"Huis clos",directed by Jacqueline Audry,from Jean-Paul Sartre's play(1956).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the creepiest thrillers ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Angel(Mickey Rourke) is a sleazy private detective in 1955 New York. One day, Harry is approached by a mysterious lawyer named Louis Cyphre(Robert De Niro). Louis also has unusually long fingernails and needs help in searching for a former client of his who disappeared mysteriously without ever paying him back. So Harry begins his investigation which takes him from the dark alleys and streets of New York to the hot, musty bayous of Louisiana. While there, he meets up with Epiphany Proudfoot(Lisa Bonet) who is a voodoo priestess and soon enough Harry becomes caught up in voodoo mysticism.This is the first movie directed by Alan Parker that I've seen and is also the movie that introduced me to Mickey Rourke. The movie has a really dark atmosphere and I really like the heartbeat on the soundtrack that helps to build the tension. "Angel Heart" ranks up there with those really twisted supernatural thrillers like "The Sixth Sense" and "Jacob's Ladder". Why this movie hasn't gotten much attention over the last fourteen years I'll never know. What really makes this movie good is probably its 1950s setting which gives "Angel Heart" some originality. The film's ending just gives me the creeps because it just comes at you from out of no where and there is nothing that hints it. Viewers should also be cautioned when watching "Angel Heart" because it is extremely bloody and then of course there is that love scene between Mickey Rourke and Lisa Bonet which stirred up a little bit of controversy when it was first released back in 1987. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, complex and depressing...an outstanding film!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good supernatural thrillers with the incarnation of Satan himself as a pivot figure?.we don't see enough of these films, if you ask me. Alan Parker's `Angel Heart' is one of the chosen few! Complex and confusing at times, but warmly recommended to fans of the occult and mysterious cinema. Mickey Rourke shines as protagonist Harry Angel. An unshaved, chain-smoking private eye with a chicken-phobia! The year is 1955 and the place is Brooklyn when Harry is hired by a malevolent Mr. Louis Cyphre (pronounce this name aloud a few times in a row) to find a missing crooner, who got severely traumatized in the war. The money is good and the job doesn't seem that risky, so Harry accepts. Pretty soon, the search takes him to all kinds of poverty, human misery, superstition and alternate religions. Every important figure in the search for Johnny Favorite (the crooner) finds a violent death after Harry talked to them and, apparently, our private detective is a lot more involved than he initially thought. As mentioned before, Angel Heart is a darn complex and very coherent film. One viewing is enough to understand the entire premise and main storylines, but a second (third or fourth) viewing sure isn't redundant. It would be a shame if any of the carefully worked out details and character-connections would go unnoticed. `Angel Heart' (and especially cinematographer Michael Seresin) also receives a huge plus for the dark and depressing portrayal of the film's surrounding. Angel Heart looks unattractive, vile and ominous which creates a superb horrific atmosphere. The supernatural aspects about the story are a bit overly stressed by clichés like silent and staring nuns or foggy New York suburbs. But this small negative element is largely made up by the subtle violence and compelling mystery this film features. The acting is outstanding with Rourke at the absolute top of his career. During the second half of the 80's, Mickey was the unforgettable star of several brilliant films such as `Barfly', `Year of the Dragon', `Nine ? Weeks' and of course this `Angel Heart'. Robert DeNiro as Louis Cyphre was a downright brilliant casting idea! There isn't that much De Niro content in this film but, when he's on screen, evilness nearly drips from the screen. Bobby De Niro is probably one of the only actors who can make it look eerie to eat an egg! Lisa Bonet, in conclusion, isn't the world's most talented actress but Angel Heart sure is her best film. All in one, Angel Heart is a very good film that'll be appreciated by thriller fans and the admirer of slightly more intelligent horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DVD Transfer Enhances This Sordid-But-Intriguing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very sordid film. I usually don't go for that sort of thing, but there are a lot of other good things about this movie that made me add this to my collection.There is very good cinematography and camera-work in here, made even better by the special edition DVD transfer. I liked the old film-noir type atmosphere in the story, which is an interesting one overall.There are no really good-guy characters in this film. Mickey Rourke plays the star of the movie: private eye "Harry Angel." He's somewhat of a low-life but so is everyone else. Lisa Bonet looks spectacular and has a steamy sex scene in here. Robert De Niro gets big billing but he doesn't have that many lines in this film.The ending of this movie has a very unique twist to it, but it's certainly not a satisfying ending. It is one I should go back over after the next viewing and check for credibility. That's all I can say without using spoilers.Overall, a sleazy but very intriguing story, with great atmosphere, that I enjoy watching every five years or so. Some would call this movie a modern-day "film noir."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"HOW TERRIBLE IS WISDOM WHEN IT BRINGS NO PROPHET TO THE WISE"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A masterpiece, set in 1955. Mickey Rourke gives an absolutely flawless performance. Robert De Niro is perfectly cast in his role and as always he gives an exemplary performance. Lisa Bonet only got her role because she agreed to show her breasts in the movie. The director took full advantage of this, by building up to Bonet's bosoms eventual exposure. First, we see Lisa wearing a wet white singlet, with her nipples erect. Later, we see one breast exposed during Lisa's wild black mamba ritual dance. Then a little later on, we see both breasts exposed during Lisa's erotic love scene. In the mid 80's Lisa Bonet was the innocent daughter on the popular tv sitcom, The Cosby Show. She took the part in Angel Heart in an attempt to shed her innocent tv persona. It worked but her performance in the film is adequate at best. Upon Angel Hearts release in 1987, Bill Cosby spoke publicly about his outrage with Lisa's decision to show her chocolate buttons on film. However, the only thing Bill's media attention generated, were more ticket sales for the movie.*************SPOILERS***************Through a black magic ritual, a man sells his soul to the devil in return for stardom and he becomes a famous musician called Johnny Favourite{Mickey Rourke}.Johnny Favourite, then, cheats the devil by kidnapping a soldier, celebrating in Times Square, having just returned home from the war. Through another black magic ritual, Johnny kills the soldier, whose name is Harry Angel, and takes over his identity, thus cheating the devil out of their contract.Harry Angel is then drafted back to the war, returning a short time later with terrible facial injuries and memory loss.One night, while in hospital, Harry Angel is secretly taken away by his wife and rich father in law, both of whom were accomplices in his scam to cheat the devil.The father in law pays a doctor $25,000 to forge documents stating that Harry Angel is a permanent patient in the hospital.With his new face still bandaged and having been dressed into a military uniform, Harry is dumped in Times Square which is once again welcoming home troops.His wife and father in law perform a disappearing act and the drugged Harry awakens, removes his facial bandages and assumes he has just returned home from the war, his damaged memory unable to recollect any event preceding his arrival in Times Square.Twelve years later, Harry Angel is a "dodgy" private investigator, when a mysterious man, named Louis Cyphre{Robert De Niro} shows up with a job for Harry. The high paying job is for Harry to locate the whereabouts of Johnny Favourite or at the very least discover if Johnny is alive or dead. Harry accepts the job, completely unaware of the truth and of the horror that awaits him.Lousi Cyphre{pronounced Lucifer} is the devil and he has come to collect an old debt. The soul of Harry Angel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Matures with age and grows on audiences and film connoisseurs alike!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad I caught this because what was seen by many as a poor film in 1987 can only be seen as great film in 2007. Angel Heart is one of those films that matures with age and grows on audiences and film connoisseurs alike. A psychological horror/thriller is one of the hardest genres for a director to prosper in but if you were to mix in spiritual and religious elements along with a heap of film noir, a touch of romance and a smidgen of jazz then you would set yourself a near impossible task, nevertheless it would be a task in which Alan Parker would succeed.The direction of this film is masterful as Parker engages us through a meticulous atmosphere littered with mysterious allegories, gut rendering paranoia and an unmatched sense of place. This unmatched sense of place is a symptom of his stark imagery and sombre lighting which is played out through an amalgamation of film noir and the focal iconography of 50s and 60s French New Wave (the use of elevators, ceiling fans, staircases etc).For many of these reasons and more Angel Heart is a very influential film and its inspirations can be seen in many of the psychological thrillers/horrors released in the past 20 years, it is thought provoking and at times a lot more disturbing than any of its genre equivalents. The multi-faceted love scene in the film is one such example, it plays very well as it is cleverly interspersed with a host demonic echelons which (given its style and narrative position) I believe to be unparallelled, even in contemporary cinema.Overall Angel Heart is a very well paced and well acted film ? although initially I felt that having Mickey Rourke in the lead role was a poor choice (based on his more recent work) but clearly he was at his acting best in his younger days almost Oscar-worthy, Robert De Niro is also on form as is the young Lisa Bonet ? but these performances combined with everything else make Angel Heart a film that will stick with you, not as much as Midnight Express or Mississippi Burning (dir. Alan Parker), but enough to make you ponder why this film wasn't so successful upon its initial release and enough to curse why he didn't spend more time dabbling in the psychological/horror genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER I think everybody has covered this film well in general, I just want to point out one thing from an esoteric point of view: The Devil knows the truth about Harry Angel. He knows it from the beginning, but the problem he has is that Harry doesn't know it. He sets Harry the tasks of finding the missing singer already knowing what Harry may find and counting on it.In esoteric lore, you cannot actually sell your soul to the devil because you don't own your soul, it is a part of the highest god level. You can only think you sell your soul to the devil and go through with whatever deal you think you have. If you don't know you have a deal, you cannot be asked to pay.That is why the deception to get out of the deal with the devil worked. Johnny Favorite didn't know anything about Harry Angel or vice Versa. The devil wants paid and if you watch the scenes where Robert De Nero hires Mickey Roarke's character, Cypher alternately seems amused or full of hatred for this man sitting before him who cheated him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have often said that horror is the most difficult to master. I believe this to be true because although it seems any moron with a camera can stalk a would be victim and try to psyche the audience out by shaking a few trees, then flagitiously embellish the film with blood instead of atmosphere, true fear is difficult to capture on film. I think we have all seen films that lay it on pretty thick but ultimately fail. I truly believe you can hire someone to make a dummy and stuff it with blood and even some rudimentary designs of intestines and hearts and various other functioning organs that have the ability to make the squeamish cover their eyes. But if you remember some of the greats, some of the icons of the trade, you will see that a good horror film is more about minacious shadows, the vicissitudes of lights, the ominous and foreboding music and finally the brilliant sagaciousness of the story. I think many people overlook the relevance of a story in the horror movie genre. Many inferior films like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Idle Hands and such will present us with a half-assed story and then try to build on it by bombastically insulting us with the banalities of gore and other not so shocking elements. But what they forget is most horror films that either succeed or develop a cult following are films that somewhere along the way hit a nerve in the collective mindset of their viewers. Friday the 13th's attack the very foundation of one of adolescent's unadulterated joys, that being camping. Halloween invaded our trick or treaters and Nightmare On Elm Street surreptitiously alienated our dreams. In short, we were not safe from these abominations on any front. Angel Heart follows that trend.Spoilers Ahead... if you have not seen this film, do not read from here on out.The basic premise of Angel Heart is a detective story at heart. This is a 40's style film noir complete with rain soaked streets, seedy detectives and lots of questionable characters. We meet Harry Angel ( Roarke) as he is taking a phone call from a stranger. This stranger is from the law firm Winesap and MacIntosh ( any similarities here? think about it). They would like to meet with him as they have a client that is familiar with his work. The client's name is Monsieur Louis Cypher."Is your client foreign? Is he a foreign gentleman?"Harry then travels to a church ( strange enough place to meet a client who wants to hire a detective) where he enters the room and is first greeted by Winesap (who looks a lot like Stephen Tobolwolski), and then he sees his client. But what we see first is long, perfectly manicured finger nails, a strange cane, a ring that has either the star of David in the middle of it or a strange cult like pointed symbol, you decide. Also, the client's hair is put up in a bun and the man dressed impeccably. The man does not rise to shake Harry's hand. But he smiles with a diabolical, factitious grin that seems warm and inviting but reeks with deceit.Harry then gets the facts of the case and is told that he will be searching for a crooner that owed Louis some money but disappeared during the war. So in essence, all Louis wants from Harry is to find out if this crooner is alive or dead. Cypher offers him a lot of money to find the guy and so Harry accepts."You must want this guy pretty bad," Harry says with a chuckle."I don't like messy accounts," Cypher replies dead-seriously.And then just before the meeting concludes, Louis says to Harry,"I've got a funny feeling we've met before." Harry has no recollection of ever meeting the man, and he would remember seeing how Cypher sticks out like a sore thumb.From here Harry goes on a labyrinthine journey to find out what happened to this crooner. It takes him from Coney Island to New Orleans. And along the way, dead bodies begin to show up. First he interviews a doctor that had something to do with the case. He shows up dead in the next scene. Next we see an old guitar player named Toot Sweet and then he shows up dead, "strangled with a part of the body meant for pissing with." Now Harry is a suspect in two murders and it just keeps getting worse.Every 20 minutes Louis Cypher shows up to check on his progress. And every time he does, more strange religion seems to get introduced to the plot. This French gentleman is obviously a fanatical, devout, religious iconoclast. He is not just seeking this missing person for personal accounts, it seems more like a reckoning. And the further Harry gets into the mystery, the more liable he is to be implicated in things that he had nothing to do with. To make matters worse, Cypher tells him that he has old fashioned and bucolic ideas about justice, "You know, an eye for an eye, that sort of thing." Finally Harry, in desperation, asks him in one of their sittings, "Who the @^&amp;* are you Cypher?" Cypher's reply, "Watch your language, this is a church."By now the film has us both intrigued with it's eccentric and neurotic characters, and confused in some ways by the abstruse manner in which the story is unfolding. This apparent confusion is by design, because this film takes pride in laying the foundation out for us but not the glue. We have to use our heads to figure things out and that is rare in many films, especially the horror genre. That may sound contradictory to what we are all lead to believe about most horror, but it is true. Horror, true horror has gone the way of the do-do bird. It is all but extinct. Angel Heart however, is more of a heterodoxy than one might think. It takes all that is good with the genre and makes it even better. Every scene in this film seems to quietly show us another piece to the puzzle. Every twist and turn seems to unravel the story like the layers of an onion. Without giving away the plot and the secrets to the film, here are a few scenes to digest and think about.Take for instance the not so subliminal use fans in the film. Every time Louis Cypher is in the room, fans are first shown. This is relevant in some scenes because of the heat, but what about on a cold blustery day in the Bronx?Also examine some of the intriguing lines that slither out of DeNiro's mouth. Lines like, "They say there is just enough religion in the world to make man hate one another, but not enough to make them love." Or: "Would you like an egg Mr. Angel?" After Harry says no, Cypher replies, "you know, they say the egg represents the soul." He then bites into the egg and chews it with perfect equanimity. You can never tell if Cypher is mad or satisfied. All we know is this man is here to find a missing person. Some of the time he cracks a smile but what he is really smiling about is just somewhere underneath the surface.There are also a few times when Harry catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror but he sees two images of himself, the mirror is cracked or split or mangled in some way. And he always looks pensive and confused when he looks into the mirror as though he sees something.... but then forgets it.We are also privy to scenes that are ripe with contradictions. Bullets are stored in a Bible, a nun is cleaning blood off the wall, a priest wants to drive in a Rolls Royce, a heart is cut out, almost like a butcher did it and took pride in his work and a few other images that confuse yet enlighten you at the same time. Angel Heart is the true working of a paradox in progress.The climax of Angel Heart is one that will have you shell shocked. I wasn't prepared for it when I saw this film as a 17 year-old and even now when I am pushing 30 and have seen the film over 100 times, I am still in awe when I watch Harry and Louis banter about as Louis tells him of his ultimate fate."Alas. How terrible is wisdom when it brings no profit to the wise Johnny.""My name's not Johnny.""I know who I am. Cypher I know who I am!"When all is about to be revealed, Louis tells Johnny to take a good look in the mirror because no matter how cleverly you sneak up on a mirror, you reflection always looks you straight in the eye. And when he does, all that we didn't know but may have suspected, is now revealed to us.Angel Heart is not the type of horror film that will scare you every five minutes with ghosts that bounce balls down stairs or with pumpkin candles that flicker coyly enough to see a shadow float across the ceiling. But what it will do is turn your insides upside down with the promise that something pernicious and final is about to take place. Angel Heart is opulent with undertones of doom and sumptuous with forbidden overtones. Just as Blair Witch attacked us with what could be there, Angel Heart admonishes us to stay away from things that should not be there. Harry Angel has entered into an inchoate project and it is one that he will wish he never sought out in the first place.This is one of the best films I have ever seen, and along with Halloween and Jaws, not only does this film rank highly on the horror charts, it cross polinates into the top films ever made. I am not sure where I would put this film because to compare a film like JFK and Raiders of the Lost Ark with an atmospheric, spine tingling film like this is like comparing a top of the line BMW to a top of the line Jaguar. Where do you start and how do you stipulate which is better. All I know is that this film made me fear what it warns us about. And it made me interested to read the Bible again. That has to count for something. After all, the Bible is filled with stories of fire, brimstone, people turning to stone and burning bushes and deceit and betrayal. Sounds like fun, doesn't it?10 out of 10-- This is the epitome of horror and if you have not seen this film, I urge you to find it and watch it this weekend. Mickey Roarke and Robert Deniro are priceless and keep in mind, this is brought to you by the same team that gave us films like T-2, First Blood and Basic Instinct. This was a different kind of film for Kassar and Vajna and I am thankful they decided to take a chance on a dark film like this. Add Alan Parker to this brilliant behind the scenes team and you have all the ingredients for one hell of a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sublimely powerful, menacing and brooding film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many fine reviews of this film and so good to see that the appreciation of what makes it great, runs so deep.It creates a fantastic atmosphere, I never lived in NY in the 50's but I did in this film.It generates intense visceral fear without the need for gratuitous violence or gore.It has great performances from De Niro, Rourke and Bonet. Sublime portrayals of sinister brooding evil, edgy sleazy guilt, and powerful yet vulnerable beauty, respectively.The plot, and the tension, build relentlessly to the cataclysmic ending with (for my money) the greatest piece of cinematic imagery I have ever seen. In keeping with the film it is understated, and IMO devastatingly chilling.If other reviewers haven't mentioned it then I would like to encourage fans of this film to read William Hjortsberg's Fallen Angel on which the film was based.Its a great book and despite the fact that, having watched the film, you know the ending it still slams into you like a steam train.Great book, great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1955, in New York, the smalltime private detective Harold Angel (Mickey Rourke) is summoned by the attorney Herman Winesap (Dann Florek) to meet his client Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro). Angel learns that a popular pre-war crooner, Johnny Favorite, had a contract with Cypher and vanished; Cypher offers a large amount for him to seek out Johnny. Angel heads to a clinic where Johnny was last seen and visits the addicted Dr. Albert Fowler (Michael Higgins), who tells that Johnny was shot in the face and arrived in the clinic with amnesia and dysfunctional. One day, a man and his daughter took Johnny with them and he was paid to forge the records. When Angel visits Dr. Fowler again, he finds him dead. Then he visits Johnny's former lover Margaret Krusemark (Charlotte Rampling) expecting to find the location of Johnny and later the woman is murdered. Then he visits the musician and former partner of Johnny, Toots Sweet (Brownie McGhee), and the man is killed immediately after. Angel leaves a blood trail behind, but when he meets Margaret's father Ethan Krusemark (Stocker Fontelieu), he finds the doomed fate of Johnny Favorite. "Angel Heart" is a classy, dark and creepy horror movie by Alan Parker, with a scary Robert De Niro in the role of Lucifer and Mickey Rourke in the top of his career. This is one of my favorite movies ever and I had seen it at least three times before today, last time on 14 October 2001.The explanation about the fate of Johnny Favorite is quite confused and many viewers do not understand what happened to the crooner. In order to understand, there are two capital moments in the story: when Angel talks to Dr. Fowler and to Mr. Krusemark. Spoilers ahead:My understanding is that Johnny conjured Lucifer and made a pact to become famous; in return, he would deliver his soul to the devil. The also Satanist Mr. Krusemark is impressed with Johnny and introduces his daughter, who also worships the devil, to him. Margaret and Johnny become lovers and find a means to lure Lucifer in a black book. Johnny and Toots kidnap the soldier Harold Angel in the Times Square and Johnny sacrifices him in a ritual and assumes his identity. He delivers his identification to Margaret inside a jar but he is summoned to fight in the war. He is shot in the face and arrives in the clinic where Dr. Fowler works with amnesia and dysfunctional. Margaret has never had the chance to see his new face since he is covered by bandages. Margaret and her father remove Johnny from the clinic and leave him alone in the Times Square, expecting that he recovers his memory by himself. Years later, they assume that Johnny has died. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): "Coraç?o Satânico" ("Satanic Heart")Note: On 27 December 2014, I saw this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Creepy Thriller With Some Good Twists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angel Heart" is a dark thriller that begins very conventionally when a private detective is employed to undertake, what seems to be, a routine missing persons case. This is misleading, however, as the investigation is soon characterised by a series of dead-ends, bizarre murders and strange encounters with the supernatural that give rise to the types of tension, violence and shocks which continue to be present at various points throughout the entire movie. The plot is thoroughly absorbing, offbeat and full of surprises and the quantity of blood on view is absolutely extraordinary.Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is an unkempt, small-time, private detective who's hired by the immaculate but rather mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to trace the whereabouts of a crooner called Johnny Favorite who'd achieved some success in the period just before World War 11. Favorite had suffered serious injuries during his time in North Africa where he'd been entertaining the troops and had spent time in a mental hospital near Poughkeepsie where it's believed that, after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, he'd been treated for shell shock. Cyphre had helped Favorite to launch his career and wanted to know if he was still alive because there were some clauses in his contract that remained unfulfilled.Angel soon discovers that something irregular had happened 12 years earlier (in December 1943) when he traces a clearly falsified document relating to Favorite's apparent transfer to another hospital and then discovers the body of the doctor responsible who'd just been brutally murdered. Spooked by this experience, Angel decides that it's unsafe to continue with the case but after Cyphre increases his fee, he agrees to carry on.His further investigations bring him into contact with a sophisticated fortune teller called Margaret Krusemark (Charlotte Rampling), the daughter of one of Favorite's secret lovers, Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) and a blues guitarist called Toots Sweet (Brownie McGhee) who'd previously worked in a band with Favorite. All three are distinctly unhelpful and the gruesome events that take place following his contact with them have a powerful effect on Angel who's sharply aware that he's steadily unravelling but can't do anything to improve his predicament. Alarmingly, things get even worse for him when the reasons for his involvement in this dangerous and seemingly intractable case are finally revealed.Some of the content in "Angel Heart" is shocking and controversial but its greatest quality is the unsettling atmosphere that's present from start to finish. The dark street scene that opens the film sets a sinister tone and everything that follows from the eccentricities of Cyphre to the sounds of the descending steel elevators continues to suggest a lurking threat. This creepiness is further emphasised by the use of drained colours, high camera angles and views of a spiral staircase that work together brilliantly to create a sense of continuing unease.In a tremendous performance, Mickey Rourke inhabits his role so fully that he's utterly convincing as he portrays the difficult changes that Angel goes through and Robert De Niro also makes the most of the scope that Cyphre's character provides. "Angel Heart" has a haunting quality that makes repeat viewings irresistible and enough twists to ensure that such experiences are both rewarding and enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rourke's finest role in an atmospheric classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>P.I Harry Angel has a new case, to find a man called Johnny Favourite, only it isn't a straight forward missing person's case. Prefect, grounded, Alan's Parker's voodoo-laden, hard-boiled film is the ultimate mystery film.This is without a doubt Mickey Rourke's finest role. The supporting cast deliver some of the most interesting and story driven performances which include Robert De Niro, Lisa Bonet and Charlotte Rampling to name a few.You can feel 1955's New Orleans warm rain, hear the jazz, taste the grit of 1950's Brooklyn, Michael Seresin's cinematography is amazing. The films realism captures the time wholly, Trevor Jones mystery music builds up the tension as murders increase and Harry Angel is drawn into eventful dangerous meetings. The dialogue is flawless and the ending has a mind-blowing twist that has been imitated but never surpassed. The Johnny Favourite theme tune will linger with you long after the end credits.A timeless, eerie and realistic atmospheric classic. Perfect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Here comes Mr Jordan - or Trans - Stygian equivalent..................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A couple of nights back I saw Mickey Rourke interviewed on TV by Piers Morgan.Mr Morgan's essential English politeness and unwillingness to offend actually brought rather more out of Mr Rourke than a more direct in your face approach might have done.Mr Rourke's slightly bizarre appearance - the result of some ill - judged cosmetic surgery - was completed by his sporting that absolute adjunct of 1980's celebrity the pony tail as he shambled into his favourite New York bar to answer,or in many cases not to answer,Mr Morgan's courteously put questions. In respect of his early experiences in the Actors' Studio Mr Rourke was open enough,but it became clear that,further down the line in his career, having got what he wanted he no longer wanted it,so to speak.His ill - advised political comments about "A prayer for the dying" alienated most of his large British audience,and he has been "forgotten but not gone" cinematically speaking for many years here in the UK.Prior to Morgan's interview I last saw Mr Rourke on the small screen he was apparently coked to the eyeballs at the Cannes Film Festival,unable to string two sentences together.He had obviously made a tremendous effort to get his life back on track,which is good news both for him personally and for admirers of his peculiar intense but internalised style of acting. This reached its height in "Angel Heart",a splendid Alan Parker movie which looks deeply into the question "Do you really know who you are?" Starting within the conventions of the 1940-1950s Private Eye pictures it neatly changes between genres as it progresses.Mr R.de Niro plays The Devil incarnate on earth to claim a soul long past its sell - by date. He hires P.I. Mr Rourke to assist him with the task which he completes only too successfully. Whatever shortcomings "Angel Heart" may have in the logic department,they are more than compensated for by the performances and the ambiance.Mr Parker directs with gusto and a fine eye for detail. Mr Rourke is so good that one can only speculate that had his career not hit the bumpers early on,Mr Bruce Willis might not have cornered the market in the dirty vest and glistening torso segment. Now he's grown - up,perhaps his gruff geniality will mark a return to a new era of real men in Hollywood.I feel that the "New" men have had their chance and missed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am told that people didn't like this film because it was hard to understand. If I told you the ending, you would not suffer a bit and could still enjoy this film immensely, but I won't spoil it.It is a deep and dark film, set in 1955 in Harlem and New Orleans. Cheap detectives, voodoo, murder, sex, racism - it's all there to add to the mystery.It is a mystery - a missing person case - where our hero, the two-bit detective (Mickey Rourke) goes looking for a man who has been missing for 12 years. His work takes him to New Orleans, where he gets involved with voodoo and Lisa Bonet ("The Cosby Show") in her film debut. And, what a debut it was, as she and Rourke gave us a scene that had all the appearance of reality.The film also features Charlotte Rampling, who, while not giving us the show she did in The Night Porter, nevertheless provides a treat as she lies dead with her heart cut out.And, we wouldn't want to leave out Elizabeth Whitcraft (Goodfellas, Working Girl) who gave the most skintastic performance of her career.But, the real credit for the film goes to Robert De Niro, who plays a greasy looking character that hired Rourke, and provided the twisted ending that makes this film a horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Angel, a low-rent private detective, has been hired by Louis Cyphre to track down a man with whom he has some sort of contract. The investigation leads Harry from person to person, from New York to New Orleans, through many dark twists and turns. As he goes deeper into the case, he gets pulled into a world of Voodoo, the occult, and murder and finds that he himself is involved somehow. He struggles to find out the truth behind everything going on and when he does, it's quite the revelation for him.It took me several viewings to finally grip Angel Heart. The film is a bit difficult, not in that it's hard to understand the plot but that there are so many details to sort through. You must pay attention to make sense of all the names mentioned, the flashbacks, the twists, and a tricky back-story that is given to us piece by piece. That said, when all the things come together, it does work well for the most part. Alan Parker's direction is both subtle and sharp, and he really does a fine job capturing the noir-type mood. He's also able to bring the 50's era to life without going overboard or relishing in it, he just simply shows it. The slushy New York locations contrasted with rainy, humid New Orleans suit the story very well (the change in climate being a reflection upon Harry's own comprehension and, indeed, fate), as does the bluesy/jazzy soundtrack. And that pounding heartbeat really helped to turn the tension levels up. Mickey Rourke is excellent as Harry. He's got just the right amount of New York accent and brings true emotions to his character; formidable, frightened, or distraught, he performs realistically. Now Robert De Niro, it's just a pleasure watching him as a sly Satan! His mannerisms, from a slight grin to a menacing glance to eating an egg, are wonderful. I've read some negative remarks about Lisa Bonet's acting in the film but I thought she did just fine with her role, as did the rest of the cast.So, aside from the sometimes confusing plot points, I thought Angel Heart was a very good horror mystery and holds up well for being nearly 20 years old. I really do enjoy story-driven films dealing with such subject matter and was not disappointed with the one in Angel Heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perhaps the most underrated film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was the only film that ever gave me sleepless nights. It is terrifying at an almost elemental level. I can understand why so many people gave this film a low rating; on first viewing it appears confused, plot less and strange, but, if you see it again, once the ending has been revealed, all the hidden meanings emerge from the woodwork and a truly shattering psychological experience reveals itself. Far from being confused, it is actually quite simple and straightforward. Far from being plot less, "Angel Heart" has one of the most intricate and well-constructed plots of any film I have seen. Every shot in this film carries a hidden meaning, from the opening with the young man's corpse, to the whispers in Harry Angel's ear, to Harry shattering a mirror, to the direction turned by the blades of fans. The more times you see the film, the more you understand and the more terrifying it becomes. In the movie "Hellraiser," there is a magic puzzle that once solved, opens the gates to Hell. "Angel Heart" is the same way; the more of this puzzle you put together, the closer you get to the final, soul-searing understanding.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I unsuspectingly decided to watch AngelHeart one day, propelled by the grim apocalyptic landscapes in The Wall and the intense Midnight Express. I must say, i was unprepared for the complete kick in the ass this movie was. First of all, the script is very sound, combining tight noir mystery and bizarre paranormal carnage in one seamless, endlessly bleak atmosphere that unfolds beautifully and economically. It's one of those movies were clever hints at the final plot twist exist throughout the duration of the film, but it's only at the end that all the pieces fall into place. Some people have told me they saw the end coming, which i will not reveal here, but i think most people will be too engrossed in the gorgeously filthy, decaying set pieces and grizzly violence to pick up on all the hints, and even then the movie still delivers on the grounds of execution alone. Rourke gives his all-time best performance (with his role as Marv in Sin City following at a close second), and imo perfectly depicts a man falling completely apart emotionally as he progresses further into madness. Parker is masterful here, maintaining a constant aura of doom and mystery, juxtaposing the quiet main piano theme brilliantly against Rourke's failing sanity. Every scene is charged with despair and melancholy, and i consider this one of the most depressing films i have ever seen. Though many people may see this as a good reason not to view the film, i still consider it a remarkable artistic achievement. De Niro also turns in a small but creepy performance... Overall, i would highly suggest this film to anyone interested in nightmares</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If I was going to make a film??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I was going to make a film, I think that Angel Heart is the type of film I would love to make. It had a superb moody atmosphere with great locations like Cooney Island, New Orleans and The Bronx. Actors like Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro and Charlotte Rampling at the top of their form, and a slow dream-like quality not seen too much in today's Cinema. It also mixed "genres" very successfully - merging the traditional gritty private eye format with an occult supernatural story-line - a unusual amalgam at the time, and not really revisited since this fine outing. There's also a fair amount of black humour, and a wealth of sparkling cameo performances (Izzy and Wife) that add depth and quirkiness to the film - making the overall experience even more enjoyable.I get the impression that director Alan Parker was at a point in his career where he could choose the style of movie he wanted to make, and was willing to direct against "type" with this private eye/occult thriller. This must have been magnificent freedom for a director - along the lines of David Lynch and Spike Lee making the movies they wanted to, with seemingly little studio interference. Alan Parker had had great success up to this point with films like Fame and Midnight Express, so he had some clout with the studios, and they knew that he was likely to produce a quality movie.I think that Angel Heart is one of those buried treasures that has not even achieved "cult status" - it seems to be below the radar for most movie watchers - even the UK DVD release seemed low-key and budget-priced, but very well done with a superb transfer, director commentary and informative extras. IMDb review comments mostly praise the film - but I feel that it's an 80's gem that ranks along side Good Fellas, Blue Velvet and deserves a much wider audience.So? now that Angel Heart has been made - I will have to set my sights on making another classic unknown film, I suppose the world is my celluloid oyster?..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Faustian Tale That Makes Sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the problems with the story of Faust, the man in the German legend who sold his soul to the Devil, is that we never understood why anyone would make such a foolish bargain in the first place. A few decades of wealth, power, fame, and sex in exchange for an eternity of suffering the fires of Hell? Evil may be fascinating, but stupidity never is, and we quickly lose interest in the fate of anyone dumb enough to do that. The story fares much better when understood in the allegorical sense, of course, but it is always better if a story makes sense literally if it is to have much value figuratively.This movie solves that problem. Johnny Liebling is a crooner who thinks he knows a way to trick Satan. He makes a pact with him, in which Satan gets Johnny's soul in exchange for fame as a singer, under the name Johnny Favourite. Having made the deal and benefited from it, he then performs a ritual that involves cutting the heart out of a soldier and eating it. By so doing, Johnny is able to substitute the soldier's soul for his own, the result being that the soldier's soul will have to suffer the fires of Hell, while Johnny's soul does not. The soldier's name is Harold Angel, suggesting his innocence, of course. As part of the ritual, the soldier's dog tags are sealed up in vase. Only if Johnny himself opens the vase will the ritual be undone. Because Satan wants Johnny's soul and not Angel's, he must trick Johnny into breaking open the vase.When World War II breaks out, Johnny is drafted and subsequently suffers an injury, which causes him to have amnesia. He spends some time in a hospital, but his friends get him out. Not knowing what to do with him, they simply drop him off in a crowd of people on New Year's Eve. As a result of Johnny's confused memory about swapping souls with Harold Angel, he comes to believe that he is Harold Angel, and eventually starts working as a private detective under that name.Ten years after the war, which is when the movie starts, this Harold Angel is hired by Louis Cyphre (Lucifer) to find Johnny Favourite. Angel does not realize it, but he has been hired by the Devil to find himself. We do not realize it either, at this point, and we are encouraged by the movie to like Angel and to identify with him. He seems to be basically a nice guy. As he starts investigating, he begins experiencing disturbing images from the past. Little by little, he begins to suspect the truth. He is horrified at the idea that he might be Johnny Favourite, and having come to like him and identify with him, we are horrified too.In his desperation to assure himself that he is who he thinks he is, he breaks open the vase, and the dog tags of the real Harold Angel fall out. The spell is broken. At this point, Louis Cyphre appears, announcing that Johnny's soul now belongs to him. Finally, recent memories that Johnny had distorted are replaced by accurate ones, and he is forced into the realization that he has murdered several people.Because Johnny thought he had a way to trick the Devil, this story works on a literal plane. And by making us like him as Harold Angel and identify with him, the movie forces us to realize that we too may not be as good as we like to think we are, that we too have something inside us that is evil.But a remark made by Louis Cyphre gives this Faustian story a new twist. Cyphre says that Johnny was doomed the minute he cut that boy's heart out. In other words, all that dabbling in black magic and making a pact with the Devil was just so much hocus-pocus. In itself, it was harmless nonsense, and Johnny would never have gone to Hell for that. It was only when he did something truly evil, when he murdered that soldier, that Johnny was damned. By this remark, Cyphre links the literal understanding of this story with its allegorical one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All That Mystery Was Brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best film noir ever made and one of the most memorable released in the 1980's along with "Body Heat" (coincidence that both movies have Mickey Rourke starring). But "Angel Heart" is not like "Body Heat" because it follows into other direction, there's some similarities between both films. The mystery here is given to a Brooklyn detective named Harry Angel (Rourke) contacted by a mysterious and sinister man called Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro, in one of his most scariest performances ever) who wants to discover the whereabouts of Johnny Favorite, a popular singer who disappeared after the Second World War. Following some strange clues the detective seems to be attracting and adding more and more deaths with individuals involved with this Johnny Favorite. As the usual films noir goes along with mysteries and charades there's also a female companion for the hero, a beautiful girl played by Lisa Bonet, who is involved in the situation and better stop right here without saying why she's important. The plot is incredibly well written, the ending is very satisfying, memorable and before you hold the mystery pieces together you'll see that everything makes sense. But if you can't figure out what happened in the ending go to the IMDb's FAQ and see the story told in order (I understood, but some connections didn't worked quite well, but after looking the FAQ's it was more interesting how the whole thing was made). "Angel Heart" is not only a film noir. It's a great story about fighting big and great dangers, entering in darker worlds, meeting sinister figures, powerful forces of evil, and seeing at the end how they make you stronger or weaker depending on your view. Will Harry discover who Johnny Favorite is? What's his importance? Who is Louis Cypher? (pay attention to this name). The only hint I give you, and I don't think no one mentioned this anywhere is the words/things with "CH" that seems to have a deeper and negative reaction on the detective: he hates chickens, churches and... if you're smart enough you'll get the third clue by watching the movie.Alan Parker directs a great film, unforgettable in every sense from the magnificent performances to the cinematography and editing, everything works great. It delivers suspense, tension, dramatical moments, sensuality and more. One of my favorite films! 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just revisited this film, having first seen it in the late 80's It is around, probably because of the success of Sin City and The Wrestler. I was surprised by the quality of Rourke's performance. He IS PI Harry Angel.Harry appears to be a sleazy, dishevelled, down at heel bum who looks as though he is a couple of meals away from a soup kitchen. But Rourke gives him just enough appeal to engage our sympathies.Harry is hired by the stylish, debonair Louis Cyphre (De Nero) to track down a once popular pre-war crooner, called Johnny Favorite, who "owes him one" and who has disappeared. As the story unfolds, Harry begins to realise, with some considerable unease and dismay that his involvement in this, apparently routine, "Missing Person Mystery" may be more personal than he thought. His growing apprehension is contagious and made me, for one, want to shout. "Harry, get the HELL out of this". But, of course he doesn't.He is seduced by Cyphre's money and as events unfold, begins to realise what he (Cyphre) is and his true purpose. With horrified disbelief he attempts to deny the growing evidence of his own true identity with his piteously, heartbreaking cry of defiance, "I KNOW WHO I AM". No, you don't Harry. Finally, as almost every one he questions about the "disappearance", meets a grisly end, comprehension dawns and he responds to a cop's "You're gonna burn for this, Angel" (the gruesome murder of a young girl) by acknowledging both his guilt and his debt to Cyphre. "I know", he says, in a whisper filled with dread. "In HELL" Director Alan Parker uses an old tune to create a terrific, spooky and menacing atmosphere throughout. This is most effective in the scenes in New Orleans. There, Harry wears a cheap lightweight suit, anticipating a steamy, humid, city. Only to discover that it can rain, very heavily, in the Big Easy and as his fortunes wane, so he and the suit become ever more dishevelled. The four scenes between Rourke and De Nero are riveting. Especially, the one in the Italian restaurant that, I think, surpasses the famed Pacino-De Nero scene of HEAT. Although, Robert De Nero's "Special Appearance" is eye catching, ultimately this is Rourke's film.......9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing, underrated movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently watched Angel Heart. I hadn't seen it in years, and stumbled across it one afternoon.I was stunned as I was completely drawn into the world of Detective Harry Angel, and sat mesmerized for the next two hours, until the film's stunning conclusion left me breathless, even though I knew what was coming.This is not a simple movie, but the simple plot line is that a hard nosed private eye gets in too deep when hired by a mysterious client to find a missing person. What follows is a complex, twisted tale of morality, secrets, and the fact that you can never outrun your past, no matter how hard you try. For those of you who only know Mickey Rourke as the hulking ruin you saw in Sin City, you really need to see this film. Rourke was at his prime here, and gives a performance that is both believable and shattering. It is a portrait of a man who knows he is losing his hold on everything that he knows to be true, but is unable to stop going down the road that he senses will lead him to oblivion.The first time I saw this movie, I was a teenager, and thought the movie was too slowly paced. Now, with a more mature set of eyes, I think the pacing is perfect. Languidly allowing the viewer to be steeped in the humid, foreign atmosphere of a sultry Louisiana.The cinematography is fantastic, with every detail authentic, down to the fact that people didn't wear antiperspirant back then :-)I absolutely believed in the world that Harry found himself being trapped by, and the horror kept growing as every new detail was slowly brought to light.This is a film that demands to be seen at least twice. I have watched it twice more since that afternoon, and I am still finding new details that I had not noticed before. Be warned, it is intense, but it is an unforgettable classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One twisted tale + Two of the most bravura performances I've ever seen = One 'Hell' of a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Angel Heart' begins with an eerie, atmospheric background score, with the opening frame of a cold, winter night....It is at this very stage, that the viewer gets completely drawn in, into this shocking tale of an investigator out to seek a missing person, for one really odd client. The premise sounds like a regular mystery of a missing person, with the investigator, Harold Angel (Mickey Rourke) following every lead he gets. But things are not as straightforward as they may seem, as Harold slowly uncovers the disturbing truth behind the disappearance.I am surprised Angel Heart doesn't even have a 8/10 rating on IMDb. It definitely deserves much more than a 7.2. At least from horror/thriller film loyalists, 'cause this one is definitely a cut above some other cheap, B-horror flicks. This movie is a close second to the brilliant 'Jacob's Ladder' from the same producers (Mario Kassar and Andrew Vajna).Alan Parker's direction is excellent. The background score by Trevor Jones is well in place and perfectly complements the dark mood of the movie.What can I say about the performances that hasn't already been said! This is quite possibly Mickey Rourke's career best performance! He shows a wide range of emotions, with so much ease. He sinks his teeth firmly into the character and fits the role of Harold Angel to the T. Not to mention he has great screen presence and charisma.As for the great Mr. De Niro...this is one actor who never fails to amaze me. Just when I thought he couldn't possibly be as brilliant as (or better than) he was in Raging Bull or Taxi Driver or The Godfather Part II or even Casino, I come across this GOD of a performance..De Niro's Louis Cyphre! This is what a true performance is all about!!! And what's more, De Niro is hardly there on screen (maybe a total of about 15 minutes?), but you've got to hand it to him....he makes it a point to be extraordinary in every frame he appears in! This is one less known but magnificent performance from the legendary actor.And then there's a special mention of Lisa Bonet. She delivers in her small role as Epiphany.All said, 'Angel Heart', is not to be missed. Strongly recommended for the fans of creepy and twisted movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic movie in its effective eerieness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember having seen this movie in the beginning of the 90ies on TV, the strange atmosphere stayed with me but I didn't quite get the movie back then I guess. Watching it now I am really stunned with its plain bleakness, classic plot twists and effectiveness in creeping you out without the nowadays so popular and cheap SAW-Snuff-Stuff. "Angel heart" takes place in the 50ies revolving around a private eye from Brooklyn played too damn perfect by Mickey Rourke who gets a job by a man named Louis Cypher (played great like expected by Robert De Niro) to check out where one of his debtors hid. Investigating the case he gets more than knee deep involved in a story full of occult and voodoo themes that throws him into the mad heat of Louisiana.The whole movie is raw and gritty, the soundtrack is minimalistic yet effective and the violence is rather on the sidelines, still sticking in mind. For the atmosphere of eerieness and strangeness (loved the nose shield!) this movie already deserves to be ranked among later classics like "Seven" and the final twist of the movie with its subtle ending round it up to be a must-see. Not just the ending, the whole way of telling the story is pretty unique from the saxophone-driven beginning in a dimly lit back alley. Check this movie out by any means if you are bored by all those movies which try creeping you out with extensive gore and close-ups. This one gets to you far more by showing far less and getting your mind revolving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No quesch, Angel Heart is a kind of movie not for everyone. Ideally suited for mature and attentive viewers with a particular zest in movies seeped in a bizarre Dali-type surrealism full of mystery, supernaturality, violence, bloodshed and sex. I drags us into an hypnotic world of voodoo, mambo-jambo, black magic, and the Lucifer.But, this is not a classic-type horror flick per se. Instead, unique and stylish OCCULT-THRILLER like Polanski's "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Ninth Gate" based on intrigue, confusion and contradiction. In terms of its twisty plot and surprise ending, it is the predecessor to "The Sixth Sense", "The Others", "The Skeleton Key", "Secret Window" and "Jacob's Ladder". If you enjoyed these movies, "Angel Heart" would be a favorite piece in your DVD collection.Set in 1955, it is an excellent period work, as are the settings and cinematography, especially shots of dark, seedy, and steamy backdrops in Louisiana. The scenery is murky, the ambiance is eerie, flashbacks and images are distorted, all playing tricks on your mind. Surrealistic scenes are all shot beautifully and subtly: grotesque elevators, lurid ventilators, decaying buildings, sleazy rooms, echoes of closing doors, pieces of shattered memories, suffocating Louisiana swamps, blood dripping and running all over the room. Sometimes it's difficult to follow the plot precisely, and every detail needs to pay attention to get the clues and put the pieces together. It is likely that you would miss some details and second viewing would be helpful.From beginning to end, a scuzzy and confused private-eye Mickey Rourke's performance is top notch, you can't help but feel pity and sadness for him. Harry Angel is his magnum opus. Robert De Niro portrays more gruesome &amp; deadly Satan in human form than Al Pacino's comedic &amp; commercial Lucifer in "Devil's Advocate".Exquisite work from Alan Parker. Highly recommended...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Parker's "Faust"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If to choose things that influenced Parker's masterpiece, there must be "Faust" and noirs of the 40ies-50ies. It's just simple like that but at the same time it isn't. It doesn't mean Parker's picture is a licentious screening of Goethe's tragedy or stylized retro-noir. It is a unique piece of cinema that had never been done before or after. Having received rather controversial reviews buy American critiques, it's been underrated from the very release. It got it's cult meaning only years later, when it has been recomprehended around the world. But even today many people see only movie's external cover not willing to think on it's deep philosophical issues. In my opinion, this this certainly Mickey Rourke's best role and it's a big pity seeing what he did with his career. De Niro makes a very memorable cameo as Mephisto. In fact, the whole casting seems to be just perfect, from cold-eyed Charlotte Rampling to magnifying Lisa Bonet. For those who think that Hollywood of the 80ies was becoming commercialized and too viewer-friendly, Angel Heart is a living evidence that it also gave birth to such transcended pieces of cinema. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite simply an incredible film. Director Alan Parker brilliantly weaves an intense thriller using the horror and noir genres. Angel Heart, set in Brooklyn and New Orleans, is one of the most beautiful cinematic films I've ever seen. Parker really took advantage of the surrounding scenery.But what stands out the most in this film is the acting. Mickey Rourke, who plays Harry Angel, is phenomenal as usual and proves that he really is one of the greatest actors of his generation. DeNiro, who plays Louis Cyphre, though only in about 15 minutes of the film, delivers one of the creepiest performances I've ever seen. You can't not enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Title: Angel Heart (1987)Rating: * * * * 1/2Version Reviewed: Lions Gate (NTSC ? Region 1) Video: Anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) Audio: English dd 5.1 Running Time: 1:52:50 Rating: RDirector: Alan Parker (Pink Floyd: The Wall / Fame) Writer: Alan Parker (Mississippi Burning / Evita / The Commitments) Music: Trevor Jones (From Hell / Dark City / Labyrinth) Photography: Michael Seresin (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban / Birdy) Editor: Gerry Hambling (Pink Floyd: The Wall / Fame)Starring: Mickey Rourke (Fade to Black / 9 ? Weeks) Robert De Niro (Godsend / Jackie Brown / Mary Shelley's Frankenstein) Lisa Bonet (High Fidelity / Bank Robber / Enemy of the State) Charlotte Rampling (Swimming Pool / Orca) Stocker Fontelieu (Mandingo) Brownie McGhee (The Jerk)Synopsis: Harry Angel (Rourke) is a rather ragtag and rough and tumble private detective. Always one step away from trouble Harry takes a new case from a rather sinister fellow named Louis Cyphre (DeNiro). It seems that a singer named Johnny Favorite owes Mr. Cyphre a debt that he is to collect upon Favorite's death and it becomes Angels' job to find him and determine his status. When all roads lead to mysteries involving the occult and voodoo, Harry will have to uncover a terrible truth and the cost could be his immortal soul.Acting: The acting is superb as each actor brings some really great nuances to their characters. Little scenes in this film seem to be made huge with these little additions. Like the scene where Angel meets Cyphre and DeNiro is rolling the hard-boiled eggs and Rourke counters the menace by tossing a pinch of salt over his lest shoulder. These are the little things that make performances priceless and enduring.Direction / Writing: Expertly written and directed by Parker, every frame of Angel Heart seems to have an inherent grunginess that becomes more menacing as the film progresses. Beautifully set-up scenes do at times seem to have such a textured darkness that the darkness itself seems like a character that threatens to envelope all the characters. Technical: The technical aspects of Angel Heart don't disappoint either. Trevor Jones musical score runs a gamut of emotion and feeling. Menace, longing, jubilant, jazzy and erotic overtones make for one of his best scores and he has made several. The editing is top notch too; every scene seems to wield yet another piece of the puzzle and is presented very well. The look of the 50's seems to be presented very well I am no expert on the period but they seem to have done a remarkable job of replicating it.DVD comments: DVD special features consist pf: ? Newly Remastered anamorphic print ? Newly Remastered dd 5.1 ? Alan Parker dvd intro ? New interviews ? Voodoo truths ? An audio commentary by director Alan Parker. ? A scene specific video commentary by Mickey Rourke ? Behind-the-scenes ? Trailer galleryAfterthoughts: The dvd is a must for any fan of the film and I particularly enjoyed the voodoo documentary. Angel Heart is a very deep and textured film. I have seen it three times now and it always holds my attention with the details and nuances of the acting and overall production value that is quite remarkable. A must see for all fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>once Mickey Rourke said : "Alan Parker wears that glasses to look like Oxford's graduates, but he's been raised in the streets indeed &amp; that's why he's a great director"."Angel Heart" was the first shock. i do not believe in silly top 10 but if i ever commit to choose, "Angel Heart" will be undoubtedly 1 of 10.the magical atmosphere which combines Raymond Chandler-style detective stories with high dosage of religion-related references &amp; of course with the 50's ( not familiar, promising 50's of America's post-war era ) is so unique &amp; every single plan in any sequence is so thoughtful that makes "Angel Heart" an obsession of mind for any serious viewer.i'm a guy from VHS era &amp; i never forget the 1st time i watched "Angel Heart ". it was near 14 years ago( i was in high school), it was a LD(laser disk) copy with poor quality (yellow background all around) &amp; it had hard-coded Japanese sub! the sex scene( which is disturbing but vital) was tamed &amp; the sound was disaster with today' standards, ...but the impact was shocking. i stayed awake till morning, thinking about that 2 hours of shock experience. i still could hear the mixture of Harry's footsteps on thick snow with "heart beat"-based score during that cold night. i still could feel the echos of some sentences: "do you like an egg?" , "..so Johnny picked up a young soldier" , "my name's not Johnny" , "the flesh is weak Johnny, but the soul is immortal", "..and your soul belongs to me"...i was wondering why Harry Angel couldn't pronounce "Louis Cyphre" correct, even once! i was thinking about the close-up of Cyphre's ring in the beginning. i could visualize the voodoo's ceremony Harry watched. i could applause Parker's flawless use of flashbacks...after years &amp; years, the main motif seems familiar now : being hired to search the truth, searching the truth &amp; frustrating after finding the truth. doesn't seem familiar? same as sir Alfred's "Vertigo" and Polanski's "the Ninth Gate". while "Vertigo" concentrates on untouchable immortal beloved, but "the Ninth Gate" is far closer to "Angel Heart",with less impact of course. thanks to the technology, i've watched better(quality) versions of "Angel Heart" since then. vcd, DVD-copy on VHS &amp; DVD itself.( blue-ray next?)now i watch it 1ce a year &amp; the impact is still the same.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective thriller that works well even when the twist is obvious (spoliers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Private detective Harry Angel is offered a job through a lawyer by one Mr Cyphre. Mr Cyphre is owed a debt by a man who he helped become famous as a singer. The man was hurt in the war and is believed dead although Mr Cyphre cannot be sure. When Angel finds that the man may not be dead he follows the trail to the South where he encounters a range of characters from the man's past as well as encountering that voodoo is some way involved. When key people in his investigation start being murdered, Angel is the main suspect and he must find the man to clear his own name.From the first moment Robert De Niro's character is introduced, the first twist is revealed to all but those with the thinnest grasp of word play. The final twist may not be as obvious but the majority of the surprise is gone. So then, it is to the film's credit that it works so very well despite this cat being out of the bag for most people. The plot is still dark and clever in it's own right and works well as a basic detective story but also with the other meaning to most things.The dark atmosphere of evil and voodoo is gripping and well painted by director Parker. The mugginess of the scenes in the deep south can be felt through the screen surprisingly well. The cast do a good job as well. It is hard to watch Rourke in video thrillers now and then see him doing such a good job here. He carries this film himself. Support from Rampling and a surprisingly naked role from Bonet (who was still best known for the Cosby Show at the time) add class. De Niro's devil is great despite only having a few scenes. The scene where he tell Rourke that some cultures believe that an egg is the symbol of the soul before eating one with an evil look in his eye is great. His screen presence makes good on a small but important part.Overall this film will work best for those who are totally unaware of the twists and turns it takes but is still an effective and enjoyable thriller for those who see the twists coming or know what they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best American horror films of the 1980s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As dark and brooding a slice of American Gothic as you could wish for, ANGEL HEART is one of the best straight horror outings to come out of the late '80s ? a time when most genre offerings were cheesy, rubbery outings of stupidity. ANGEL HEART is in essence a mood piece. Set during the 1950s, it chronicles the efforts of a private detective to track down a missing person who soon finds himself in some very dark places. With a string of unpleasant sex and violence scenes, excellent direction from the always-good Alan Parker and some quite wonderful performances, this is a real classic. There aren't that many films that deal with modern-day voodoo in a non-biased way so this one's a real treat.Parker is adept at crafting atmosphere and you can almost smell the cigarette smoke in this seedy, grubby little film. Mickey Rourke, in a career-best performance, is Harry Angel, the protagonist. Angel is a pretty unpleasant guy who thinks nothing of using violence as a method and yet Rourke embodies him with a raw humanity that makes us warm to him from the start. Although he's the archetypal tough guy he projects an air of bruised vulnerability that makes him riveting to see on screen. He has some great supporting actors with him, too; Lisa Bonet excels in a layered performance as the voodoo-practising Epiphany Proudfoot; Charlotte Rampling as a fortune teller; finally Robert De Niro, as great as ever as the sinister Louis Cyphre.The film is pretty slowly paced but laced with moments of action and violence that breathe life into it. My attention never wavered for a second. There are occasional missteps ? I could have done without the 'glowing eye' stuff that takes place at the climax, that only serves to cheapen the effect; good when used in films like FRIGHT NIGHT, but not here! But the handling of Rourke's gradual realisation as he pieces together the mystery and his final understanding of the true horror of his situation is top notch and the film then ends on an unforgettable piece of imagery. Altogether a great work and a film I thoroughly enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant horror yarn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few horror efforts from the 80's and 90's have the devilish nightmare ambiance of Alan Parker's Angel Heart. The film is pure atmospheric brilliance from beginning to end, with a twisted, dark hearted story of evil deeds, demonic secrets and a shocker of a twist ending. Mickey Rourke plays Harry Angel, a hard luck private investigator in late 40's New York. He is visited by a mysterious, disconcerting gentleman named Louis Cyphre, played with restrained menace and mirth by Robert De Niro. He's only around for a handful of scenes but every time he shows up he coats the scenes in a terrifying black velvet sheen of unsettling discomfort. He hires Harry to locate an elusive crooner named Johnny Favourite, who has gone missing, still owing Louis some vague debt. This enterprise sends Harry on a hellish journey from the dirty brick labyrinth of Harlem far across the country to the eerie, sweat drenched, voodoo stained swamps of New Orleans in search of Johnny, who always seems to be one step ahead of our gumshoe hero. Soon bodies begin to pile up, murdered in blood chilling occult fashion, with clues that begin to frame Harry, and as a net of secrets, carnage and supernatural stirrings closes in on him, he races to find the truth before he ends up another victim. Charlotte Rampling is great as a woman with ties to the case, and Bill Cosby's daughter Lisa Bonet shows up in a sizzling turn as a sultry siren of the bayous who entrances our Harry. In fact, the sex scene between them was originally banned from the final cut for its raw, wet primal intensity, but has been restored in the special edition DVD. This is a huge highlight of Rourke's career. He plays Harry with an edgy, desperate frenzy of virile survival instinct and terrified confusion. Although the film deals with some truly ugly elements, it's nothing short of gorgeous to look at, the locations painstakingly recreated and the costumes and props have a well worn, lived in feel that makes them all the more believable. The real star of this piece though, is the atmosphere. There's a palpable sense of dread that hangs in the air along with the perpetual haze of booze and cigarette smoke. There's a sense of inevitable doom that's driven into our psyches by the Gothic, hair raising score and the hallucinatory madness we witness Harry experiencing. Visually it all looks stunning, with a baroque, stylized edge to the violence and above all, a really fun detective murder mystery with paranormal elements at its core. I couldn't recommend this one enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Angel Heart" is a true standout film among director Alan Parkers' filmography: a seedy, depressing, disturbing, provocative, and mesmerizing mystery with all the creepy imagery one could hope for. It begins on a very ominous note and remains gripping all the way through its serpentine story. Mickey Rourke, in one of his very best performances, stars as Harry Angel, low rent NYC private eye hired by mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro, who's fantastic) to locate a vanished crooner named Johnny Favourite. His search leads him from NYC to New Orleans, and with the story (based on the novel "Falling Angel" by William Hjortsberg) taking place in the mid-1950s, that merely adds to the overpowering atmosphere. Along the way, the dead bodies start piling up, and Harry finds things just getting more and more gloomy as his search moves inexorably towards its devastating conclusion. I think that a key to this films' success is that it *can* work even for the viewer who knows the major revelations beforehand, or guesses at them early on. It's the gravitas that Parker and his fine cast brings to the proceedings that make it so compulsively watchable. Also appearing are Charlotte Rampling, beautiful as ever, in the role of black magic practitioner Margaret, and the stunning Lisa Bonet, who's memorable in the role of young mother Epiphany. Familiar faces in smaller roles include Pruitt Taylor Vince, as a detective (he acted again for Parker in "Mississippi Burning"), Kathleen Wilhoite, as a nurse, Michael Higgins as a drug-addicted doctor, musician Brownie McGhee as Toots Sweet, and Dann Florek ('Law &amp; Order: SVU') as an attorney. As this story plays out, one just knows that whatever Harry finds out, it won't be pleasant, and the dark tone extends to the memorable sex scene, which is erotic and creepy in equal measure. The music score by Trevor Jones is suitably eerie and there's a serving of blues music that is irresistible, adding to the overall experience. In the end there's a strong message about the nature of living a lie, and the final confrontation between two characters is brilliantly subtle, depending on acting rather than spectacle or much in the way of cheese. This represents a solid effort from all concerned. Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrifying would be a good word to start out a review of Angel Heart with, wouldn't it? Yes. It would. This movie will chill you to the bone. It's the story of Harry Angel, a detective looking for work who takes a job offer from a mysterious man named Louis Cyphre. Cyphre is looking for a man named Johnny Favourite and offers Angel $5000 dollars to find the fellow who has mysteriously gone missing. But as Angel's search goes on, key people in his investigation begin to die off under gruesome circumstances. All the while the investigation leads him to dark underground cults filled with disturbing amounts of voodoo and chicken blood. Angel Heart is a movie that disturbs on all kinds of levels, never once letting up and only growing creepier and creepier as time goes on.Good, sincere horror is hard to pull off, but Angel Heart manages just fine in being a truly scary, truly enticing film. The storyline takes us to the darkest and creepiest of places, taking all sorts of gruesome turns that lead us to a dramatically excellent ending. It is a film that looks to scare, yet also engage and entertain in a sophisticated yet grotesque way, and it does just that. Some would say that it goes overboard on the sex and violence, but for such a satanic and evil film, I would say it has just the right amount. This movie is like a mysterious and foreboding dark hole that, through sheer terror, draws you in closer and closer then grabs you by the neck and scares the living hell out of you when you least expect it. My only complaint would be that on the way to this final big scare, the film drags a bit and gets pretty slow right before the epic conclusion that will leave you disturbed yet mystified.I give the film a lot of credit for telling such an excellent story, but I cannot forget the hauntingly beautiful cinematography that drives this film so well. The film is shot incredibly well with each frame as poignant and tightly constructed in the most artistically creepy way possible. The film doesn't completely rely on the blood and guts to scare you, it uses immaculate cinematography to entice you and sicken you at the same time. Alan Parker directs the film with a keen eye for the grotesque yet glorious, framing beautiful shots that capture the films disturbing darkness, as well as mixing in some fast paced scenes with an abundance of quick cuts that scream right into your face and keep you so heavily engaged in the film that you just can't look away. The film boasts some truly masterful visuals.Angel Heart is an excellent horror film that plays itself so much smarter than the average horror film, while still maintaining a healthy handful of blood, guts, and thrills to be scarier than the average horror film as well. Don't expect to leave this film happy or jolly. This film is dark, grotesque, and downright evil. But it isn't trying to sugarcoat any of the disturbed terror it is trying to instill, so from that perspective it succeeds so immensely. It drags in the middle, but it pays off enough with its exhilarating and shocking ending. Angel Heart is a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Gothic film-noir, strange combination that works for its pulp-style and star power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alan Parker doesn't necessarily have a masterpiece on his hands here; he's sometimes a little uneasy when it comes to storytelling devices like a voice-over repeating details from a previous scene, or in actual visual devices a few times (notably for me is the tap-dancing cut-away scene, with those few cut-aways distractions from what is otherwise a powerhouse scene). But it is a truly absorbing effort nonetheless, and one that I wouldn't pass up if it arrived on TV at some random moment in time. For all of Parker's dips into the kinds of montage-style editing that he perfected in the Wall, it's also in some small bits with a documentary feel, and in the most part a mood that melds together those dark crevices and corridors and alleys and shadows that one finds in the best of the film-noir period with the same dark tendencies of the supernatural film. It's even got a very typical 'noir' set-up- gleefully typical in actuality- as private eye Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is sent by Louis Cyphre (ho-ho, though not as such played by the totally dead-pan De Niro) to seek out a man who welshed on a contract signed with him. It leads him through Harlem, then to New Orleans, into a whole web of black magic, voodoo, and sinister figures on his trail, and other skeletons in the closet to find.Parker's style is meant to ratchet up the questions raised in the viewer as the film progresses, and as any good twisty thriller goes it deepens these questions by the complexity of the protagonist, leading to the final twist that one may have seen done in quite a number of films since, but does retain its power as something of a dark catharsis for this character. Parker's success here rests on two facets: his blending of a mood of the nature of the people and of New Orleans in general, how people on the street, or in the voodoo dance at night, aren't overdone into some cliché but are shown as they are, as figures in this quasi-limbo Angel has gotten himself into. The other being the casting or Rourke and De Niro. The former gives Angel Heart much of its appeal: it's almost too easy to see Rourke as a gum-shoe, but here he plays it as a person cynical and witty, but also sort of damaged goods, hiding past wounds with a cigarette and look of the eyes. And as things become crazier all around him, little by little one sees the wear and tear on his psyche, until the final scenes when he breaks down into the other side of his tough guy act- vulnerability. De Niro, on the other hand, is so sinister in what he doesn't do. Considering how over the top his contemporaries- Nicholson and Pacinio- went with the role of the devil himself, this may be the most subdued of them all, which makes it all the more chilling (see the egg scene), with the Scorsese-esquire beard a good asset.Although the casting isn't altogether perfect- Rampling is given an all too brief role to work wit, the minor characters being reasonably well suited for the atmosphere, and Lisa Bonet being just about adequate, though not quite the same caliber as Rourke, in her role as a mysterious bayou teen who is the daughter of the suspect in question- having these two heavyweights under Parker's command is quite staggering for any movie fan to enjoy. It's a strange feat to accomplish, but somehow Angel Heart holds up since its release twenty years ago as a genre hybrid sleeper, where the hardest- and darkest- thing to find is probably right inside of oneself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy on so many levels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angel Heart" is creepy on so many levels that I thought I would have a hard time explaining myself, but I got a handle on it now, so I can finally write this review! Harry Angel (A cocky Mickey Rourke)is hired by a mysterious client named Louis Cyphre (A dark Robert DeNiro) to find a musician named Johnny Favourite. Angel is a crude, rather uncouth individual who, at first doesn't want the case, but the chance at earning a nice sum of money, jumps at the chance. Pretty soon, he wishes he hasn't as he is drawn into a very dark landscape involving voodoo,weird visions (Blood everywhere, a person in black sitting in front of an electric chair, and an elevator), and murder in Louisianna. Whenever Angel talks to his acquaintances, they end up dead in gruesome ways (One poor soul ends up in gumbo!).O.K. Kids, this is where the spoilers come into play, so if you haven't seen this film WALK AWAY NOW!!! There are 3 reasons why this film is incredibly creepy: 1) The ending: When Harry Angel finds out the disturbing truth that HE is Favourite and that Cyphre is Lucifer (Which people should have figured out in the beginning), you are in just as much disbelief as he is! How on earth did this happen? When Cyphre breaks it down, and the viewer can see the evidence, then it makes sense. Angel screams in denial, saying that he knows who he is, but then he (And us)starts to realize that he's wrong. He admits to himself (And to the viewers)that HE had committed the horrible murders in the film.2)Lisa Bonnet: I was (and still am) a die-hard fan of "The Cosby Show," and will always see her as Denise Huxtable. Her role as Epiphany was a total change, and to see her in an INCREDIBLY STEAMY love scene with Rourke totally shattered that image. Then for us to find out that she was Rourke's daughter? Another sin that will surely send him to hell (Incest, as well as murder).3)The images and sounds:The constant use of blood,spiral staircases,and elevators are used in a nightmarish way. The viewer gets caught up in the nightmare, swirling out of control like Harry. The final image, of Harry in an elevator, going down, is the scariest of all. You KNOW who he is and what he's done, and he is going to burn. Simply put, he's on an express elevator to hell.One of Alan Parker's best, and he gets great performances from everyone, especially Rourke. And a guarantee good film to give you the shivers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angel Heart will have you gasping for air.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's enough broken down fans, chickens, dark allys, twists, and seedy characters in this thing to keep you glued to your seat, contemplating the film, for hours after its concluded. Quite frankly, you'll be too terrified to even move. If anyone has played the excellent Sierra adventure game, "Gabriel knight: Sins of the Fathers", you'll see a clear inspiration with this movie. Angel Heart is a nightmare of a film-noir flick with a little of the horror genre mixed in. Truly one of the most involving films I've ever seen and by the end of it, the audience will feel as though they've been taken through Hell. Mickey Rourke plays Harry Angel, a small time private investigator in New York City. Most of his clients are jealous lovers and that sort. Angel gets a call one day by Louis Cyphre, a clergyman of a strange religion, asking him to track down a man who is in dept to him. Angel Heart moves like a detective drama with the pacing. But the film is so much more than just a gather clues and evidence type of thing. There's a real psychological horror that builds up as Angel nears closer and closer to his man and as he begins to question the validity of his employer, Mr. Cyphre. Mickery Rourke is brilliant in the movie. He plays a detestable and dirty chainsmoking hustler who will do almost whatever it takes to find the person he's after. Yet the character is also likable because of Rourke's charm, which allows for us to care about him. Robert DeNiro is creepy and downright disturbing as Louis Cyphre in all his subdued glory. The production is amazing. Angel Heart feels like a dark moody blues and jazz number. The story starts in New York and ends up in New Orleans. Lisa Bonet and Rourke have one of film's most notorious moments, a sex-scene that got her kicked off "The Cosby Show" and almost landed the film with an X-rating. Parker's movie ain't for the squimish or faint of heart, that's for sure. Many of the voodoo scenes with chickens are freaky enough, let alone several of the films' gruesome murders. Alan Parker directed the film perfectly. He's vowed to work in every genre and made one hell of a flick with Angel Heart. Michael Seresin did the cinematography for the movie. He also shot Parker's earlier film, Midnight Express. Trevor Jones composed the film's score. Overall just a damn fine piece of movie making. You'll be hard pressed to find a more surreal and nightmarish movie than this with such great acting and storytelling. The ending will leave you gasping for air, yet somehow you will have seen it coming all along. Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When this movie came out, I was about twelve. I went to see it in the theaters on the first night. I came out, not understanding what I just saw one bit but somehow, I knew that I really liked it. Coming out of the theater, I saw my counselor from day camp, who had just come out of the same showing. I asked him if he understood it and he said yes. I asked him if he'd explain it to me and he said that yes, he'd explain it to me the next time he saw me. I spent the rest of the weekend with this movie in my head, reliving scenes of the unspeakable horrors I had seen in my mind. It made sense to me after thinking about it for hours upon hours but only slightly. I got the gist of what was going on but I couldn't understand how the movie ended the way it did and how everything added up. Finally, when I saw my counselor in the neighborhood and he explained the movie to me, it was as if I had been slapped in the forehead by one of those TV evangelists who enjoy slapping people around and helping them "find Jesus, praise God!" I saw the light. Literally. All the little details in the movie finally meant something to me. I think I asked him to go over the details of the story like twelve times that summer at camp, just so I could relive it.I love this movie. It's sick, violent and it's got one of the most realistic sex scenes I've ever seen, unless you count in the little detail of all the blood streaming in from the ceiling. I don't know anybody who has that kind of sex... well, maybe a couple but I'm not telling. It's a dark noir movie with just enough religion in it to make it frightening. You see elevators going down shafts all loud, rattling their gates.... man, it's enough to give a prison bully nightmares. Mickey Rourke is the bomb as PI Harry Angel. This is easily his best performance and it's a shame that no one gives this guy any respect. I can understand why he doesn't get any respect but still, throw the guy some Snausages, ya know? Robert De Niro is excellent as his client and Lisa Bonet sheds the Cosby Show image along with all of her clothes pretty handily. I thought the underarm hair was a bit ill-style but to each their own. Alan Parker sets the mood perfectly from the very first frame of the film. I definitely think that if you haven't seen it, you should do so but watch it at night when you can enjoy the darkness of it.Anyway, I can't recommend this movie enough. Sex, violence, voodoo, maimings, guns going up places they shouldn't be, scary looking mofos, chicken throat slashings, blues and some sick plot twists get this flick a high ranking from yours truly. Also, I think this has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard in a movie. The saxophone by Courtney Pine is priceless. You go, Mickey! I got a thang about chickens too, yo!RATING: **** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cinematography, Great Story, Great Acting -- These make a Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just thought I'd add a few words about this great movie. First of all, it is great, and I hope you reading this will side with the large number of positive reviews and see this movie. The few people who didn't like it must be pinheads (or short attention span types)!*** Spoiler Alert *** This movie is not new, so I don't feel shy about discussing some spoiler type info. Louis Cyphre = Lucifer; this should be easy, and tipped me right at the beginning the first time I saw the movie. But I still wasn't sure until the scene a little later where Mr. Cyphre says that in some cultures, the egg is the symbol of the soul. He then proceeds to eat the egg (hard boiled), in a creepy shot. He eats souls! At this point I said to one of the guys I was seeing the movie with "he's the devil!"To those who may be confused by the details of the soul-switching scenario, and why the devil took so long to come after Harry Angel/Johnny Favorite: the ceremony they performed back at the beginning of WWII was to give up Harry Angel's soul in substitution for Johnny Favorite's, thus cheating the devil. Then Johnny was going to take on Harry Angel's life and escape the devil indefinitely. But then Johnny was shipped off to war, got a head wound and amnesia, and ended up really thinking he was Harry Angel (okay, I'm a little unclear on this bit, but I haven't seen the movie in a couple of years). So what it comes down to is, Harry Angel is really Johnny Favorite, even though he doesn't know it. And since he is, and his soul belongs to the devil, Lucifer can command him to commit murders, even without his conscious knowledge! This is how Johnny/Harry killed the blues musician, and the astrologer/former girlfriend, and the old addict doctor without even knowing it! And you realize then that the Lisa Bonet character is really his own daughter! One of the only movies I've seen where incest is part of a movie yet not the main point of it.This movie is just beautifully shot as well. See it in widescreen if you can, Alan Parker always has great shots that deserve it. I remember a shot of a spiral staircase at one point that was just beautiful. And I will never again see a fan in a movie (an electric fan) without thinking of this movie. That's another clue: every time you see a shot of a fan, and the blades start moving, the devil is in the room! It starts right at the beginning, when Angel first meets with Mr Cyphre. It's winter time, but fans are going! (On a side note: isn't it appropriate that the devil has a French name? Given current political feelings, I mean; of course, I'm biased -- an Anglophile -- so I don't like those weasely Frogs to begin with.)There is so much to recommend this movie that it's hard to pick things: from the humorous touches ("Do you know what today is? It's Wednesday -- it's anything can happen day!" I never was a Mouseketeer, but it's a great reference to the period.) (Also funny: "I got a thing about chickens."); to the great music -- that haunting song, which seems so real, like it was a real song from a crooner of the '40's, as well as the real blues featured in the movie; even the end credit sequence is great, with the elevator cutting back and forth with the credits -- an elevator going straight to hell! The movie also shows a creepy movie version of New Orleans which could seem cliche to some, but is so well done, and fits so well with the period of the movie -- reminds me of another great one, "Southern Comfort," where there's this whole community of Cajuns living in the bayou, just oblivious to the outside world.I also love movies that blow up the illusion that the past was better than the present. Every culture tries to promulgate that, but it is just resistance to change. The '50's was no happy time, people were just a lot more deluded than they are now.This is a great movie to watch, a great movie to listen to (I eventually bought the soundtrack), and one with a great story. Alan Parker is one of the sort of underground geniuses of filmmaking. He directed Pink Floyd's The Wall, too. Another great movie of his is "The Road to Wellville," not a mystery, but another period piece, this time about the 19th century (and how squalid it could be), and the exploits of Kellogg, the guy who founded the cereal company. See that one too (it's a lot funnier than "Angel Heart," and stars Matthew Broderick, Bridget Fonda, Anthony Hopkins and Dana Carvey in another overlooked movie. Perhaps not as "great" as "Angel Heart," but still really good)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most interesting pieces of Film i have ever seen! Watch " Angel Heart"!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You've read the rest of the reviews I'm sure. I must agree Angel Heart is an amazing piece of work! It is a classic, one of those films you can watch more than once, and with each watch always pick up on new things again and again in its fine content!As you know the film is set in 1955 and is about A New York private detective; Mickey Rourke's Harry Angel hired by a client, Mr Louis Cyphere (Robert De Niro) to track down a missing singer Johnny favourite. This is because Johnny owes Cyphere Greatly. Seems like a simple task but Johnny favourite is hard to track down and the only leads are the people who use to know him. Going deeper and deeper into the story Harry becomes involved with voodism, evil, murder and bad luck to name but a few.The script is well written, not too overbearing and keeps us on the edge of our seat always, believe me! Alan parker's directing is so mesmerizing. His effective use of symbolism, hidden messages and dramatic irony is evident in his expressive camera work.One scene this can all be seen in is at the table where Harry Angel meets Louis Cyphere (Ingenious pun/play on words for us to think twice about Robert de Niro's character). Mr Cyphere teases Harry by peeling the shell of a boiled egg slowly with a serious facial expression along with secretive eyes. He then says "Some religions believe the egg is a symbol of the soul, would you like an egg Mr Angel", to which Harry replies "No thank you"; yet it seems as if Harry is refusing something valuable he shouldn't be refusing. Harry looks shocked and be wildered after Cyphere bites half of the egg perfectly to chew, then swallows.Another example of symbolism I don't think many picked up on, is where Harry is embroiled in a fight at a band singer/leader's home; there is a struggle and a wall statue of an angel is knocked to the floor by Harry and breaks in half into two pieces. This is all done to make the viewer think about Harry Angel's life and Fate, and for us not to take things at face value.Parker uses very strong images of fiery red that stand out against dull, cloudy grey backgrounds in his effective gory and bloody images. For example, the murdered bodies we discover. The texture of the red gives us a sense of danger, which is what Harry Angel is in and we are made to feel very, very uncomfortable and disturbed when viewing such images.I even remember wanting to turn away when I saw the sex scene with Harry Angel and Epiphane Proudfoot (Played by Lisa Bonet), where blood drips off the ceiling to cover them and we glimpse a scene of a group of people having an orgy surrounded by a bright red background with fire flames in a hell like place.Most 90's horror movies would instead tirelessly try to scare us poorly with such images, but Parker has instead ingeniously let such graphic images tell us through their look what is happening in the story; rather then just letting us just think 'Ok another boring dead body that popped out to try to scare me Sh**less'. These dead bodies cleverly bring out our curiosity as to why and how these gory, bloody bodies are here without explanation, in the first place, when we view them for the first time along side Harry.Consequently we share Harry Angel's frustration and confusion throughout the film as to what is going on i.e. when he says ` Who the f**k are you Cypher?' or ` Johnny favourite is bad luck and its starting to rub off on me' and are yet reminded that there is more to this than meets the eye when we view the flashback scenes Angel encounters.At the end we share the dramatic atmosphere and are really shocked when we discover and feel what Harry is feeling when he finds out ` the truth'. This twist is like no other twist I have ever encountered. A real eye opener and in my opinion much better than any twist in any film I have ever seen! We really feel emotionally for Harry here, as if he doesn't deserve this fate, but yet if you think about it he does because it is a result of his thoughtless actions. Speaking on that note, the moral and message of the story is if you meddle with things you are not suppose to meddle with, the results are more than likely to be disastrous. Also, making a promise goes with keeping a promise. Some people or entities you make a promise to will never take `no' I can't keep this promise for an answer, once its been made.Over all this film is different from most quickly made horror thrilling type films, and that's because careful thought has gone into its writing, directing, acting and production. It is unique because in no way does it feel familiar to other horror films, and that's because it was one of the real first pieces of work that had originality to it. In the years to come, when people ask me what my favourite films are `Angel heart' is surely going to be one of them! An underrated classic! Should always be remembered and appreciated.</fullReview>

The unrated version is the one I recommend. I believe this to be Mickey Rourke's finest performance, at the height of his powers. DeNiro chills one to the bone. The supporting cast is superb, casting was remarkable. Lisa Bonet was so utterly natural in her role that I realized how unfair the small screen had been to her, how very limited the Cosby show was as a vehicle for her talent. I absolutely cherished the performances of so many of the supporting cast that I would be writing on and on here. Angel Heart is one of my Top Twenty films of all time.

		<shortDescription>An Under-appreciated Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angel Heart is a horror mystery film that features Mickey Rourke,Lisa Bonet and legendary actor,Robert De Niro. It was adapted from the novel entitled Falling Angel by William Hjortsberg.Written and directed by Alan Parker,the story was set in the 1950's wherein a Brooklyn private eye who was hired to locate a missing pop singer.As the investigator tries to solve the mystery,it turns out that anyone who has a clue to the mystery has come up dead.As always,the critically acclaimed novel has a better story in the book as compared to the movie.But nevertheless,it was still worth the view considering that the cast involved provided a good performance from Rourke,De Niro and surprisingly Bonet.Added to that,it was twisty, erotic and definitely splendid.Too bad that it is under-appreciated by movie goers. Give it a chance and it would not be surprising that one may find it an unpopular gem.</fullReview>

The film, which began as an urban noir in the scenery of New York, quickly turns to the mystical path of detective, changing geography and immersing narrative stuffy Southern Gothic's macabre of New Orleans (one of the most famous scenes in the film Parker pays tribute to the creativity of Andrei Tarkovsky and his masterpiece «The Mirror») to the finale taxied to Revelation: insight to the protagonist (and with it, and to the audience) comes too late in the literal sense - Angel really is an angel, only Fallen Angel. The entire film is agonizing attempts restless soul Angel defer its verdict. But like any self-respecting noir, he was doomed from the beginning, long before the meeting with the infernal Louis Cyphre an impressive performance by Robert De Niro. Herein lies the paradox of film noir genre - the sinner is committed to the Lord prescribed redemption, but in vain. Fan blades (one of the main visual symbols of the film), like the wheel of history, continue to cyclic rotation, only the acceleration time is almost tangible stuffiness inevitable fate, and a lift to the scaffold is already waiting, just press the call button.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel Heart is all about atmosphere: Dark, suspicious, dangerous and supernatural. Few horror movies get to be this good; and many try to emulate it's mood to no avail.Angel Heart is considered Alan Parker's Master Piece for a good reason. The acting is quite excellent (except maybe for Eliott Keener, playing as Det. Sterne); Rourke, Bonet and De Niro make a fabulous tríade. The general photography delivers a sense of dark eeriness and estrangement and the Sound Track (mostly Blues) works like "a charm".As a side note I would also like to mention the actor Pruitt Taylor Vince, who in this film acts as a sidekick for Det. Sterne; but the curious tidbit is that you also get to see him on "Jacob's Ladder" (1990), another Thriller/Noir Master Piece of eeriness (though a very different movie), and as memorable as Angel Heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Visually Stunning Cult Thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have heard some things about Angel Heart, but I wasn't sure what kind of film I was expecting. What I saw is something that is a little bit of a cult horror Gothic classic. It wasn't frighteningly scary, but it sure was thrilling at times and often pretty violent. The acting is solid and this is one of the better films by Mickey Rourke. Of course, there is a bonus when Robert de Niro is involved.Alan Parker directed a film about a private detective who has been hired by a client to find a man named Johnny. But in his search, he finds many weird and unusual things that may turn out to be so much more...The acting is really good. Mickey Rourke, who makes a living playing such unclean rag-tag characters, is really good as the private detective, Harry Angel. Robert De Niro, who gets top billing, but does not have many lines, but he still is very good. In Lisa Bonet's first film role, boy she's pretty weird.Overall, this is a really intense psychological horror film. It's a strange film that mystifies all these cults that appear in the movie. As a detective film, it plays it by the book but the movie is still well-made. This has the makings of a cult classic and it seems to have been criminally underseen. The visuals are also rather striking and rich, which surprised me. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, stylish and sinister neo-noir mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angel Heart is a film that didn't seem to get a lot of respect on initial release for some reason. I never understood that then and I still don't really now. For me, this is a very stylish and intriguing film that has many good things about it. Its story centres on a Brooklyn private eye who is hired by a mysterious stranger to find a missing singer who owes him a debt. Everywhere he goes a trail of gruesome ritualistic murders follow. The setting is a very big part of the success of the movie and one of the reasons it has aged so well. 1950's Brooklyn, Harlem, Coney Island and Louisiana are all invoked extremely effectively and give the movie a real sense of place and atmosphere. Likewise, specific settings are well used such as the creepy evangelical church in New York or the backwater bayou in New Orleans. Intensifying the feeling is a really effective, haunting jazz soundtrack. All these things combined make for a very potent mood and atmosphere. Director Alan Parker needs to be given a lot of credit here for this. His direction is excellent and the moments of cinematic style he uses are all, not only extremely well executed, but also really effective in building atmosphere and dread. Sometimes it's totally innocuous details like tap dancing feet that are edited in such a way as to signify impending horror, similarly recurring imagery of lifts, fans and staircases are given a somewhat sinister feeling. Other times, the material is much more direct such as the notorious sex scene or the psychological flash-backs that Harry Angel experiences every so often. While little details like the mysterious nun whose face Harry never quite sees are very well integrated and scary. In other words, stylistically Angel Heart is a real success.All of this would be well and good but what takes it up a level further is the fact that the central mystery is very compelling. It has plenty of noirish detail and characters but is given further value by the way it intermingles this with voodoo and jazz music. It makes for a pretty distinctive concoction it has to be said. The production values in general seem very good here and the period detail is never less than completely convincing. The icing on the cake is of course the casting. Mickey Rourke was at the height of his powers at this time and he effortlessly fits the character of Harry Angel. Robert De Niro is very sinister in a slightly unusual role for him. Lisa Bonet is pretty memorable as the girl who Angel dalliances with in New Orleans, while Charlotte Rampling's icy persona is utilised well as a sinister fortune-teller. All-in-all, there is a considerable amount of excellent things about this production and its lukewarm response back in the 80's remains baffling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting 1987 thriller fare, that time in no way has changed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For it's time, which was 1987, here's one film that pushed the bounds of controversy and that's how I always felt it, snd I still feel the same today, looking back on it. I love this movie, it's my favourite thriller. Set in 1955, the whole cinematography, is truly amazing, honestly capturing the period, one hundred percent with such interesting sets, backdrops, and detail, down to the smallest knick knac, probably about the best period I've seen. Rourke's apparel is perfect too. Rourke, in still one of his best ever performances, plays small time PI, chicken phobic Harry Angel, who's offered a hefty fee by a mysterious and slightly menacing character, Louis Cyphre (a flawless memorable performance from Deniro) to track down a musician, Johnny Favourite, who was into a lot more than just music, and could already be six feet under. His investigation leads him through Harlem, and the dangerous New Orleans, where he encounters a few incidents with some nasty looking thugs, warning him to cease his snooping. Only everyone Harry questions, winds up dead in some bloody gruesome ways, where even the castration of one 'em, a blue singers, is inferred. The gore is actually stylish and heavy. Even at it's we seen an unrelated victim who's had his throat slashed. Too that controversial goes too far scene, with Bonet and Rourke starkers, sc..wing where blood becomes an illusion of rain running down the wall, until their bodies are showered and drenched in it, I admit, had me thinking it'd gone too far on my few view, but those are the movies our sickies love the best, and this was one of those films. Another subject is thrown into too- voodoo, which intensifies it's creepiness, an angle I loved, where you won't believe Bonet does while partaking in a dance. I must say the background work of the plot is great, where at the end, you'll learn why all of the murdered are murdered, and brutally too, and why Harry as one private dick says, "Burns". A thoroughly engrossing, psychological thriller, while being an unsettling and foreboding journey, for nearly all it's running time, with danger at many a turn. A bucket list movie must. A definite winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Film of 1987</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe because I didn't see the "twist" coming until it finally happened, but not only do I think "Angel Heart" was the best film of 1987, I think it is one of the most underrated films of the last 25 years. I liked Alan Parker as a director, primarily because I know of few directors who could be so versatile as to make films as diverse as "Angel Heart," "Shoot the Moon," "Midnight Express," and "The Commitments." And this is Mickey Rourke's finest performance, and at that time, was why so many of us thought he'd be the next great American actor. I didn't go as crazy over DeNiro as so many others, but he certainly scared me at the end of the movie. All in all, just a great, great film. If anyone reading this review hasn't seen this movie, you owe it to yourself to finally do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Controversial drama. A chilling thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alan Parker directs no doubt the most controversial movie of 1987. The twist is electrifying. The story can easily confuse many a viewer, but the pace is slow and deliberate. Harry Angel(Mickey Rourke) is a down-on-his-luck private detective that occupies his time with cheating spouses and insurance fraud. One day he is employed by a sharp dressed man named Louis Cypher(Robert De Niro)from New York City to find a missing famous crooner named Johnny Favorite. Angel is urged on by the evil and mysterious Cypher. His commission keeps getting bigger, but the search keeps getting more complicated. Angel ends up in rainy Cajun country of Louisiana and the search features voodoo, black magic and murder. The private dick becomes involved with a teen-aged mother named Epiphany(Lisa Bonet), and ends up in a torrid and graphic sexual encounter. Angel discovers he himself is connected to the missing singer. The love making scene appears to become a brutal rape. I especially enjoyed the scenes featuring the pouring rain in New Orleans. The twist makes for a hard hitting finale. Others in the cast: Charlotte Rampling, Michael Higgins, Brownie McGhee and Dan Florek. This movie is definitely a departure for the lovely Bonet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every now and then, a fantastic thriller/horror comes along, and catches everyone by surprise. I could go into a diatribe/editorial concerning what makes good horror, but I'll save that for the message boards. What makes THIS a good horror is a mixture of the classic Noir style, Mickey Rourke's charisma, an awesome screenplay, good direction, some decent effects, and Lisa Bonet. Yes, that's what I said: Lisa Bonet of the Cosby Show. She is an absolute delight in this production, centered around the Louisiana Bayou, ancient religions (though muddled heavily by an injection of Christian myth), intrigue, suspense, and some heavy (but great) atmosphere.If you are a horror fan, this is a must see. Angelheart is both classy AND smart.It rates an 8.7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's dark, it's mysterious, it's? I know not, my feeble vocabulary falters when asked to describe this film. Every scene having an effortless elegance, this film simply glides along beckoning the mesmerised consumer deeper into the dark side of the Deep South.De Nero was the perfect choice for Cyphre, no one else before or since could ever have mustered that kind of calm, menacing intensity. Likewise the whole ensemble filled and became their roles making a truly palm sweating, spine tingling, 113 minutes. Quite possibly the best 113 minutes of a lazy weekend spent on the sofa with cheese crackers and a bottle of crisp chardonnay as one sits mesmerised like a well fed and slightly tipsy bunny caught in the headlights of approaching traffic, doomed to oblivion but caring not.Like good cooking one can't fail if one has good ingredients. Likewise Parked could not fail to excel with William Hjortsberg's fantastic novel. With films as with food we all have our preference, mine would be film noir I can't help but watch Angel Heart without turning down my television's colour. I simply adore the added gritty darkness of the monochrome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this movie. That's why I rated it a 10. Pauleen Kael thought it was stupid; criticizing ,e.g., the constant symbol of the fan in the window. But that was just because Ms. Kael, once she disliked a movie, sometimes found the most trite things to criticize in order to justify her dislike. Incidentally, I think she once called Clint Eastwood a Fascist and not a very good movie director. Well...? Anyway, "Angel Heart" is such a good movie to watch and re-watch. The premise is so fascinating. Think about it: Do you know who you really are? What if you made a pact with the devil for stardom but can't remember any of it? In our celebrity crazed America, can you think about anyone who would do that? The symbols alone are worth watching. The fan, the broken mirror, all the voodoo stuff. I was a child during the time period of the 50s when this movie takes place. It is very nostalgic for me to remember seeing some of those props such as the converted street car turned Diner that I remember as a kid. Where they found all these props is beyond me. Now I have to tell you that the novel, "Falling Angel," has some pretty explicit scenes of group sex in front of the devil who witnesses his followers offering a baby sacrifice to him that's left out of the movie. It's interesting if you watch Rourke's comments in the new expanded DVD version, he says he was in a very negative period in his life and doesn't recall much about working in the movie. He simply needed the money and took what roles he could get. If you buy this copy, by all means do yourself a favor and listen to Mr. Rourke's commentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angel Heart: A brilliant example of atmospheric horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw Angel Heart, I didn't know for sure what it was. About two years ago I had been flipping through stations on TV and stopped on a movie with Mickey Rourke and a bearded Robert De Niro. Already I was hooked, but it wasn't just the presence of these two actors that had me watching, it was the look and feel of the film. Considering I had only caught the last ten minutes of the movie, I was completely engrossed. But it wasn't until earlier this year that I was finally able to sit through the entire movie.The story of Angel Heart is one of noir essence accompanied by overwhelming dread. It begins in 1950's New York, with Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), a low class gumshoe with quite a low prolific career. In his office, he gets a call from a potential client's lawyer, asking him to meet him in of all places, a Harlem church. The client in question is Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro), a mysterious figure who offers Harry a case: Find Johnny Favourite, a war veteran and jazz singer who went missing after returning from the war.. This seemingly simplistic case takes Angel from the roughness of New York to the steamy bayous of New Orleans. As he investigates Favourite's disappearance, he finds himself in the middle of something far more sinister than he ever suspected.As a through-back to the detective thrillers of the 40's and 50's, Angel Heart takes us to places that weren't often traveled in thrillers of the 80's. We're taken to the backwoods of Louisiana where locals practice Voodoo, jazz clubs where classic sounds are still new, and seedy motels that make alleys look like suites at the Ritz-Carlton. There aren't many clean places in the film and it rains in nearly every scene. Writer-director Alan Parker creates a world where only the noir exists and darkness is constant.But this is not a genre film in the conventional sense. Parker keeps most of the story within the nostalgic South and even adds Satanism to the mix. Eventually, the movie begins to completely turn away from its noir roots and becomes surrealistic horror.In what can be called a virtuoso performance, Mickey Rourke gives Angel a perfect glibness that makes his journey all the more surprising. Balancing pompousness with certain professional drive, Rourke perfectly captures a down and out gumshoe. Sharing his every scene with Rourke, De Niro shines in a purposely understated role. As Cyphre, De Niro is at his most stoic and creepy in only a few scenes.At the time of its release, the real interest of the movie came in the appearance of then Cosby Kid Lisa Bonet. As the gorgeous but mysterious Epiphany Proudfoot, she gives an against type performance that showed its power by getting her fired on the role that made her famous. The sex scene that most scarred her innocent persona is anything but sexy and is something you have to see for yourself.For me though, the ultimate standout of the film's legacy lies in the brilliant cinematography by Michael Seresin. In terms of capturing a film's visuals with its atmosphere, Seresin's photography is some of the best I've seen in the horror genre or any other. Along with Seresin, Parker uses another one of his regulars, Trevor Jones, to create the perfectly toned music for the film.Angel Heart is a prime example of a filmmaker creating a perfectly envisioned piece of work. Everything about the movie fits the genre to a perfect pitch and follows its dark visage to the very end. Criminally underrated at the time of its release, its finally found an audience ever since its release on DVD, and rightfully so. A horror film this brilliant shouldn't be missed by anyone remotely interested in horror or mystery films.</fullReview>

There are certain conflicts in th movie, deliberate I'm sure, first one to clear up is how Johnny managed to kill the young boy,and eat his heart on New Years Eve.Doctor Fowler admitted to Harry that he was a virtual zombie when he arrived but soon recovered.A man called Edward Kelley and an unknown young woman took him away.They went to Times Square and stole Harry's heart,and all moved south, so why was Harry still in Brooklyn? Also why did Margaret not recognise him? She had his dog tags.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) Voodoo and Satanic inspired film-noir detective story that at first starts out as a run of the mill missing person investigation by Brooklyn private dick Harry Angel, Mickey Rourke, that leads him to New Orleans and Algeries LA. and the discovery that the person he's looking for is not at all dead or brain-dead, as he was lead to believe. The person in question is very alive and well and in full control of his mental facilities.Contacted by a Mr. Winesap, Dann Florek, to take a case of a client of his Angel meets him at this Harlem church that seems to practice Voodoo blood sacrifices instead of Christian ethics. Meeting Winsap together with his really strange and creepy-looking client a Mr. Louis Cyphre, Robert De Niro,makes Angel's blood run cold but when he's offered $5,000.00 for his services, from Cyphre, he immediately agrees to take the job.Told by Cyphre that he's looking for this former night-club and USO crooner a Johnny Favorite aka John Liebing who was badly injured in the last war in the battle of North Africa. Being told by Cyphre that Favorite suffered severe brain damage and was brought back to the states and admitted to this private sanitarium, The Sarah Dodd Harvest Memorial Clinic, outside the town of Poughkeepsie in upstate New York.As Cyphre goes on with his story he tells Angel that it was always believed that Favorite was a patient at the clinic until recently when he went to visit him finding out, now twelve years later in 1955, that he either escaped or was smuggled out of the sanitarium back in 1943 and has never been seen or heard from since. You get a very uncomfortable chill up your spine, like Angel does, when Cyphre tells him that he's looking for Favorite for one and one reason only: to have him pay off a debt that he owes him and get the impression from Cyphre's tone of voice that the debt is to be paid not in money but in blood!Eerie and nerve-racking thriller with Harry Angel trying to track down and find, dead or alive, the very illusive Johnny Favorite with the leads he comes up with in his investigation back in NYC has Angel traveling to New Orleans. Tracking down the daughter of Mrs. Proudfoot, Johnny Favorite's lover in New Orleans during the war, 17 year-old Epiphany, Lisa Bonet, Angel gets involved with a number of strange and terrifying Voodoo cults. It turns out that Epiphany, like her late mom, is a high Voodoo priestess. The involvement with Epiphany and her fellow cultists results in Angel being hit or exposed to some kind of Voodoo hex that drives him to the brink of insanity if not beyond it. As Angel slowly uncovers the mystery of just who this Johnny Favorite really is and if he's still alive everyone he comes in contact with in his investigation ends up brutally murdered in what seems like a number of blood curdling and gruesome Voodoo rituals.Angel finally gets to the bottom of what all this Johnny Favorite business really is all about when he gets in touch with a Mr. Ethan Kursemark,Stocker Fontelieu, who like his late daughter Margaret, Charlotte Rampling,is an expert as well as practitioner of the Black Arts. It was Margaret who Angel first got in contact with in New Orleans that resulted, from her talking to him, in her murder where her heart was ripped out of her body!It's after his talk with Ethan, and later with Cyphre himself, that Angel realizes the real reason why he was picked by Cyphre to investigate Johnny Favorites strange disappearance in that he himself had a lot to do with it! As the shocking truth about Angel's strange connection to Favorite comes out from his subconscious mind Angel loses it ending up mumbling to, and trying to convince, himself that it's all just a bad dream or nightmare, as the movie ends, but knowing full well deep down and in his soul that it's Not! it's the Real McCoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, i saw it for the first time in '89, and i was quite...confused. I just couldn't believe the end : i just draw up from my armchair. Not because De Niro was finally Satan(that i understood in the 5 first minutes), but that Harry Angel was "who you know". I had to see it one more time to understand the whole plot. Since i saw it about 10 times, and then i haven't watch it for about 5 years up to today. It's just incredible : the movie looks absolutely not almost 20 years old !!! And this darkness ! I can't remember i saw a so dark movie. The painting of hell with the death in black dress, the lift and these ventilators just get me sick. I had also forgotten a main point in the end of the story : the love story with Lisa Bonet reminded me the recent Old Boy. I thought any American movie could suggest this taboo subject, no i just have to revise my judgement. PS : Rourke is a very great actor : look at him : during all the movie, when you know the plot, you can notice that he "knows" something that he cannot remember. He as just the perfect attitude in this very difficult role. Well, i would like to add that it is more a symbolic film that Devil's advocate, and really worth to be recommended for Alan Parker's work. Also for Trevor Jones'.</fullReview>

It also won the Mystery Writers POE Award. In a nutshell, both movie &amp; book are both brilliant. Pacino &amp; De Nero are both exceptional actors; how you compare them is beyond my apparently limited understanding, as is also how you compare the films; they do not come close to tackling the same subject. And poor Keanu- on his best day he is nowhere near as good as Roarke on his worst.

		<fullReview>The film starts with a lone figure walking down a dark alleyway passing a mutilated corpse, who is this figure? See if you can work it out. This kick starts the amazing piece of cinema that is Alan Parker's Angel Heart.Mickey Rourke slides into his role as the sleazy P.I. Harry Angel, relishing the character and chewing the scenery as he goes. He is hired by, the absolutely terrifying, De Niro (as Louis Cyphre) to track down the popular singer Johnny Favourite. What starts as a seemingly simple missing person case, turns into a tale of all out horror as Angel careers closer and closer to the mind of Johnny Favourite. Paranoia sets in and elaborate dream sequences help to show his fractured mind, with Alan Parker packing in some of the greatest and indeed chilling Manichean, among other,imagery&gt; helping to create an indescribably tense atmosphere. Lisa Bonet also provides some excellent support, and misleads the audience as well as Angel.The ending itself is a kick to the senses, and makes for the most visceral and indeed scary ends to a film. Overall a true classic, that deserves more attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was amazing. I always judge a great movie by the criteria: Is it good enough to watch again and again. The answer to this movie is yes. This movie is an unfolding mystery starring Mickey Rourke and Robert DeNiro. First off the scenery was spectacular. The movie is supposed to take place in the 50's, and it captures the film noir scenery perfect. I have to give credit to the director Alan Parker, who has an impressive list of films directed. Also amazing is Mickey Rourke's performance. Barfly is probably on my top ten list, and it starred Mickey Rourke. I loved his performance in that movie. It is amazing that he starred in two great movies in the same year. Both this movie and Barfly was released in 1987, and both movies in my opinion are required viewing. 1987 was an amazing year for Rourke. It makes me think maybe he sold his soul to the devil, just like the character he played. Prior to seeing Barfly and Angel Heart, ironically, I thought Rourke was a worthless actor. I saw him in Harley Davidson and the Marlboro man, and I could not understand all the hype he was receiving for being an actor. Now I understand! The story itself is complex, and it leaves the viewer to come to conclusions and answer their own questions. A look at the IMDb.com message board will verify this. There are many posts with questions trying to figure out answers to the movie. Repeat viewing will help you answer these questions.92/100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hard-boiled making ends meet private dick Harry Angel is given a routine missing person case by the mysterious Robert de Niro. This is one of my personal favourites. The first time I watched it the tension towards the end was unbelievable. There were only a few minutes left in the movie, yet Harry was nowhere near finding the missing Johnny Favourite. What a payoff though!This is the best Rourke performance I have ever seen. A shower and a shave and he would have been a great Philp Marlowe. You see his acting skill here and think he should have been one of the great actors in movies. What a waste.De Niro is very clever as the stranger in a beautifully played cameo. He is just so cool. Parker's direction is full of great stylisation, slick editing and cryptic images. It's neatly paced.Charlotte Rampling and Lisa Bonet do the needful. But this is about Rourke, prodded on by de Niro towards the terrifying payoff. Harry's anguish, guilt and horror are wonderfully realised by Rourke. The real life '50s settings make the movie all the more effective. The soundtrack is just so appropriate.A cult classic if ever there was one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really loved this film when I first saw it. I'm not one who goes to great lengths trying to anticipate the ending, so I wasn't way ahead of the game when the big revelations came. I discovered them at the same time the character did, which made the film much more enjoyable than otherwise. This was Mickey Rourke's best work. I thought that he had a huge future ahead of him, but it really didn't pan out. Between this and Barfly, I figured him to have a lot of range, but apparently I was wrong. As for Lisa Bonet, I thought she was very good here, too. I never saw her TV character, but it didn't seem surprising that she would want to play against type in her first big film. Too bad it didn't work out for her either. De Niro looked to be having great fun with his role. Good marks to Charlotte Rampling, also. I never understood why Angel had his "problem" with chickens, unless it was just to set up that one little throwaway vignette in one of the chase scenes. I also do not understand the repeated motif of fans. But anyway, this is a very good flick, even with its convoluted plot. Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me, Alan Parker always used to be one of the most genius directors ever as Parker can create atmospheres like no one else can... "Angel heart" featuring Mickey O'Rourke and the as always godlike Robert De Niro is one of the more difficult movies from Parker. Rourke plays the jobless detective Angel who is hired by a man called Louis Cyphre (=Lucifer) who wants to know if a crooner is still alive or not. Little by little Angel is involved in a web in where black magic rules and the VCR might be the perfect tool to investigate some difficult parts (as all by all this movie ain't easy) but the end clears a lot... Not Parker's best one therefore the cinematographic arts are just a bit too aged but still an enjoyable movie and I am sure that from now on you will look at De Niro's fingernails in every movies you'll see by him....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful case of Movie-itis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first, credit where it's due. Respect to the man who has kept Alan Parker in work (rather than vice versa) - Michael Seresin for a wonderful piece of cinematography. This is a truly stunning movie - its visual imagery being its most outstanding asset: evocative, haunting, provocative, emotional, memorable - indelible from the mind, in fact. The music to go with it is brilliant as well.Good performances too, all round, from a very well cast selection of actors, though Rourke if anything is the one to disappoint ever so slightly. He doesn't really do hidden depths.However the film itself, in terms of plot and story as well as characterisation, is weak. There's a lot of thematic cliche in here but also cliche of scene - Rourke chatting up the plain (Hollywood plain of course not actually plain) nurse in the mental hospital to get to see the restricted file was just one of a number of particularly hoary devices that will get you yawning. Just kick back, look around and watch the spectacle - isn't it well shot? Aren't the colours great and the costumes and the lighting?*Spoiler* The reason why this film is not up there in the Hall of Fame is due to the weakness of its basic plot foundation. And I don't just mean the idea that Rourke has managed to receive a perfect face transplant in 1950. Whether or not you predict the twist will depend on how good you are at predicting this kind of thing. It is neither obvious nor impossible. However, the twist is enforced using movie-itis which is a cheap and increasingly overused tactic.So what is movie-itis?Movie-itis is the art of fooling an audience into believing something by simply not showing them things that they might expect to see and passing it off as if those things have not happened. They can do this because movies habitually cut out boring, daily activities of their characters - going to the toilet, transporting themselves from one place to another, that sort of thing. We are trusting the filmmakers to show us everything relevant and cut out the uninteresting. Films with movie-itis use our expectations of that technique to mask the fact that they have cut out crucial events/moments/ideas and only reveal that they have occurred at the end. It's a way of generating a mystery where there is none. The mystery is just a question of perspective, something that exists solely within the confines of the film. What's more, the mystery is obscured by this slight of hand - we are misdirected into examining unprofitable avenues because we assume we are in command of on-screen events.Better films leave indicative clues, but they're rarely powerful clues. In this case, it's Rourke's dreams (I do not mean other clues in the film that really do help you guess what's going on, eg the names). These indicative hints are not the kind of clues that would allow you to guess what's going on, they're the kind of clues which allows the filmmaker (and the filmgoer) to point at as something that corresponds with the actions you're not seeing. An excuse, if you like, for leaving the pivotal events out. In other words, you need to know/guess the twist first - without the clues' help - before the clues make sense.The counter-argument would be that this film exclusively shows you events from Rourke's perspective, which is true. You don't know what he's done because he doesn't consciously know himself. In exactly the same way, the 6th Sense shows that movie from Willis's perspective. It's artificial, of course, because of the 1st-person, 3rd-person dichotomy. The 3rd-person perspective of cinema means we assume that we are separated from the protagonist's consciousness. We can literally see things he can't see (ie the wall behind where he is) and assume naturally that we are watching him, rather than viewing the world as he is viewing it. In other words, it's never made explicit that we're not seeing it all, omniscience which is of course the default condition of cinema. Nevertheless, I'm not saying movie-itis is an unfair or broken technique. In its own way it has a climactic payoff. Many successful films have employed it. But it doesn't make for truly great cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******Minor Spoilers********When I first saw this movie I found it deeply terrifying on a level that was profound. Part of it was because I kept expecting until almost the end for Robert DeNiro to pull up the mask and reveal he was just some wacky cultist, not the Devil hisself. Some parts of it still work, and the feeling is there of a doomed man finding himself inexorably drawn to an ending he doesn't want to face. Probably what worked for me most was having the movie set in the fifties, which kept giving me the feeling we were watching events that had already been done and passed by, the only one out of the loop was Mickey Rourke. However, many parts are simply throw away or just plain silly. The body lying in the street at the beginning, or Lisa Bonet's child at the end with those yellow eyes. Plus the one question that was never answered--why had the Devil waited years to collect his due? Overall it's still an effective horror story, just not as scary as it once was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dark brooding presence of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angel Heart is set in the dark side of 50's America. Micky Rourke is a chain smoking, unpleasant private eye. He's called by a lawyer working on behalf of the mysterious and equally unpleasant "Louis Cypher" (Robert DeNiro). Mr. Cypher is trying to track down a lost contract, and hires private detective Harold Angel (Rourke).The film is brilliantly shot, darkness and light contrasted to excellent effect. Fans, stairs and lifts keep appearing for no apparent reason, 'pinging' our senses for attention - symbols of a yet darker and nastier turn ahead in the plot. Stifling heat add to the overall discomfort of the backdrop as Angel is thrown into a web of brutal murders and sinister connections. The casting is excellent, everyone is in the right place. The cinematography is wonderful and the overall attention to detail is superb. Both Mickey Rourke and DeNiro are on top form, trying to 'out-do' each other.Lisa Bonet is every bit as effective in her lesser role. Having grown up with her as the sweet, innocent, young actress from the Cosby Show I was more than a little surprised.Rourke carries the film along cleverly and sincerely against a backdrop of dysfunctional characters and locations. As we watch Angel's life go to pieces he is thrown from one situation to another in the quest for the lost contract.This is a superb combination of detective/horror story. It works brilliantly well when you consider the dime-novel it came from is no great shakes. Outstanding!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since not many people have commented, I guess I'll take up some space. If you are thinking about seeing this movie, please see it! This is Mickey Rourke at his brightest and best. He is absolutely amazing. Every scene he just radiates with such undeniable beauty that it will be a mistake for admirers of Mick not to see it. I love this movie because Mick was so beautiful. But on top of that, the movie was excellent. Rourke made alot of actors look sorry by comparison. He showed unbelievable depth in his acting. You get the impression he is actually experiencing it. You may have to see the movie at least three times in order to get the twisting plot. But it will probably be so interesting to you, you probably won't mind! Mick really was the prince of fine actors. Bonet was most lovely and showed herself an incredible talent. Bonet and Mickey shut the film down and made this one of the best movies I have ever seen! And Bob did his thing too. All the other actors really did well also. It was great in every sense. Mickey was perfection!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Films dont come any better than this. This is an excellent adaptation of an excellent book, Falling Angel by William Hjortsberg. The plot has all the elements of a Chandler story mixed in with devil worship, voodoo and the stifling atmosphere of the Deep South. Mickey Rourke's performance as gumshoe Harry Angel is the best of his career, without doubt worthy of some kind of industry recognition. Robert De Niro's Louis Cyphre is played with the kind of calm, self congratulating detachment that comes of knowing the inevitability of Angel's demise. Angel's brief is to find out the location of crooner Johnny Favorite, whose wartime injuries left him a virtual vegetable in need of constant supervision. Cyphre, having a 'contract' with the vanished singer, employs Angel to ascertain his whereabouts. As Angel brings his dishevelled form of inquiry to the case, things start to happen, bad things. All the key people who Angel talks to end up getting bumped off in particularly nasty fashion. Its as if the singer is stalking his links to the past and getting rid of them one by one. Circumstantially, Harry is becoming the prime suspect and can feel the noose tightening around his neck. The ending is a finale of epic proportions, a terrifying realisation that rocks the viewer and ties up the twisting plot. The acting, direction, camerawork, story , settings and dark soundtrack make this film an absolute classic. If you like your films dark, scary, psychological and intelligent, then this is the film for you. Enjoy.</fullReview>

It may take a couple of viewings to catch the twist at the end... The sound I thought was surprisingly good for a movie that old... I dont know what happened to Roorke?

		<fullReview>This is a beautifully told but very ugly story that will stay with you for days (and nights) afterwards. The cinematography in this movie is striking. It is a tribute to and a step beyond the greatest B&amp;W film noir of the past. It ranks up there with "BladeRunner" and "SE7EN" as modern standards of light and shadow as character. New Orleans has never looked more elegantly seedy. This marvellous photography is used by Alan Parker to create a very ominous and nasty atmosphere, which is perfect for this clever detective tale gone gothic horror. The tone of this film is palpabele. Mickey Rourke is excellent here, easily the most complete and interesting performance of his career, and DeNiro looks like he's having fun as Mr. Cyphre. Unlike recent films such as "Fallen" and especially "The Devil's Advocate" there are no cop-out endings that ring unfair or false, just the inevitable conclusion to the story of a doomed soul.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Oozes Thick Atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mostly a detective story, with a little voodoo and supernatural thrown in, "Angel Heart" stands out from other films for its style and thick atmosphere. Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is a two-bit private detective who takes a job that requires him to find a mysterious and famous crooner from the past, named Johnny Favorite.The story, set in 1955 and mostly in New Orleans, is fairly convoluted, with important events taking place a dozen years before 1955. As such, the dialogue contains an enormous amount of exposition, combined with some flashbacks. I think the script could have been improved by including a prologue set in 1943, showing generalized events without giving away plot twists. In so doing, all that exposition could have been avoided.Despite a somewhat weak script, the film veritably oozes heavy atmosphere. Sultry music; interior shadows and muted colors; and those 1950s visuals, with its hairstyles, old cars, and drab clothes combine to create an eerie framework conducive to murder and spiritualism in the bayou country of Louisiana, a delicious cinematic cocktail of mystery and suspense.Nonprofessional actors fill some roles, which heightens a sense of realism, as does the filming of most scenes in real locations instead of built sets. A few scenes are too violent and bloody for my taste, but are mercifully rare.In the role of Harry Angel, former boxer Mickey Rourke gives a really good performance, physical and spontaneous. Indeed, most performances in this film are above average.The script is the film's somewhat weak link. But it is more than offset by potent imagery, atmospheric music, on-location filming, appropriate casting and good performances. "Angel Heart" is a fine detective thriller with an atmosphere that's as thick as homemade jambalaya.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mickey Rourkes finest Performance!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: Angel Heart (1987)Director: Alan ParkerCast: Mickey Rourke,Robert Deniro, Lisa Bonet Review: I cant believe that I had let this movie pass me by! And I call myself a horror fan...anyhows, lets get to the point. This film is awesome! Its great! And I'm really, really glad that I saw it. Robert Deniro and Mickey Rourke, it cant be all that bad right? Right! The story is about a private detective called Harry who is called upon by a man called Louis Cypher to look for another man called Favorite that disappeared many years ago and owes him something. Harry needing the money takes the job and starts to investigate who this guy 'favorite' is and what he did. The journey takes him deep into the heart of voodoo, new Orleans and devil worship! Alan Parker has delivered a truly dark film. I was impressed by the look and feel of the movie which is one of its strongest assets. The film starts out in Los Angeles, kind of like a film noirish dark alley smoke coming out of the streets, fans blowing in the summer heat type of place. Thing is, the movie only gets darker and darker... the deeper Harry is to uncovering the mystery, the darker the film gets. Everything is dirty and steamy. Hot, wet and bloody. As you can see I absolutely loved the visual aspect of this film. But what about its performances? Well Mickey Rourke is the main star here and he delivers the goods. In fact, I think Ill say that this is definitely one of his best -if not the best performance- of his life. The last frames of this film display that this is truly one of the best actors who's sort of disappeared into nowhere. I certainly I'm looking forward to his next film. Lisa Bonet delivers another great performance, too bad she is also hardly ever seen. And speaking of seeing Lisa Bonet...for those of you guys out there with a hard on for her, check this movie out! I think she was only like 18 or something when she did it! But damn it there's a steamy sex scene in which she goes all the way with Rourke and its sexy as hell. Now we understand why Lenny Kravitz wrote all those love songs for her. But get this the scene is not only steamy...its artistic as hell! Once you see the dance of blood that goes on in these sequences well you will be impressed as well, Parker here shows complete domain over using visuals as art.And then there's Deniro. He is good as always...but on this film, the role he plays gives you a real nice chill down your spine. First off he looks menacing as hell with his goatee and his long hair and those long fingernails. He has got this deadly serious tone to him, you don't want to mess with this guy, every word that he spits out sounds threatening. The delivery of his dialog is excellent. Also my hats of to Alan Parker for writing an excellent screenplay.The atmosphere on this film never lets off. Even if the movie starts out in a big city landscape...its a dark and shadowy big city! Then it moves to the bayou in New Orleans and things really start to cook up. Right down to the moment where we witness a real life Voodo Dance ceremony. Alan Parker is a great director, heck who wasn't moved and shocked by Midnight Express? With Angel Heart I really think he delivered yet another great film which should certainly rank way up there among his best films ever.Basically, this movie took me by surprise and I enjoyed every second of it. Its a mystery that you will want to devour slowly. Like a delicious meal that you just want to really savor. A slow boiler for sure, but a good one! Review: 5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Different Prospective on Angel Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite movie, along with Scarface, because of the acting and sets, putting one back in time in the mid fifties. Rourke truly was Harry Angel in this movie, and because of this has never been the same since. My view is that Johnny Favorite only committed the first murder when he became the soul of Harry Angel. The murders of Fowler, Sweet, Krusemark, Kelly, and Epiphany were committed by Cyphere (Satan) to play with Angel's mind and get him to in effect to admit to all of the murders after Epiphany's killing. Cyphere, in the end, won by having Angel admit to all of the aforementioned murders and relinquishing his earthly life to the "chair" for having broken the contract with Cyphere. Note in one of the last scenes how Cyphere picks up Angel's gun and dog tags in Krusemark's apartment before killing Epiphany and framing Angel. Truly compelling acting by Rouke, De Niro, "Fowler", Rampling, and "Sweet" to have one watch this movie over and over. My favorite line is "Sure I know what an attorney is. It's like a lawyer, only the bills are bigger".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very strange thriller with a twist ending that you will either love or hate.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alan Parker crafts a weird, absorbing, but ultimately rather silly mystery-thriller with this film. Taken from a novel by William Hjortsberg, and adapted for the screen by Parker himself, this movie undeniably contains its fair share of intriguing moments and ideas, but it stumbles at the very death by providing a twist revelation that stretches all the credibility that has gone before. I know of people who rather like the ending, but in my eyes it just doesn't quite fit. The film unravels as an engrossing and perfectly well-crafted mystery, but the final scene slides off into the realms of Faustian horror and fantasy. It's an ending that you will either love or hate?. I hated it. Having said that, there is enough in the earlier sections of the film to admire, and it would be unfair of me to dismiss the whole film simply because the final few minutes don't work in my opinion.In 1955, New York private eye Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by a mysterious client named Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to track down a missing man. The missing man, a big band singer called Johnny Favorite, seemingly broke the terms of a contract with Cyphre and is now sought by the latter for his deception. Angel quickly establishes that Johnny Favorite went to fight in the Second World War and was severely injured during the fighting. However, Angel also discovers that Johnny was mysteriously taken away from the nursing home where he was under care after the War, and no-one seems quite sure of his present whereabouts. Angel follows a trail of clues to the voodoo community of New Orleans, where he meets poor bayou girl Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet) and finds himself lusting after her. Gradually, Angel becomes more and more aware that he is involved in a very sinister mystery indeed, the solution to which may affect him more personally than he could ever imagine.The good points include strong performances by Rourke and De Niro, the former holding the film together with his edgy interpretation of the scruffy, moody hero; and the latter doing well in his handful of scenes as the creepy client. Thrown into the mix are various bloody murders, elements of satanism and occultism and lots of doomy dialogue, none of it remotely convincing although it DOES lend the film a suitably nightmarish atmosphere. Staying on the plus side, Trevor Jones provides a good score which adds a degree of creepiness to the proceedings. On the negative side, Parker gets rather too sidetracked by what he perceives to be the seedier aspects of his film. The violence is deliberately ? and excessively ? unpleasant, and there's a bizarrely pretentious (and controversial) scene in which Rourke and Bonet have sex, somewhat vigorously, while blood drips down onto them from the ceiling. At 113 minutes, the film feels slightly overlong, or at least certainly too lengthy for this particular story. And the twist ending is a let-down too, as noted already.Angel Heart remains worth watching for its intriguing elements, but on the whole it is a rather flawed film which falls agonisingly short of its potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Mix of Horror and Noir!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angel Heart is the successful fusion of two great genres; detective mystery and demonic horror. However, this film is a mystery first, and a horror film second; this is shown by the way that the main emphasis is put on the mystery, and not on gory set pieces and the supernatural side of the movie. The film plays out much like your average neo-noir for the most part, in that a private detective is hired and by means of talking to several people, he is able to follow up his leads to solve the mystery. Angel Heart is no normal murder mystery, however; as within the film is a strong satanic influence, and that is where the film draws it's originality from.The story of Angel Heart revolves around a man, Louis Cyphre (a clever variation on 'Lucifer'), that hires a private dick (Harry Angel) to find a man (Johnny Favourite) that 'owes him a contract'. As previously mentioned; the film plays out like a normal mystery thriller, with the detective investigating his leads and the mystery progressing from there. Angel Heart is very intricate, and this therefore requires the viewer to pay attention to the movie. This is a quality that is admirable in any mystery movie; it makes sure that the audience will pay attention to the film, as missing a moment of the movie could result in you losing the plot. Angel Heart moves slowly and intricately, but it has more than enough to keep anyone interested, most notably an intriguing storyline, some lovely visuals and great performances from all concerned. Angel Heart features a stand out performance from Mickey Rourke; a man that made a few good movies in the 80's, and then somewhat and unfortunately disappeared from our screens (although he did have a great little part in 2003's best movie; Once Upon a Time in Mexico). Mickey Rourke creates just the right atmosphere for his character; Harry Angel is from New York, and this is shown by Rourke's thick accent, the man also has a lot of charisma, which is shown in the character. Aside from Rourke, the movie's other stand out performance comes from Robert DeNiro, in a great little turn as the Devil. Robert DeNiro is a fantastic actor, and he really shows it here; with just a small part in the film, DeNiro manages to make a lasting impression. The way he portrays the character of Satan is also pretty close to the mark of what I would expect Satan to be; it's evil, but it's very subtle evil. The Devil in Angel Heart doesn't go round casting spells or killing people, but just his mannerisms alone are enough to make the audience see that the character is evil; and that really is quite frightening.Despite the obvious openings for the movie to be over the top, it isn't. Despite it's several brutal murders, Angel Heart is very restrained and subtle; and that works to its credit. In fact, there's only one real out of the ordinary part in Angel Heart; and that's the part where Lucifer's and the child's eyes change towards the end. The only other thing of that ilk is the demonic ceremony, which isn't shown on screen. Everything else that we see in the movie stays much within the realms of the real world, and that is another frightening aspect of the film.Overall, Angel Heart is a great movie. Its story is interesting and intricate, the acting is fine and it's also very original. All in all; a great film that should be missed by nobody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night I watched the film Frailty and I really liked it. I gave the film rating 10! So I wanted to watch something similar and Angel Heart was suggested in many sites. And so I just finished the film and ... It is far far from Frailty. OK, it is some kind of a mystery and horror and psichological thriller but this one was really slow paced, boring at times and overall I am not really thrilled about it.The highlight of the film for me is Mickey Rourke acting as well as Lisa Bonet's ( though I must say I did not recognized her in that satanistic/ritual dancing scene. I thought it was a completely different girl so was rally surprised when they mention in the film it was her!). I liked some of the scenes for their moody and surrealistic setting ( like that Cony Island beach scene and sex scene with blood/rain). From the first moment he was introduced, I knew he was a devil ( De Niro). It was kinda obvious but his role/acting was not particularly memorable to me.The first scene and that dead body... Is that the man /young soldier? Or just a random murdered person?All in all, this film is somewhere in the middle. My rating is five which means it is just interesting as to not make me stop watching it ( though I was giving a thought to).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel Heart is a sharp looking, well acted, tightly directed dark thriller that is quite complex and well made. Director Alan Parker blends mystery private detective story with supernatural horror very well, with lots of atmosphere and suspense to boot. The cast is excellent with Mickey Rourke as the leading man and scruffy faced private detective and employed by the mysterious figure Louis Cypher to track down crooner Johnny Favorite. Deniro is great as the prince of darkness and throw in Lisa Bonet of Cosby Show fame to provide the audience with some great eye candy. Angel Heart is quite violent and contains a lot of nudity as well, but pulls off being a classy production as the subject matter and story demands the level of sex and violence contained here. Angel Heart predates the somewhat similar Devil's Advocate and in my opinion Angel Heart is a superior film and is ten times better. That, I must digress is a matter of personal taste, but this is a platform to express ones opinions and that is exactly what I am doing. Awesome movie by the way, Angel Heart is great stuff.</fullReview>

Still those movies which are created now and showing the old time are very similar to this movie. They used two great actors Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro but story more revolve around mickey. One thing they are showing is very irritating that is Robert's nails again and again they are showing it except that everything is good. So, movie starts with mickey and he is private detective, Robert is his client and gave him the work to find the missing person. Than mickey started his search and try contact everyone who knows him and he found out that guy is related to dark magic also. Who so he contacted is getting killed than he got scared to much. After sometime he found out that his client is Lucifer the demon and he is here to take him down to hell and that guy whom he is searching was himself. He lost his memory 12 year ago living under some other name and he was killing everyone by instruction of the demon. This movie is full of suspense and movie is little slow. If you are fan of mickey you will like this movie. Robert de niro has very less role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all it's not a horror movie. So I don't get why it is categorized in this genre. It's a mystery thriller, with good actors, but even though the idea of the story is not bad I thought it was poorly executed. But I can't blame the actors because Mickey Rourke is a good actor in Angel Heart, nothing bad to say about him. Normally I don't like remakes but for once I think that this movie could be much better if another director would remake it now. In this version there are actually too much things that don't add up or at least are way too complicated to understand. And to me that's not entertaining. It's too bad because the idea was really good. Even though I actually figured out the whole story after just ten minutes it was still hard to follow. I expected more from Angel Heart so I'm slightly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remains in our subconscious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the movie back in 1987 in Madrid with a group of friends.The theater was crowded. When the movie finished and the lights turned on, nobody moved from their seats. the film was so shocking, deep, intelligent, terrifying, that simply we were not able to assimilate what we saw.This is not a usual horror movie. Is extremely psychological. Some days after watching the movie i was under the influence of this feeling: a kind of unusual fear, which lies deeply at the bottom of our subconscious . Ancestral, ancient fear. In order to cause this feeling, the director has turned to create a claustrophobic atmosphere, highly mysterious and disturbing: spiral staircases, shadows, opening and closing doors, intense and visceral soundtrack full of subliminal sounds, and most important: an intelligent and totally different plot from what we've seen so far.It is also a story about karma and it's remuneration. The discovery of who we really are. Fate.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably De Niro's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These are some of the best acting performances I've seen from De Niro, Rourke, and Bonet. It is probably De Niro's creepiest role. It's also amazing to see the huge difference 25+ years has made in Rourke's appearance, while how little Bonet has aged.This flick has the ingredients to keep you on the edge of your seat. Aside from the great acting, it is a film noir featuring murder, sex, the occult, two major cities with very different cultures, and a very solid mystery with a twist that I didn't see coming. If you predicted the latter, please let me know in the comments, but precede your post with "SPOILER."While the quality of the video, effects, sound, etc, is not on par with today's technology, which could easily render most movies with such a dark tone sleepy, its aforementioned strengths make this movie a classic and one that you will want to watch more than once?probably not right away, but somewhere down the line, someone will say that they never saw this film, and you will suggest that you both sit down and watch it together. You will probably enjoy watching it the second time around, knowing what to look for.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devilishly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favourite films and yet Alan Parker wasn't the type of director I'd figure could turn in such a dark, gripping voodoo-noir as he does here.It actually hurts the film that you can work out DeNiro's character straight away from the moment he signs his name, but even so Parker ratchets up the tension as he sends 50's private detective on a wild goose (or should that be chicken) race trying to track down an old 30's crooner who, like doomed bluesman Robert Johnson that same decade, fancifully made a similar deal with the devil in exchange for his gift of music. In the end, he didn't have to look so hard, but even with the viewer knowing the denouement well in advance of the finish, still Parker cooks up a pungent gumbo of a plot, with steamy sex, incest, gory murders and diabolical undertones, filmed in a deliberately washed-out way as the film tries so hard to be the black and white noir its director wanted it to be.Extremely well cast and played, Rourke, pre-Botox, gives his face the chance to act and is just right as the persistent but perplexed down-at-heel private detective whose personal journey to ID Johnny Favourite ends with a return ticket to hell. De Niro plays his part with the requisite mix of devilish charm and beguiling charm while the very young Lisa Bonet, fresh-faced and just out of family TV show "The Cosby Show" gives a passable performance, perhaps just lacking that little bit of womanly experience to really have you believe she understands the part. Parker is to be commended for his vision with constantly changing background shots and the use of symbolic totems like old- fashioned electric fans and of course that ever-descending lift. I also loved the Times Square recreation, right in front of the couple kissing in that famous black and white V.E. day photograph (you know the one!)."Angel Heart" is not for the faint-hearted (my wife hated it, for example), but for me it was an engrossing and rewarding watch and certainly made my heart pound a little faster as it reached its climax.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Emulating many non-American filmmakers and American movies' admirers, such as Melville, Polanski or Kurosawa, the British Alan Parker ended up making the best tribute to the movies that nourished his cinematic dreams: a film noir.In '78, Parker proved his value as an atmospheric director with the nightmarish "Midnight Express", but only in the reverse year of '87, he could fully express his personal skills, because of the very requirements of the genre. Indeed, whether you expect a detective story or a horror/thriller, the result has to be highly atmospheric, and in the case of "Angel Heart", the epithet is a huge understatement.The film opens in January 1955, with Mickey Rourke, as a down-at-heel and down-to-earth Brooklyn detective, charming with ladies, cynical at times, but never failing to look sympathetic. On that level, Rourke embodies his role like a successor of Bogie and Brando tailor-made for the 80's. His co-star, not the least, is Robert De Niro as a sinisterly suave rich man, holding a cane under pointing fingernails and a heavy thick beard that makes him look like the evil twin of Martin Scorsese. The film is also stars Lisa Bonet, taking a risky, yet effective, departure from the family-oriented Cosby Show.The beginning feels like a faithful reminiscence of hard-boiled Raymond Chandler's stories, with the typical dark and shadowy shots of New York's streets, until it suddenly takes us to a creepy journey into a weird devil-worship and voodoo-culture in New Orleans. In the process, Angel Heart reveals his fear of chickens and avoidance of mirrors that make his presence in New Orleans even more uncomfortable. His interactions with Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) are effectively creepy but De Niro finds the right note in his performance, keeping so much coolness in a rather hot setting that we never give a second thought about his name.Angel's mission is to find a crooner and WWII veteran named Johnny Favorite, who has an old business to settle with Cyphre. Angel goes to the hospital where Favorite is supposed to be cured from shell-shock, and finds out from the morphine-addict doctor that the records have been falsified to let a man and a woman take Favorite to the South. Locking the doctor without morphine, Angel expects more information, but when he comes back, the doctor strangely turned into a corpse, all signs indicating it was quite a brutal murder. This is the starter of a series of fresh corpses punctuating Angel's track, and pointing the same accusing finger on him.Cyphre meets a reluctant Angel again and accepts to pay him 5000 dollars to find Favorite's new whereabouts in New Orleans. Angel gets in touch with all the persons who knew Favorite, professionally and privately, from a musician to a fortune teller played by Charlotte Rampling, but the closer he gets to the truth, using his street-smarts and occasionally his way with ladies, the more enemies he makes. He tries to contact Favorite's secret love, only to find out that she's dead, leaving her only child, Epiphany Proudfoot, Bonet as a precocious 17-year old mother. A strange relationship grows with a disturbing smell of deviation, peaking at the infamous love scene.Naturally, Alan Parker indulges himself to the most gruesome details like during the frenetic sex scene, when pours of rains turn into blood, as to suggest a disturbing correlation between sex and violence, as if both were the rotten fruits of the same evil tree. The sordid details don't shock either because the religious undertones that fill the story make them strangely acceptable. The merit of the disturbing voodoo-scene where an entranced Bonet slits a chicken's throat and hysterically dance with her blood-covered face is to desensitize us enough to the sight of blood to handle the ultimate confrontation.So it comes to this, "Angel Heart" is a film of heavy, threatening and nightmarish atmosphere, a sort of dead-trap no one can get away from it, not even Angel, and this is why the conclusion was the only satisfying one, it does provide disturbing answers but we never discuss their plausibility because we had already been plunged in that supernatural universe, made of animal sacrifices, creepy talismans, smelly herbs and heart-pounding cries. And the ending makes the cinematography's point, by highlighting the curse of a humanity carrying evil germs in its dirty womb, from the sordid streets of New York to the dirty swamps of the Bayou."Angel Heart" has often been praised for being a mix of "Chinatown" and "The Exorcist", but in its own way, Alan Parker recreated the 50's more realistically than Polanski's treatment of the 30's, and with its predominance of black and red, some details gets even scarier than "The Exorcist", I'm thinking of the sex scene with Lisa Bonet that even rivals with the infamous crucifix moment. Visually speaking, the film is a spectacular masterpiece showing how far a director can pushes the button of morbidity, almost having fun with it. And to keep on the religious vocabulary, the film is blessed with magnificent cities and stairs shot, working as a true homage of German expressionist cinema, making the color feel like it's black and white.And God, there is Rourke's performance that even surpasses De Niro during the mind-blowing last minute. Both Angel's coming-to-realization and your own understanding of "Angel Heart", cut straight to yours, literally. And I have goose bumps remembering his raspy scream and his repeated denial "I know who I am". Why, one thing you sure is, Mickey is one hell of an actor, and your performance as Angel, proves it.The most memorable shot of "Angel Heart" is of an old Otis elevator cage interminably descending into an unknown destination ? and while watching the film, I had the feeling I was the one trapped in that cage with Alan Parker as a sadistic bellboy grinning at the anticipation of what I would find when the door opens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Devil is in the detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angel Heart" hoodwinks its audience even more than the plot hoodwinks its characters in a movie that cleverly combines the supernatural with a film noir style mystery.The story involves Harold Angel, played by Mickey Rourke, who is hired by the saturnine Louis Cyphre, played by Robert De Niro, to track down Johnny Favourite, a moderately well known crooner who disappeared years before. Favourite owes Cyphre a debt, the nature of which is not revealed until the end of the movie. Cyphre makes it clear that Angel was not chosen by chance and is offered $5000 to take the case.After a number of strange encounters in New York, Angel follows a lead to New Orleans, where he eventually finds people who knew Favourite. Among these are two women: Margaret Krusemark, played by Charlotte Rampling, a former lover of Favourite; and Epiphany Proudfoot, played by Lisa Bonet who Angel spies in a steamy voodoo ritual.Nearly all the people Angel tracks down that have a connection to Favourite are killed shortly after. Angel becomes more and more troubled by the case, and is suspected by the police. Cyphre eventually resolves the mystery with a startling revelation. The credibility of this revelation depends very much on Hollywood's firm faith in plastic surgery to change people to the point where their own mother's wouldn't recognise them.The plot of "Angel Heart" cheats shamelessly, providing an embarrassment of riches for plot hole explorers. The film is based on William Hjortsberg's novel, "Falling Angel", which was set wholly in New York. The book gets you in, and is certainly an original concept, however it does suffer from its fundamental gimmickry, which is also the weakness of the film.The film is opened considerably by moving much of the action to New Orleans; a setting that suits the story's central themes. Mickey Rourke's character, Harry Angel, is perennially sweaty and sleazy. He looks like he could benefit from a packet of those lemon-scented towelettes that are so handy after a meal of Kentucky Fried Chicken. He effects designer stubble on his chin, which owes more to Don Johnson's 1980's "Miami Vice" than to the squared-away look of the 1950's, the period when the film is supposedly set.Some reviewers have accused Robert De Niro of overacting in this film. De Niro, in fact, delivers just about the right level of ham balanced with understatement for what is a totally over-the-top character. Indeed, the prize for the most excessive overacting must go to Epiphany Proudfoot's baby at the end of the film when its eyes light up with a demonic glow; a heavy-handed touch in a movie that uses its other devilish effects judiciously.Trevor Jones' atmospheric, sax-accented score adds considerably to the mood of the film. The cinematography and art direction of "Angel Heart" are impressive, even if there is a fixation on swirling fans and interiors that are reminiscent of the musty clutter of a Peter Greenaway film."Angel Heart" pulls off an outrageous story with flair. For a film that is a hybrid of many genres, "Angel Heart", like the book upon which it is based, is definitely one of a kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ANGEL HEARTI was expecting more and was slightly disappointed.The movie was about a private detective who is hired to find someone. But the person who has hired him is not quite what he seems.The characters in this film are good. I liked Harry Angel, the investigator. He was likable. The guy he is working for, Louis Cyphre, is awesome... if you have seen the movie, you know what I mean. Finally Epiphany Proudfoot was great. The actors playing these characters was also very good. The film stars Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro &amp; Lisa Bonet.I was a little disappointed that Robert DeNiro wasn't in it anywhere near as much as I would have liked. Especially as his character was my favourite.The violence was great in this. It was all psychological. You didn't really see anything throughout the film, but you didn't need to. What you saw was enough to let your imagination work to figure out what happened. There is plenty of blood in this.The movie was slow in places and the story trailed away every now and then.I will give this film 6 out of 10.I did enjoy it, but it should have been better.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

The performances were all excellent with Mickey Rourke easily standing out; he always makes his characters believable and that was most important in this case. Of the others, De Niro was good in the places we saw him although he doesn't have a major part to play; I thought Lisa Bonet did a very reasonable job also. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it certainly has something; and enough something to gain my recommendation.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.8/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For de Niro Famns and more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have not seen this movie and want to, which you are recommended to do, see it for the performance of Robert DeNiro. De Niro has developed a style of acting over the years, which, while otherwise excellent, is recognizable, and at times detracts from the character he is attempting to portray on film. Sometimes he appears to be unable to shed those New York mannerisms, inflections, which, while he remains one of the major actors of this generation, an audience viewer can spot a mile away.In his portrayal of Louis Cypher, all those mannerisms and traits, all those de Niro-isms, are gone. De Niro's character is bone-chilling, blood-curdling, eerie. This was a part in which he apparently immersed himself, both off and on camera. Alan Parker, the brilliant director of this film, has said that de Niro was so unapproachable and eerie on the set, that he decided to allow him to direct himself when the cameras started. De Niro himself says that his portrayal of Cypher was his imitation of Martin Scorcese. If true, that comment is enough to change one's opinion of Scorcese.This is not to say that the supporting cast doesn't measure up. On the contrary. O'Rourke gives one of his best performances; Givens also gives a break-out performance. The other characters, though minor, are convincing and strong.Filmed on location, Parker does a great service in giving us a look of what New Orleans looked like prior to Hurricane Katrina. One can't help but wonder what neighborhoods portrayed in the movie are still standing.If you are a fan of Robert De Niro, you will love this film.</fullReview>

It does not scare you with dirty faces. It do scares you, with its plot, atmosphere, some cut out body parts and blood.The story is all about how a guy, a private detective, gets this case of finding out about a guy Johny Favorite, that whether he is alive or dead. In course, he finds out a lot, and the people to whom he investigates get killed, brutally, by cutting their organs. In the end, he finds out about Johnny, and the secret.Film has a lot of blood and violence; and a sex scene, which is not porn, but is far far away from normal sex scenes, and has nudity (not front) and blood.Watch this movie in relaxed mood and with a strong heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel Heart is directed by Alan Parker and written by William Hjortsberg (novel). It stars Mickey Rourke, Robert De Niro and Lisa Bonet. Music is by Trevor Jones and cinematography by Michael Seresin.Hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphre (De Niro), New York private investigator Harry Angel (Rourke) goes to New Orleans in search of missing WWII veteran Johnny Favourite. But once he gets into the case he finds that nothing much makes any sense. Especially as the bodies start to pile up.A mix of detective mystery thriller laced with voodoo horror, nicely furnished with noirish photography and piped with a suitably eerie musical score, Angel Heart is a Sothern Gothic delight. The plot is a bit too murky for its own good at times, and credulity is stretched to breaking point, but the constant sense of unease and the off kilter flow of Harry Angel's journey, ensures its riveting from the start to its wonderfully twisted ending. Rourke is excellent, a ball of sleazy like confusion, De Niro isn't having to do much and he's not in it nearly enough, but never the less he commands the screen with that 80s presence he was so famed for. While Bonet lets go of all her homespun Cosby show niceties to unleash a naked and bloody woman of intrigue.Enjoy the metaphors, enjoy the hoodwinking, enjoy the cast and certainly enjoy the impressive sheen cloaked all over it. Parker has fun making it, you should have fun watching it unravel in front of you. 7.5/10</fullReview>

Mickey Rourke plays old school detective Harry Angel like a character straight out of a Tom Waits song. De Niro is masterfully understated and steals every scene as the shadowy client that hires Angel. The soundtrack is creepily fitting and the action finds the perfect mix between straight out detective story and all out horror building to an unforgettable climax.

		<fullReview>Agreeing to take on a case, a private detective finds his target's connection to Satanism and black magic far more dangerous than expected and tries to escape them before succumbing to their threats.This was a rather fun entry, though there's some definite problems with it. One of the main issues here is the rather convoluted manner in which the entire mystery is found out, which tends to run all over the place and features a lot of extraneous parts that really could've been streamlined over time as the investigation seems to go on forever without really coming to any real conclusion in most cases, being told rather than fully investigated. That said, the rest of the film is quite enjoyable with a thoroughly involving mystery that needs to be sorted out, a rather potent mixture of black magic and voodoo which creates a nasty atmosphere, an intense and ultimately shocking sex scene thrown in and a rather shocking twist that ends the whole affair nicely. Not too much wrong here, though, so the positives really overwhelm the negatives.Rated R: Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, Full Nudity, an intense sex scene and violence-against-animals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Captivating Detective Story With a Voodoo Horror Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) has a new case, to find a man called Johnny Favourite. Except things aren't quite that simple...First of all, I am used to seeing Mickey Rourke as a deformed mutant humanoid beast. So, as much as I should be embarrassed to admit it, I cannot even recognize him when he looks like a normal and handsome younger man. He is also a good lead actor (though I suppose we know that by now with "The Wrestler").I think of this film as a cross between "Chinatown" and "The Serpent and the Rainbow". It has the detective angle of "Chinatown", with people turning up dead, questionable connections and a private dick who may have to hide from the cops himself (well, that could be "Maltese Falcon", too, I suppose). "Serpent"? Well, just the voodoo aspect, and both films came out about the same time -- this being the better of the two (sorry Wes Craven).I have seen reviews calling this the creepiest performance of Robert DeNiro's career. I will not agree or disagree, but accept it as possible. I mean, I do not normally think of him as a creeper, so what do I compare this to -- "Cape Fear", I guess. Or "Little Fockers".Roger Ebert says director "Parker's films are always made with great gusto, as if he were in up to his elbows and taking no hostages" -- he uses "The Wall" as an example, which is nothing like this film, but they both do have an intensity that any moviegoer ought to appreciate. Ultimately, Ebert calls the film "an exuberant exercise in style" and gives it a bold three and a half stars... I am hesitant to match that, leaning more towards a solid three. But yes, this is that rare good movie that gets overlooked by the target audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A melting pot of suspenseful genres mixed pretty well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angel Heart" is a '50 noir-style murder mystery done in the 1980s in living -- and bleeding -- color. It's a very straightforward story that ends up being more than meets the eye, mixing in horror and satanic elements to become a one-of-a-kind thriller.Private detective Harry Angel (Rourke) takes on a case to locate an old-time crooner named Johnny Favourite, who has been missing since WWII. He is hired by Louis Cyphre (De Niro) who has an "unfinished contract" with Favourite. It's fairly apparent that the devil is owed someone's soul, but Angel doesn't pick up on these clues as obviously as we do. Angel goes from name to name in search of people who knew Favourite and a trail of murder follows mysteriously behind him.Other than the delightfully creepy performance by De Niro, director and adapter Alan Parker deserves the praise for the enjoyable parts of this movie, namely it's suspense. His use of heartbeats for this dreadful suspense effect and the way he intercuts the scenes of shocking discovery with normal ones (such as a boy tap dancing in the streets of New Orleans) is nearly adrenaline-pumping. His depiction of rotating objects such as the fan and elevator cable spool is a bit blunt, but stylishly effective.Being an '80s film, you definitely get a sense of movement toward the modern thriller as we know it today. The style of the film, its pacing, its tendency to sit quietly at times and be introspective -- these are things we've come to know from the genre 20 years later, but as a '50s period piece as well, there's a definite tribute to film noir in the characterization and acting. Rourke's Angel is much like those P.I.s that get in too deep from the '30s and '40s. The dialogue too is very much the same way.Not spectacular but not disappointing, "Angel Heart" is entertaining and certainly unique. People who are into movies that involve elements of satanism, where the devil is a character, will certainly enjoy it more, but most will get enjoyment out of its classic mystery structure and intriguing twist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unstoppable force of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angel heart is a 80's thriller starring Mickey Rourke and Robert Deniro.I was told that angel heart is a really good twisty thriller.So i borrowed it and sat in and watched it with some friends.First of all the performances from Rourke and Deniro (as you would come to expect) were great and the story was very different and very good.The basic plot is that Harry angel is hired by a mysterious client called Louis Cyphre to track down a man by the name of Johnny Favourite. But the more Angel digs he finds more than just a missing persons case he finds a story that leads him into the world of the occult and the macabre.This movie is very chilling and a massive step for Alan Parker.Obviously some people say they can suss out the movies twists within the first 5 minutes. Well let me tell you something, just watch and enjoy the movie don't try to figure out in the opening scenes thats just plain sad.Overall a very good thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mickey Rourke's Finest Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film captivated me when I saw it in the theater back in 1987. I was already somewhat of a Rourke fan, having enjoyed his work in "Rumble Fish" and "The Pope of Greenwich Village". "Angel Heart" made me a believer for good. His performance was so charismatic and raunchy, but also subtle and nuanced. He's the anti-hero. He plays a Private Dick who goes on a wild goose chase through New York and New Orleans, seeking a missing person. That's the basic thrust of the story, but it is filled with twists and turns and menace and mayhem, and the lush photography and spot-on set designs are a pleasure to the eye. It has elements of "Gothic" horror, but it is really more of a mystery/thriller. Despite Robert DeNiro's presence throughout the film, Lisa Bonet's massive sex appeal, and Alan Parker's excellent direction, it is Rourke who carries the film. His acting is so human and true and vulnerable, especially at the film's crescendo, that it leaves a lasting imprint on the memory. Angel Heart is an underrated gem of a film, that although has a cult following, should be more universally honored for it's originality and overall excellence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This piece held my attention throughout. I found the camera work rich an artistic. (I want to see things through another's eyes - not that I'm bored with my point of view, it just adds depth to my world).The blend of the work of so many personalities is always mind-boggling to me; the act of pulling so many visions of the story into a synthetic and believable whole, very nice. This was a pretty seamless effort on the face of it for me. The storyline does not require the mentation of a chess-master to follow. I find that distracting. I guess it is simply for me, an nice composition. The music augments the production without trying to "steal the show". I wish I knew more about who is responsible for shots and angles but I fully enjoyed the camera-work - clean and direct.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just rewatched this movie, something I do from time to time with my favourites and believe me this qualifies on that count. A lot could be said about this movie and judging by all of the other comments it already has been! So I will just say this; it is seldom that you see a movie so well cast, even the smallest part was played to perfection and with great believability. For example, check out the doctor who was killed off in the earlier part of the movie, if he was not off his face when he played the role he deserves an Oscar, so help me. It is this attention to detail that makes Parker such a top notch Director. BUt of course full marks must go to the cast themselves, probably what you caould call an ensemble cast, I suppose. I have to say too that the sound track plays a huge role in setting the mood in this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror film at its apogee.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror film is a difficult discipline. Too much effort to spook, and it becomes comedy. And like comedy, the Gothic movie is prone to pratfalls and corny premise. ANGEL HEART doesn't have this problem. The work takes the riddle of the cat chasing its own tail, and creates some genuinely eerie moments.On a frozen Brooklyn day in the mid 1950s, private detective Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is approached by a prospective client, Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNero), and asked to track down a customer who ran out on an account with him some years previous. The deadbeat, one Johnny Favorite, had a singing career that Cyphre helped him out with some years previously, and has since disappeared. Angel takes the case, which leads him northwest by deep central southern U.S., first up into Harlem, and then down into New Orleans, Louisiana. Angel finds himself in conflict with the sanctified church and a sect rouge voodoo cult, both of which turn out to be red herrings before the story is resolved. He gets a little glimpse of the segregated south, a closer look at voodoo mambo Epiphany Proudfoot (Lisa Bonet in a role that quickly dispensed with her wholesome image on the Cosby show, pant pant pant), and a final reckoning with his own not-so distant past. And wherever he goes, death isn't far behind. I'm told the climax of this piece was quite predictable, but it worked for me back in 1987 when this film came out, and the pacing of the film still works today, in my not-so-humble opinion.ANGEL HEART is a masterful horror-suspense film, one of the best of the 1980s in U.S. film making. It was also a powerful vehicle for Mickey Rourke, who is a very fine actor, despite his misgivings about the profession. The work also contains one of the creepiest closing images, the hint at which is used throughout the film and used quite effectively to the last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost 20 years later...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After almost 20 years since I caught this move in the theaters, I decided to rent the DVD, and remembered why I enjoyed the visual and atmospheric aspects of it.This was Rourke's next appearance after the blockbuster "9 1/2 Weeks" and before "A Prayer for the Dying" and "Barfly", which means it was made while he was just leveling off from the peak of his game as an actor. Rourke said so himself regarding "Angel Heart" that it was a movie he did in order to get the money to pay for the house he was about to lose, and was also around the time that he had realized that acting wasn't giving him what he needed anymore. I have to say, I'm glad he did this one rather than passing it up, as it contains some of the best of his more subtle acting.I must admit that when I saw this in the theater, I turned to my date and said "Gee...Louis Cyphre, huh? A private dick, huh? Lookin' for someone who has gone missing with amnesia, huh? It's going to be him searching for himself - just watch." Well, this truly did annoy my date, who brushed off my observation (which I thought was pretty evident to anyone with a brain) and I simply watched the film, treating what I'd already figured to be true as merely incidental to the film and enjoyed how the story was told.And told beautifully it was! Alan Parker and his production team of cinematographer Michael Seresin, production designer Brian Morris, &amp; editor Gerry Hambling, create an incredibly atmospheric, rich and lush film worth seeing. For Parker's first venture into making a thriller movie, it was, for it's time, a completely original and welcomed approach to a much-abused genre.Watching the DVD today truly did please me for a few reasons. The main factor I appreciated about the DVD's special features were the segments devoted to the truths about voudon. The parts, titled "Voodoo...The Truth - Voodoo in the Madia" and "New Orleans Voodoo Connection: History of Voodoo in New Orleans" plus "Dances of Worship: The Meaning of Dance and Music in Voodoo Worship" and so on, showed a great responsibility on the part of the DVD's creators to dispel the much-negatively-portrayed religious belief/way of life of many people around the world, as well as telling the truth about how many lies this movie/the novel contained. Containing interviews and conversations with various practitioners, from Ava Kay Jones a Yoruba priestess, Brandi Kelly, the proprietor of "Voodoo Authentica", John T. Martin, manager of the Voodoo Museum in New Orleans, Ifa Priest Dr. Afolabi Epega, dancer and teacher Ausettua Amor Amenkum, and others, the "special features" is well worth watching, whether it be by an every day joe or joeanne, an initiate, or a practitioner of the faith."Angel Heart" was yet another film that was frowned upon by the practitioners of Ifa, Santaria, Candoble, Lukumi, and other Yoruba belief systems, as it was yet another film that hyped the false negativity of this benevolent belief system. When the film was made the term "voodoo" was always associated with darkness, whether referring to "voodoo economics" or via its portrayal in the media at large. The fact that Satan is even personified in this movie is ridiculous when you look at the fact that voudon in any of its forms has no actual heaven &amp; hell system. To tie the Judeo-Christian laws and beliefs in with something that has had to work in, around, alongside, and with the very man-made ideals that have sought to oppress or destroy it is hilarious at its best - destructive at its worst! When I see this happen time and again, I often wonder how many would be outraged if, say, Judaism or Baptist beliefs were portrayed in the same dark and destructive manner?So, I must say, it pleased me, a practitioner of Ifa tradition, to see that finally someone took the time to fill the general population in on the realities behind the practices that have been all but crapped on by the media!~T.Paul www.t-paul.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The thing about Angel Heart is I have found very few people who admit to liking it, it seems to exist on a separate plane from other horror movies. It usually gets put out really late, with few fan-fares from the TV companies. Granted, the plot is a little complicated, I am not ashamed to admit that I did not see the ending coming. I won't ruin it for those who have not seen it yet, suffice to say you just KNEW De Niro was a nasty piece of work, but you can't put your finger on it. Or rather I couldn't. Rourke is cool personified, he really had it all. De Niro is flawless as usual, in an over the top sort of way, but hey, it's De Niro. I love this film, I never tire of watching it, and it always works for me. Top marks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>..."Angel Heart" is tour de force of both Alan Parker, the director, and yes - Mickey Rourke, the actor. All is perfect in this film: the plot and its realization are remarkable - wonderful acting and perfect directing, brilliant photography and colors, very well chosen places with meticulously worked out details in NYC and the South, i.e. amazing precision with architectural preferences and interiors, landscapes, costumes - no doubt, and even the weather. The year of 1987 is also probably the best year of Mr. Rourke as he played very well in two other good films, "A Prayer for the Dying" and "Barfly". All three films are the gems of the world's cinematography of the end of the twentieth century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel Heart is a hauntingly original horror film that will keep you in constant state of questioning and devilish suspense. The characters are mesmerizing with unforgettable performances by Mickey Rourke, Robert DeNiro, and Lisa Bonet in her breakthrough role. Angel Heart is complex and should be viewed attentively for those who plan on fathoming the story on the first viewing. However several fans have revealed that this film was better upon a second viewing.Angel Heart is a subtle mystery concerning a private investigator (Harry Angel) hired by a wealthy businessman (Louis Cyphre) to locate the whereabouts of a singer by the name Johnny Favourite. Alan Parker evokes eerie emotions and stunning visuals in a southern voodoo atmosphere with his experimental film-making witch is simply unforgettable. This is hands down Alan Parker's best film to date as well as one of the best films of the 1980s. A must-see for anyone who enjoys a thought-provoking mystery.</fullReview>

This was a long movie but never boring it was engrossing in fact with a AWESOME ending that i love every time most people hate it but i myself LOVE it. The Acting is Oscar Worthy Mickey Rourke gives an ASTONISHING show here and he simply amazed me here i know critics hate him but i think he is a fantastic actor and deserves more credit i LOVE this guy and he should have been considered for an Oscar. Robert Deniro does AMAZING as well not on screen enough but still he is Wonderful as always and is one of the best actors of all time if not the best. Lisa Bonet is very cute and does very well here in her role. Charlotte Rampling is very classy and does quite well here. Overall a wonderful taut compelling thriller that is a must see or own for any movie fan! ***** out of 5 and i must sat Mickey Rourke is a fast runner (LOL)</fullReview>

I was mystified the entire time. Plus, it was a movie with a twist. Mickey Rourke shines at his best in this movie as an investigator hired by some spooky guy to find some singer named Johnny, yet during his investigation, everyone he encounters keeps dying. Your put into the story through his POV. I loved it.I was younger when I first saw this film and was a big fan of Lisa Bonet. It was incomprehensible to me, but I was fascinated.

Mickey Rourke gives his finest performance as Angel, a man on a journey to hell--and self-discovery--who starts to fall apart as he gets deeper into the case. The film is brilliantly put together, and Parker uses music and images--such as the recurring motif of a creaking fan--to create a sense of unease.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once hated now loved</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being totally honest the first time I saw Alan Parker's bone chilling Angel Heart I was not overwhelmingly impressed and found it slightly too sombre and stylish for its own good. Since then I have seen the light, or the masterpiece in the dark in this case, and can only put it down to a film that was ahead of its time. The 1950s setting absorbs you into the seedy world of New Orleons where Angel is hired to track down Johnny Favourite by the ominous entrepreneur, Cypher. The mood throughout is intense as we discover piece by piece what initially seemed like a typical Chandleresque story is in fact something more sinister. There is still a lingering sense constantly that not all is as it should be. And believe me it really isn't in this evocative combination of the supernatural and film noir. I found Rourke, in one of his better roles, believable as the confused and doomed detective and DeNiro's underused Mr. Cypher incredibly chilling. Unforgettable scenes include the infamous sex scene between Rourke and Bonet, DeNiro's infamous 'the egg is the soul' scene and the ending twist, that I found far more effective than those of alternate broody films such as The Sixth Sense or Fight Club. This is definitely not the sort of film you'd want to show at a family gathering.</fullReview>

It's a cross between a Mike Hammer detective story and and a horror film. The clues are scattered all over the story and are in the films title.

		<shortDescription>Nothing you've seen before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really "like nothing you've seen before", but not much more to agree with usual opinions about this movie. It's been compared to gore, porn and such sharply defined content genres. Everybody who watches a thriller may tell which scenes are suitable for critical evaluation, but it's just a technical mistake calling "porn" a movie where the nudity is restricted, no explicit body parts are shown (no more than usual in any recent cash-maker Hollywood production) and the only -intentionally unpleasant- sex act takes less than two minutes of the whole playing time- neither a nice boyfriend turns Carrie into a romance movie... Faithfully based upon the book by Hjörtsberg, who tells a mystery crime story gathering supernatural, religion, voodoo, thugs, dog races, and other common references in crime genre, the movie must be and is also impressive, fast, shocking and hard-boiled. In fact, the novel features harder numbers which the film simply skips -I'm not spoiling-, such like a satanist mass and a monsters parade. But it's true that blood is widely used, from plot-required reasons to just nightmare fillers. I really can't find the flaw in the main actors work. Rourke is certainly playing Rourke, but this matches exactly this dirty detective rol. Fallon, the terrorist from A Prayer For The Dying and Stanley White, the police captain from The Year of the Dragon are other examples of tough characters where I really find him to fit perfectly. Screen monster De Niro is usually out of question, maybe with the rare argueable exceptions of Frankensteins and blood-thirsty ex-prisoners. His "special" role here demonstrates his versatility once more. Only Lisa Bonet may be considered short of resources, but not a problem this time, since this matches her character well: opaque, secretive, mysterious and... beautiful. The twisting suspenseful plot is the key to this film, very well supported by the New Orleans-Louisiana superb background. Just add a terrific soundtrack by Trevor Jones (similar to other collaborations with Parker), featuring the tenor sax player Courtney Pine, which puts extra adrenaline and fear in dangerous doses, and a few good old tunes, and you'll get a clearly underrated movie which is even better on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was blown away by Mickey Rourke's acting and the cinematography and art direction was masterful in this finely crafted and detailed film. Parkeer wrings the dark soul out of 1955 in both New York and New Orleans, getting down to street level, making the viewer into voyeur in an almost documentary sense.The plot is strong but the twist at the end has, by now, been overdone in other movies. But every scene is a reality saturated conjuration of the time and place involved. Although dealing with the occult, the film is not gratuitously or manipulatively suspenseful or violent, rather, it is artful in its details and engaging as a detective thriller.Rourke's character has a refreshing imperturbability to the spooky occult goings on he becomes ensnared in, and rejoinders DeNiro's sinister inquiry "Don't you believe in religion?" with "I'm from Brooklyn". DeNiro was fairly predictable but intense and Charlotte Rampling, studied and subtle and pragmatically beautiful as ever. The co-actors were all exceptional, understanding the inner dimension to even the smallest of the movie's roles.This film is on the verge of being a filmmakers film, a near classic contemporary Film Noir.Walter</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sad but true story of how gripping Rourke's performance is in this movie and his other 80s choices, as compared to the post-boxing era of Mickey's life. I very seriously doubt we will ever get a chance to see Mickey in a starring role again, so if you haven't seen his role as Harry Angel, you are missing out one of the best actors of the 20th century right when he chose all the right roles.There was no generic in any role Rourke played in the 80's, and this movie is certainly not generic also. You approach the search for Favourite with Harry. You are torn by the search with Harry. And you take the eye-opening climax with Harry full-steed.From a devout Rourke fan, I implore you to watch this movie. And even if you dog Mickey more than the media, you should at least see it for Alan Parker's directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has "heart"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you thought "The Wall" was trippy, Angel Heart is the "The Wall" on acid. It is an acid trip inside of an acid trip. I was horrified and in awe at the same time. Some of the scenes that contain the most gore and grossness truly capture the aim of the film. The aim of the film is to show that if you screw with evil, you will get screwed in the end. While I was supremely sickened by the "climax" of the film, I loved the "twisted" story and the terrific acting. Robert De Niro always had a way with playing the bad guy. I can see why he was picked for his role in "Meet The Parents." Overall, Alan Parker succeeded in making a noteworthy film despite depending upon one's opinion of it. For me, Angel Heart fits into the catergory of good movies that will make your skin crawl. This is a movie worth some praise despite how sacreligious it is. I give it an 8 out of 10. A decent piece of actual horror that uses gore to make a statement which is to make you feel uncomfortable.</fullReview>

Robert de Nero does the best act (of Devil in human form) and the despair on Mickey Rourke's face is a show of that man's talent in acting.

		<shortDescription>The devil keeps tidy accounts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This reference to death being treated as an accounting scheme for the heavens or depths made me think of "A matter of life and death" and the consternation caused by a missing soul. The soul is the essence of this story. Notions of Biblical evil were out of fashion in the cinema for many years. This film bravely attempted to bring such old fashioned evil back to our attention via a stylish film noir. It succeeded artistically but failed commercially and critically. It can now be seen to have influenced so many more recent hits such as The Devil's Advocate, The Firm etc. Alan Parker paints his scenes with beautifully bled (no pun intended) colour. O'Rourke and De Niro are mesmerising as their characters take part in this game of deceit and treachery. It is particularly sad that O'Rourke's career faltered so badly in the 90s. De Niro could have been forgiven for being concerned that a new rival was about to challenge his supreme acting status. O'Rourke must look back on this film and think those immortal cinematic lines: I coulda been a contender. Especially appropriate given his other career in the ring. This film will never leave you. Perhaps only challenged by Bladerunner as film of the eighties.</fullReview>

From Mickey Rourke, to Robert Deniro, the amazing and completely off the wall PLOT. When it come to Film Noir and Dark Thrillers, I doubt there has ever been a better film, made. It easily ranks above something like 7EVEN. If u want a movie to really play with your mind just like a FIGHTCLUB does this definetely the movie for you. Certainly not a movie for the faint hearted.To SUM it up if any movie has left a LASTING impression on my MIND its' ANGEL HEART.Don't MISS this at any COST!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One hell of a mesmerizing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the 90´s I loved to watch and discuss films. Films, which are not the usual "Ok, let ´s rent a video stuff". "Angel Heart" is definitely one of the most hypnotically movies I ´ve ever seen. First there is the brilliant acting of Mickey Rourke, Robert "Louis Cyphre" De Niro and Lisa Bonet. The acting of the two male actors reminds me of a boxing fight. De Niro the master of method acting, always in deep concentration and the young Mickey Rourke who, apart from "Barfly" plays the role of his life, went at it hammer and tongs. Secondly Alan Parker the British director of masterpieces like "Birdy", "The Commitments" and "The Wall" together with Michael Seresin the director of photography, created an unforgettable atmosphere of William Hjoertsbergs novel "Falling Angel". A dazzling mixture of a film noir of the 50´s and Goethe´s Faust. First Alan Parker wanted to shot the movie in b/w, but we all know that it is much harder to find proper financiers for a b/w film in USA than in Europe. Thirdly Trevor Jones one of the best score composers produced a real masterpiece of a soundtrack. (Courtney Pine ´s sax is great) I know that there is no best movie in the world but there are a few who can claim that they are nearly perfect. Angel Heart definitely is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there is one characteristic of Alan Parkers movies it is atmosphere and Angel Heart has more than all his other films i feel.From the bleak opening of a slum in an American city to the frantic ending in the steamy underbelly of New Orleans you somehow feel you have been in the movie.A little like Tim Burtons Sleepy Hollow parker has drained the colour out except for red which highlights the liberal amount of bloodletting.The cast are superb with Micky O'rouke equal to his quality work in Barfly and DeNiro faultless as Mr Cypher.The whole film is shot beautifully especially the recurring scenes that appear briefly and help create that wonderfull atmosphere.Parker is a craftsman at the top of his game here.If value for money is judged by the emotions provoked by a film they could quite easily charge $100 admission for Angel Heart and you would be getting a bargain.See it soon ,preferably on a stormy winters night!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those few movies which you can watch more than once and it is probably advisable to do so.When seen again it becomes evident how well the various elements have been brought together to accentuate the story.The soundtrack,the use of surreal images and the acting indicate the depth of talent involved in this production.The choice of songs truly captures the era,but for me it is the background music used during Harry's flashbacks and his symbolic dreams that make the movie as far as the soundtrack is concerned.It creates the impression that there is a malevolent presence over Harry and that the case has initiated images of a past come back to haunt him.The flashbacks and surreal images make it a beautiful movie to watch and these images play on your mind as if they a making a psychological impact on yourself.These images are well timed and do not fragment the film nor does it come across as pretentious art.The actor's performances are very strong in this film and there is not one actor I feel I could criticise.Robert de Niro's cameo appearance is brilliant and he portrayed his character as being a man of mysterious origin and is utterly confident in himself.This portrayel of the Devil is preferable to Al Pacino's more animated and comedic Lucifer.Pacino's character seems to be engineered for mass appeal in a blockbuster movie while De Niro's is created for suspense and chill factors.Mickey Rourke is superb and it is a pity that we do not see him in more movies.Anybody wishing to view this movie should watch it again to analysis the story and only then can this production be truly appreciated.I gave this movie 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Among the scariest films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angel Heart" will easily haunt you for years to come. If you haven't heard of this film, which is quite likely, you MUST see it. Mickey Rourke turns in the performance of his lifetime, and De Niro is superb in a small but terrifying role. I've never seen a film look so grim and fitting for it's subject matter, except for mabye "Jacob's Ladder." The suspense is perfectly conveyed by director Alan Parker through simple cinematography, tight performances all around, and a near-perfect script based on William Hjortsberg's equally terrifying novel "Falling Angel." I know many people who weren't prepared for this film when they saw it, and couldn't take it. They turned it off after the first 30 minutes.  Beneath "Angel Heart's" horror lies an excellent detective-mystery premise that will keep you guessing till the end. Another thing you should be warned of is the music; it's stuck in my head and I'm sure it will never leave. Particularly Johnny Favorite's "Girl of my Dreams," that also serves as the movie's "theme song." It's been 2 1/2 years since I first saw "Angel Heart," and it still haunts me. Only one other movie haunts me more than this, and that is "The Shining."</fullReview>

Not too much to say about it except by the time i was finished watching it, I was so drained of what i had just saw. The scenery is so murky, flashbacks and images are distorted, and a lot more of which you would expect in a die-hard mystery. Ignore the presence of the actors Rourke,De Niro,and Bonet and watch it with an open mind. And don't forget to pay special attention to nearly every detail of the movie. ***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out; I was about 17 or 18 at the time. And yes, this movie did too remind me of The Sixth Sense because you keep wondering what's going on and finally when it's revealed at the end, it all makes sense. The film concerns a rather scuzzy, small-time private eye in 1950's Brooklyn, played to perfection by Mickey Rourke, of course I think Bruce Willis would have been good in this too, due to similarities in personality and accent. Harry Angel (Rourke) is assigned by a strange man with long fingernails and long, slicked backed hair in a ponytail (slyly played by Robert DeNiro) to locate a former WW II era crooner who has been missing for over 12 years. In the process, he interviews people who are later on killed off in very grotesque ways. His search eventually takes him to New Orleans into a creepy world of voodoo and black magic. The film has many surrealistic scenes invloving elevators, fans, old decaying buildings, and an unforgettable scene where he is having sex with Lisa Bonet and hallucinates blood running all over the room in the process. For fans of more intelligent horror genere, rather than the cheap teen-oriented Scream, Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, etc., I recommend this very highly.</fullReview>

While the record spun often on the record player, I didn't see the movie again until a few days ago - and the magic hadn't left.

		<fullReview>I am usually very skeptic about two genres, horrors and comedies. I love to see a great movie of either genre but mostly I'm disappointed. But this one, although it is not categorized as a horror movie, it's definitely one of the creepiest movies. I don't consider slasher movies as horrors. The horror movie needs to be CREEPY first and foremost. It doesn't get creeper than this. It's an atmospheric movie where you feel certain feeling that goes beyond what you just see on the screen, there is something very disturbing that you can't really put your hand on, and you don't know what to expect. I was lucky enough to see this movie for the first time without knowing anything about it. it might have lost some of it's value if I did, I'm not really sure. Over all, I rank this as the best Horror/Thriller, which is a new category just to leave The Exorcist as the best pure horror movie ever.</fullReview>

Great period piece with attention to the details, wonderful cinematography and a fun little story with enough little twists to keep it interesting. The biggest twist is a bit obvious, but it is really a lot of fun getting there, with Mickey Rourke perfectly cast as the slightly shady and completely disheveled Harry Angel. Trevor Jones and jazz saxophonist Courtney Pine combine to form a wonderfully spooky soundtrack that I have listened to a hundred times.

In this film, I just can't imagine anyone, not even Nicholson, doing this role better. He's a lower-class not-too-bright sleazeball detective hired to find .... well, something dark and unspeakable. To say any more would destroy the mystery.The story reveals the mystery at just the right pace and with just the right blend of evil and seedy atmosphere.

		<fullReview>This is a very unique movie which plays with the concept of death and spirituality. In unexplainable situations the body dies but the soul is unprepared. For some reason the soul needs a guide to help it find its way home to reach the logical conclusion.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0bYEey2ztQ This is a video about reaching truth of society for political power.Robert Deniro plays the character of the angel of the lord our God sent down from heaven. His mission is to reveal the truth to a human soul which is misguided. By his guidance the truth is revealed. Although painful human nature is shown its reward by its actions.Since Robert DeNiro is supposedly Jewish I often wonder if he also studies the Jewish Kabbalh. This is also a concept to reach enlightenment and truth of human society. This is free and only requirement is to have an open mind and open heart. According to my research Hasidism, based in the Kabbalh, became popular around the turn of the 18th Century which also stressed dance and music. As symbols have been often used music may have been interpreted as a truly logical and creative eloquence that is universal among people.Some people have different senses of logic to determine which music is the best. The screams of pain and suffering, rejoice song, religious belief song, drums and trumpets of ancient warfare, laughter and other emotions. Natural verse electronic. Obviously in this film prefers natural saxophone music similar to a natural trumpet mouth.Again the main theme is for the soul to reach truth, enlightenment, and or peace. Its not very peaceful to find out that the screams of pain and suffering is a desirable aspect of the investigation, even though they are naturally made by the mouth of a human soul.I think the human soul has a universal sound in elation such as laughter, crying, pain, happiness. Why Lucifer prefers the natural course seems to entice a hatred of the concept of Satan, but similar to the concept presented in Dantes'Inferno. Although Dantes' Infernio could be more related into an investigation of feudalism, monarchy, administrative corruption by human vices. Which were more of the era of Orthodox Christian thought.Since this film deals with eggs, being a symbol of the soul, and as Satan devours one explaining his orders for the investigation. Perhaps it is something Satan desires as well found in the musical essence as a survival tactic. Partly because Satan desires payment of this soul, and partly because Satan is being responsible, but would like to keep something which seems to be the ethical vice in natural music to further distinguishes his evil presence in the eye of the public. Or in this case the viewer of public censorship concerning the evil of man embodied in Satan as generally perceived by the public.I discovered the secret of royalty despite this film about the Pagan Occult with the innocence of a child. Its not the hand that guides the sword for a true leader, but the mind that guides the motives of society. Hence the orb in the left hand and sword in the right of a seated ruler. The orb could be seeds, medicine, or other knowledge condensed for the transfer into society by the ruler. As in the movie James Bond in Octopussy the Russian usage of eggs may symbolize seeds of the population or fertility ornately by jewels. But again it is the loyalty of a subject which brings the truth to protect society into the hands of their sovereign leadership that defies the forces of evil that should seek destruction of the soul of a nation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harry Angel and Epiphoney - can anyone say incest?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen this movie and I think it's absolutely brilliant, although I have to be honest and say that I'd worked out the twist about halfway through.However, there is one scene that really bothers me, the bit where Harry and Epiphoney have sex, is this really a case of incest or am I reading too much into this? Also, can I ask did anyone else who had never seen or heard about the film before work out that De Niro was the Devil from his name Louis Cyphre? I actually thought that was a bit cheesy and almost gave the game away from the start.Beautifully directed by Parker though and actually a lot better in terms of plot twists than other supernatural films like Sixth Sense.Mickey Rourke was the only guy capable of pulling off such a masterful performance. I feel he is much undervalued and should get more worthy roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved This Movie, Stylewise and Acting Wise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the best devilish horror movie next to Rosemary's Baby. The sets, acting and action were utterly consistent and convincing. Mickey Rourke lived the role, making rumpled, street wise Harry Angel by far his best role. DeNiro and Rampling were their usual good. The only "stunt" was the hoopla surrounding the sex scene with Lisa Bonet, but that was consistent with the plot too. The atmosphere of the whole movie was unrelenting doom and the imagery, from the fans, elevators and old buildings sets supported that consistently. Not for the weak at heart, it has a few sick scenes and a general air of brutality, it's a film about evil and the Devil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece, but for the music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this film. Don't get me wrong. AND it was made in 1987, thus the music was always going to be touch and go. But on my third viewing of it (I have the DVD now) the saxophone really started to get to me. That said, the sound design itself will blow you away, the bass tearing through my apartment like thunder.The film as a whole is a wonderful mix of Gothic and crime thriller. Plot points are masterfully placed and supported by strong editing.One of Rourke's best performances, his portrayal of Harry Angel oozes cool at the beginning of the film. The progression of his character is life-like. De Niro plays a great villain, as the quasi-homosexual Louis Cypher (spelling?). Strong cameos by Lisa Bonnet and Charlotte Rampling are noteworthy.See this film.</fullReview>

Actors, with the handsome Mickey Rourke signing his best feature, showing yet his dark side after the otherwise graphically beautiful "9 1/2 weeks", the -this time- impressive De Niro in an unexpected application,Charlotte Rampling in her line with a-can't-more coldish role of medium, telling also of the troubling character of Cosbie show escaping Lisa Bonet. Realization, not enough well known Alan Parker-so eclectic, casting you in a story before you realize seeing a movie!and...the end I won't tell about of course! All this combination is simply the parameters of a no fault movie.

		<fullReview>This is a nice mix of noir and spookiness. As has been mentioned before, a detective is hired to find a missing singer, and the path he follows gets darker at every turn. Everyone in the film plays their parts well, and the descent into despair works well.Spoilers: As noted, the detective is actually on a hunt for his real identity, which is sufficiently diabolic for Mr. Cyphere. It's the kind of vengeance fitting the "crime." Why such a protracted search? A devilish punishment.The occult aspect of the film is almost superfluous to the action; the murders would work just as well without it; however, it does add to the mood.Nice effort, well worth seeing.

		<shortDescription>A Pleasant Surprise!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite being a film junkie I had never heard of "Angel Heart" until I saw it on sale at Wally World. It had a holographic cover which caught my attention and I saw De Niro was in it so I read the back cover and was immediately enticed. I couldn't find it in any rental stores so I put it in my online queue and I just finished watching it. I have to say it was an extremely good movie and I was just so glad that I found it by a lucky chance. I've always liked Mickey Rourke and have seen a lot of his movies but it's an easy decision to say that he was in top-form for this one. Robert was great in a brand new role for him and I loved it. I must admit that I had no idea what the ending would be and it really threw me through the ringer. The twists and turns were mostly unpredictable, unlike many generic ones we now witness in today's movies. I also found the suspense to be absolutely riveting. While there was some gore I didn't think it was excessively done especially with the whole Voodoo theme going on in the backdrop. The plot does get confusing at times but if you pay attention at the end it'll all come together so just hang in there and you should find your patience to be well worth the wait. Such a good movie!Final Gall:Movies: If it ever gets re-released you can count me in.DVD Purchase: It's still expensive despite the sale but I can see myself buying it in the near future.Rental: Do so!</fullReview>

Although slow in parts and lacking explanation for many of events in the narrative up until the final scenes, it is superbly crafted and very well shot. The acting is excellent for the most part and "Angel Heart" has one of the most memorable endings on film I've seen.As stated, this film does drag in parts, so those of you who love the "run and scream and stab"-style of horror would probably be disappointed with it. However, those that can sit through to the end will receive a reward well worth the effort invested.The first time I saw "Angel Heart" on television I only caught the final half hour, but the final scene was so great I immediately went and rented the film. It's a movie I consider worth owning and will be buying in the near future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ANGEL HEART (UNEDITED VERSION) (1987) ***1/2 Mickey Rourke, Robert De Niro, Lisa Bonet, Charlotte Rampling. Rourke (in one of his best and most memorable performances) is perfect as seedy '50s Brooklyn gumshoe Harry Angel who is hired by Lewis Cypher (De Niro with nasty Lee Press On Talons) to find a missing jazz musician and finds himself embroiled in voodoo, murder and some truly unsettling situations in hotter than hell New Orleans. Reminiscent of "Twilight Zone" and a precursor to "Jacob's Ladder" this nightmarish detective thriller set the stage for out there-ness and controversy for its blood drenched sex scenes between Rourke and sloe-eyed vixen Bonet. Effectively chilling musical score by Trevor Jones and dank photography by Michael Seresin. --- This is the unedited version with the aforementioned tryst sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alan Parker's Angel Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mickey Rourke, still good enough to appear in theatrical releasesas opposed to straight to video fare, stars as the New York privatedetective Harry Angel. The setting is 1955, and this normallylowbrow investigator is hired by Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro) tofind a missing singer named Johnny Favorite, who owes Cyphre adebt.Angel begins making the usual inquiries, finding out that Favoritewas an amnesiac WWII veteran who was spirited from the localhospital by a mysterious duo who paid a morphine addicted doctor$25,000 to keep the patient on the books as a resident there.Angel seems to have hit a dead end, learning Favorite had asociety girlfriend down south, as well as a secret lover. Cyphrekeeps pushing Angel, plying him with cash. Angel also takes amore personal angle on the case, especially since the doctorends up dead of an apparent suicide, but Angel is a murdersuspect.Angel goes to New Orleans, and tracks down the society girlfriendMargaret (Charlotte Rampling). As Angel finds more and morepeople who used to know Favorite before the war, but have notseen him since, the witnesses turn up dead after seeing him.Margaret, as well. Lisa Bonet is Epiphany, the offspring of thesecret lover and Favorite, and Angel is drawn to her, resulting inone bloody love making session. She is mysterious, is 17 and hasa child (something not exactly looked up to in the '50's), andcomments that Favorite was the most evil person on the face ofthe earth. And Cyphre keeps Angel on the case, even as morebodies pile up and the New Orleans police look into Angel'smotions. We soon learn the real relationship between Angel andFavorite, and Cyphre's true identity...This film is most notorious for Cosby alum Bonet's sex and nudescenes, which are not all that notorious except that she was on thesqueaky clean sitcom first. Rourke is very good as the slightlydumb Angel, who kind of stumbles from person to person asopposed to doing any kind of brilliant Sherlock Holmesiandeductions. DeNiro is great as Cyphre in his few scenes. Thiswas made back when DeNiro did not agree to appear in EVERYfilm made; when his very screen presence was an event. Heshould make more genre films, but he made the laughable "MaryShelley's Frankenstein," instead. Rampling is given nothing to doexcept make a cute corpse.The main surprise ending of the story is too easy to figure out. Themechanics of Favorite and Angel's relationship are hinted at, butCyphre has a line about an egg being a symbol of the soul, andyou pretty much have it once you hear him say it. Parker's visualsare stunning, nothing appeared on screen this disturbing until"Jacob's Ladder," to which this film favorably compares. Hisversion of New Orleans is appropriately hot and humid, anothergreat instance where he makes his main characters sweat andsuffer just like normal people (just look at the perspiring PhilJoanou made Alec Baldwin go through in "Heaven's Prisoners).Great look and good script, by Parker based on the novel byWilliam Hjortberg.All in all, "Angel Heart" succeeds enough times to make it a scary,suspenseful ride. You may know how it all comes out, but gettingthere is the fun. I recommend it.This is the unrated version, and contains strong physical violence,some gun violence, strong gore, strong profanity, female nudity,male nudity, sexual content, sexual references, and strong adultsituations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Angel Heart" is a flawed, imperfect film that is far from brilliant, yet amazingly intriguing. Choosing Mickey Rourke as a lead was a mistake in itself. He is amusing at times, but let's face it--he can't act!!! He swaggers through each scene, doing a bad Bruce Willis impression. Mickey, you're no Bruce Willis! And the film is set in the 1950's, whereas Rourke seems a few decades ahead of his time. I was quite disappointed that Robert DeNiro has such a small role. He's practically plastered across the video cover, yet only has about ten minutes of screen time. Another attempt to capitalize on the success of a big-name actor. I'm pretty sure people wouldn't be as eager to rent the flick if Mickey Rourke was plastered across. But DeNiro was great in his role (a different, more low-key role than usual), and the little screen time he had I appreciated. Lisa Bonet has proven her talent in recent flicks like "High Fidelity" and "Enemy of the State," but she shows practically no expression throughout this film and the only reason to check out this early performance is to see how great she looks naked. And she does have a banging body!!! OK, enough bashing. This is a unique, visually striking--though truly grim and unpleasant--mystery/thriller with a twist ending that comes from left field. The film doesn't always make sense, but it keeps your interest, sometimes making your pulse pound. Those who've seen "Midnight Express" and "Pink Floyd: The Wall" should be able to anticipate the gruesomeness of the material. Before viewing the movie, I heard a lot of hooplah about the explicit sex scene. Now I'm an avid moviegoer, so I'm very jaded when it comes to sex scenes. It takes a lot to shock me. But when watching the sex scene in this movie...I felt like I was watching underground porn or some sort of snuff film. It is THAT graphic! Walls start bleeding, naked bodies get covered in blood, we see flashbacks of orgies. Alan Parker went over-the-top, to say the least!There are other gruesome images, including a chicken sacrifice that would turn the biggest carnivores into vegetarians, but mainly this is a mystery--and what an intriguing one it is! And it was the plot--filled with twists and turns--that fascinated me most. I am not exaggerating when I say this movie is like nothing you've seen before. As I said, it's not the greatest, but it's definitely worth checking out. And after watching the film, you'll definitely want to chat about it with your friends. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

Watching Rourke in the early going of this film brings your guard down, leaving you unprepared for the happenings that lie ahead. And when DeNiro shows up, ya' gotta know something's up, cause Bob ain't gonna play your average schmoe in any movie.

And i completely recommend the Directors Cut edition, which i got for a mere ?6 in HMV (it's worth so much more), so look around and i'm sure you'll find it at a cheap price, even try AMAZON.COM/CO.UK.

		<fullReview>Director-screenwriter Alan Parker keeps this gory, sexy beast grinding along like a disco dancer bathed in blood. The whole thing thump-thump-thumps in a twisted altered state in dark, seamy corners; yet, aside from all the voodoo ambiance, there's not a hell of a lot going on (although Parker is a pro at hiding this until the ending, which has a high "oh, brother!' quotient). Mickey Rourke, rumpled and handsome, cuts a cool, shabby-chic, noir-ish figure as a detective assigned to find a missing band singer; Robert De Niro is his mysterious client. Smart viewers will figure out what's going on long before Rourke does, but there are subplots to distract you--though they don't quite add up. In supporting roles, Charlotte Rampling is scarily statuesque as a New Orleans grande dame and Lisa Bonet as a voodoo princess is eerily fragile, a lusty waif. But neither character does much to advance the plot (they're just walking targets) and the much-touted sex scene between Rourke and Bonet is just Alan Parker feeling his oats. In a brief role as a nurse, Kathleen Wilhoite makes more of a connection with the audience (and with Rourke) than anyone else. The sharp editing darts around letting you see just enough mayhem, and then backtracking and giving you more. Rourke is alert and gripping, and De Niro is cunningly rich (though the role is beneath him). Unfortunately, the plot is juvenile nonsense, cynical and corny, managing to displace mystery and conjecture with B-movie clichés. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

The Terrible Tone was Probably too much for some Patrons and Critics because it just Never Lets Up and gets More Maniacal and Morbid as the Movie moves along.If it is Film-Noir, Horror, and the Supernatural You Seek, Look no where else, this is an Acidic, Atrophying, Amalgamation of Genres that is Bathed in Blood and takes no Prisoners.

		<fullReview>Angel Heart is one of those movies where the journey is so interesting you can be very forgiving when you find the destination is disappointing. Quite frankly the destination is a bunch of mumbo-jumbo that has plot holes big enough to drive an 18 wheeler through, but by that time we have been well satisfied and entertained by the ride to get there, so I for one am not complaining.I've watched this movie a few times now, first because it is so stylishly noir and evocative of a time and place and genre, and secondly because I really would like to get my brain around the actual premise of the diabolical transaction that took place. I really don't understand who or what Harry Angel is. His body is obviously not Johnny Fortune's, nor is it that of the original "Harry Angel", the army guy who was butchered as part of the ceremony to transfer Johnny's soul. And why did Margaret Crusemark and her father actually assist in this process, since we find out later that she hated Johnny Fortune? And why does she not recognise Harry Angel as being that soldier when they meet years later? So many questions, so many flaws, so fundamental that it forces you to watch the movie again and again to get to the truth, if there is one.If there is one thing I would criticise it is the unnecessarily gruesome way in which people die. Maybe it is true to the book, I don't know, but it adds nothing to the movie, and in fact quite the contrary, it jars badly with the standards you would expect in what is essentially a 1950s period piece. For me the fact that people simply die is enough to tell the story, I don't need to know they had their genitals cut off, or whatever.I love the little "extraneous" details that are thrown in. Like when Harry greets an unknown girl on the sidewalk and asks if her new boyfriend really owns a car. We never see her again, and it adds nothing to the progress of the movie, yet it says so much about Harry as a person, as part of a community, and makes you care about him so much more.Much has been said about Robert de Niro's work, I agree it's fine, but really no more than you would expect. I loved his line "the future isn't what it used to be". Who'd have thought the Devil could be a stand-up comedian.Mickey Rourke of course holds the whole thing together and he does a brilliant job of portraying a believable gumshoe doing the best he can, but for my money the best piece of acting comes from whoever plays the morphine addicted doctor.So a mixed bag here, a rough diamond, but with enough allure to make me watch it again and again, which I guess makes it a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Devilish Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mickey Rourke stars as private detective Harry Angel, who is hired by a mysterious and sinister man named Louis Cyphre(Robert De Nero, very canny performance) to find a man named Johnny Favourite who owes him a debt. Harry takes the case, and finds himself involved in a lurid world of voodoo rituals that further leads him to the beautiful Epiphany Proudfoot(played by Lisa Bonet), who was Johnny's daughter, and with whom he becomes involved. Harry will later realize a terrible secret about Mr. Favourite that will forever alter his life in a most final and fateful way...Excellent performances by the three leads, and atmospheric direction by Alan Parker can only do so much to save this most sordid and oppressive film, that touches taboo topics with such an over-the-top fashion that it makes the film a highly uneasy experience on reflection, though the closing scene with both the child and the elevator is chilling indeed...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel Heart is more than the flick in which a Cosby kid got her kit off ? but it is indeed that ? it is a period drama which on paper has every chance of moving into hokey territory, but with some skillful handling and a gradual build in momentum manages to emerge as a very strong thriller with supernatural elements and a pretty solid twist.It is 1955, a decade along from WW2 and Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is a small time Private Investigator. Early in the film he is solicited by a mysterious man through his lawyer to perform something of a missing person search. The mysterious man is Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro in a solid cameo) and the man he is to find was a popular African American singer named Johnny Favorite who had a minor pre-war hit before himself heading off to war.Cypher alleges that Johnny and he had a contract that was broken, and that Favorite still owes him. It is not for Angel to collect the debt, merely to see if Favorite is actually even alive so that Cypher can make his request formally? And off Angel goes on the manhunt.After some early setbacks which see Angel put in minor peril he decides that this gig might be out of his league and heads to Cypher to make this clear. While Cypher explains to Angel just how badly he wants Favorite located ? by increasing Angel's fee dramatically ? he somehow manages to make the simple and banal task of eating a hard boiled egg infinitely more menacing than I remembered it being as a kid.Angel ? now back on the case ? follows the trail of clues to N'Awlins. Without going into the developments and twists in the case it is fair to say that the situation unwinds slowly in languid fashion, and we learn at the same gradual pace that Angel learns exactly who is involved and what is actually going on.Eventually Angel tracks down Favorite's former squeeze, who is already deceased but has left a young daughter named Epiphany (Lisa Bonet) who is maybe 18ish. Epiphany is smart and seems to know more than she lets on ? she is also effortlessly hot ? and Angel gets the itchin' for another "chat". Before he gets the chance to do that though he tails a blues singer who also seems to know more than he is telling, and watches as bluesman, Epiphany and a gaggle of scantily clad "others" perform an elaborate and frenetic voodoo ceremony complete with the sacrifice of a chicken.It's always the crazy hot ones who are into the voodoo.Now Angel realizes that there might be very good reasons as to why no-one seems to want him to know the truth.()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() People who meet with Angel as he goes about his investigation have a habit of winding up dead, though there isn't much on screen violence or gore, it seems that almost everyone involved at any level doesn't want the truth to come out. Angel himself gets warned off verbally and physically, he makes discoveries of his own and even manages to have himself an Epiphany at one point ? the capital letter is not a mistake.On we go to the ultimate unveiling of the "big picture", with information and new facts coming thick and fast as the story moves faster and faster, involving more bizarre developments and situations. This all culminates in a quite satisfying payoff to end proceedings with Cypher arriving again and hoping to collect.This was the 80s before Mickey Rourke rode motorbikes too fast and before he got hit by both boxers, the bottle and the scalpel so hard that he started fondling panicky starlets in public. He is just the right mix of cocky, confident and resourceful here to believe what is going on and to see exactly why it was Angel that was set on the case in the first place.De Niro plays Cypher straight and understated, and obviously relishes the menacing dialogue and creepiness that his character exudes in his brief dealings, and Bonet is young and definitely hot enough, but she also manages to be very credible in her role.All in all Angel Heart is a very effective period thriller, it moves along at a slow pace and might prove a little slow and dated for some, but it maintains interest as Angel (and the audience) moves closer to the truth and boasts some solid performances from actors who could have let this all go extremely cheesy.Final Rating ? 8 / 10. It could me 20 years to find this under-appreciated gem, you'd be doing yourself a favour if you looked it up sooner rather than later. (And you get to see some Cosby-cans!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Harry Angel is a small-time private-eye in Brooklyn in 1955, hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphre to find Johnny Fontaine, a forties crooner who owes Cyphre a debt and seems to have gone missing for twelve years. Angel starts looking and the trail leads to Louisiana, but all the people who knew Johnny seem to be dying all of a sudden ...This is a chilling, weird amalgamation of private-eye / period-drama / horror-movie made during a terrific streak by the talented Parker (his two films which bookend it, Birdy and Mississipi Burning, are also excellent). I love the way it starts out as a completely straight mystery thriller, and slowly brings in the satanic elements, until by the end it's become a full-on horror movie with our hero literally descending into hell. How much you like it I guess depends on how much you buy the big explanation at the ice-house in the end, which is amusingly rushed and hysterical to catch us off-guard. I think it's great; what other private-detective movie ends with the gumshoe discovering he's the killer and he didn't even know it (even The Big Sleep isn't that cracked) ? What sells it for me is Rourke's solid blustering performance - he steers a great course through smartass, out of his depth, bewildered, disbelieving and resigned as he's manipulated through the story by forces he can't control. The rest of the cast are good, with DeNiro in the plum role as The Lord Of The Flies himself, subtly underplaying it to great creepy comic effect. There's also a terrific score by the underrated Trevor Jones (Runaway Train, Labyrinth), which pops and spits all through the action, skilfully underlining the trouble our hero is in. Shot on authentic and great-looking locations in NYC, New Jersey and Louisiana, and based on the book Falling Angel, by William Hjortsberg (who also wrote Ridley Scott's Legend). I almost always find I enjoy movies which mix genres up, and this is a fine example of a well-written and stylishly made such hybrid. A great horror thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, But Stylish and Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angel Heart begins with Harry Angel, a Brooklyn private detective, being hired to find a missing singer by a mysterious client known as Louis Cypher.Set in the 1950s, we travel with Angel from Brooklyn and Harlem to the sweltering swamps of Louisiana where he becomes involved with a teen-aged voodoo priestess named Epiphany Proudfoot. All the while, bodies are starting to fall as Harry's investigation leads him closer and closer to the singer, Johnny Favorite, and the true identity of Mr. Cypher.The capable cast, headed by Mickey Roarke, seems committed to the material with Roarke doing a credible job with a sleazy character like Angel, keeping him likable from beginning to end. Lisa Bonet, as Epiphany, is properly alluring without bringing too much attention to her limitations as an actress, and Robert DeNiro looks as though he's having a grand old time, chewing the scenery and actually inhabiting his character instead of playing a parody of himself as he's done in most of his recent films.The great Alan Parker directs, evoking the lurid atmosphere of the noir films of the fifties, as well as of the subject matter itself, which touches on addiction, incest, and satanism.The problem with Angel Heart is that it is all style and no substance. Once the multiple shots of rotating fans, slamming doors, and blood splattered walls are stripped away, you're left with a pretty hokey plot and an entirely predictable ending. Still, this film is like the most intimidating roller coaster at your favorite theme park. You may know every single twist and turn, but you'll still enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

A good script, terrific acting, inspired direction, perfect set design and wardrobe, amazing cinematography, and one of the most haunting, creepy soundtracks of all time. I think the only reason it is taking so long for this film to get recognized is because of it's ultra-dark theme. Let's face it, most people these days just aren't comfortable with this sort of truly evil story and unlikable, diabolical characters. Angel Heart is most definitely not for the faint of heart, it will give you nightmares, and no one involved seemed to be the same after they made it. But in terms of sheer cinema it never loses the power to amaze me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit, when I rented this for the first time about 10 years ago, the only reason was because I had heard about Lisa Bonet's sex scene when the flick first opened in 1987. In fact, that's all we heard about when this movie was publicized: that Bill Cosby's TV daughter was taking off her clothes for the camera. Heavens! Scandal! How could she??!! But in the end, this scene is actually quite mild, and the real hero of the movie is everything else that happens. I had no idea when I started to watch that I was in for a rare treat: an intelligent, well-acted and well-directed horror movie with style and class to spare. And on top of that, it's spooky, eerie, makes you think, has a lot of subtle comedic touches, and an ending that packs a wallop. How many movies in the "Horror" section of your local video store can offer that?I could go on, but I'll just say that I think it's one of the better movies ever made, in any genre. I love the scenes near the end, at the horse track and with the block of ice. If I was going to be a filmmaker, this is one of the selections I'd study to get an idea of what works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Supernatural Film-Noir - disturbing, unsettling and flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This motion picture will stay with you long after you've seen it. It has a tendency to leave you feeling quite disturbed and unsettled. This can be attributed mainly to the films last 15 minutes, wherein the lead character Harry Angel, a private investigator (played by Mickey Rourke), learns the emotionally devastating truth behind the case he has been working on. Rourke is quite good throughout the entire movie, lending his character a certain sleazy-cool charm, but it is in the films last few moments that he shines best. His harrowing display of pain in these scenes is so intense and believable that you truly feel his despair. Robert De Niro who appears in only a few scenes (in a key role), also does good work. Now for the down side. Director Alan Parker from the very beginning imbues his film with such a heavy atmosphere of impending doom that we hardly have a chance to breathe. If he had perhaps lightened up a bit in those earlier scenes, the ending would have slowly crept up on us and been even more shocking and disturbing than it was. Also he attempts to combine the horror and detective genres with only moderate success (especially in the later case). What usually thrills us about classic film-noir detectives is their sarcastic wit and hip dialogue. This verbal element is sorely lacking in ANGEL HEART, so the audience tends to latch onto the visual aspects of the investigation which are not enough to keep us totally riveted for the first two thirds of the film. On occasion the director also loses his sense of subtlety and allows sex, blood and gore to steal the show (as in the bedroom scene with Rourke and Lisa Bonet). The above complaints aside, ANGEL HEART is an unforgettable and haunting film which though not a totally pleasant experience, is still worth a look, especially if you like films dealing in psychological horror.Final Verdict: 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On December 7, 1998, I watched for the first time "Angel Heart" on HBO. I have never heard of it or read about it. I really did not want to watch it, because the title sounded so la-di-da.To my surprise I experienced one of the best cinematography I have seen in a long time. Each camera set-up is beautifully composed and some are unforgettable in their almost docu- mentary power.The kids playing jazz on the street, the night club scenes, the tapping feet, the elevator to hell all mount up to an unforgettable visual experience. I wonder if Holly- wood really appreciated the artist in Michael Seresin's powerful camera work.I can hear them say: " yea... too much style... too artistic. this stuff doesn't sell. Too artsy fartsy. "Unfortunately the writing was bad, bad, bad and one has to look into a crystal ball to figure out the plot line. De Niro looked rather silly with his Scorcese get-up. Where were the beetle eyebrows? The long fingernails did not suggest the devil - unless Beelzebug nowadays is a cross-dresser.Pity, all this voodoo-schnoodoo made me laugh. The humor is really not sly and there is more blood all around to frighten even the weak hearted. And all this talk about the SOUL. Beg your pardon, a " doomed " soul.Think back 50 years. The real master pieces of the art of film are eternal because all the ingredients of a motion picture fit perfectly. " Angel Heart " could have been great.

		<fullReview>(written November 2006)This is an old 80s suspense/thriller film about detective Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke), who has been hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to find one Johnny Favorite, once a singer, who owes Cyphre something big from before the war. Harry goes on a long, twisted journey of murder and violence through Louisiana's rougher parts that eventually leads to a startling conclusion.For the life of me, I could not think of much to say about this movie. It's amazing, that's for sure. Great acting, great setting, mind-blowing plot, attractive young women, big names, it's got all of it. There isn't much to say here except that the movie rules. The plot twist is truly genius once you let it sink in.The detractor of this movie is the fact that the ending sucked. It wasn't a good place to stop the movie really. It's a bit hard to swallow at first, you don't know what hit you. And sadly, it doesn't completely make sense, even after you understand it. There are...plot holes, which I won't state here due to not wanting to ruin this movie. And that is really all I can think of to take points off of this masterpiece. Go rent it. Or buy it. Steal it, even. Whatever. Highly recommended to fans of dark and intelligent films.</fullReview>

I hear he got rather disheartened about an acting career--unfortunate as his ability to rise above the slodgy material of Angel Heart's script is impressive. His un-pretty boy looks make him an actor one does not tire of watching. What in the world was going on Robert DeNiro's mind when he signed on for the extended cameo role of Cyphre? Another of the mysteries of this film about stolen identities and voodoo rituals. The love (?) scene in the motel room that has a ceiling leaking gallons of water and blood is a grand climax for Angel Heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murky but well made and acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has been a long time since I first viewed this film in the late 1980's in an edited version to get that "R" rating but it's finally available for everyone to watch in the original version that the director wanted. Story is set in 1955 where a sloppy and dirty private eye named Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is given a call for a job and he heads to a church in Harlem, New York where he meets Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro) who gives him $5,000 to try and locate someone named Johnny Favorite. Angel heads to a mental hospital where Favorite was a patient and there he learns that a doctor was given a large sum of money to make it look as though he stayed there longer than he did. The trail leads Angel to Louisiana where he meets Epiphany Proudfoot.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Epiphany (Lisa Bonet) tells Angel that her mother knew Favorite but now has no information on whether he's alive or not. While in Louisiana some of the people that knew Favorite start to die suddenly and it usually comes after Angel has interviewed them and the local police start to wonder how he is involved. This film is directed by Alan Parker who has such a diversified resume as far as the different types of films he has directed. But two elements in this story are reminiscent of previous efforts by him. The first is the time period (In this case the 50's) and Parker has dealt with period pieces before. And secondly he has made films that showcased the Southern culture and this film does a commendable job of being shot in the humidity of Louisiana. I personally am not as high on this film as others and it's primarily because the script does wander and then lag in the middle as Rourke's investigation goes on without even a hint that he's getting closer to the target. This is a muddled and murky mystery that seems to go on and on but there are some things that raise this film high enough for me to recommend. The set design gives this film such a rich feel for it's time period and the cinematography by Michael Seresin is excellent as he captures the heat and sweat of the Louisiana Bayou. Seresin has shot many of Parker's films and together they certainly have a special relationship that's reflected in their work. But the special thing about this film are the good performances by Rourke and Bonet and they together give one of the steamiest sex scenes in movie history. Parker had to trim it by a few seconds to get the "R" rating but you can view the original scene now on DVD. Rourke plays one of the sloppiest characters in recent memory and he's always unshaven and dripping from sweat. But with that he still keeps the audience interested in what he is doing during the investigation and Rourke always had good screen charisma. This was Bonet's first big role in a film and she's very good as a sexy young Cajun girl that's involved in black magic. This should have led her to some sort of a film career but it never did which is to bad because she shows so much promise here. This story has many twists and turns and even though it bogs down after a while it's still a well made film that leaves an indelible mark of sorts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Film, but not true to original story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original story was published in the late 1970s. In the book the detective Harry Angel seemed to be a little classier than what he is shown in this movie. Also, the book version is set in 1959; not 1955 as in the movie, and the book version has absolutely nothing to do with Louisiana. All the action in the book takes place in New York State; most of it in the City. In the mid to late 1980s the State of Louisiana was trying to attract the movie industry and have portions of movies made in the state. This was to cash in on Louisiana's "different" culture at the time when it's economy was in a terrible slump. The filmmakers were probably given tax breaks, free police escort, that kind of stuff (or so I was told at the time) to induce them to film there. That is probably why the story was amended somewhat to include Louisiana scenes. One error in the movie comes to light- in one scene of the film the detective, played by Mickey Rourke, is clearly shown sitting in the colored section of a street car (presumably the Royal Street street car); being 1955 segregation is still the law of the land except in public schools. Though whites, technically, could go into the colored areas of public establishments or transportation, in reality the other whites would not allow them to do that. It certainly would not be casually done as shown in that movie. Perhaps the movie is right in showing Harry Angel as being a down-on-his-luck gumshoe. In the book he wears a suit and carries a gun quite carefully; taking the legal ramifications of his actions in consideration. Though the book Harry Angel is still somewhat on the shady side he probably is not as realistic as the detective portrayed in this movie, or it is at least not as likely that the book detective would be the sort of person to be involved with such a evil business.Lisa Bonet is great in her role and the movie should be seen if only for that reason. One of the interesting points about a segregated Louisiana is that whereas there was not as much casual race mixing as shown in the movie there was an exception to that where white men were allowed to have a black woman, so long as it was done discreetly. And, this movie shows that quite well.</fullReview>

He speaks with Herman Winesap (Dann Florek) who says he has a client named Louis Cypher (Robert De Niro) who wants to talk with him. They arrange to meet. Cypher want's to hire Angel to find a man named Johnny Favourite, Angel agrees to take the case and after discussing specifics with Cypher he sets of for 'the Sarah Dodds Harvest Memorial Clinic' which is where Favourite was definitely last seen. Once there Angel sweet talks a nurse (Kathleen Wilhoite) into letting him look at Favourite's file, the file claims that Favourite was transfered to another hospital in 1943. The evidence doesn't quite add up and Angel becomes suspicious. He goes to see Albert Fowler (Micheal Higgins) who was Favourite's Doctor at the time. As Angel digs deeper and deeper into Favourite's past he encounters violence, murder and dark secrets that have remained hidden for years, until one final terrifying revelation.Written and directed by Alan Parker I thought it was a good film, but not a brilliant one. The script, which is based on a novel called 'Falling Angel' by William Hjortsberg is intriguing, complex and rewarding overall if you put the effort in for sure. But I found the first half of the film somewhat ponderous and I was a little uninterested in where it was all going. Things pick up a little in the second half as the supernatural elements begin to shine through, and of course the twist ending. The problem is that I knew this was all leading up to something and for the most part I was just waiting to see what. The production design by Brian Morris and cinematography by Micheal Seresin is top-notch and combine to give the film a really good atmosphere and look about it. It's very well made and has superb performances from both Rourke and De Niro but as I said I just wasn't 'into' it as many people seem to be. Once you've seen the film it has no re-watch appeal at all, the whole film is just an excuse for a twist ending which may, or may not impress you. There is some minor gore but not much, there is also a little animal cruelty with a cockfight and a chicken that has it's throat slit in a Voodoo ceremony. There is a pretty steamy interracial sex scene between Rourke and Lisa Bonet, and various other little bits of nudity here and there. Don't get me wrong, I liked it. It's just that I was a little disappointed after hearing so many good things about it. Definitely worth watching but I personally don't think it's the masterpiece many make it out to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If 'Angel Heart' could just admit that it was about a tough but lovable, and certainly flawed private detective who finds some peace in the arms of a beautiful young creole Santaria priestess, it could be forgiven it's meandering train of Mickey Rourke scene thefts.*** Light spoiler alert ***But wrapping it up in a silly supernatural plot line about devil worship and truly unlikely motivation dooms the picture to near B-movie status in my mind.*** End spoiler ***Granted, watching Rourke pull his rumpled charm on a wide assortment of interesting characters in one of the most authentically 1950s landscapes ever captured on film is very nearly worth the price of admission. As a vehicle for Rourke, it is supreme even, to 'Nine and a Half Weeks.' He drives it around like a beat-up '57 Chevy and drag races it up and down the lane for our pleasure. But just as drag races are, in the end, somewhat pointless journeys that go nowhere, so too does 'Angel Heart' fall short of greatness.Private dick, Harry Angel, played by Rourke, is hired by a mysterious and enigmatic fat-cat to find an ex-crooner for reasons the fat-cat seems to want to keep to himself. Thus begins Angel's journey into 1950s Harlem and New Orleans in which he toughs through a number of sordid, romantic, and violent situations with dash and humanity. Who is Angel after and why?If you're like me, you'll stop caring and become more focused on the sheer texture of the film -- that is in addition to Rourke's considerable charisma. Atmosphere is the uncredited supporting role in this movie and it should have gotten an Oscar if the category permitted.At the end, all comes to light in the dumbest of all ways one can do it in a movie -- a long-winded and confusing monologue that will have you re-winding the DVD a couple of times just to get it straight. Most moviegoers can take a chilling end to a mystery in which they've invested so much time as well as any good, old-fashioned happy ending. But to have either delivered in as confusing and slap-dash a manner as this script did leaves one feeling more bewildered and clueless than anything else. You're left saying, "Huh?"Any fan of noir and Mickey Rourke, like me, won't not like this film. But it had all the ingredients of a respected classic, too, but ends up focusing on all the wrong things. In addition to the dopey overall plot, too much style and not enough substance. A failing common to the time in which it was made -- the late '80s.And Mickey Rourke, too, showed all the signs of becoming the next Jack Nicholson instead of the muscle-bound caricature of a Hollywood bad-boy that he's become. What happened?Maybe it was bad scripts. 'The Year of the Dragon,' and 'Nine and a Half Weeks,' were both almost really good films about real people but each kind of got lost somewhere in the middle.So does 'Angel Heart.'Pity.This movie review by Erik Gloor</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set in mid-1950s America, Angel Heart stars Mickey Rourke as tough New York private detective Harry Angel, who is hired by the mysterious Louis Cyphyre (Robert DeNiro) to discover the whereabouts of Johnny Favourite, a famous blues musician who has apparently reneged on a business deal.This is one of those films that seems to have garnered almost unanimous praise, so I feel a bit stupid in admitting that I found the narrative kinda hard to follow; a lot of the symbolism also seems to have gone right over my head, making the film a bit of a chore to fully comprehend. Angel Heart is, however, an undeniably stylish movie, with excellent visuals that make particularly good use of light and shadow (imbuing proceedings with that all-important pulp/film-noir atmosphere). So if, like me, you struggle with the complexity of the plot, at least there's lots of lovely cinematography to enjoy.5/10, bumped up to 6 for no other reason than to make me appear slightly less of a Philistine/idiot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Profusely Bleeding "Heart"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alan Parker attempts to adopt an atmosphere of Lynchian unease in a period setting with "Angel Hert," a Noir thriller with strong (yet mostly subdued) horror overtones. Mickey Rourke plays Harry Angel, a private dick in 1955 Brooklyn who is haunted by dreams of a descending elevator, his own blood-soaked visage, and...chickens. He is enlisted by the mysterious Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to locate an allegedly-dead-but-not-dead Jazz musician by the name of Johnny Favorite; what ensues is a trip through gritty locales and offbeat characters (including a guy who has a year-round hobby of "biting the heads off rats"), with Angel winding up in New Orleans, a steamy land of mystery punctuated by intense jazz numbers, voodoo rituals, and bizarre sexuality. Parker creates a wonderfully involving atmosphere and infuses a sense of dislocation into a period that has been trivialized in other films, with Rourke a capable, engaging leading man (at times looking like a Bruce Willis doppleganger)--his oft-unusual verbal inflections (his pronunciation of "Evangeline," for instance) make Angel that much more a stranger in hostile, mysterious land. De Niro conveys a sense of subdued menace that (up until his final scene, at least) makes his ambiguity all the more intriguing; and Lisa Bonet has a small yet complicated role as the woman who may have the key to Favorite's whereabouts. While "Angel Heart" eventually comes to a point where the 'twist' ending is pretty apparent, the mystery of the initial 90 minutes was enough to keep me hooked until the baffling, open-ended final frame--while Parker seems to panic in giving the audience a coherent explanation, it winds up feeling rushed and a little out-of-place. And the "evil eye" effects that recur near the end look laughably bad today. But still, "Angel Heart" is a refreshingly mature horror film that requires some brainpower to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fifth And a Half Sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It opens with Mickey Rourke as Harry Angel, a bummy kind of private eye in a seedy office in Brooklyn in 1955. The black plastic phone rings. It's a potential client, a law firm. "Do I know what an attorney is? Sure I know what an attorney is. It's like a lawyer but the bucks are bigger." The lawyers names are Winesap and Macintosh -- two apples. A long-forgotten crooner is missing. He owes the lawyers something and they want Harry to track him down. A missing person case. Harry meets the client in the loft of an Evangelical black church in Harlem. It's Robert DeNiro overly decked out and trying on an elegant accent. The story soon gets complicated. People begin to turn up with oddball names -- Proudfoot, Johnny Favorite, Evangeline Krusemark, Toots Sweet.So far, we feel we're on pretty normal ground here. A Raymond-Chandleresque mystery will follow, during which we'll lose sight of the original problem while we meet eccentrics, goons, and pre-verts, and we'll be taken down colorful paths into mansions and down into spooky basements and people will be knocked off for reasons we don't understand.Well -- yes, but with two or three twists. One twist is that the next thing we know, we and Rourke are out of Brooklyn and into New Orleans and environs. Another twist is that the story moves into the orbit of the supernatural -- voodoo, black magic, mummified hands, pentagrams, Satanism, selling one's soul to the devil, and all that -- and it's meant seriously. I mean the devil is real and is a real character in the film. (Why he insists on meeting Rourke in a Catholic church and warning Rourke against using the F word in such a place isn't entirely clear.) The third twist I won't reveal except to say that the people who made "The Sixth Sense" might have seen this ending.It's a weird movie, overall, teetering on the brink of being arty. Off-kilter shots of ventilator fans slowly creaking to a halt. Rain turning into blood for no apparent reason. Murders committed for no apparent reason either. And not only that, but the victim's heart is cut out and left on the floor. There's a thin line between beauty and baseness, and at times this film and its editing go beyond atmospheric into plain sloppiness and self indulgence. Much is made of the voodoo thread that leads Rourke to Louisiana but in fact it has nothing to do with the central event of the story, which might just as well have taken place in the apartment of Rosemary's baby.DeNiro is a great actor but he's in the wrong role here, or rather the role is wrong for him. Whatever else he is, DeNiro is always grounded. But here his lines are written as if meant for somebody like Clifton Webb or George Sanders. Mickey Rourke -- whatever happened to HIM? He's very good in this, as he was in many of his earlier films. The next thing we knew he had a new raggedy haircut and a pair of boxing gloves. What a loss for us. Lisa Bonet is beautiful and sexy and demonstrates how well suited she was for a television sitcom. The musical score is pretty good except at times, during moments of dread, we get a booming heart-like sound that's guaranteed to induce at least a headache and at most a gallop rhythm.There's another loose end to the plot that keeps nagging me. I can't understand why any of the murders were committed.And another. Why does Mickey Rourke wind up having to pay his dues when in fact he's not the same guy who signed the contract? He has a different face and a different brain and a different set of memories. He doesn't even KNOW he's the guy who first made the deal. Is he held to the contract because he happens to have the same set of fingerprints? Somebody tried to ploy the system once in Connecticut after a sex change operation and were foiled because of that simple dermatographic fact.At times it's a little tiresome but it's worth catching if you haven't seen it, especially if you're unfamiliar with Mickey Rourke's talent, curious about Lisa Bonet's bosom, or a fan of the occult.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy and sensuous movie hampered by convoluted plot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The atmosphere of this movie is beautifully done, the power of Lisa Bonet's and Mickey Rourke's sex scene is often mentioned, but the way that scene segues into something disturbing, hallucinatory, and sinister is reflected throughout the movie, with many scenes of relaxed decadence interspersing the creepy and often chilling main story. This gives the movie a great atmosphere, and it's helped by the fact that there are not only very good performances from De Niro and Rourke (which I had expected - De Niro puts in a very menacing performance in a role which could very easily come off as campy and silly), but also mostly good performances from the supporting cast.The whole tone of the movie is very unique, mixing together a lot of the tropes of "Satanic Panic" movies, a weird hallucinatory feeling, and a neo-noir detective story.So why did I only give it 6/10? Well, the whole underlying plot of the movie is far too strange and complicated for its own good, and relies on three big twists that weren't too hard to see coming...SPOILERS FOLLOW *********** The main twist is signposted right at the start, when he talks about coming back from the war with shell-shock - this immediately set off warning signals for me about amnesia plot twists, and gave away that he was looking for himself. A second twist that De Niro is the devil is also heavily signposted in that his name is Louis Cypher and he has pointy fingernails and generally plays the role of sinister tempter. Then there's a third twist that Harry Angel is doing the killings that became obvious after the second person turned up brutally murdered just after Angel had met them. To make all these twists work, however, the plot has to involve a very complicated and convenient sequence of deals with the devil, soul swapping, amnesia, face-changing plastic surgery, strange plans to fool the main character by his friends, and actual demonic possession. Despite this several things remain unclear, the outcome of the deal with the devil to become famous just resulting in one minor single, what Harry Angel actually knows and feels at the end (it seems he remembers everything, but he must now have two sets of memories one of which is just an innocent guy), why the devil made him commit all the murders without him knowing (it kills all the people involved in the Satanic cult, but also kills the doctor, who was a bit dodgy at worst, and his daughter, who was innocent, and then the devil kills the lawyer from the beginning himself, so the devil doesn't need an agent to do the killings for him, and so many murders are unnecessary to frame Angel), also if the devil has such control over Angel, it's unclear why he has to go through a long process of discovering clues to find out who he and then frame him for murder.I've gone on for far too long about problems I had with the plot. Arguably everything does make a sort of sense because with several supernatural explanations going on, just about anything can be literally explained away by magic, but I just felt that things just didn't fit together at the end to create a satisfying explanation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To my mind, Alan Parker has always been one of the least interesting filmmakers who ever lived. Unfortunately, he's had access to some of the most interesting plots/premises in the movies. 'Angel Heart' is probably the ultimate case in point. It's basic set-up - that a man sold his soul to the devil for fame and fortune, but then found a way to renege on the deal - is fascinating. In the hands of William Friedkin on form, or Roman Polanski, or even Jeff Lieberman, this could have been a great little film. Instead it's overlong, portentous and pretentious, and lacking in anything approaching real wit. It's also terminally rooted in the 80's with it's overt, lazy score, spurious sense of 'style' (lots of shots of ceiling fans and Ridley Scott lighting) and general lack of subtlety. Some things even Parker can't foul up, though. The De Niro scenes are highly enjoyable, Rourke is watchable and the guy playing 'Toots' is a hoot.I haven't read the book, 'Fallen Angel' by William Hjortsberg, that this is based on, but I'm betting its pretty good. Shame that Parker, the man who made fiction out of the real life 'Midnight Express' and never got William Wharton's 'Birdy' off the ground, got his paws on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel Heart is a dreary mishmash of overblown egos, lofty expectations, misplaced symbolism, and garish excess. Its "thrills" aren't thrilling, its "mystery" isn't engaging, its characters are uniformly repulsive and it tries to score so high on the shock meter that it comes off as nothing but a common exploitation film. This is a highly disappointing result given the excellent novel from which it was adapted, and a major career fumble for talented moviemen Alan Parker and Robert DeNiro.This movie was infamous when it came out in 1987 for the long battle with the MPAA to avoid the dreaded "X" (now NC-17) rating, specifically for some steamy antics involving Lisa Bonet, then under the (thankfully) mistaken impression that her stint on the Cosby Show would springboard her to stardom. A movie this bad doesn't even deserve to be remembered for that controversy, because the scene involved (I won't spoil it for you) is a yawner. The plot is unusually choppy, and Mickey Rourke's limp portrayal of Harry Angel leaves the viewer totally unsympathetic and thus indifferent as to whether he solves the "mystery" or not. Killings and other bloody business masquerade as "atmosphere," and except for looking grody or artificially spooky there's no real attempt to give this film a strong flavor. It's really hard not to burst out laughing at the final shot of the film, something you don't want to do after sitting through a "scary" movie.Missed opportunity for all concerned. Hopefully for you too, because if you're smart you won't waste your time on this rubbish, and read the book instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy and fun though ultimately shallow horror noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Angel Heart we see noir and horror come together. A twisted tale of private investigation, dark secrets revealed, preoccupation with fate and its dark inescapability, the great hallmarks of noir. And with a number of grisly sights and voodoo infused plotting its a basically effective blending of the two genres. Put simply its a thoroughly watchable affair that grips from the start and breezes by with nary a dull spell. Sadly for all its slick watch-ability its too flawed a work to be all that powerful or memorable but its entertaining at least. If entertainment you seek here you shall find it, but I can certainly see why this is lauded more by genre fans than critics. But the pluses first. Mickey Rourke is the biggest in his role as Harold Angel, private eye on the case. Somewhat cynical and sleazy whilst retaining a sense of righteousness its a spot on performance that impresses more and more as the film goes on and things get darker. A terrific focal point, and the rest of the cast is pretty spiffing too, Robert de Niro is on cool and quiet form as Rourkes wryly sinister employer, the ever classy Charlotte Rampling puts in an elegantly witchy turn and the comely Lisa Bonet makes a splash as a young priestess (who appears in the films most eyebrow raising scene. The film looks super too, from the dark alleyway opening with smoke curling up from beneath onwards there's a great sense of the life of place, of human bustle and animal scuffle, heat and wet, richness and poverty. And within it all is the suggestion of dark, but here lies the films main problem. As horror, as dark piece Angel Heart is never more than efficient. Sure there are grisly sights, ones that escalate during the course of the film to one or two nice shocks. But its all too clean and controlled, where delirious revelry is needed the film offers tight editing, smart framing and restraint, clinical cuts to the meat beneath the surface rather than a better double fisted clawing plunge. And much as the horror has little more than surface charm so does the rest of the film. Plentiful symbolic shots of air conditioners hammer home the plight of mechanisms against inevitability, but there's far more atmosphere than suspense and the films revelations are standard genre theatrics. Fate has a face but offers little more than standard villainy, a white man delves deep into colored circles but racial tensions are minimal, no doubt I'll find even more to pick up on with a second viewing. All this is not meant as seriously heavy criticism by the way, its still one of the easiest watched I've had in the past few months, an hour and three quarters or so whipping along like it was less than half that length well mounted with some aforementioned great aspects and quality moments. Its just rather frustrating to see a quality genre piece with a truly great work suffocating within, and at the close of play I couldn't help but sit back and ponder being let down. Still well worth a watch if you haven't yet though, may be lightweight but its still kind of a treat. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly speaking 'Angel Heart' isn't a easy film to watch, its dark, gory and twisted. Nothing really works in this enterprise, except the Evergreen Legends Robert De Niro and Mickey Rourke, who deliver outstanding performances. De Niro as the evil villain leaves a lasting impression in a cameo appearance. Watch the scene where he offers Rourke an egg, and that proves it all. Rourke on the other-hand is commendable. His body of work in the entire movie deserves an ovation. And how can I forget Lisa Bonet. What a performance! On the whole. 'Angel Heart' is a gory 1987 flick, which deserves a watch only for De Niro and Rourke.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1950s Brooklyn, private eye Rourke is hired by the mysterious De Niro to track down a missing person. Rourke gives perhaps his best performance as the two-bit detective who is seemingly in over his head as dead bodies start piling up in his wake. Parker creates an excellent atmosphere in evoking 1950s New York and New Orleans. The first two-third of the film is fairly intriguing as Rourke follows his leads. However, the finale is a big letdown, resorting to silliness in trying to explain the mystery and thereby undermining everything that has gone on before. Bonet is alluring in her film debut but this controversial role probably hurt her career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angel Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Alan Parker (Bugsy Malone), this mystery thriller might not look like much, but with two big stars you can sort of think it is. Set in the 1950's, private detective Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is hired by Louis Cyphre - get it, "Lucifer" (Robert De Niro) to find a man called Johnny Favourite. He is following all the clues he has concerning who knew him and where he went, and ending up in more strange situations. Things to expect are one or two dead bodies, a controversial sex scene where the lovers get blood from the ceiling dripped on them, and De Niro with long fingernails. Also starring Enemy of the State's Lisa Bonet as Epiphany Proudfoot, Charlotte Rampling as Margaret Krusemark, Stocker Fontelieu as Ethan Krusemark, Brownie McGhee as Toots Sweet, Michael Higgins as Dr. Albert Fowler, Elizabeth Whitcraft as Connie, Eliott Keener as Det. Sterne, Charles Gordone as Spider Simpson, Dann Florek as Herman Winesap and Kathleen Wilhoite as Nurse. Besides the bloody moments, and the acting of Rourke and De Niro, this film isn't really much, but it isn't terrible. Worth watching, at least once, in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By comparing it to both 'The Exorcist' and 'Chinatown' the makers of 'Angel Heart' have painted themselves into an awkward corner, admitting they don't fully trust their own feature to succeed on its own (admittedly slim, and in this case purely cosmetic) merits. Spurious similarities aside, the film has little to offer other than a few atmospheric occult thrills with Film Noir pretensions. The plot follows a stylishly seedy New York detective named Harry Angel, hired by mysterious 'businessman' Louis Cyphre (say the name aloud fast) to track down a missing person in debt to Cyphre for more than just money. The bewildering trail of clues introduces Angel to various pagan rituals in and around New Orleans (including an interlude of voodoo sex with Lisa Bonet), leading finally to a macabre and gruesome conclusion that spoils the moody air of unease by its over-explicit reference to the film's title. If the giveaway character names aren't obvious enough, consider Mr. Cyphre's shaggy hair and sharpened fingernails; the only details missing are a forked tongue and cloven feet. How Robert De Niro became involved in this oddly compelling piece of crap is the strangest mystery of all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel Heart (1987) *** (out of 4) Harry Angel (Mickey Rourke) is a down on his luck private eye who usually plays it safe by not accepting any case that could get him in trouble or force him to spend too much energy. One day he receives a call from an attorney who has a client wanting to speak with him. Harry travels to a broken down church where he meets a strange man calling himself Louis Cyphre (Robert DeNiro). Mr. Cyphre isn't willing to share too many details about what he wants done but it deals with an old business contract.Apparently Mr. Cyphre bought the rights to a musician who eventually made it big and decided to back out of his deal. Many years have passed but Harry is asked to find out if this man is still alive and if he is, Cyphre wants to know where he is. Harry sets out thinking this is your typical missing persons case and at first it appears to be just that. However, the mystery soon goes to Louisiana and a small community, which practices voodoo and apparently had a hand in the disappearance. Soon bodies begin to pile up and Harry is no closer to solving the mystery but he finds himself being drawn into the mix when he meets a young voodoo goddess (Lisa Bonet) who seems to hold the key to the myster.Angel Heart was one of the most controversial movies of the 1980's thanks to a graphic sex scene as well as various grisly murders but the film remains one that people either love or hate. I've seen this film countless times over the years and my opinion of it changes with each viewing. At some points the film is highly entertaining and its strangeness certainly works throughout but at the same time director Alan Parker really brings the film down. In the end the film remains something very interesting but I can't help but feel it could have been a lot better with a better director.The film is the private eye genre mixed with horror elements and these horror elements are the films strong point. When Rourke is in New York trying to gather clues the film really drags because everything going on is something we've seen in countless films of this type. We see the hero going from one cliché scene to the next and naturally he soon finds himself a suspect in a murder case. The film really takes off when Rourke heads to Louisiana and the backdrops of voodoo enters the picture. Voodoo has had a strong part in horror history yet something new is offered here, which is something we haven't seen before.In most movies about voodoo or any unusual religion we are always given reasons and explanations about what's going on. If a certain ritual dance is being shown then someone is always there to let us know what the dance means and why they are doing it. In this film however the screenplay is smart enough to keep the voodoo as something unknown and this gives the film a creepier atmosphere. We are discovering the voodoo and seeing it the same way as Rouke, which helps draw the viewer into the film and the mystery that is unraveling.The key point of the film is Mickey Rourke who is one of the most underrated actors whose career sadly didn't go where it should have due to his tough guy image. Everyone from Humphrey Bogart to Jack Nicholson has played private eyes and in many ways Rourke's performance here is a homage to the older days of the genre. When we first see him the guy looks like a bum off the street with his unshaven face, dirty clothes and depressed nature. By the end of the film he still looks the same way but his inner soul is now showing and hanging out for us all to see. His performance here is deep and mysterious, which is the perfect note for the revolutions that will follow at the end. There isn't a false moment anywhere for Rourke, which just goes to show how well of an actor he is. Robert DeNiro must have had a blast playing his role and adds good support to the film. Former Cosby Show girl Lisa Bonet also fairs well in her film debut.The biggest problem with Angel Heart is some of the direction by Parker. The first half of the film drags in spots due to us seeing it in countless other movies and a few others scenes at the end should have been trimmed a bit. Parker does a nice job keeping the mystery a secret even though we should have caught on at the very beginning. This is the type of film that may leave you not knowing what's going on and you'll probably find yourself thinking about what the ending means but when you start putting the pieces together you'll notice that while the film is a bit confusing it's also very well laid out in detail. The ending doesn't come as a cheat and after replaying the clues you'll certainly have a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From the heyday of Extended MTV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie works as a montage of images that range from the mildly disturbing (the old lady standing in the surf, singing as a storm gathers) to the intensely disturbing (blood dripping on Mickey Rourke's bare butt while he chokes Lisa Bonet). So it belongs in a little-acknowledged genre of expressionistic 80s films that combine intense visuals with a silly or incomprehensible plot (think "The Hunger," "Altered States" and "9 1/2 Weeks," which also starred Mr. Rourke). Let's call these flicks "Extended MTV." The storyline of "Angel Heart" veers closer to the "silly" end of the Extended MTV spectrum -- Rourke plays a hard-bitten private detective hired by a mysterious, slightly sinister wealthy man (Robert De Niro, showing off) to find a vanished singer named Johnny Favorite. Yeah, the set-up is kind of "Big Sleep"-y, but the actual film is more "Rosemary's Baby" meets "Total Request Live." Rourke's (Hark the) Harry Angel character wanders around some creepy New Orleans sets, loses an underacting contest to Charlotte Rampling, watches Lisa Bonet choke a chicken (literally) and eventually finds out that he's . . . whoops, I don't want to ruin the "surprise" if you bother following the plot.If you're not familiar with Mickey Rourke and wonder why he had to make a comeback in "The Wrestler," well, "Angel Heart" explains it all for you. He's charismatic enough to command your attention but self-conscious enough to annoy you every second that he's on screen. Charlotte Rampling, one of the most underrated villainesses in film, is arresting in a small, thankless role and you wish she'd stick around long enough to rip Rourke's heart out instead of . . . uh-oh, almost spilled the beans again. Lisa Bonet was paid to look pretty and get naked, and she earns her salary. And every now and then De Niro likes to demonstrate that he's also a great theatrical actor, capable of vanishing behind costumes, accents and mannerisms (think "Brazil"). He seems to be enjoying himself as the menacing Louis Cyphre (cute, huh?)so "Angel Heart" is worth renting if you're a De Niro completist. Or if you're a fan of goofy, overproduced, underwritten 80s movies that fooled a few inebriated undergrads into thinking they were bleeding-edge art (or was it just me?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the end of the movie, I was thinking: What the hell did I just see? "Angel Heart" is that kind of a movie. It doesn't make much sense until you look back on it. While at this time, the pieces fit together, it hampers the enjoyment of actually watching the film. One might argue that it would work better on a second viewing, but at least in my opinion, it's not worth it.Harry Angel (a very young Mickey Rourke) is called by Louis Cyphre (Robert De Niro) to track down a man named Johnny Favorite. While on the case, Harry discovers that he really had no idea what he was getting himself into.The acting varies. Mickey Rourke is terrific as Angel, although the script has him act irrationally in some cases. He's a guy we can immediately root for. I don't know why Robert DeNiro's part was labeled as a "Special Appearance." His part is more than an cameo; in fact, he has the most screen time next to Rourke (although Rourke is in every scene). Lisa Bonet is rather flat here, although she can attract sympathy like no one else.My complaints about "Angel Heart" would be minor if the film was suspenseful, scary, or for that matter, interesting. Unfortunately, it is none of those things. I spent the whole time wondering what the hell was going on. Not exactly the kind of response you want from a viewer.The approach (the film will only work when it is pieced together after the credits have begun to roll)that director Alan Parker took with the project is not a bad idea from the get-go. Unfortunately, Parker is unable to keep the audience very involved, and that's a big problem."Angel Heart" has been described as a cult film. After viewing the film, I can say that I am not a part of that group.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Naked breasts -- the most wholesome stuff in this flick :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror, suspense, action, gore, softcore porn? Here's a movie that probably inspired the more recent flicks, The Devil's Advocate and The Ninth Gate. It has really good acting and very solid dialog, but the pacing is a little off and the plot revelations come very late in the film and rather clumsily at that.Mickey Rourke is really good. His character is pretty entertaining to watch, likable and revolting at the same time. The exchanges between him and most other characters are pretty good and Rourke's guy Angel gets in a lot of good lines. The homage to '40s noir is really excellent, the sets are legit and the music is moody and eerie and never lets up. This stuff carries the movie pretty far. Really excellent is the elevator motif and its recurring symbolism. I liked that a lot. Those elevator shots ruled and were way ominous.In the DVD extra interview, the director mentions the book this movie is based on stays central to NYC. But the director took creative liberties with the film and moved part of the story to the Louisiana bayou. This is where the film slows down and becomes somewhat choppy. A lot of stuff happens with loose ends or nothing is revealed to the viewer until the final scenarios play out, those of which I personally did not find to be anything particularly mind-blowing. The first half of the flick breezes by, but the second half seems to take a really long time.Oh, also the "occult" elements are totally amateurish (not to mention the horrible, horrible special effects!). I mean, come on people! Consult someone who knows their satanic jazz before you start talking about black magick and whosits. Intriguingly, I felt the same way about The Devil's Advocate and The Ninth Gate, though I thought those films had much better pacing, even though the acting might not have been up to par.It's worth watching if you're a sucker for Rourke's acting chops, occult or alternative suspense/horror flicks, or you just wanna see Rourke's hairless bum (I'm serious). The feeling of this movie reminded me of some of those decent H.P. Lovecraft movies ("From Beyond") and the presence of a NYC-Bayou connection with the devil involved reminded me of that guitar/blues-related Ralph Macchio vehicle, "Crossroads", from around the same time as "Angel Heart".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading all the stupendous reviews of this film , and then seeing this dreary movie myself, I have to come to realize that either I am totally out of sync or the movie was itself out of sync, with both period-film production as well as modern cinematography.Leaving comparisons with the novel aside (and that is true for 99% of Hollywood films based on popular novels), this film is about the mannerisms of the lead actor, Mickey Rourke. The movie must be having about a million camera angles of Rourke's face, the way he speaks, mumbles, stumbles, lurches, runs, drinks, fights, romances, jokes, grimaces, smokes umpteen cigarettes, etc etc etc. The pacing of the film is so slow that it is a perfect panacea for insomniacs. Robert de Niro, as usual, is a treat to watch, and his perfectly manicured nails made my perfectly manicured and coiffured wife, suffer from an inferiority complex. The allusion to voodoo is pure crap and the film suffers badly till the end, as it is neither a horror nor a murder mystery. It has absolutely no re-watch value, and I doubt that anyone will suffer the first 90 minutes of pure, unadulterated boredom, just to enjoy the 5-minute twisty end.To repeat: A good substitute for Alprax, for those on medication for insomnia.</fullReview>

Maybe that I now know the ending I might enjoy it more if I watched it again. I also might enjoy it more if I was in a different mood. I don't think I was in the mood for a movie of this style. -Wayne in Canada</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1955, seedy Brooklyn private investigator Mickey Rourke (as Harry Angel) is hired by spooky Robert De Niro (as Louis Cyphre) to find an old "big band" singer named "Johnny Favorite". The trail of clues lead Mr. Rourke to seedy Louisiana, and he encounters sexy voodoo priestess Lisa Bonet (as Epiphany Proudfoot). Dead bodies and hocus pocus reign. Rourke knocks boots with Ms. Bonet, as things get darker and bloodier? Director Alan Parker, with great assist from cinematographer Michael Seresin, seemed to have something really good and stylish happening with "Angel Heart" - but, ruined it with an ending from hell.**** Angel Heart (1987) Alan Parker ~ Mickey Rourke, Lisa Bonet, Robert De Niro</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if anyone does not see the ending coming you should be slapped. honestly, at the time this cliché might not have been as badly abused as it is now but now it stands out like a sore thumb. the director spares no expense pointing out all major twists half an hour or more before they are "shockingly" revealed. if you fancy yourself dense or have a tendency to miss clues presented center screen and highlighted then go ahead this movie will shock you senseless but if you want something that might cause you to think some go rent "Brutal". the production values are a little low but i promise you will have a harder time solving the mystery before the title appears. aside from those complaints its watchable, a little offensive( a plus), and you get to see some girl from the Cosby show naked. i can think of worse ways to spend an hour or two...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angel Heart .......................................................Huh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Angel Heart is an awful movie and for one to compare this to Psycho is an insult to a master director in Alfred Hitchcock. Psycho was shot in black and white film noir with a story line that people could follow and understand, even before the doctor analyzed Norman Bates, since the movie title was called Psycho. I am a fan of Mickey Rourke in the days of Rumble Fish and Rumble Fish was dark but you could follow it through to the end. But in Angel Heart, its a movie literally drenched in characters, story lines, blood, chickens, gratuitous sex and killings to such a degree where the viewer can't follow and understand. One moment Angel is having sex with a Voodoo Priestess and the next moment she's his daughter? Huh! Angel is hired to investigate a man who later in the movie turns out to be himself? Huh! Amnesia is not a criteria for a P.I. When the movie ended, I said to myself, Huh! I walked out of the theater totally confused not knowing what the conclusion was. Norman Bates was the Psycho with a split personality dominated by his mother. Johnny Angel or whatever his name was since he had so many aliases, was an investigator, investigating a missing person who happens to be himself who murdered people but had no memory of it, had sex with a woman who was his daughter .............................? To much to absorb. No conclusion. Take a Pass On It.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie quote - "Someone cut his dick off, stuffed it in his mouth, and choked him to death." To me, I saw Angel Heart as being director Alan Parker's statement about his deep-rooted hatred towards blacks.I mean, Parker certainly went well out of his way to emphasize racism, big-time, in this picture and make blacks out to be the most clueless, most gullible, most voodoo-loving idiots imaginable.Personally I view voodoo &amp; religion as being, pretty much, one and the same thing. To me, religion is clearly whites' idea of "civilized" voodoo. Nothing more. Nothing less.And, once again, (just like in 9 1/2 Weeks) actor Mickey Rourke proved that he needed neither good looks, nor likable screen-charisma, nor any noteworthy talent to be one of Hollywood's top-ranking stars of the 1980s. (With Rourke I still remain completely baffled by what brought about his vast popularity in the movies during the days of his youth) Angel Heart is clearly one of those frustratingly confused and convoluted stories that (in all of its demented confusion) gives away its surprise, twist ending far too early in the show.And, actor Robert De Niro as the drab, soul-collecting Lucifer (with his immaculately manicured fingernails) was a bore of the highest order. Like, as though Satan, himself, would be the one going after the ones who had welshed on giving over their souls when their contract expired. That, I'm sure, would be a job for one of his henchmen to deal with.Yeah. OK. Angel Heart did contain some very striking imagery, at times, and the fairly explicit sex scene that took place between the Epiphany &amp; Angel characters was quite startling to behold - But, in the long run, this film was a certified limp banana as far as its "Noir" aspect was concerned.And, yes, it fell flat on its face when it came to the impact of its horror element, as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very misguided attempt to create horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Verbal stories, books and dramas, based on the theme of someone prepared to bargain with the devil, and ultimately selling their immortal soul in return for worldly treasure of one type or another, have been a part of the literature of almost every culture and religion since the dawn of writing - so it is inevitable that the cinema has its share. I will nail my colours to the mast right away - in my opinion none of these works surpass the classic play "Dr Faustus" by the early English dramatist Thomas Marlowe, either in well rounded dramatic appeal or theological relevance . For me, this play although not totally original towers above later and often better known versions of the Faust legends such as Goethe's dramatic poem or Gounod's opera. All of these however transcend Angel Heart. This popular film still carries a (for me) incredible IMDb users rating of 7.3; if compared with them it can be seen as the absolute trash that it was. Assuming the supernatural was what its makers wanted to feature they would have done far better to base their film on Marlowe's great out-of-copyright drama rather than to purchase rights to a twentieth century imitation set in New York, and then stiffen the content by stirring in a gratuitous mix of voodoo rites that had nothing to do with the book they were filming. But they appear not to have known or even cared, whether their aim was simply to create a horror film designed to appeal to impressionable young people or whether it was to provide some sort of morality linked message - ultimately they achieved neither. True the film has a certain superficial gloss which is initially attractive, but ultimately most of it is simply ludicrous and where its search for horror runs unchecked it becomes crude and disgusting.If its makers aimed simply to create a horror film they needed to recognise that horror comes from showing ordinary normal people going about their normal days activities, and then to gradually make the viewer aware that these people are unknowingly only a hairbreadth away from some contingency that will change their lives for ever. Think not of imaginary monsters or supernatural events, but of such ordinary situations as 2,000 people following everyday activities on the Titanic when they were told that most of them were five hours away from spending their last five minutes battling the cold waters of the North Atlantic. Or think of the office workers in the twin towers carrying out their normal daily activities five minutes before the terrorist's 'plane struck and doomed almost all of them. Among films, few create such a sense of horror better than 'Naked Fear' where a young girl quietly trying to earn her living in a strange town suddenly discovers she is on the hit list of a maniacal serial killer. But Parker's films are always flamboyant and he is not the right director to produce such a film. Instead we have a film steeped in necromancy which can raise little more than a chuckle with its juvenile efforts to make our skin creep. Murnau did far better with his silent classic 'Faust', filmed in 1926 but still supporting an IMDb rating of 8. Did the makers of 'Angel Heart' ever watch this? I have not read their original novel but I understand its scenario was entirely set in New York. Parker has attempted to rake up the horror by shifting the scene to New Orleans and bringing in some lurid voodoo rites. Voodoo beliefs provide much of interest but I felt they were better featured in such simple low cost B movies as 'French Quarter' or 'Barravento' and I do not know what place they were supposed to have here unless it was to provide justification for some of the extremely crude and gross, but totally pointless images - often verging on the obscene - gracing this film. Ultimately for me the only real emotion these raised was extreme distaste. I can only hope that those responsible for the planned re-make are determined to avoid repeating Parker's fiasco.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As so often, the plot has been laid out often enough. So straight to the point: This movie sounds interesting and has an acceptable concept. Technically, it's well done; good acting (Rourke, De Niro, Bonet), dark atmosphere, a convincing set.Its only fault is: It's boring and way more ambitious than what it delivers in the end.(Spoilers ahead)The age-old subject of a man selling his soul to the devil and then trying to cheat his way out of the deal may still be appealing but it only works if the cheater is at least a bit likable. Harry Angel (the obvious pun is annoying either) isn't. He's a brute, a bully, a loser. Someone you don't care about at all. Who cares if he looses his soul?To make this waste of celluloid a bit more interesting, they thrust in some voodoo, some half-incestuous sex and lots of blood. Unfortunately, it's all uninspired and looks like a gumbo soup. Better spend two hours cooking instead of watching this piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, first off, nothing Mystery about it. If it's supposed to be a parody or some such nonsense, it's very not hidden. This might be considered a spoiler because, if you see this movie, you will know every detail before it happens. Lisa Bonet, obviously trying to come into her own as an adult actress, overplayed her role, as did everyone. This movie was not a thriller in any way. What makes people critically acclaim it is beyond me. Maybe as an "art" film? The plot was predictable and very resist-able. The actors were bad and seemed to reveal too much to keep you in suspense. I was very disappointed in this movie. Someone who knows me well recommended it, thinking the ending would surprise me. Anyone with any sense of what is considered a plot twist will be able to see the first five minutes and know everything about everything. What a waste.</fullReview>
