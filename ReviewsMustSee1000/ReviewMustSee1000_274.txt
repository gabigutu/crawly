		<fullReview>I have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run down.Why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be.This film is supposed to be a light hearted, tonge in cheek, family comedy, things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults, and that is exactly what this film does.I laughed my nuts off at this film, I thought Carey put in a great performance and the whole film (if watched at Christmas) really give you a bit of festive cheerSo to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not "Taxi Driver" or "The Godfather" and take films for what they are supposed to be, entertainment!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Merry Christmas to All...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been eagerly anticipating the opening of this film for several months. Being a huge Jim Carrey fan, I easily saw how he could morph himself into Seuss' Grinch and make the character his own. I was not disappointed. This movie was pure magic. Carrey is a master at his trade and no one could have played this role to perfection as he did. There was plenty to enjoy for both adults and children alike and this movie is sure to become a timeless classic for all to enjoy in the years to come. I already have visions of my young daughter sitting down year after year to watch this remake on video, and I undoubtedly will watch with her and laugh as I did the first time I saw it.Clearly, this movie has Jim Carrey written all over it, and I do not believe that it would have come together without him. However, the supporting cast was charming and entertaining in their own right, most notably the adorable Taylor Momsen who was the perfect foil for Carrey's antics. The set design, musical score and costumes all lent their hands to a magical, fabulous finished product and I believe all involved can be proud. It is not an easy feat to turn a 22 minute cartoon classic into a full length live action film, but Howard has succeeded with flying colours. For those critics who disagree, perhaps it is your hearts that are 2 sizes too small.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the land of Whoville everyone loves Christmas and count down the whole year until that wonderful time. However just outside Whoville lives the Grinch, a green hairy twisted creature that hates, and always has hated, Christmas and was rejected by the Who's as a child. A young girl from Whoville sets out to befriend the Grinch and help him find his love of Christmas but, when it goes wrong early on, the Grinch becomes even more rotten and plans to ruin it for everyone.I have never read the book or seen the original animated version of this story, but I do enjoy a bit of Dr Seuss and was worried about how such imagination would be filled out on the screen. The film actually manages it very well and the whole film has the look of the books, even if it lacks soul at times. The plot is stretched out to the running time and could have easily been shorter and punchier, but at heart it is a good little moral that is good from Christmas time.However, aside from the look of the film, the main reason that the film works is Jim Carrey. I cannot think of another actor who could have pulled off this role as well as he did. He is manic and really funny although I imagine that if you dislike him and his antics that you'd hate the film totally. I'm on the fence about him but I did enjoy him here. Momsen is OK but really just a `cute kid' and, while the support cast has quite a few famous faces, they don't make much of an impact under the makeup and the film is left to Carrey to save it - which he happily does.Overall this film is a little too long and padded out, but while Carrey is onscreen it seems to go pretty fast due to his hyper acting and comedy antics. However, it's Christmas and it has a nice message while not totally giving in to syrupy sentiment (thanks again to manic Carrey) and it's just perfect for kids and adults at Christmas time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you went to this movie to see some huge academy award presentation...oh well..but if you wanted to see a funny delightful adaptation of an old classic, you will love it..Jim Carey was incredible as usual. The story line was great, a few parts added like the history of the Grinch made it even better. Ron Howard never misses a beat..But although there were a few ADULT comments and cleavage added, this is supped to be a kids or family show. Try not to lose sight of that ..if you do you really wont enjoy the movie...and as for the comments about Ron Howard, try to direct a major motion picture and see how you do..its not easy as it looks ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Giggling With Jim Carrey's 'Grinch'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Howard's 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a delightful family flick that both adults and children can enjoy (mostly with each other). It is basically an adaptation of the famous children's books and what the audience gets is a pleasant Christmas treat. Price's screenplay is brilliant as he cleverly manages to include some adult humour.The world of Whoville is beautifully constructed and created, full of colour, life, energy and spirit. The vivacious characters are full of positive energy and while it is over the top, it is all done within the context and none of it appears out of place. The CGI team and makeup crew deserve full credit for making the characters and settings so lifelike, bringing out a lot of detail and appearing authentic. The set designs are stunning and the cinematography is just as energetic as the characters.Child actress Taylor Momsen is absolutely. The cute dog also turns in a fine performance. Jeffrey Tambor, a very sexy Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon are first rate. However, what would 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' be without Jim Carrey? Carrey is simply fantastic as he immerses himself entirely into the character. It's a role that has Jim Carrey written all over it. The actor has immortalized the Grinch on screen.The movie itself is not an exact 100% adaptation of the book as there are a few changes. The romance between the Grinch and Martha May could have been better developed. Other than the actors mentioned above, the rest of the cast hardly have anything to do than make fleeting appearances. Yet, 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a charming little Christmas family film that is dazzling to look at and hugely enjoyable with the whole family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lot Of Fun; Looks Great On DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this a very entertaining small kids movie that actually is geared more for adults with a lot of jokes and humor only they would understand. A few things are inappropriate for the kiddies, but just a few. Othewise, "The Grinch" (Jim Carrey) cracks so many jokes you can't keep up with them all, ranging from sexual to cultural to insider-Hollywood to racial.The film is very colorful and looks great on DVD. The little girl in here, "Cindy Lou Who" (Taylor Momsen) is really cute and the costumes and hairdos of the little people in here are fun to view. Anthony Hopkins' voice is pleasing, too, so having his narrate this elevates the movie further. His rhymes are fun to hear.I saw this in the theater, though it was "fair," but on DVD, it was far better. I've seen in three times and it got better each time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good Morning, or should I say Good After Noon, or Good Night? Uh what the hell, Hello fellow readers. Today we'll be looking at a very great family adventure, also one of the best Christmas films, THE GRINCH. This film reaches the pinnacle of family films and Jim Carrey makes a great choice by signing on to play the lead character. Though this film has a very poor score on this web site, I am here to tell you that this may be one of the most under rated film entry's of all time. This film is called "terrible", "disgusting" and "not even funny!" Now to that I have one word to say but that word is known as a swear word so I won't say it for such reasons as: I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO WRITE MORE REVIEWS. Anyway this film is a great motion picture and Ron Howard proves he still has a lot more life in him then some question. And so finishes my review on a great and funny film, The Grinch (2000)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the Grinch Stole the show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree completely, this film looks extremely overblown, and it is.Though the sets and costumes are visually amazing, they go by too fast too be truly appreciated, and there is the feeling that it is too much crammed into too little. Besides this, the supporting cast have very little to do, and the presence of Anthony Hopkins as the narrator is rather puzzling. Besides that, several weak story points are added, for instance, like the romance between the Grinch and Martha May seems completely superfluous. However, if you want to see this movie, see for Jim Carrey, who steals the show as the title role. He is simply hilarious! He does, however, run a close race against Cindy Lou Who, who is unbelievably cute.The difference between this movie, and the cartoon, is that this movie is set more from the point of view of the Grinch. In the cartoon, the Grinch is the villain, a grumpy old hermit who is jealous of the Whos and their happiness. The Whos, in the cartoon, are just simple, country townsfolk celebrating Christmas, and when the Grinch finds he cannot destroy Christmas, he knows he cannot make them suffer the absence he feels in his life, and finally understands the holiday spirit. In the movie, however, the Grinch is a slightly more modern take on his character. Actually, you can't blame him for wanting to do something about the Whos, who, in this movie, are a grim reflection of our society, and the crass consumerism and capitalism that yearly chokes the true meaning of the holiday spirit for material possessions. The Whos are so immersed in their own greed that it almost seems they deserve it when the Grinch drops the ball on them. The writers also make them seem as irritating and overly cheerful and loud as possible, with their gaudy decorations and foods, and creepy, sugar-coated style. Cindy Lou's reaction to this is our own, and she and the Grinch find the real meaning of the holiday. She and the Grinch are better seen as role models to today's holiday company, as a message not to lose ourselves in our own material greed that has become common to this holiday, but to instead remember what Christmas is. I think this holiday would get a much better reputation if people made it a routine to imagine a Christmas without presents or trimmings every year, just to keep that image in mind. But, if you don't want to be annoyed by the Whos, or blinded by the slightly overdone sets and costumes, watch it for Cindy Lou, or, if you don't like 'cute' movies like me, but like Jim Carrey's raunchy, slapstick, Marx Bros. style comedy, watch it for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Keeps Growing On Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes......This movie has really grown on me. I'm a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. I saw the movies and owned the books as a kid and was given the books as a present in my 30's by my friend Amy Fidler. I loved the original movie so it made it hard at first to accept the remake but honestly, it has been well done. Jim Carrey is amazing and all of the other players rocked it. The original movie has innuendos of the character traits of the stars, however the new movie allows for much more cast/character depth and development. I have to admit, there's one scary scene here with the two main characters however I think you have to really let yourself go in order to experience the thrill. Bought it on the Playstation Network, can't wait to own it on Blu-ray. Narrater rocked it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very eerie, but definitely worth the watch. Creepy, yet good Christmas movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas is by far one of the most enjoyable, feel-good Christmas movies ever made. Fact. It's creepy, nonetheless, but it's also very heartwarming in some particular scenes more than others. A lot of the film revolves around a young Taylor Momsen, but the title character, the Grinch, played by Jim Carrey, is of course the best thing about the film. Not all Christmas films are like this one. This one's unique. It's a different take on Christmas - a different approach. A good approach, too. How the Grinch Stole Christmas has plenty of Christmas feel-good moments, a few funny scenes here and there, and good makeup. It's almost entirely consistently eerie, because The Grinch is a very eccentric, creative, eerie character in the film. It's a good film overall, and you should always watch it around Christmas time. It's definitely one of the best Christmas movies ever made. 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey at his best in the Grinch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ask and Who, there's no place like Whoville around Christmas Day. Yes, every Who down in Whoville likes Christmas a lot, but the Grinch (Jim Carrey), who lived just north of Whoville did not. The Grinch hated Christmas, the whole Christmas season.It could be because his head wasn't screwed on just right or it could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight. But I think the most likely reason of all is that maybe have been that his heart was two sizes to small. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) goes and sees who raised the Grinch who talk about the Grinch and say he wasn't a bad Who, he was just different. Cindy gets told the day at school just before the Grinch was last seen again.Jim Carrey is a hit as the Grinch and even in the serious times in this movie he is hilarious. Carrey I last saw in the movie "Yes Man" with Zooey Deschanel which was a movie about a guy who always says no and goes to a seminar about saying yes which changes his life and gives him more possibilities in life than he thought he knew. Momsen is much older now and it's fun to see where the actors or actresses end when you saw them when they were younger. She actually now is currently on the TV show "Gossip Girl" as Jennie Humphrey on Monday nights if you wanted to check her out in her role on the show or just see where she is now. This movie also stars Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Clint Howard, Josh Ryan Evans, and Mindy Sterling. This is a good Christmas movie for the whole family to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a disgusting, offensive, frivilous prostitution. Mean-spirited, superficial, and completely lacking any resemblence to the original story. Has anyone ever READ the original story? The point of Seuss' "Grinch" is not that the Whos are selfish weenies who learn how to be grateful after the Grinch steals all their Christmas. THE POINT OF SUESS' GRINCH IS THAT THE WHOS ALREADY KNOW THAT MATERIAL GOODS ARE NOT THE POINT OF CHRISTMAS, AND THEY HAVE THE GIFTS AND GADGETS AS AN EXPRESSION OF WHO THEY ARE, ALREADY, INSIDE. Jim Carrey is at his annoyingest; Ron Howard shows glaring deficiency in basic storytelling; and the general plot is gaudy and ridiculous, not to mention risque and offensive -- wife-swapping at the party? The Who children brutally mocking and ostracizing the young Grinch? The buxom Whoville sex-pot? A ROMANCE STORY? Give me a green latex make-up-covered break. The sets, make-up, and camera work were obviously meant to be stunning and grand. Instead they came across as exaggerated and trite. The Grinch's bat-cave-like home? The nauseating use of tilted camera shots? And oh, wow, what great latex noses. Brilliant.I physically shuddered as this atrocity progressed. Commercial, soul-less, pathetic.The sky animation, though, was nice.Really, really bad. My children will never see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long and Nonsensical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is entirely too long, but what really annoys me... even more than the Grinch's overacting... is the nonsensical direction the story takes.The film attempts to tell the story of the Grinch, including a fully fleshed out back story of his childhood being emotionally damaged by the thoughtless Who children. Fair enough I suppose, except the original Grinch tale was about consumerism, and the real point of Christmas being love and family rather than gifts. This Grinch eventually arrives at the same change of heart as the original, quoting the same lines that Christmas "came just the same," before returning the gifts. But why? None of it jives with his poor treatment by the Whos earlier on. Unlike the original Grinch who was only obsessed with the gifts, this version gives no explanation as to why he should have suddenly forgiven all of them. The entire thing feels arbitrary and ill-fitting.Add that to the excessive runtime and the general unlikability of most of the characters, and we're left with a film that doesn't deserve a spot in the annual holiday rotation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Ron Howard Stole the Grinch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a film adaptation of the always memorable 1957 book by Dr. Seuss. The story was already adapted into the classic 1966 television special featuring Boris Karloff the Uncanny. How does it hold up compared to these and other Christmas movies? Not particularly well.To say something nice first, the film looks great. If ever you wanted to see a Dr. Seuss book come to life, this is it. The set design is terrific. The blend of miniatures and computer generated imagery is fantastic to the point where stuff looks very convincing. The make-up effects were good enough to win an Oscar.Jim Carrey does a great job. He obviously is having fun with the role, getting to play as over the top as he wants. His usual silly improvisation works well with the role. He also does very well in the make-up, able to perform many facial expressions that don't look real. That one iconic grin appearing to be digitally enhanced, though it wasn't. And once the movie gets to the book/special parts where the Grinch is actually stealing Christmas, Carrey shines and makes the movie incredibly fun.The rest of the cast is okay. They are all overplayed bordering on camp, but I guess that was what Ron Howard was going for. Taylor Momsen does a decent job in her first starring role, but Cindy Lou is portrayed as far too over-the-top sweet. Every scene she's in seems to punch you in the face with how sweet she is and how cute she looks. Anthony Hopkins is fantastic as the narrator, but he's got such a good voice he could make the phone book sound interesting. This is about where the good stuff ends.The TV special had directly adapted the book, so to turn it into a full length feature extra content had to be added. Some is welcome, most is not. I do like how they expanded on the relationship between the Grinch and Whoville since the original story did not have much. The concept of why the Grinch hates Christmas is good in theory but the way it was done was lousy. The whole "Made fun of as a kid" thing has been done dozens of times before and doesn't help the original story's true message (more on that later). The entire Whobilation sequence is dumb, tedious, and seems to exist only to fill up space. Howard had some fun and Carrey got to be silly but it hardly helps the plot in anyway. You can skip past it and not miss anything.Ron Howard is mostly known for his dramatic movies. Backdraft, Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, Frost/Nixon, and even Parenthood was more of a dramatic movie with comedic elements. And he seems out of his element by doing this campy, silly style. He would have done better with a dramedy like Parenthood. But this just isn't his style and it shows. Other directors can pull off camp with style but Howard, like Spielberg, is better suited for drama with comedy added.The biggest problem with the movie is that it completely reverses the message of the original story. Originally, the Grinch didn't understand the true meaning of Christmas and it was the Whos who made him see the truth. In this movie, the Whos are over-commercialized gluttons who only care about material things and it is Grinch who makes them see the truth. What? Did the producers ever even read the book or watch the special? Didn't anyone involved ever say, "Hey, you got this backwards."? The reason the Grinch is a grinch is supposed to be because he just sees the material things and thinks that's all there is. Later, he realizes that stuff was only a representation of feelings. Here the Whos are all self-centered jerks, except for overly sweet Cindy Lou, who represent all the negative things about the Christmas season until the finale. As with any adaptation, fans will tolerate any change as long as the spirit stays true to the source. But this movie was not faithful to what Seuss was trying to say. If the movie had just stuck to the original story and just expanded on Grinch's misconceptions about the season, the movie would have done very well. After all, he's supposed to be the hero and villain whereas here he is simply this green goofball doing random things up until he actually performs the title deed.Children will probably enjoy the silly antics and goofy setting. Though my little brother (who was three when the movie came out but I don't remember when he did see it) was terrified of the Grinch for years after seeing the movie because Carrey can be intense for the younger ones. Adults will probably find the story to be dumb and full of fluff. Fans will enjoy how Carrey performs the role but may find the story to be too drastically changed. If you're looking for a good Christmas movie, there's plenty better about finding the true meaning of Christmas. Plus the classic TV special is readily available wherever this movie is sold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amusing Christmas film that captures the imagination of Dr. Suess with Ron Howard's bold direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard is known for making such dramatic films like Apollo 13, The Da Vinci Code, Angels &amp; Demons and many more, but before those two adaptations of Dan Brown's novels, he adapted the original book of the same from Dr. Suess, a remake of the 1957 cartoon "How The Grinch Stole Christmas".The premise, like the cartoon, is the same: The Grinch plots to steal Christmas from all of Whoville, but learns that Christmas comes from the heart. This one, however, has a few tweaks that weren't included in the book. It details the Grinch's past about him being humiliated by the children of Whoville and has a relationship with Martha May Whovier. It wasn't the best origin, but wasn't that bad at all. While this movie stayed true to the spirit of the book (and despite it's crude and inappropriate humor but has a few good jokes) Jim Carrey, although over-the-top, did a perfect job as the Grinch. The rest of the cast did great especially Taylor Madsen as the lovable Cindy Lou-Who.I show some empathy for fans of the book who hated this adaptation, but as for me, I'm recommending this Christmas classic to others highly.Rating: 8.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Spectacular Christmas Movie,but Jim Carrey is Undeniably Entertaining,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a great movie with a well written storyline and a good cast.It certainly made a few mistakes with adapting the classic Dr. Seuss book in to a live action movie,there are just certain elements to it that certainly could have been improved upon.It is a film lots of people like to watch at Christmas,and while I'll admit it is a fun movie,it dosen't really put me in to the Christmas cheer the same way movies like Its a Wonderful Life or the Santa Claus do.However,Jim Carrey as the Grinch is certainly a highlight,he's completely unrecognisable in this make up,but the characters personality and mannerisms remind us that it really is him under all that.I remember reading a review by Roger Ebert a few years ago in which he said that this movie focused too much on the meanness of the Grinch,and I would have to agree that this was a problem as we are suppose to feel sympathy for him,but it's hard when all we are seeing is why he's a bad person and seeing very little moments of kindness.It certainly made a few mistakes,but How the Grinch Stole Christmas is still a fun movie that brings the creations of Dr. Seuss to life,and I would recommend it to a family looking for a nice Christmas movie. An evil creature living near the cheery town of Whoville plans to put a stop to Christmas once and for all. Best Performance: Jim Carrey Worst Performance: Molly Shannon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A big part of me hates this movie. It's overblown, the simplicity of the original story is smashed, and the look of the film is garish. They turned the Whos into smug materialists instead of the kind-hearted, wise folks who loved Christmas because it was a time of love and fellowship. Also, no one can replace Boris Karloff as the Grinch. Ever.Still, I cannot deny this film is a major guilty pleasure for me. Jim Carrey is over-the-top and ridiculous, but his overplaying makes me laugh (and I must admit, the make-up on him is fantastic). The disgusting-looking Whos are so terrible-looking, but that's hilarious too. Everything they could have got wrong went wrong, but it's done in such a stupid manner that it makes it kind of charming in a weird, surreal way.I wouldn't recommend it, but at the same time, if you want to do some MST3K for a holiday movie and got tired of Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, then this is the flick for you.</fullReview>

By grabbing hold of and finding the strength of the very merry, holly and jolly Christmas, he saves everyone's Christmas instead of stealing or ruining it. They make his Christmas the best one so far, and he makes the Christmas their best ever. By watching this with my grandfather, it really brought out the Christmas spirit in me. It really, truly did. It made my Christmas. The music in this movie brought it up, if just a little. It was nice, it was indeed. I am giving it 6 or 7 stars out of a possible 10.

		<shortDescription>A Refreshing Christmas Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big budget remake of the classic cartoon about a creature (Jim Carrey) intent on stealing Christmas.I had rather low expectations for this one... not sure why, as it turned out to be quite good. I just wanted to add a few thoughts here.First of all, Taylor Momsen nailed the Cindy Lou Who part. She has gone on to bigger, better things ("Gossip Girl") and good for her. Second, Ron Howard nailed the look of a Seussian world. The faces, the architecture, it all seems so right and I think the good doctor would have approved. I heard that Tim Burton was approached to direct, and I think he would have done a fine job, but how do you beat this? And last, Jim Carrey. Wow. He has had some good and bad career decisions, and this has to be among his best. The physical comedy, the improvised jokes, it was like the role he was born to play. The other choices were Jack Nicholson and Eddie Murphy. Nicholson could possibly have done it ten years earlier, but did he have that range of motion in 2000? And Eddie Murphy? Maybe, maybe not. This was a Carrey role inside and out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the hands of director Ron Howard and star Jim Carrey, "Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole Christmas", is a loud, obnoxious, excessive, CHARMLESS bore. This very short story is expanded to 1 hour and 45 minutes of grotesque imagery that focuses on repugnant characters, who wear out their welcome within 30 seconds. Carrey's schtick is beyond unbearable. Easily one of the worst films I have ever seen. NOT recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There... I dissed a Ron Howard movie. Usually a Ron Howard film dictates quality and a light-hearted touch. This is just heavy handed and makes this story into something it was never meant to do.This is a story about the spirit of Christmas. In the original story, all the Who's of Whoville are not phased by their loss of decorations, libations and gifts. They come together and through their genuine spirit of love, come together, and it is this that makes the Grinch's heart grow.The movie gives a background to the Grinch... and to boot blames the Whovillians for the Grinch's bad attitude. So wrong and flawed.The character of Cindy Lou Who builds on that and further impunes the citizens of Who-ville. tsk tsk tsk. That is not the innocent of the original story.The narration while interesting completely re-writes a beautiful story...tsk tsk tsk Dr. Seuss was right not to let this story be re-told.The odd thing is that this story could have been abstracted into something altogether different ... much like the re-telling of another Christmas classic... Scrooge.But no... the theme was used and abused and ended up with a sad tale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My personal opinion on the Grinch 2000</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The BEST movie ever! I don't understand why there are so many unhappy reviewers on this magnificent film. Ron Howard, if your reading this, please please make another one but you got to use Jim Carrey as the Grinch again, he was extraordinary. And to add the icing on the cake, what about an actual Whoville Village filled with actual running stores and candy shops at Universal Studios, YEAH!! (I'm not loosing it people, I'm actually a very intelligent person with a huge imagination). I feel Ron Howard brought this amazing animated all-time classic to life. My daughter LOVES this film (and she's a teenager). So everyone ignore the negative reviews and if you haven't watched it, its a must see and I hope you enjoy it as much as the rest of us Grinch-Lovers. Way to go Opie/Richie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This an appalling movie: either a cynical cash-in of the beloved TV special or a delusional misfire. Either way, is it shockingly poorly made. The set direction looks like remnants from Pee-wee's Playhouse. The cast (beyond Carrey and Hopkins) dips into TV second bananas. The script is obviously stuffed with more filler than bad dog food. The pace all feels wrong--there are times of almost excruciating slowness or just plan inanity. Jim Carrey can not carry (sorry) this movie. It seems like he's struggling to put his stamp on the Grinch and Howard offers no help. Speaking of Howard, I actually saw a clip if him comparing this movie to "The Wizard of Oz." What audacity! Combined with a sledgehammer marketing campaign to reap in the bucks now repeated with the video/DVD release, I feel insulted that a perfectly good piece of entertainment (the original Grinch) has been co-opted. This is nothing new--remember "The Flinstones." I say, unless you come with an idea of your own--don't bother.</fullReview>

The actors loked horrible with their makeup. The first hour was a painful experience to sit through. The first hour was the Jim Carey show and I did not pay to see Jim Carey walk around in the Grinch costume talking in a Sean Connery accent. I paid to see The Grinch and it was nothing like it.

		<fullReview>I cannot imagine that Dr. Seuss would have liked this movie if he was here to see it. The only common characteristic linking that fantastic little book and '66 special to this unfaithful pile of film is the title. First of all, this movie takes countless liberties for the sake of stretching the story out to an hour and a half. The classic line "The Grinch hated Christmas/ The whole Christmas season/ Now don't ask why/ No one quite knows the reason" is spoken in the film (by Anthony Hopkins, who does a great narration of the story the way it should be told), then contradicted entirely by a very clear summary of the Grinch's life. Then there's Whoville itself: In Ron Howard's movie, it's depicted as a corrupt, somewhat dark town of sex and alcohol. What book was Ron Howard reading? There is no cynicism in Whoville! "All the Whos in Whoville liked Christmas a lot." Remember? Also, there is nothing in the book to imply that a shot of Christine Baranski's cleavage and Jim Carrey using the word "bitchin'" might help the story along. I won't even get into Jim Carrey's performance. TERRIBLE. He played himself, not the Grinch. The girl who played Cindy-Lou Who was cute and fit in with the story very well. Other than that, the movie sucked. Just watch the original and forget this was ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How?! This film is awful! A wonderful kids book should not be turned into a full feature length film! Dr Seuss must be rolling in his grave. The film is filled with bad jokes, Jim Carrey being annoying with one of the original messages getting completely jumbled up. The writers felt that it was necessary to put in A BUNCH of adult jokes that are sexual, gross and painful to watch when you realise that this is based on a kids book! While the Grinch himself looks fairly good, the Who's look like demons! They even act like demons! They are nothing like Suess envisioned them to be. They don't even act like the Who's from the original book! The settings (while fairly large) have bleak colours (colors if you're American) and some appear as fairly ugly. It rarely follows the book and when it does, you finally get a sense of relief. Then a gross joke is shoved in your face and you begin to despise this film even more. I don't understand how most people like this film. Jim ruins some of the scenes and it is just an awful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard, who never met a story he couldn't screw up, takes the delightful holiday cartoon classic and turns it into something gormless, vulgar and awful. The cartoon used imaginative language and iconic animation to create its magical effect. Howard replaces all of that with gaudy art direction and stupid physical humour. The makeup effects are creepy, not cute; the Whovillians are anonymous drones -- and it doesn't help that they look like half pig/half human lab creations. Jim Carrey, who on paper seems like he would be perfect casting, overplays to the hilt, creating exactly the opposite effect to that inspired by the original droll creation of animator Chuck Jones and actor Boris Karloff. The only positive attribute Carrey could have brought to the film, that rubber face with which he could have created any number of comic moments, is buried underneath heaps of prosthetic makeup.This is a foul, terrible movie, and I can't believe that anyone could possibly like it. How it even rated a 5.6 here at IMDb is beyond me.Grade: F</fullReview>

Ron Howard's version was a loud, garish horror, so awful that he should be made to return his Million Dollar Baby Oscar {although he deserved it) to compensate. How could Howard butcher a classic that way? Yes, he's entitled to make his own vision into a film, but he should have reconsidered. This was as arrogant (and as ill-thought out) as the Psycho remake a few years back. Suggestion to filmmakers everywhere: Wheb something is perfect, leave it the hell alone.--arnie113 -- Boy, do I feel stupid. Of course Clint Eastwood directed Baby; that's what I deserve for staying up late and not checking my facts before posting. but Howard is the director of Frost/Nixon, and maybe in penance for Grinch he shouldn't win.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 3 words that best describe this film are, and I quote, "Stink! Stank! Stunk!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(possible spoilers)Someone once asked Dr. Seuss if they could secure the movie rights to his 1957 Christmas classic How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He turned them down, insisting that no one could do better than the marvelous Chuck Jones TV special from 1966 (also in mind, perhaps, was his bitter experience writing the script to 1953's The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T). When the good Dr. died in 1991, his widow, Audrey Geisel, still obstinately refused to sell the movie rights. But with the commonplace use of CGI effects becoming a reality, Mrs. Geisel had a change of heart. Universal made her a generous offer she accepted; she also accepted the casting of Jim Carrey as the title character. Supposedly she was satisfied with the final result. Well, Mrs. Geisel, that makes one of us.The film was given a $123,000,000 budget (which is more than even Heaven's Gate cost, including the adjustment for inflation), which obviously went towards the very elaborate makeup, set design, and special effects (which are underminedsomewhat by the rather hazy cinematography). Unfortunately, it seems that none of that money was set aside to get a better script than what Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (scribes of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, which made much betteruse of a high budget) turned in. Whereas the TV special was a trim 26 minutes without commercials, this film tries to fill a running time of 105 minutes with more background information about the Grinch. It turns out that, as a child, he was the subject of ridicule, including an especially humiliating experience one Christmas at the age of eight. So it turns out that everything that ails our poor Mr. Grinch is directly because of the Whos. Trouble is, it seems like a rather long 105 minutes, with too much dead wood clogging up the story. That might not seem so bad if only the Grinch were a little more...well, Grinchy. The character that Dr. Seuss wrote and Chuck Jones later animated was a sly fox whose slick attempts to hijack the holiday season were undermined by his sudden change (and exponential growth) of heart. Carrey's Grinch is a loud, hyperactive oaf and, at times, a thug who, when made the holiday `Cheermeister,' trashes the Whoville town square in anger(hopefully the scenery tasted as good as it looked). This undermines the script's attempt to make the Grinch more sympathetic, with all the Whos down in Whoville so unsympathetic (at least in this interpretation).The Whoville of Dr. Seuss's vision was a small town populated by honest folk who knew in their hearts the true meaning of Christmas. The Whoville of the movie is a rather noisy and crowded place populated by spoiled, selfish, materialistic ninnies; an obvious attempt to comment on American consumerism. This is offensivelyhypocritical inasmuch as the film industry has benefitted greatly from American consumerism, and as this film contributed to it with a huge merchandisingcampaign.The film also expands and redefines the character of Cindy Lou Who, a small but crucial character in the original. The innocent two-year-old waif who walked in on this spurious Santa is now older and wiser, constantly questioning the false values of the Whos and trying to understand the Grinch's point of view (her one major scene from the original is re-enacted, making it seem out of character). Sheseems to be the only one who would ever know that Christmas is more than just gifts and decorations, thus making her a completely different, and more annoying, character.Those who celebrate Christmas should sooner accept a lump of coal in theirstockings on the morning of December 25 than a copy of this overlong, overacted, excruciatingly tedious, ham-handed, crude attempt to turn the children's classic into a feature film. It proves once and for all that darkness, vulgarity,manipulation, and heavy-handedness are inadequate substitutes for charm, wit, sincerity, and heart. The folks at Universal should get down on their collective knees and thank God that this truly bilious $123 million stink bomb grossed $260 million domestically or they'd not be here today. Furthermore it made Mike Myers' The Cat in the Hat possible!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Howard Ruined Dr. Seuss.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000): Dir: Ron Howard / Cast: Jim Carrey, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, Molly Shannon, Bill Irwin: We are all curious as to how the Grinch accomplishes his mission on the most giving time of year but from what I can gather, the only thing he truly stole was my admission fee. He is rejected from a small village and lives in the mountains. We are never given any back story as to what his parents were like. Instead we are given a lame pelican explanation that just seems tacked on. The villagers also have snouts, which I never fully understood and probably never will. Plot regards his stealing away Christmas and having a change of heart. While it may mirror the classic holiday animation, it still comes off as artificial. Interesting directing choice for Ron Howard who is known for films such as Apollo 13 and The Paper. While his attempt is praise worthy, the payoff is nowhere near as entertaining as the animated film. Jim Carrey is the ideal choice to play the Grinch but without any background, it just comes off as a really good impression. Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor and Molly Shannon are given the embarrassing tasks of sporting snouts and lame lines of dialogue. The Grinch costume passes but art direction is artificial and about as festive as your average toy store. Perhaps the Grinch should have stole the screenplay. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knock-down-drag-out performance by Jim Carrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in early 2000, Ron Howard's live-action version of Dr. Seuss' "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" stars Jim Carrey in the eponymous role of a green curmudgeonly monster living on a mountain outside of Whoville. He hates Christmas and has a beef with some of the citizens of the village, like the mayor (Jeffrey Tambor), but little Mary Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) inspires change in his life and the town. Christine Baranski is on hand as a woman in Whoville who has a secret crush on the mean freak.The original 1966 cartoon based on the 1957 book was/is a potent denouncement of the materialistic side of Christmas: After the Grinch steals all the presents, food and decorations in Whoville, he's dumbfounded to discover that it doesn't matter to the villagers as they sing together in jubilation to celebrate the holiday, which profoundly transforms the Grinch.This live-action version severely complicates matters in order to extend the runtime to 3? times as long. Here, the townspeople are not so one-dimensionally benevolent and we discover why the Grinch is so cantankerous &amp; hateful. Concerning the former, the villagers have to learn a lesson about the meaning of Christmas as well as the green meanie. The theme of 'love conquers all' is driven home with Taylor Momsen standing out as the cute 6 year-old girl. Her performance is so great it's hard to believe that she was only 6 during filming. Interestingly, Taylor went on to launch the hard rock band The Pretty Reckless in 2009.The imaginative Dr. Seuss-inspired sets are as good as could be expected for a live-action version of a cartoon and the beefing-up of the story is interesting while turning off purists, but it's Carrey's over-the-top performance that's most memorable, not to mention quotable. The likable dog, Max, is great as well.The film runs 104 minutes and was shot at Universal Studios, University City, California, with some outside photography of Utah.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is really fun, though his canon does include some clunkers. I really wanted to like this film, but with all the bells and whistles and Carrey's mugging, it just got dull. Because it is from the Grinch's perspective, the events seem cruel. The humor is juvenile and unoriginal. It has that anything-for-a-laugh being to it. What carries it to a point is that it is a good story. But it is not enough. I guess when someone does a sequel, even if it is a feature film updating a cartoon, it needs to take it to the next level, to put some new and original spin on it. I'm not even saying it's terrible; I give it a six. But a few days after seeing it, I really took nothing with me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about a green hairy creature called Grinch, who hates Christmas a lot. He goes a long way to destroy Christmas, until a charming little girl changes his mind."How The Grinch Stole Christmas" is a visually rich film. The sets are so colourfully decorated, and people are so extraordinarily dressed and styled. Every Who people has almost unbelievable hairstyle! All the designers have let their imagination run wild while designing the sets and characters. These surely helps to make the film joyful and festive.However, the plot is not as good as I hoped, as it lacks a certain magical spark that makes people sympathise with the characters. I found the Grinch character annoying, as it behaves more childish and irresponsible than a spoiled child. Fortunately, the ending is heartwarming, and saves the film from being a bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the Grinch Got Annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off I am going to admit that I love the animated classic, so that is more than likely going to have some bearing on this review. In the animated one the Grinch is mean &amp; nasty. He hates Christmas &amp; that is all I need to know. Ron Howard (whose films I usually like) has made this Grinch merely a vehicle for Jim Carrey to go over the top and get quite annoying. Jim Carrey in my opinion is at his best when he shows some restraint. "The Truman Show" is my favourite role for him. Albeit I don't think anyone else could have pulled off the Grinch quite as well as he tried to. There are a few funny lines, but sadly not much else to this slow and quite frankly bad film. Perhaps they could have dragged out the story to fill an hour. Which in children's films is still somewhat respectable, but this thing goes on far too long. This first hour of this film has absolutely NOTHING to do with the animated classic. It is only after an hour of Carrey mugging and doing some rather stupid tricks for the camera do we get to the meat of the story...The Grinch STEALING Christmas. Those scenes in the classic were great (as is the whole thing),but yet again we have Carrey's Grinch being LOUD and obnoxious while he is breaking into the Whos homes &amp; stealing all their stuff. He even uses a vacuum for crying out loud. Now that is a quiet way of robbing somebody isn't it. The animated Grinch is a much better thief I guess. *POSSIBLE SPOILER* The line "maybe Christmas doesn't come from a store" dare I say it the moral of the tale is ruined by one of the opening shots of every Who down in Whoville going nuts and spending every who-dollar and every who-minute shopping for Christmas presents. In fact the only Who down in Whoville that knows any better is Cindy Lou who is a quite bit older than 2 in this film. Do yourself a favour and either watch The CLASSIC animated version when it is on TV or rent it.Do NOT. Repeat DO NOT get sucked into the marketting hype that is the live action GRINCH because it just plainly WHO-SUCKS!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>$123 Million dollars to do a remake of a 22 minute cartoon! Ridiculous!!! Ron Howard is fine as director, and Carrey is almost tame as the grinch, but pulls it off. But the actually movie is slow-paced, dull, loud, too big and gets lost in itself. I think the intentions were very good, but got swallowed by the Hollywood Machine!This movie should have been about 20 or more minutes shorter than it was. Alot of unnecessary scenes, and build up just started to bore me. We did not need to see the Grinch as a child. That was never an issue in the cartoon...He was just the Grinch...Plain and Simple!Not enough time was spent on the parts that were from the cartoon. The Cheeriest Person Award, or whatever it was called, was just silly and padding as far as I'm concerned. There was just too much in the movie to really appreciate the Dr. Seuss of it all. The costumes, makeup, sets, etc. were brilliant and breath-taking. They really did give it the cartoon feel, but went way over the top.Overall it they cut it down, took out the Love interest of the Grinch ( what was up with that???), and just stuck to the main points. A 45 min or hour long Live version would have been more than sufficent.4 out of 10 for the film 10 out of 10 for the costumes, set, and makeup!</fullReview>

Crumpit earlier and when they came into town talking about how they had seen the Grinch, the cold-hearted mayor, Mayor May Who, get's word. Since this year would mark the 1000th Whobilation, he doesn't want even the word 'Grinch' to be mentioned. Lou's wife, Betty Lou Who, was trying to beat Martha May Whovier in the lighting contest and Lou get's a prank phone call asking if his "subzero chilibrator" is running. But why does the Grinch hate Christmas so much? Cindy Lou Who decides to find out, so she interviews various Whos who tell the tale of the Grinch as a lad, who hated Christmas from the start, but when he was 8, he took a shine to Martha May Whovier, who kinda liked him too. But a young Mayor May Who claims Martha was his girlfriend. He and his buddies are mean to Grinch. Grinch also has a beard, and since he never shaved before, it doesn't turn out right. May Who and his friends are awful cruel to him, so he runs off and has lived on Mt. Crumpet ever since. For the Whobilation, a Cheermeister must be selected. Cindy Lou nominates the Grinch and ventures to Mt. Crumpit to tell him. The Grinch doesn't really want to go, but soon "changes his mind".But before he can get his award, he get's tossed into the Chair of Cheer and is force fed pudding and fruitcake. Then he runs a sack race. When it's all over, Mayor May Who presents him with his gift: a shaver. It all comes back to him and he beings to rant and rave on why he thinks Christmas is stupid, then burns down the city's tree and snatches a little car. Grinch can't stand it anymore. He must stop Christmas from coming, so he get's the idea to dress up as Santa Claus. He builds himself a hi-tech sleigh, get's himself a Santa suit, dresses Max as a reindeer and blasts off to Whoville. He steals all he can get his furry green hands on. Then he takes his load to the top of the mountain to dump it. Back in Whoville, all the Whos awaken to see what has happened. Mayor May Who blames it all on Cindy Lou Who for getting the Grinch involved with them. But it takes Lou Lou Who to talk sense into everyone and to explain what Christmas is really about, so now everyone's happy again. The Grinch soon realizes the true meaning of Christmas and turns nice. He saves Cindy Lou's life then they go back to Whoville, where Grinch returns everything and they all go back to his place where he, he himself, The Grinch, carved the roast beast.This is a very good film. Better than the animated original.Jim Carrey was a good Grinch. Jeffrey Tambor was good as that mean old Mayor May Who! Ron Howard directed the film, and a trademark of his is: familymembers. Mostly his brother Clint Howard, or his father Rance. In all of Ron Howard's films, these people can be found. Especially Clint. "Cocoon", "Apollo 13", they're there. In this movie, Clint plays Mayor May Who's toadie, Whobris. This film was very popular when it came out and it still is. I recommend it!! --</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An instant Holiday classic! Great fun for all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Seuss' "How The Grinch Stole Christmas", has been airing every year on television since the 60's, and every year, I enjoy watching it over and over again, so, I could not wait to see this movie. And the movie definately does not disappoint!! Fantastic sets, a great cast, and a great job by director Ron Howard bring the holiday classic to life.The Grinch lives on a mountain above Whoville, where all the Who's enjoy their favorite time of the year....Christmas! However, the Grinch does not like Christmas, and he sets out on a mission to ruin it for the happy go lucky Who's.The feat of turning a 22 minute cartoon into a feature was not easy, however director Ron Howard really did a great job. There are also some interesting bits where we get to see just how the Grinch got to live at the top of the mountain, what he was like as a child, and they even give him a love interest!!Really great retelling of the story! Jim Carrey is just splendid as the Grinch, and the narration by Sir Anthony Hopkins, adds a sort of class to the film. Get your family together, and enjoy watching this new retelling of a classic story.Merry Christmas!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure where to start with this movie. I just didn't care for it too much. First of all the character of the Grinch. Many stories featuring him display him as pure evil, in this movie, he was far from that, he was more eccentric than anything else, and just plain weird. And why did Cindy Lou become such a central character in the story? Also, she look like she was much older than two, and above all the ending was w-a-a-a-a-a-y too corny.I have to hand them a little credit for make-up and special effects but as for everything else, do yourself a favor kids and watch the animated version by Chuck Jones, or better yet, read the book!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing as Christmas is approaching, and it's tradition for people to write jolly (or not) reviews for films, and Hollywood to make un-jolly films for them to review... hold on, I'm sorry, it's really approaching Halloween. But remember: This is scary!Anyway, I'd better warn you about something: Jim Carrey really looks like himself in this film. Those clips you've seen with him getting buried in makeup? Played backwards; they're putting makeup on him so he looks rubber-faced.Special effects look good in this film, but really, do you expect us to believe that there's a town inside a snowflake? No! Also with bad features:Jim Carrey's in it-enough said! Unneccesary subplots like Cindy Lou Who's biography makes the film go on for 13 hours! We can't believe that a tunnel will take you upward and harm you!More is that they do not change the ending. Come on, (spoiler) for one, it's telling you to give up on your dreams! I mean, Al Gore doesn't push the Christmas stuff that he stole from Whyville over the mountain! Don't tell me that it was in Dr. Suess' story; it still tells you that dreams are silly!Also, there is no point to remaking good films anyway. What do I mean, you ask? Psycho, Planet of the Apes, and now this piece of ****. And to think, we pay money to see CGI-and-nothing-else films like this!Rating: -86566/6PS: Notice that I never said one specific word from the title?

		<shortDescription>CU Film Critic takes on "How the Grinch Stole Christmas."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen far many, many reviews of `Dr. Seuss' How the The Grinch Stole Christmas' in which critics can't resist the urge to write in rhyme, and every last one I've read irritates me. Yet, as I sit to begin my review, I feel the uncontrollable urge to begin rhyming myself. I promise not to.I remember being excited to hear that there would be a live action version of `The Grinch' starring Jim Carrey, and I also remember being disturbed to hear that it would be directed by Ron `Opie' Howard. I had hoping for an artistic genius such as Tim Burton or a holiday entertainment luminary like John Hughes. Oddly, Opie pulled this one off.If you want to see a good, fun holiday movie, go see this one. I'm not going to start comparing it to the classic animated `Grinch,' but I think it did a noteworthy job of giving some back story on the Grinch's character and a little history on the town of Whoville.It also attempted to answer some age old questions- most notably, `Where is Whoville?' Well, the movie begins by showing, visually, that Whoville exists deep inside a tiny snowflake. The only problem with this is that the rest of the film goes on to prove that Whoville is actually located in northern Minnesota.I've noticed that Jim Carrey is a lot more fun to watch when he talks like Jimmy Stweart on crack. Honestly, I don't think anyone else could have pulled off such a classic character. Carrey's Grinch could be the standard by which we measure all other bastardized Hollywood versions of cherished childhood memories.`The Grinch' is packed with Ron Howard's `in-jokes' and double entendres aimed at disillusioned Gen-Xers. Seuss purists may find this distasteful, but honestly, why spend millions of dollars on a big-budget remake if you're just going to rehash the same material?Cindy Lou who had gigantic teeth and gigantic hair. She also sang a nice little tune. Let's move on.The film's talent award goes to the dog. If anyone truly lived up to the persona given them in the original Seuss drawings, it was Max. Some may argue that Carrey's performance was more admirable. To those people, I say, `but the dog was cute and had an antler on his head for a good portion of the movie. Did Jim Carrey even attempt this feat? I think not.'Let's look at `The Grinch' by the numbers. The props department provided 1,938 candy canes, 152,000 pounds of crushed marble (used for fake snow), 8,200 christmas tree ornaments, and no less than two million linear feet of styrofoam to build the city of Whoville itself. Opie got the studio to go all out financially, and it shows. The sets look like you'd expect Whoville to look. Great stuff.`The Grinch' gets a `B+.' It won't by any means replace its predecessor as a holiday classic, but you'll leave the theater feeling like a six-year old.</fullReview>

If you haven't seen this one yet, see it as soon as possible. Carrey's performance as the Grinch is not to be missed, and the entire film itself was a hoot.

		<shortDescription>The Grinch does not steal your money!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> Every Holiday season studios rush to release their film, which they think, will become a Christmas classic. This year, Universal Pictures in association with Imagine Entertainment release ?The Grinch', a comic fantasy starring Jim Carrey. Does this movie fall into the aforementioned category? No. This delightful holiday film is destined to become a classic due to its' over the top look and zany performance by Carrey himself.  Carrey plays the titular character who lives just above the town of Whoville, one Christmas after an unsettling experience provided by the townspeople, he decides to steal all the good holiday cheer and steal Christmas. But his plans become thwarted by a sweet little girl from that town, and the rest is pretty much history. Credit definitely goes to Howard and his team who put together a simply stunning looking film, which is also incredibly enjoyable. It seems as if they stole the Disney formula for a successful family film. Hire a lead that both parents and kids can relate to, sprinkle a bit of comedy and a touch of comprehensible story and voila ? a decent film. But in this case, the end result is as magical as the book itself. Forgive me if I am into the Christmas spirit, but anyone who does not enjoy this film must definitely be a Grinch. The perceptive filmgoers will ask themselves one question, how do you turn a 15-page book into a feature film? Well, this is where Ron Howard excels. He uses the book as simply the third act in the film. The first act of the film recounts the legend of the Grinch and his childhood. The second act revolves around his acceptance in the town after a long absence, which ultimately backfires and causes to get even with the town. Resulting in him stealing Christmas. Howard puts forward enough eye candy to satisfy even the youngest viewer, yet supplies enough wit through Carrey's character to satisfy even the most meticulous adult. Jim Carrey's portrayal of the Grinch is simply astonishing. By the end of the film a smart moviegoer will want more. He brings to the movie his regular sense of physical comedy that works incredibly, but this character allows him to expand his speech patterns and body language to a level we the viewers have never seen before. Simply put, he is a real treat to watch. And the film is a definite treat. The reason why this movie works so well is because through the first act, you can see why The Grinch has a grudge against the people of Whoville. His perspective is explicitly stated, although it was conjured by writers of today and relates in no way to the original book. It is interesting to see the take on why he is such a mean one. And from there on, the movie is simply a delight. Furthermore, another reason why it is fun to watch is because it is not scared to make fun of itself in the process. And when it goes over the top, as one can see through the Grinch's drive on a car two times smaller than he, it goes way over the top. Leaving the audience to one resort - laughter. While many were skeptics about Carrey's portrayal and the direction of the film under Howard, all doubts can be put aside upon completion of the film. It is a pure, wonderful, fantastical journey that we have never seen before, and it is exceptionally well done. A true winner that will definitely become a Holiday classic. Giancarlo's Rating: *** (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit mean spirited for my tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a child I never understood why the name Grinch, and I'm equally stumped as to why the name Scrooge, has always been used to describe someone not in the Christmas spirit. It seems to me that if you call someone 'Grinch' it should be a compliment, not a detriment. When I grew up, and perhaps you can translate that into when I lost innocence, I realized the irony of the definition of the name Grinch. This character is supposed to be the isolated and lonely. It's supposed to be all of us from time to time. But the reality is that he does not represent the few, he represents us all. Why do we continue to use the name Grinch to describe someone not in the Christmas spirit when the lesson of the story is that the Grinch kept Christmas in his heart? The same goes for Scrooge who kept Christmas with him for the rest of his life. The reason is that because these two characters represent us all. Aren't we all these characters for eleven months of the year and only when we hit December do most of us dust off our liberality's in the name of righteousness? We forget that the Grinch became a being that loved Christmas, but only for the last few minutes of the story, or in our lives, December.So for me this film does not work. It is not set to the same time as is the Dr. Suess classic. It tries to give the Grinch a reason for his isolation and his loneliness and that doesn't need to be done. The point of Suess's story was that the Grinch was upset. He was angry and he was lonely and in the end he was redeemed. Period. This film tries to show us that he is worth redeeming because some children made fun of him. Isn't Christmas a time when anyone can be redeemed? Why tell me why someone is worthy of redemption. If the Grinch wasn't picked on as a child should he have been shunned by the Who's? If the spirit of Christmas, and indeed the Dr. Suess book, is so magical, why give me a back story? Even though Dickens does give us a back drop for Scrooge to hang his isolation on, we know from the beginning that everyone, regardless of Scrooge's story, wants Ebenezer to be part of their Christmas. Here we are given a reason why we should include the Grinch, and that goes against the point of the season. It once seemed to me that we needed to hold on to the magic of Christmas the whole year through. Now I would be excited if we could hold on to it if only for one night in December.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice movie, shame about the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie "How the Grinch stole Christmas" is a very nice movie for children. It has a suitably festive Christmas feeling, and the character of the Grinch is very funny. This is definitely one of Jim Carrey's best roles.The plot begins very pleasing indeed - we learn that there is this Grinch who hates Christmas, and hilarity ensues when he is invited to celebrate Christmas with the Whos. But when the Grinch's past is explained, the whole plot breaks down and flattens. I mean, a romance story? That's so clichd it's terrible. What's more, it totally demolishes the character potential in the Grinch and makes him just another Who, who just happens to be green instead of pink.The way I would have written the ending would be that the Grinch is actually of a species naturally hostile to Whos, one which preys on them, for example. Since this species prefers solitude, the Grinch settled away from others, but the Whos just happened to build their village next to him.If you don't mind the story, go see this film. It's worth it for Jim Carrey's acting alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An enormously disappointing adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a big part of my childhood here--my all-time favorite children's book (narrowly beating out ("The Monster at the End of this Book"). My parents tell me that repeated bedtime readings caused me to have this book memorized by the time I was four. Suffice to say, I was apprehensive when I first heard about this project. But, I told myself to keep an open mind. After all, this movie could never compare to the understated genius of the Dr. Seuss book or the Chuck Jones cartoon--those works were untouchable. Therefore, to be fair to the filmmakers involved, this latest adaptation needed to be judged on its own merit.Of course, that would be much easier to do if the movie didn't steal so much from the cartoon. Using the musical numbers "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" and "Welcome Christmas", and even ripping off a couple of the sight gags, it's more appropriate to say that this is an adaptation of the cartoon than it is the book. That really bothered me, especially after I made a conscious effort to leave my adult cynicism at the door, putting myself in a child's mindset, and hoping to enjoy the movie as such. The movie incorporates a number of post-modern "in-jokes" that make fun of pop-culture and current events. An effort to entertain the parental units in the theatre, these jokes ripped me back into adult cynicism and forced me to think about the desensitizing effect of violence in the media and how ridiculous it is when a movie star runs in slow motion to escape an exploding fireball. Well, fine. So be it. If the filmmakers wanted to appeal to adults, than as an adult, I say this is an overblown spectacle whose message is undercut by the shameless merchandising and licensing that accompanies this film. Save yourself eight bucks and go read the book with a child. You'll probably get a lot more fulfillment out of that, anyway.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Grinch gets a very funny movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember during the early summer, I would start seeing a lot of commerical trailers for a new Christmas-related movie. It was a big-screen adaption of a classic children's story (and an equally classic cartoon by Chuck Jones) modeled after...who else, but the Grinch! With Jim Carrey as the title character, I knew I had to see this one. He, and director Ron Howard, I could tell, where going to bring it to life! So, along came November, 2000. I was there to see this movie on its opening night (I often like to) and this turned out to be a very funny movie. It contained a true-to-the-book style story, and I, at some point, forgot this was Jim Carrey playing the Grinch. He just belonged in this movie. The supporting cast is fun to watch, and Cindy-Lou Who gets more screen time than she did in the book and cartoon. But don't worry, the Grinch is still the leading character. Dr. Seuss would more than likely be satisfied. It was easy to see why this movie became the highest grossing movie of 2000. If another Dr. Seuss book was made into a movie, which one do you think they would they do next, maybe a live-action "Cat in the Hat"? GROSS-OUT ALERT!!!: If you enjoyed your lunch, you should turn away for this one scene. In the remix of, "You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch", remember the lyrics, "you've got termites in your smile"? Well, then, Mr. Grinch decides to show us they're not kidding...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A FUN, GREAT TO LOOK AT FILM WITH A CHRISTMAS SPIRIT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I personally thought that 'The Grinch' was fantastic. I loved the clever choice of characters and I especially love the Grinch's dog, Max. Okay, the jokes are pretty lame and Jim Carrey doesn't give the best performance yet, but It is still a great film that a selection of people will enjoy The whole design concept of this movie is amazing. The make up, set design... everything was outstanding and was visually stunning. I appreciated this film because it shows us how the Christmas spirit can make us all feel happy- even if we don't particularly like Christmas. Quite a few people have commented on how 'crap' and how 'boring' this movie was. For those people, just think a little bit. If you look at the effort that has gone into the film, you have to like something about it! No body can actually say that the fine detail put into 'Whoville' and the clever designs weren't satisfying. One negative comment. I thought maybe that it could have been slightly more humorous (but it still was funny in parts)but I cannot complain because it is obvious the film was aimed at children.Overall, **** out of *****If you haven't seen it- its worth checking out... OH!, and narration by Anthony Hopkins was also a bonus.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an ugly movie that exploits just about everything associated with Christmas. Plus, it's disjointed, even for a bad film...kind of like the family heirloom Aunt Bertha pasted from old jigsaw puzzles while waiting for the Grim Reaper. Everywhere are stuck bits and pieces of assorted plots with no relevance to each other or to a larger whole. There's something to offend everyone in "Grinch", but then, it IS a Jim Carrey movie, so that's part of the point. I wandered how he would fit his trademark anal humor into a Dr. Suess classic, and sure enough, he found a way! That, combined with a Who wife-swapping party and a gremlin grinch child film extender, nominates this turkey as the all time worst holiday movie.The saving grace of "Grinch" is that wonderful Song to Warm Your Heart, warbled by Cindy Lou Who. This little ditty was so shockingly bad, the audience reaction brought my dozing partner to snorting wakefulness. Imagine someone with Margaret O'Brian's acting talent singing manipulative lyrics to awful music while gazing at the moon through an upturned rat's nose. Not since the polar bear wandered in the backdrop of the 1972 "Lost Horizon" has a film been so unintentionally hilarious. Forget forking over money for Ron Howard. Go for this moment alone."How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a film that brings the whole family together. Each person- mother, father, teen and tiny babe, are united in one thought...What Was That!? Toss this treasure in the free box at the next family garage sale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that I initially felt ambiguous about. On one side, there were some pretty interesting visuals. On another, the characters were terrifyingly ugly and Carrey, as the Grinch, was annoying. The movie itself isn't terrible, I suppose, but it's pretty bad. The best reason I can imagine for this is the fact that Howard attempted to stretch a rather short story into the cast of a two-hour film. He didn't succeed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story and the acting were nothing amazing, just about as good as the previews made them look. I'm not a huge Jim Carrey fan, at least not in this type of movie (as opposed to the Truman Show or Man on the Moon). However, the set, the makeup, and the costumes were really excellent, and made the movie worth seeing. I hope that it gets an award for some aspect of design, because that was really its saving grace. I thought the message at the end was kind of interesting: it was a little bit of preachy anti-consumerism, interesting considering the money this movie made not just in ticket sales but various Grinch paraphanalia.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS / (2000) ** (out of four)If you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional Dr. Seuss classic fable, don't see "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas." If you are old enough to read this review, then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture. It contains lots of colors, creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction, joyous load noises, and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village Whoville. Unfortunately that is where the movie's positive elements end; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for Jim Carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin, all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do.Many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole Christmas from Whoville, so I will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read. However, I will say that the movie's story is executed in three major acts; the development of the grinch and setting, the Whoville festival, and the Dr. Seuss vision of the mean one robbing the Who's from their Christmas. There are many familiar names within the credits here, but no familiar faces. Like in "Battlefield Earth," I just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes. Regardless, there is SNL's Molly Shannon as Betty Lou, the wife of Bill Irwin, the later playing Lou Lou, the father of little Cindy Lou, played by Taylor Momsen. Jeffrey Tambor is the Whoville mayor, Anthony Hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film's narrator, and Christine Baranski is the Grinch's lone lost lover.The filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little Cindy Lou. The screenplay by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape; there is little if any focus by director Ron Howard and the screenplay is predictable, too extensive, and contrived. The only character given any distinctions here is the Grinch himself, all of the other characters are puppets of the plot, shapeless and uninteresting. And the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic. Example-Grinch: Oh, the Who-manity!The movie's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer Michael Corenblith, the costume designer Rita Ryack, and the ample makeup department. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a very good-looking production. The sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream. The people of Whoville are plastered with makeup, to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines. Although dazzling, I really can't give credit to the performances, for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place.Jim Carrey is one actor who I can talk about. His performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself He is way too egotistic as the Grinch, too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of Seuss. Surprisingly, although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences, no laughs come from Jim Carry's zany silliness. It is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for Carry to overplay his part. This factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original Christmas classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas."After this movie, historians should check the coffin of the late author, Dr. Seuss may have rolled over in his grave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of Carrey's since his early stand-up days at the Improv and Comedy Store and am delighted by his success. There seems to be nothing this guy can't do. The Grinch is no different. This is a fun-filled eye-treat that will leave you in a good mood after seeing. The expansion of the Grinch's story is good,especially(not to give too much away)his earlier years. I'll admit I almost walked out early on in the film when Cindy Lou Who broke into song,but that was the only real maudlin moment. Ninety percent of this movie is Jim Carrey and he makes the most of it. I could have done without some of the adult humor that Ron Howard and the writers seemed compelled to inject,such as the Who-Ville party in the flashback involving keys or the Grinch's use of his dog with a sleeping mayor. But that aside,it was a fun Christmas movie. It may not make you forget the original cartoon,but it's worth a look or two. And Jim rules!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The costumes and make-up were grand, there were some exceptionally funny lines, and the role was made for Jim Carrey. Carrey did as good a job as could be done given the rather disappointing script writing. Sure this was mostly a movie for kids, but if you are going to spend this much money making a movie you really ought to at least give the story enough body to go beyond that of Dr Seuss. I expected more from Ron Howard. It's worth a see, but it lacks the necessary qualities to become a major classic, by any measure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps I liked this movie more than most because I've never particularly cared for Suess. It wasn't so much his verse that I had a problem with, but those headache-inducing illustrations that everyone seems to hail as groundbreaking. Even when I was the target age for these books, those images didn't inspire my imagination, they scared the hell out of me. Hmmm... perhaps that's a form of inspiration, but not a very fun one for a small child.I never cared for the cartoon Grinch, either -- and why would I, when I didn't care for Suess? The movie, however, struck me in a certain way, a way that I can't say for certain I loved the movie, but I did find it mildly enjoyable. The sets and the costumes had just the right touch of outlandishness, picking up on the Suess vibe but without the nauseating effects found within the books. Some things could have used improvement or outright deletion. When Cindy Lou Who decided to sing, off-key, about Christmas, I took the opportunity to hit the snack bar. We really could have done without that scene, Mr. Howard.It seemed like there should have been more to the rivalry between Baranski's character and Shannon's character. The scene with the lighting machine gun was cute, but that's where the subplot ended. It would appear as if whatever else there was to this story was sliced from the film, save for this scene, because the director needed a mechanism to introduce a character that was a key to the conflict between the MayWho and the Grinch.The movie attempts to lead the audience with timing gaps for when, it seems, we were supposed to laugh. It didn't work. There were quite a few laughs, but none for those uncomfortable pauses.Despite all this, I managed to enjoy the film. It seems that everyone else who attended enjoyed this film, too. There were no bloody carcasses in the aisles, nor were there any weeping widows or orphans on hand to sob at reporters about what a tradgedy the whole affair was, the world did not end, civilization did not fall, and the price of milk did not go up -- things that, judging by the dramatic comments of my fellow IMDB-ers, can be blamed directly on this movie when it plays in other parts of this world.I have a feeling that this film is destined to become a holiday classic and tradition. If the idea shocks, disgusts, and horrifies some of the people who have become a little too emotional over an adaptation of a children's story, then I can't think of anything I would like more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Meaning, Well-Made Movie Misses Mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ironic that Dr. Seuss' fable emphasizing the non-commercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped, marketed, and successful blockbusters of the holiday season. The general gist of Ron Howard's adaptation is that the Grinch's bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Cindy Lou Who (played very well by Taylor Momsen). This movie makes an ardent, ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Seuss' story, but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Chuck Jones' animated version. Jim Carrey is noteworthy in his performance as the devilish Grinch, but whether it's the dialogue, the pacing, or extraneous storylines heaped upon the initial plot, the transformation from bitter miser to gleeful benefactor just does not ignite convincingly. There are some wonderful visuals and the make-up work is amazing, yet beyond the technical triumphs there's an element or two here that's missing.Succinctness?Soul?Or maybe Jones did the initial adaptation all too well in his 25-minute cartoon that Howard falls short of in a movie that feels three hours long. Howard, Carey, and crew are all very capable and talented, but what would seem a winning combination is just weak and plodding in its final product. If you must see the feature-length version, rent it on video with Jones' animated version and you can see how bigger and glitzier is not always better. I give this film three cans of Who-Hash out of five.</fullReview>

Ron Howard certainly has come a long way from his role as the shrimp Winthrop in "The Music Man". I was glad they didn't just make this a remake of the TV show. for instance, we actually find out WHY the grinch hates Christmas, and we have a couple of "whovillians" who are sort of bad guys themselves. good, entertaining movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know I've lost a little childhood innocence over the years, and God knows how jaded I've become about my views regarding the lackluster, weak and poorly conceived material upon which so many big-studio productions are based. So it's no wonder that "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," as visually stunning and technically complex as it was, didn't quite knock my socks off. As usual, Jim Carrey was his over-the-top self, and I admit the film's premise and lead/title character pretty much beg for a zealous actor like Carrey. Nevertheless, the film wasn't whimsical or enchanting enough to suck me in, probably because in-between the Grinch's ranting and raving, my heartstrings couldn't penetrate the incredible makeup, costumes and set designs long enough to latch onto anything very real or genuine. In other words, the visual intensities almost worked against the film at times, obscuring reality and creating distractions that were just too effective. Of course, for the small fry and others seeking a purely visceral, sensorial experience, the film certainly succeeds. And I have to admit I fell in love at first sight with the adorable Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who.So, as always, we take the good with the questionable, and we'd give anything to ask the venerable Dr. Seuss himself for his considered opinion.</fullReview>

It was just missing something of the magic that the simple illustrations and wonderful poetry of Dr. Seuss brought out. Jim Carey is a master of physical control and exhibits it in this movie. Perhaps I'm too judgemental just because it's based off Dr. Suess, but I just think there's something missing from the overall effect of the movie, and I can't put my finger on it. I'd recommend this movie for a one time Christmas watch, but not much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a 1966 classic, but why did they have to remake it? Well, I'll tell you what. It was a bad idea. A disastrous idea, if you will...The Grinch is pretty much plotless. A little girl, Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), wonders whether the evil Grinch (Jim Carrey) really is all that dastardly and tries to befriend him. The Grinch isn't having any of it and attempts to ruin the Christmas celebrations until, lo and behold, he, and the feckless Whos, discover the much-vaunted ?true meaning' of Christmas.Some lovely costumes and nice set pieces can't save this film. The acting is corny, Jim Carrey is effortless in his attempt to be The Grinch, while Taylor Momsen is unbearable as the dumb-ass little cheesy kid, Cindy Lou Who. On the subject of the Who's...could you get any more annoying, by any chance? Their big noses and wide smiles used to be classical, now they are please-kill-me irritating. Ron Howard's direction is the only thing that is average, and perhaps Anthony Hopkins narration can be credited too.Someone once called this remake memorable. Well, the only thing that is memorable about it is how bad it is.I rate The Grinch 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this day and age, you really can't help being prejudiced towards holiday films like this one. I went into it very skeptical, thinking it was going to lean a little too much towards the kiddie, cheesy antics that one can easily find from a film such as JINGLE ALL THE WAY. But being the persistent Jim Carrey fan that I am, I ignored my insight and bought a ticket to THE GRINCH.Thanks to good ol' Richie Cunningham, I was totally amazed at how great the film was. It did a good job of blending dark humor, much like that of Tim Burton, with old fashioned holiday cheer. The dark humor, although very brutal at times, had me aching with laughter throughout the entirety of the film. The surrealness of the world created in the film, along with the various memorable characters, places it among the ranks of other classics such as THE WIZARD OF OZ, WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, and THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. And as for the comic maestro Jim Carrey, his performance sort of resembles that of another green mischief-maker in THE MASK. I'm sure the basis for every critic's approach to this film was to compare it to the original. Bad move. It is an unfair judgement to compare this film to the original especially because it transcends it in so many ways. This film is perfect for all ages and all kinds of people. So ignore the misguided reviews, buy a ticket, and slip into madness with THE GRINCH.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The previous reviews excoriating this movie are exactly right. But it's more than just a disappointment--it maligns what the cartoon and the book were all about. This movie isn't really even about Christmas--maybe politically correct Hollywood can't bring itself to make a real Christmas anymore. For those who really liked the cartoon growing up--personally I never missed it--this movie gives mental images to the Grinch that you don't want. The Grinch was always mean, but in a sonorous dignified way, how else could he be with Boris Karloff as his voice? Carrey turns him into a total buffoon, who's not even the least bit scary, just pathetic. Adding on the absurd childhood trauma episode to attempt explain the development of the Grinch's meanness wasn't even laughable, just a diminishing of the character. The Whos are entirely different in character, losing all the charm of the originals. I get the sense that Carrey's wild overacting, even for him, was as a result of all the makeup they layered over him, he wanted you to know he was in there. Too bad. The sole redeeming virtue was the dog who played max--he had the only scenes worth watching. Avoid this turkey at all costs, so you can enjoy your Who Beast without an upset stomach.</fullReview>

The gumby-bendy toy was disguised under a green suit, but the insufferable quips and 'ad-libs' make his identity pretty clear. Which is a shame. His 'bigness' and cartoon-inspired personality made him a natural for this, but as usual he sinks into cheap shots. The cultural references that took me out of the Suessian world were what bothered me most. I came to see the Grinch, not Jim Carrey as, well, a bad imitation of Jim Carrey.The cinematography was a mess too. The film had a chance to be visually stunning, but went for visual overload instead. Completely artless. I would have loved to see what someone with a real sense of style (ie. Tim Burton) could have done.While I'm recasting, Anthony Hopkins as the Narrator was a huge mistake. His voice is dull and uninspired. There is only one voice I can think of that could have replaced Karloff's (mainly because its totally different) and that is James Earl Jones.Sigh.</fullReview>

He is gross and disgusting at times (minus two). He came back to his Pet detective type movies (minus one). The movie becomes tedious at times. Nothing like Liar Liar. (minus one). Overall this is a forgettable movie. They could have done more if they had chosen another actor for the Grinch, like Robert De Niro. I guess it's okay if you see it with your children. Bit first try to see the 6th day or the unbreakable. Those are better choices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well, what can I say......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming from England, I didn't really know what The Grinch was. I've seen the cartoon on at Christmas (and of course it's small cameo in Home Alone), but I have never read the book. I must say, it was a nice film to watch. Enjoyable, and funny it made me actually feel good after I'd seen it. When I saw The Grinch, at the London Premiere, I congratulated Ron Howard on a very well made film. He asked me "Was it too corny?" Thinking about it.....yes it is, but isn't it supposed to be?I agree that many of Carrey's previous characters are portrayed within The Grinch, The Mask, Andy Kaufman etc, but is that a bad thing? We all loved those characters didn't we? So why shouldn't Jim put them into this role. Everyone in London seemed to enjoy it. I understand that Americans have a different view on the film, due to the books of Dr Suess. You know whether it stays true to the original story or not. We, in England, however, just see it as another Jim Carrey film and expect nothing else.The one thing that we all must agree on is that The Grinch is a much superior film to Me Myself and Irene!! This is a real feel good film and should be seen by everyone over the Christmas season!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny movie, worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so maybe I'm easily amused, but I enjoyed this treatment of a holiday classic. I liked the balance of the dark atmosphere against the holiday season, and the satire on the overcommercialization of Xmas is excellent, although it loses steam later on. Jim Carrie comes through about as expected, although I did find one scene tasteless and gratuitous. I wouldn't recommend this movie for extremely young viewers, however. In many ways, this movie is more the way I would expect Tim Burton to handle it, rather than Ron Howard. Still a movie well worth seeing. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i am a jim carrey fan. lets get that out of the way first. why you might ask? there are a few 'actors' in hollywood that have been spawned by comedy, some of which have found success (adam sandler, mike myers, bill murrey, eddie murphy etc) and there are those who have not (the cast of saturday night at the roxby for instance). but there are few that can turn their talents to other projects and develop there range of work.jim carrey is, in my opinion, an illusionist/impressionist and at the very top of his class. he gets $20m a picture for a reason. a performers popularity is sustained by his ability to evolve and to adapt to new audiences expectations. carrey has done just that. no longer a one toned actor, has he has proved with the truman show and man on the moon that his ability to act is as strong as his ability to contort &amp; jest. explanation over.so the grinch is another carrey signature role. many have said that carrey was born to play a role, be that kaufman, riddler etc, but here we have another example.i am english so i'm not up on dr.zeuss and all the lingo that goes with it...theres a cat and hat and some thingies and a erm...yeah. but i took the time to find out. i get that its as good as a fairy tale. a fable, a childrens story. thats what ron howard has done. created a breathing fairy tale. with an edge.the cast are sidelined for carreys performance. an all out assault for any filmgoer, be you fan or critic, carrey spits the grinchs curses with gleeful abandon throwing restraint to the wind.is the grinch a good movie though? it is what it is, a fairytale. a bedtime story. magical and amazing in places. i watched the film in november, and as i left the cinema i wanted it to be christmas. i wanted everyone around me to burst into song...well maybe not. but you get the picture.the grinch is a christmas movie and as such should be treated as one. it does what it sets out to do tella story. make you laugh and teach us a moral lesson. oh and also that the bad guy is'nt always to blame.go see it, feel festive and don't eat broken glass.(if you've seen it you'll know)7/10regards and yuletide cheer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much Jim</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I found this movie very entertaining and well done, I couldn't help but realize during the entire thing that I was watching Jim Carey dressed up in a green suit. Before I attack the character of The Grinch, let me state that I thought many things about this movie were very good. The sets and lighting were wonderful, the little girl who played Cindy Lou was not annoying like most little kids are, and I thought that the story really moved along. All of the things that were added to make this 1/2 hour TV special into a movie worked very well.Now, on to The Grinch. This character seemed to be a culmination of every other character that Jim Carrey has ever played. I saw pieces of Ace Ventura, The Riddler, The Mask, Andy Kaufman, etc. This made it hard to determine what the Grinch was really trying to be. Was he mean, nice, a comedian...what? I think that if Jim Carrey had been a little less Jim Carrey than this movie would have been much better. An understated Grinch would have had more impact than the overstated bumbling idiot that Carrey portrayed. I'm not the world's biggest Jim Carrey fan to begin with, but by the end of this movie I was even less of a fan. Three words: Tone it down.I'd recommend seeing this movie, because it is interesting, and 'You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch' is a great song. But expect to see more Jim Carrey than you can stomach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Can they Destroy Seuss?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, which was painful to view especially with my 7 year old present, totally destroyed the spirit of Dr. Seuss. In his book the Grinch was a Grumpy old person who just wanted in the end that the people like him. In this dark comedy we get a vicious beast that tries to kill a little girl without a thought. The same beast is sought after by a sex craved woman.The director tried to rip off the Munchkin Land (a la Wizard of Oz) look of the town and does a real poor job of it. There is a lot of camp in this movie which is really poor quality (maybe the director should have watched some old Batman on TV to find out how to get it right).If you are taking the kids I suggest Rugrats in Paris which is a thoroughly entertaining film for both children and adults. It is also one that you can feel safe taking the smaller kids to unlike this muddled affair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was completely surprised by this film. Being the huge holiday cartoon fan and not a fan of Jim Carrey, I could not possibly see them pulling this one off. I found myself just laughing hysterically through most of the movie. When I wasn't laughing, I was smiling. I think most people that have bad things to say about this movie are basing it on the original cartoon. They had to put in some extra "stuff" to make it longer and more entertaining...and it did just that.They could have found no one more perfect for the Grinch then Jim Carrey. I think that the critics need to lighten up and have a good laugh. This movie is full of holiday spirit and definitely made me find the happiness in the Christmas Season.</fullReview>

And the rest of the cast was wonderful, Christine Baranski was fantastic.The scenery was amazing And the concept is good. But I was very board and thought the trailer's before the film were more entertaining. This is more than likely as a result from the dialogue. But if your looking for a movie to take the kids to this is it, though I suggest renting the cartoon - it's much more entertaining. I found this movie to be nothing more than eye candy. If only they had spent as much time on the script as they did on the background scenery the film and the people watching it would have benefitted greatly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am, to say the least, not one of Jim Carey's fans, but he does a fine job as the Grinch in this film.I realize that extras had to added to this film in order to make it long enough to qualify as a feature film, and for the most part, the additions are fine.I am a professional musician, and what offends me most about this film is the stupid, sappy song that was inserted into things for no reason, apparently, other than to have a soundtrack to sell. The song is sung by Cindy Lou Who, and it is as awful a song as has ever been written, not just because the child playing the waif has a bad singing voice, but because it is one of those plastic sappy songs that the public seems to buy in bag-loads these days. Thank God that the Grinch Song (You're a mean one...Mister Grinch, etc.) from the original Chuck Jones film from the 60s was included, or I would have felt nothing but animosity towards this film.OK...that aside, I think this film does a fine job with the story. A lot of the plotting as to how the Grinch got like he is, is predictable, but I can live with that quite easily. Everything comes out fine in the end as it should, and we're left with a swell grin on our faces. What more do you want from a shadow play?So...go see it. If disgusting music doesn't offend you, you'll love it, and if it does, well...it's really a minor problem. Like the summary line says, it's worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grinch's Cruel Edge Taints Film's Laughter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was totally excited about seeing this movie! Jim Carrey as the Grinch -- Oh, what excellent casting, I thought! My mouth was watering.Sadly enough -- Well... Maybe, I was too anxious and my hopes were too high. Yeah, the Grinch returns the Christmas presents by the end of the movie, but the movie didn't deliver the goods.I remember the part from the 1966 original so well -- the Grinch slapping antlers on his lil' puppy, and demanding him to pull the sleigh. I couldn't wait for that part. I knew that scene would leave me busting a stitch. But that highlight was also humdrum.But I have to admit, though Jim Carrey's facial expressions were unbelievable, I felt the puppy was the star of the show!I wanted so badly to love and caress this movie. I wanted to laugh aloud -- But I couldn't. I remember when Jurassic Park first hit the big screen. Everyone took there kids to see a pleasant Disney-like movie about dinosaurs. But instead, got a movie that was so realistic and terrifying that kids were clinging to their parents. Yes, Jurassic Park was phenomenal. But the Grinch isn't.Why? Because you expect a T-Rex to be deadly. And so be it. Throughout Jurassic Park, the T-Rex was a dangerous animal from start to finish. The Grinch, however, was too much of a psychopath. You're left wondering whether you can trust the Grinch even as the movie ends.Jim Carrey was awesome. The back-drop was incredible. Even down to every detail having squiggly-shapes, with nothing having right-angles. Even the ladder in the mailroom was crooked. A lot of attention was focused on the set, but the Grinch's script was too dark and too unsettling of a character.It was like a Disney set that was exploited by Tim Burton. Rating: 6 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey makes a good Grinch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's treatment of the classic Dr. Seuss cartoon deserves both applause and a shame-on-you. Technically, the movie is without flaw (as far as I could tell). The story, however, suffers from two decidedly un-Seuss-like scenes which both involve the Grinch doing something VERY bizarre: in one scene, the Grinch gives the mayor a doggie-style moon pie kiss; in another, he gives Cindy Who a drink of water whilst standing behind a tree (the sound of a liquid falling into a glass is heard, and Cindy gives the contents a dubious look as she goes to bed). The voice of the Grinch audibly changes during the course of the movie -- a sign that dubbing was involved. But, this detracts only a little from the movie.Hardcore Seuss fans (and I am one) quickly noted the differences between the original cartoon and the movie. True, the material with which Mr Howard had to work was sparse; it was disturbing, however, to see the Grinch stumble through a hairy childhood and become a reclusive miscreant after shaving his face badly.With the exception of the mousy makeup on most of the Whoville characters, the Whos were represented fairly well. The hair styles were delightfully obscene, and the non-euclidian geometry of the buildings and streets was pure Seuss.I feel that the movie was not worth the price at the ticketbox and should, instead, be viewed when the DVD hits the rental stores.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I very much wanted to like this film. It was OK, but I can only give it half marks.The visuals were great, and the costumes and general style are largely faithful to Seuss (albeit much richer).There were some genuinely funny moments. But the humor is very inane compared to vintage Seuss. The Seuss style of humor came through the twinkling of an eye - this movie delivers it intravenously.In typical Carey style, the movie is very fast paced and erratic. A gentler, more thoughtful, portrayal of The Grinch would have been welcome.I left this film with Christmas well and truly stolen!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Grinch in a near empty BAFTA screening with only a couple of kids in the audience. But the movie is not only for kids. The screenplay throws up a fair amount of jokes and set pieces aimed at adults.Jim Carrey is brilliant and truly has made character of The Grinch his own. He would steal the show, if it wasn't already his by default.His supporting cast do admirable jobs. Taylor Momsen is cute and sweet as Cindy Lou Who while Christine Baranski plays a variation of her Marianne character from Cybill as Martha May Whovier, the love of The Grinch's life.Rick Baker's make up is fantastic, Rita Ryack's costumes are extremely well made and hats off to Michael Corenblith for his production designs.The movie itself has a certain charm and will be loved by a large amount of people. Carrey plays to the audience in a similar style as he did in The Mask.And let's not forget that the movie carries a message - that Christmas is NOT all about gifts, but about being together.Can't wait for "Green Eggs and Ham" to hit the screens!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I come out of a movie, especially if it was hyped as much as this, and I can only say 'eh, it's okay' then it's really not okay.The film itself is visually rich. Everything is detailed quite nicely and the special effects are tremendous. Ron Howard is a director who's work I generally enjoy immensly. He tells a story well and usually gets the best out of his actors. Then comes this. The Grinch. I'll admit that I was looking forward to seeing it. I like Jim Carrey, most of his film except for Man on the Moon, but I'll save that for that review. The acting is good, You really can't recognize Carrey under the makeup. And he plays the part to a tee.But it's the storyline that bugs me. Why does Hollywood feel the need to center a movie around a kid? And then make them sing? Why add so much new story to a classic? I found myself almost dozing off right in the middle of the film. This movie would have been more enjoyable if all the children had been tied down and gagged. I like kids in real life, but not on screen. It's what I call 'Dan Ackroyd syndrome'. The formula doesn't always need a kid. The Pepsi girl isn't cute!! But I'm subjected to her before every film, just like these films do. maybe I'm just going off on a tangent because the film just didn't grab me. But if you see it for yourself, you'll see what I mean. I'm not saying it was bad, it's just not great. If I want to watch a christmas film, I'll watch the Christmas Story, at least the kids in that are real. They have defined personalities. Go check the Grinch, but at the dollar theatre if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's tough to rate a movie that tells a story we all know by heart. Knowing the story takes away from the surprise factor. The question is no longer "what will happen?", it is "how will it be depicted?"In this big screen version of the cartoon many of us grew up on, there is an effort to provide some back story as to why the Grinch is a Grinch. But the effort is feeble, and hardly explains why this creature would remove himself from contact with others (aside from his dog) for years. Get mad, yes. Ostracize himself from "whoo-manity," no, at least not without assuming some serious mental problems.The 'Hoos (or Whose, whatever) are an odd bunch. Some are tiny, but most are the same size. They have odd little pig noses and big ears. But really, they seem like regular humans in make-up. Shallow, uninteresting humans, but still human. This takes away from the sense that what we are watching is a fantasy world different from our own lives. There is an opening scene that brings us to the Hoo world (and out again at the end), and for all its effort to symbolize a journey to a magical land, it really seems like so much fluff and a half-hearted attempt to get us to buy into what we are supposed to believe.Jim Carrey is, well, Jim Carrey. I have a hard time picturing anyone else who could have been the Grinch. Carrey adds some heart to an essentially heartless figure, and some of his trademarked manic humor. I wish he had been allowed to use *more* of that, to make the Grinch seem a little mentally unbalanced instead of simply lonely and grumpy.The rest of the cast is essentially lost, with the exception of the little girl who plays the Hoo who believes in the Grinch. Her parents, the neighbor (inexplicably dressed in a cleavage bearing outfit, though she seems as asexual as could be), the mayor, and everyone else is interchangeable and unmemorable.I fear this Grinch movie will be one of those "holiday family films" that will show up each year on the networks (a la Home Alone). It probably deserves that fate. It is just interesting enough for kids to watch and not nearly good enough to be a must-see film (such as The Wizard of Oz). There was something missing here, but I can't bring myself to care enough to figure out what it is. We gave this a 6, mostly for Jim Carrey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey Sets High Standards That The Film Doesn't Meet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey gives a fantastic performance that I'm sure will earn him his third consecutive Golden Globe award. He is unstopable and it says a lot about his talent when you know he is the only one who can play the part.I was looking forward to the film so much, that after sitting in the theater for almost an hour, I forgot that this was a movie geared towards kids. The plot was very cheesy except for the flashback sequence that revealed why the Grinch is so, well, grinchy. And what was with the flavorless sub-plot that involved Cindy Lou's mother and the house lighting feud she had going on with Christine Baranski's character? What ever became of that?Any who, the movie was a little lame, but Carrey was flawless.10/10-for Carrey5/10-for the movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the Film Spoiled a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I heard that Jim Carrey was going to play the Grinch, my curiosity peaked. Unfortunately, curiosity killed the cat. Now if you want to say Jim did a good job, that is one thing. His energy and enthusiasm did not go unnoticed. But to talk about the film is a different story. First off I do not remember the Grinch being so hideously ugly, nor do I remember the Who's being as freakish looking either, but all of that is nothing compared to the idiocy of the plot. The words "Stupid," "tasteless", "unamusing" and just plain "gross" come to mind. Out of all the gags, I only laughed once. I was surprised at the normal "Jim Carrey" Adult humor that was placed into a Family film. Fifth graders will love it, most adults will be unamused and little kids might even be afraid of the Grinch's ghastly appearance. This movie takes an original classic story that shows the true meaning of Christmas and trashes it into a commercial and meaningless farce, that almost appears to be mocking the original idea. I don't want to give any examples of what I mean because I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it, but as far as I am concerned the whole thing spoils itself.</fullReview>

There were a lot of absolutely hilarious moments though worth catching. The scene with the little girl singing was fairly intolerable and then she started singing again later, but fortunately it was the end of the movie!!

Kudos to the make-up crew who creatively disguised all actors, and to the set decorators and costume designers. HOWEVER, I could not get past the mean spiritedness of the movie which was not found in the original Dr. Seuss book. I somehow feel that Dr. Seuss may have been rolling in his grave. The best character in the movie has to be the dog Max. Wait for the video release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For all you Grinches out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I went to see this one today, expecting either the greatly fun holiday movie that it was shown to be or the excruciating bomb that all the critics made it out to be. Throughout the first part of the movie, I sat there watching it in boredom and thinking that maybe the critics were right after all. Then, at one point about twenty minutes into it, I just got drawn in. From there, it was a great mechanical sleigh ride up to the very end. Jim Carrey just shone through all those layers of makeup and costume as the Grinch, as did the rest of the cast in those weird little noses of theirs. I know it's not much like the original book or cartoon, both of which are holiday favorites of mine, but I don't tend to judge by that if something is good in its own right. It won't win any Oscars or anything (except possibly for things like makeup and sets), but it was a fun holiday movie. I had a total blast watching it, and I would greatly recommend it for someone who is willing to see this good old dog of a story do some new tricks.</fullReview>

Grant it, this is not a best-picture film, but Jim Carrey's performance as the Grinch is top rate. And in order to make the half-hour animated story into a full-length motion picture, they had to add something.

		<shortDescription>It's not Dr. Seuss' Grinch, it's Jim Carrey's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess this movie is OK if you forget about the original and just go with the new one as if it were not a remake. My kids seemed to enjoy it but I just didn't. I tried to like the Grinch but it just didn't make any sense. ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** They try to explain why he hates Christmas but even before anything malicious or cruel happens to him, we see him as an infant, bumping another infant out of the way, Then, as a baby, devouring a Santa plate with relish, then again as a small child drawing terrible things happening to Santa (which would of course, ruin Christmas for everyone) while he chuckles with glee to himself. In the book and cartoon, the motivation for why he acted and behaved deviously was never introduced so we never questioned it. But since this movie introduces the motivation, at least they could be consistent in the answer. But all they succeed in doing is showing him acting like a Grinch before he even becomes "The Grinch". When his heart grows, the Grinch goes into ridiculous contorted fits of pain and anguish, having the effect of ruining what could and should have been the most touching part of the entire film. At the end, when the townspeople finally accept him, he is still mugging and leering and just being a nuisance. ***END SPOILERS*** In the cartoon and the book (I know, I'm comparing...and that's where this movie comes up short), we end up liking the Grinch and accepting him. There is no motivation in this movie for anything like that and when we see others show affection for him, e.g., Cindy and Martha, there really is no explanation as to why...it's just in the script I guess. Come to think of it, the only people in the movie that I cared for at all were Cindy and the dog Max. Aren't there any likable people in Whoville? They look scary and act kind of mean.The set design was great though, although I found all the make-up distracting and I actually think it would have been better without all the makeup, even for the Grinch character. Jim Carrey has proved that he can do facial contortions, and the audience has the ability to use their imaginations, I think all those layers of makeup were just too much. Give some credit to the audience, we have imaginations too and we would most likely fill in wherever the overdone special effects were lacking but there was no need to do so. No need for imagination at all...everything was done already, whether we liked it that way or not. It could have been a great film, and maybe it is for some people, but I'm not one for all the glitz. Some humanity for the Grinch, especially at the ending would have been nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey's Makeup the Real Star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING: These comments may reveal portions of the film plot.The big screen version of "The Grinch" works best when it sticks to the original story. While Ron Howard hasn't created a "great" film, it is still good, and most people will enjoy this diversion.STORY/SCRIPT: Howard had to build on the original 25 minute cartoon, so many things have been added to the original story you probably remember from your childhood. This isn't bad, since you learn much about what made the grinch, "the Grinch." But it also makes for a more sinister character -- one that eats glass, for example.SETS/SPECIAL EFFECTS: Wow!!! Whoville lives! You'll see the color combinations, the animated effects, all brought effectively to life. And everything is seamless enough that you'll probably find yourself forgetting it is special effects. This is one very effective part of the film.MUSIC/SOUNDTRACK: Great fun. Especially effective is when the movie breaks into the classic, "You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch..." You'll want to sing along. But all the music is fun. Could the little girl have been dubbed? Sure, but why? Little kids are cute, and that includes their very off key singing, and I think that is what Howard was going for here. I thought it was fun.MAKEUP/COSTUMES: Here is where the movie excels. Carrey BECOMES the Grich. Not just a live version, but the actual cartoon version. When he smiles, it goes from ear-to-ear, just as in the animated version. And it works both as a sinister smile and a friendly smile. And the residents of Whoville likewise are impressive. Everyone builds on the characters in the book, makes them look real, yet lets the actors skills come through.ACTING/DIRECTING: Carrey is the best here. I found myself thinking of the Grinch, not Jim Carrey as "The Grinch." He shines through all those layers of makeup. The poor part is that the Grinch is either really bad or really good, and in the film becomes downright sinister. Result: he doesn't have many levels to play, so he doesn't. It's a bit flat as a result. Likewise, the rest of Whoville. The characters there don't quite make it either.PARENTAL WARNING: Parents, remember that this film is a bit meaner than the cartoon. This includes the acting, the story, and the directing. The littlest kids may be bothered by some of this.OVERALL: This isn't a classic, but it's not as bad as many have said. As one who went to see it to remember the cartoon, I found I should have stuck to the cartoon. That's okay. You'll probably have fun, you just won't need to go back to the film over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't believe some of these comments! First of all, I didn't want to see it as all the critics had panned it. But I went...and I really loved it. Jim Carrey IS the Grinch! And, I should note, I am NOT a Jim Carrey fan. Yes, I thought some of the story dragged a bit, but they had to flesh out the plot to make a movie. And, if they'd made it 'dark and Tim Burtonish', it wouldn't have been what it was written for--a Children's Story. (People who have children, want to see a kids movie for kids, not adults--YOU sit up all night, with kids who have been given nightmares by Tim Burton's 'kids movies'....) Remember, Dr. Suess Widow had complete control over what would and wouldn't make the final cut, and she is the one who knew what her husband would have wanted. It wasn't until Jim Carrey met her and 'became the Grinch' that she allowed them the rights to the movie. I was charmed by the movie, and glad I decided to go with the family at the last minute. I think this will become a classic, and I'd better see Oscar nominations for make-up, costumes, set designs, and possibly Carrey for this movie.....He was the Grinch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Holiday Classic Comes to Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, I've seen the 1966 cartoon over 100 times most likely... and I must admit, the more I watch it, the more I wish the cartoon was longer. Well, this year I got my wish. I will admit, that it isn't the easiest thing turning a short story into a two hour long movie, but Ron Howard pulled it off. Yes, I do agree that Tim Burton should have been the one to direct the movie, but I still think that no one else but Jim Carrey could have pulled off the character of the Grinch.Carrey does lots of goofy things in this movie that you wouldn't have previously thought that the Grinch would do, but I think that if Carrey had made the character a little less goofy and a little more serious at the beginning of the movie, then maybe it would work. Because the Grinch's character is supposed to just be miserable and grumpy, then when he's stealing the christmas presents, he could act a little more goofy because he's "enjoying" what he's doing.Either way, it's not Carrey's fault. He does a flawless performance (as always) and can pull off an awesome grinchy smile. Tim Burton would have caused the film to be darker and aimed more towards the adults. This may have made the movie a little better (or worse, hey.. we can't prove Tim Burton could do it better) but that defeats the entire purpose of this film.It is not intended entirely for adults. Yes, it was written so that it interests the adults as well.. but it was created for the kiddos.The beautiful world that Ron Howard created works perfectly though. I loved Mt. Crumpet and Who-ville. Who-ville is a town where straight lines don't exist, everything has to curve and bend (just like Seuss had always inteded) and that must have been quite a challenge for any director. But he does pull it off nicely.The backstory on the Grinch (that explains why he hates Christmas) defeats the line in the poem "The Grinch hated Christmas, he hated the whole season. Please don't ask why, no one quite knows the reason." But alas, they do give him a childhood and a love interest. I don't quite agree with this aspect of the story, but it was interesting to watch and kept me entertained.The movie starts getting really good when it returns to the original story. The part of the movie where the Grinch prepares to steal Christmas. You'll note that Jim Carrey even sings the song "Your a mean one, Mr. Grinch" and does it really well. Nice job!Jim Carrey seemed to give the Grinch an unusual accent in this film, it's like a bad Sean Connery. I wasn't quite sure if it would work at first, but it does!The narration was down pretty well, but they did change up the original poem to work with the new story, so it's not exactly the same.All in all, this is a great holiday film. It's not Ron Howard's best film, it's not Jim Carrey's best film, but it's a darn, gee-golly gosh, fun movie and I suggest that you give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>REVIEW OF THE GRINCH: **1/2First off, Tim Burton should have directed this and Christopher Walken should have been the Grinch. Don't get me wrong, Jim Carrey was great, but the movie was too lighthearted. There could have been a darker, more adult fantasy movie buried underneath all of the slapstick humor, which Chris and Tim wouldn've pulled off perfectly. But alas, no. This is no more than a dumb children's movie that is too scary for kids and too childish for adults. Next, there is NO way to make a 2 HOUR MOVIE of a 19 page book! It's like turning Weekend Update into a 4 hour epic. So, for about an hour and a half, nothing happens except for Jim Carrey re-enacting The Mask. Then, by the time "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" starts playing, you wish that you had just gone to see Rugrats or The 6th Day. The make-up is great though. But if I was Ron Howard, I would've convinced Tim Burton to do this movie and have Christopher Walken to be the Grinch. Then, it would've been more darker, more ironic, and less dumb and more time would be spent on why Grinch became such a Grinch. Sorry that I'm raining on everyone's parade, BUT IT'S JUST MY FREAKIN' OPINION!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting update!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who honestly has not seen the original "Grinch" cartoon? The wonderful message, the fantastic imagery, and Boris Karloff's legendary narration made it a Christmas classic (when I sang the theme song for a high school Christmas choir concert, a couple of years ago, the audience instantly recognized and loved the song). So, when I heard that there was a live-action remake in the works. I though of only one word: "How?" That seemed to me at the time to be the most impossible story to remake in live-action. While other people were excited, I was incredibly skeptical. That is why I was so pleased with this new version. Basically, there are two reasons that this is a film to be seen. The first is obviously Jim Carrey. I have been a big fan of his work since his breakthrough in "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective". Even if the film that he is making is not very good, he manages to give 110% in that role. This role will most likely be listed as one of his best. To play a character that is as firmly rooted in children's minds as Mickey Mouse, Harry Potter, or The Wicked Witch Of The West is a tremendous honor for an actor, and Jim Carrey knows this. He plays each scene, each LINE like it is his last. He commits his face, his voice, and his body fully to this role. It does not take too long to forget that Jim Carrey is simply playing the Grinch. You believe that he IS the Grinch. That is only the second time that Jim Carrey has done that to me ("Man On the Moon" being the first). The other notable aspect of this film is the art direction, which is simply breathtaking. Since the town of Whoville is enclosed in a snowflake, the crew has taken great pains to show us a place that is not of this world. All of the noses are microscopic, the buildings are bent, and the cars are more suited for a circus than a city street. This film belongs on a list with other films such as "Star Wars", "Metropolis", and almost every Tim Burton film as a movie that created a incredibly good-looking world. This is the type of film that you could spend the entire time just looking at the corners of the screen and still be entertained. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" has a central message in it which states that "Christmas is not something that is bought in a store." Well, this film shows that a good movie is not something that is bought in a store. Most of the Hollywood that I have seen consists of filmmakers who either (1) wonder why their "artistic" film did not appeal to a wide audience, or (2) why their summer blockbuster was widely made fun of. Both types should study this film, which manages to be cheesy and wonderful at the same time, and is going to be hugely successful, judging by the opening box-office.</fullReview>

The movie is different enough from the cartoon that it's interesting to watch, and I wasn't constantly comparing the two. Anthony Hopkins is no Boris Karloff, but with the extended plot the movie doesn't rely on the narrator NEARLY as much as the cartoon did.

		<fullReview>Ron Howard's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", though beautiful to look at, takes far too many liberties with Dr. Seuss's classic to have the same name. This film is undoubtedly stunning in its visuals and make-up, but something is missing from the original story. I left the theater not feeling the joys of the Christmas season running through me like I was hoping.The main problem I had with the movie is that the entire theme of the original story/cartoon was lost in the feature film. The whole subplot of how the grinch became the grinch did some to develop his character, but left us feeling negatively about the whos. Also, it seemed as though the whos needed more schooling in the meaning of Christmas than did the Grinch. I thought he was quite justified in rejecting the over-commercialized, self-indulgent ritual that the self-centered whos participated in every year.I'd recommend this movie for people that like a lot of eye-candy in their movies and Jim Carrey fans. But as for that one movie of the holiday season that brings tears to our eyes and makes us think deeply about the true meaning of the Christmas--I'm still waiting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Real "Grinch" are the critics that are slamming this wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***In the land of Whoville high atop a creepy mountain there lives a furry green guy known as the Grinch. For years Whovillians have pretty much left this strange man alone, leaving him to his own lonely devices. However it wasn't always like that. As a very 'different' looking child the Grinch was constantly tormented and teased by unfeeling fellow classmates, culminating in a particularly cruel incident that takes place during a class Christmas party. Angry and anguished the little guy runs away from school and the town and up a mountain where he takes refuge and has lived ever since in a huge gloomy lair.In the happy-go-lucky land of Whoville there lives Cindy Lou Who, an insightful little girl whom tired of holiday ultra-commercialism, questions the real meaning of Christmas. One fateful day during his annual return to wreck holiday havoc in Whoville, the Grinch meets Cindy, an experience that somehow convinces the youngster that there is much more to this man than he allows folks to see...that somewhere way deep down inside this hairy green body...small as it ultimately is...there exists a heart. Like a good reporter Cindy goes on a quest to learn the origin of the much maligned and feared Grinch. After a few days of interviewing the townspeople she indeed learns of the Grinch's dark unhappy childhood and what drove him to flee the town and hate Christmas altogether. Wanting very much to right a past wrong Cindy nominates the Grinch for a special award, her youthful innocence somehow believing that if the Grinch shows up to accept the honor, the town will embrace the creature and all will be well.From the beginning one is struck by Director Ron Howard's dismal practically colourless look to his expensive holiday film. The movie seems to wallow in browns and reds with the actual cinematography appearing to have been shot through a pair of panty-hose. For me the unconventional 'look' of Grinch works for the movie, giving it an other-worldly 'haunting' feel. The other thing that works for this movie is Jim Carrey. No actor in existance could have pulled this off so well, brilliantly balancing a character filled with hatred and deceit with a lonely embittered soul who spews hilarious sarcasm like a demonic water-hose. Carrey inexplicably takes the character of the incredibly (and understandably) mean Grinch and makes him human and even likeable. And when circumstances finally makes the green guy's heart 'bigger,' I wasn't the only one in the theater welling up with emotion. This is more than a remake of a classic animated Christmas 'short,' this is a beautifully written and performed brand new Christmas classic, that among it's many other attributes, has the intelligence and dignity to actually make us consider what Christmas is supposed to be about.Although I never discuss what other critics have to say, I am shocked that so many movie reviewers are bad-mouthing this film, some calling it a mean-spirited movie that will scare little kids. The fact is, many film critics just didn't get Grinch or didn't bother to try, seeing this as just another manic vehicle for Jim Carrey instead of the funny, warm and enormously entertaining film that it really is. For my money this is one of the best movies of the year, with Jim Carrey delivering yet another wonderfully energetic and memorable performance. The score provided by the always reliable James (Braveheart, Titanic, Glory, etc.) Horner is appropriately understated except when it needs to be, then in typical Horner fashion, it practically soars off the soundtrack</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, they added some things; this is, after all, Hollywood, and I suppose it'd have be a lot shorter film if he just stole Christmas. While sets of the Grinch's lair were stunning, much of the added plot doesn't work well. Any filler-plot and average jokes were more than made up for with good acting and the impressive sets/visual effects (the scenes with The Grinch actually stealing Christmas are, for lack of better word, cute).Simply put, Jim Carrey IS The Grinch. Though at times almost unrecognizable under the makeup and potbelly, Carrey adds his own spirit to make such an unlovable character quite lovable, even when his heart was a few sizes too small. While other actors did good jobs, this was Carrey's movie; he couldn't be touched, and rightfully so.In the end, its a great holiday movie, with a timeless theme, and may be a "fun for the whole family" movie that for once actually lives up to that description, but the animated version is still better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How could you do this Mr. Howard?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had my reservations about having Jim Carrey in the starring role, but with Ron Howard at the helm, this movie had to be a winner. Boy were we wrong! This film was a total disappointment. Jim Carrey was way over the top. It was more like Jim Carrey was being played by the Grinch, not the other way around.The costumes, make-up and scenery were beautiful. The soundtrack was very well done. BUT WHO LET THE LITTLE GIRL SING? It was horrible! Her acting was very good though. Why didn't they dub her voice? It ruined what would have been a great Christmas song. I don't think anyone will remember it now.The simple tale has been completely bastardized. The only part that kind of worked was the background as to how the young Grinch became the Grinch. As they needed to make a 20 minute cartoon fill an hour and a half they should have worked this angle more.The moral of this review, is to keep this picture from your view. It could have been better, even merry, but that would require a lot less Carrey. You should not have put up, nor been a coward. How could you do this Mr. Howard?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Check out the number of "Howard" surnames listed in the credits. I counted four, but may have missed some. Dedicating the film to his recently deceased mother, Ron Howard was the perfect choice for directing this Dr. Seuss adaptation. Mr. Howard has a real feel for family relationships and that plays a key part in the theme of the Grinch vs. Who-ville. Howard, as usual, cast numerous members of his own family in the film. This includes, the always good for a laugh, brother Clint. Jim Carrey again proves that he is a tremendous acting talent. "The Truman Show" followed by "Man on the Moon" and now this! We are are blessed to watch such a uniquely talented performer perfect his craft. If you say the Grinch role required little acting, you are wrong. Carrey captures the true spirit of the role, and a wide range of emotions, while toting make-up that makes it impossible to recognize him. My one complaint with the film is the extremely weak version of the Grinch theme song. Done wonderfully creepy in the original TV special, the song is so light-hearted in the film that it loses the punch it is supposed to pack. My tidbit on this one is to be sure and catch the Ron Howard parody performed by Jim Carrey as he doffs a ball cap and begins mimmicing the director. This was most assuredly a Carrey ad lib that made the final cut. My request of Jim Carrey is: PLEASE get over the butt fetish!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but I really didn't like the movie. Yes, it was entertaining in a leave-your-brain-at-the-door sort of way, and maybe I was expecting it to be just like the great book and excellent TV adaptation, and maybe that's why I was disappointed. It was painfully obvious that they stretched a short story that was stretched into a 30-minute TV special into a 90-minute film. Visually, it looked very static and I wasn't drawn in emotionally to care about any of the characters. I would have much preferred to see someone with more range, like Robin Williams, playing the Grinch, instead of he's-covered-with-green-fur-but-I-can-still-tell-it's Jim Carrey. At least I can take heart that I only paid the matinee price...</fullReview>

Ron Howard wants to be a friendlier version of Tim Burton in this film, which is not a bad thing. He gives the film a washed out looked, full of drab reds to show the Grinch's distain for the whole holiday. The screening I was at was full of children, all of whom seemed to be enjoying themselves.

		<fullReview>Since this is a Christmas movie, I'll be as kind as I can while still being honest.I gave the movie a 6, but only because I felt the movie's production values off-set the disappointing adaptation.I think that most people, regardless of how they felt about the movie after seeing it, would agree on one thing: Jim Carrey is very much his "usual self" (think Ace Ventura, Mask, Tony Clifton, and a half dozen vague impersonations). For those who are fans of Jim Carrey's manic over-the-top delivery, this is... fine. For those who aren't, it will undoubtedly ruin the experience for them.Had I never seen the original "Grinch" book or cartoon, I most likely would have enjoyed this movie a lot more. Unfortunately, I've read/seen them several times throughout my life, making it very difficult to separate them from what I was viewing on-screen. Had I not been overly familiar with Jim Carrey's usual mannerisms, I would have been able to more easily lose myself in the Seuss-like environment. Unfortunately, I kept seeing the Grinch bursting into seemingly un-Grinchy comedy bits. (What did the "Ron Howard as director" sketch have to do with anything?)Now, the good points: the scenery, while not exactly natural-looking, definitely had that curvey, distorted Seuss-like perspective, with the occasional dash of Chuck Jones-ian skewed angles as well. The makeup was incredible on everyone, the computer animation segments were impressive enough to fool most people, and Anthony Hopkin's narrative portions were the closest one could get to the original story.--------------------- SPOILER WARNING: If you haven't seen the movie and you intend to, don't read the next paragraph. Skip to the paragraph after that one. Thank you.--------------------- A few gripes: Could they have come up with a more disturbing method to have the Grinch's heart grow two sizes? It looked quite painful. Also, since when did the Grinch harbor Oscar the Grouch sensibilities? His lair resembled a cross between Blankman's secret headquarters, Oscar's trash can, and Pee-Wee's Playhouse. Max the dog, while well-trained, seemed a bit too much like Benji; and Cindy-Lou Who, who was "no more than two", is suddenly six or seven and more intelligent than the entire adult population. At times I felt like I was watching "Horton Hears A Hackneyed Cliche'": the mysterious orphan in a basket, the alienated child, the unrequitted love; at one point, I felt like I was watching Disney's "Hunchback Of Notre Dame," when they gave the Grinch an award and ultimately humiliated him in public, much to the dismay of the secret love interest. -----------------------------For those of you who didn't read the spoiler, it's okay, I'm done ranting now. I went into the movie really wanting to like it - expecting to like it, in fact. I went away feeling a bit like Cindy-Lou Who did at one point in the film: Too much shallow sentimentality and glittery flash, not enough 'keeping it real'. It's a cute Christmas movie, and somewhere in it there's a moral, albeit a muddled one; but if you're looking for a faithful recreation of a cartoon classic, you might have better luck with "Popeye", "Inspector Gadget", and "Casper". (Then again, maybe not.)</fullReview>

There were chunks of time, anywhere from 10-15 minutes, where nothing was happening - knock about 30 minutes off it would have been much better.</fullReview>

Jim Carrey had one of the best roles of his career. Even though you can't "see him" through all of the great makeup, you can hear his clever acting and it will have you laughing in every scene. Of course, there are some slow parts of the show. It was to be expected when you are trying to make a respectably long feature length film out of a 30 minute cartoon. Even though the supporting cast plays almost no part in the main part of the movie, Carrey picks this movie up on his shoulders and makes it one of the most hilarious laughs of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good Jim Carrey - not a kid's flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILER WARNING: If you don't know how the story ends, don't read this review!Jim Carrey, the human cartoon, was an obvious choice for this movie, for obvious reasons - he can bring cartoonish behavior to any role and can be very entertaining. When taking a children's book which had already been expanded to a 26 minute animated film and expanding it to a full length feature film, something had to be added to fill the void. Carrey is also known for pushing the envelope on what is acceptable or funny, which is great for films targeted for adults, but not so great for a kid's flick. This film not only missed the mark on a G rating, but was given a PG-13 rating. I would rather have seen a film with less ass-kissing (yes, literally) and more appropriate for the 12 and under set for which the original animated cartoon is perfect. In the end, a very funny Grinch gets the girl, but doesn't seem transformed like the one we see in the cartoon version of the same story. Jim Carrey is the best part of this movie, but it still isn't enough to carry it through. I give it a 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My one line summary says it all, but I will be more specific.The scenes involving the Grinch and little Cindy Lou Who are imaginative, zany, and even touching. Jim Carrey pulls out all the stops and goes almost as crazy as he did in THE MASK. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou is the only likeable Who in town. Without these two, the film would be nothing but overly elaborate props, costumes, and sets that completely lose the simplicity of the original book's artwork and the madcap Bugs Bunny qualities of the classic 1966 Chuck Jones cartoon.Minus Boris Karloff's voice and loaded with lots of extra verses that even the Grinch himself detests, the film's whimsey gives way to the clutter and darkness of a Tim Burton flick, but without Burton's dark wit.I think that most people will enjoy parts of the film, especially Jim Carrey's scenes, but I don't see this becoming the classic that the 1966 cartoon is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Things Weren't Meant to be Remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last night &amp; was amazed at why anyone would want to remake the original in the first place. The original cartoon Grinch was a success because it stuck to the story and because Boris Karloff provided such a wonderful characterization.This film reminded me a LOT of Man in the Moon, which depended mostly on Carrey's over the top histrionics to carry the weak plot. This movie is the same way. I found Carrey's performance in this movie a watered down version of his work in "The Mask," and I totally agree with the reviewer that commented on Ron Howard stealing Tim Burton's visual look for this film. Why did they make this movie? In my opinion it's almost impossible to improve on the original, it's like someone trying to make a live-action remake of "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown," invariably it disappoints, and I found the backstory of the Grinch's childhood an insulting sellout to Seuss' story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Whoville, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a reason why animation (i.e., cartoons) often succeeds where live action does not: if one can suspend disbelief long enough to interpret two-dimensional line drawings as "people", then the story is accepted by the brain, even if the "people" fly, change into rabbits, or turn purple. With live action, though, if all one can think of is, "that makeup doesn't look right", then one can't be drawn into the story. This is one of the major faults with this new GRINCH: disbelief not only can't be suspended; it can't even get into the harness. For example, it's hard to accept that with this picture's budget, they used sets with such glaringly fake snow and rocks. It reminded me of some of the pop singers' TV Christmas specials of the 1960s. Whoville, though, was mostly well done. The costumes and crazy hairdos were wonderful, as were the cars and general trappings of the town. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grand scale disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Awaiting this film with great anticipation, I hoped for a great fairy tale come to life type of film. What I saw, however, was a flawed mess of a movie. Turning such a short book into a feature length film is virtually an impossible challenge. The fill that has been thrown at us is comprised of Jim Carrey either hamming it up, or a rather unnecessary explanation of the Grinch's motivation. Apparently he's got issues over being the first kid in the class to shave. It's understandable that more of the Grinch's past would be thrown into the mix, but what we get is just ridiculous. He hates Christmas cause he's the Grinch, it's just that easy. And on top of that, he's GREEN. It really doesn't take shaving to single him out. Jim Carrey, thanks to the amazing makeup job, looks the part perfectly. He pulls it off both vocally and physically. It's such a shame that his performance here is so much more ACE VENTURA than it is THE TRUMAN SHOW. Between all the mugging and joking, any layers of depth that the character could have otherwise had don't have time to come through.Now before I say anything about Howard's direction, I must say this -- TIM BURTON. Howard's direction makes Whoville look like a set on a Hollywood soundstage. This is the kind of world that Burton could have breathed life into, as he consistently does. He has admitted that Dr. Seuss is one of his biggest influences, and it shows in his work. Howard directed films like Parenthood and Apollo 13 and, while great with films like that, he doesn't quite know how to bring the texture of a surreal fantasy to the screen. All we get is great sets and great production value. The camera never sees this world with a sense of awe or wonder, but instead with a very dry 'yeah here it is' style. While there are moments in the movie that are enjoyable, the jokes that do work don't belong in this movie and other moments just drive you away from, not further into, the world of Dr. Seuss. As a movie, it should have been better. As a grand scale reworking of a classic, it falls terribly short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a FEW spoilers in this, not many, and certainly not enough to ruin the movie for ya, but I had to warn so as not to get "Blacklisted"Anyway... when analyzing this movie, you have to take into account several things... the book is only 200 pages or so long, right? That doesn't translate into a hollywood movie, verbatum. So, they added some new situations, and characters, and made it a new story with the old spirit. And that's the point really, isn't it? The whole point of "The Grinch" is that "maybe Christmas isn't from a store." Christmas is about love, and family... not gifts and such.So, okay, Ron Howard, or Jim Carrey, or whoever is responsible for the "fart jokes" or "idiotic humor" okay, so the concept of some of the jokes weren't appropriate for kids... but were they presented in a way that the kids understand it really? The scene where Grinch gets the mayor to kiss the dogs butt, that had several levels to it, and the kids took it as "eww, the man's kissing a dog!!!" and the adults took it as "eat my dookie mr. maywho!" So, some crude humor was used.Anyway, I love the original "Grinch", I love Jim Carrey, and little Cindy Lou Who was as adorable as all get out... and I loved this "Grinch." Nobody else could have done the Grinch with more sincerity and understanding as Jim did. I've never been moved by a man covered in green goo/yak fur/and makeup as I was by Jim as the Grinch.And finally, when I was a kid, I remember what the Grinch did for me. It made me realize Christmas really was more about giving than it was about recieving. And it made me realize it was mean to judge someone by how they look. This movie stretched out to encompass a vast audience, and it hooked me, it hooked my parents, it hooked my grandmother, and it hooked my six year old and four year old cousin.Works for me.Do you know what that movie did for kids in that theater? This is some of what I noticed."Mommy, why are they so mean to him?"Somebody crying when the Maywho proposed to the chick, breaking the Grinches heart again.A zillion squeals of laughter compared to only one squeal of horror when they briefly showed termites in the Grinches teeth.Cheers, clapter, smiles and tears as the Grinch presented the presents back to Whoville... by kids, by teens, by adults, and by old fogeys.I don't recall anyone coming out of that theater sulking, mad, or ranting about a "ruined classic" or "that crude Carrey character"... I recall smiles and happy families.And smiles, laughter, and family is what Christmas is all about, when Dr. Suess wrote the book, now, and in BOTH movies, cartoon and real life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What? Christopher Lee is THAT busy???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the annual popular stage production at San Diego's Old Globe Theater I was thrilled that Theordore Suess Geisel's widow consented to making a live action feature. The play was a gentle children's story that played on our memories of the TV production. I enjoyed reading stories of Mrs. Geisel making trips to Hollywood to meet Ron Howard and her delight with some of his past films (I wonder which ones). After seeing a sneak preview of this much more manic version I can honestly say that the decision was a good one. Not only is the delightful costuming and make-up of the play well adapted to the screen, but Jim Carrey brings much depth to one of the most well-known Christmas characters. Not since Boris Karloff's Frankenstein and Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera has so much been done under so much make-up. No, we can't recognize him, but it's not just the make-up, the acting behind the mask is truely inspired. Yes, that is the Grinch up there on the screen, no doubt about it. Ron Howard is not an obvious choice of director having been more successful with slices of Americana ("Backdraft," "Apollo 13"). Even "Cocoon" and "Splash" were awash in American culture past and present. Dr. Seuss has been part of most American childhoods for the past forty years. Ron Howard was also a part of most American childhoods at the time the book was first published and the TV special came into our living rooms. He certainly understands the mindset of those that grew up with the Grinch while understanding contemporary tastes. My only complaint is the lack luster narration provided by Sir Anthony Hopkins. I remember when "Twilight Zone the Movie" was released and Rod Serling's narration was replaced with Zone favorite Burgess Meredith (inspired!). Though it is difficult to replace Boris Karloff's classic (and yes, inspired!) narration (Vincent Price alas is dead too), couldn't Ron find someone with a creepier voice? I guess the fact that Hopkins is best known for "Silence of the Lambs" is the connection to horror but, jeesh, Christopher Lee (an icon of 60's horror if there every was one) is the obvious choice! If there is anyone who has a Boris Karloff sounding voice (with the Boris Karloff experience) it is Dracula Lee. I understand that he is currently very popular (voicing the animated Rings trilogy and doing Lucas' Star Wars), but how long could the narration have taken??? Despite this complaint the film is still great fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. Seuss Would Be Out-Raged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything that is good, sweet and pure about the original is gone, replaced by a bloated, distorted and over-the-top mess. Jim Carrey does his usual schtick, mugging to the camera, acting so ridiculously over-the-top, he comes back around the other side and then over-the-top again. It's very reminiscent of his turn as the Riddler in Batman Forever. But Carrey is not the worst thing about this film. The entire film looks a little smug, like there was something on the camera lenses. All of Seuss' beautiful bright colors in the animated feature, gone. This movie has color but it's like viewing it through a dense smog. Because this is "full length" motion picture and the original animated film was only about an hour, we get an added hour consisting of why the Grinch came to hate Christmas and a Whoville Christmas Eve celebration that looks like something that came out of a nightmare. But the worst thing, the absolute worst abomination done to this generations-beloved story is the Who's themselves. They're materialistic and competitive extremists. What the heck? Seriously? These are the characters were supposed to feel sorry for as the Grinch steals their stuff? Plus, their characters are so over-the-top, it's almost like they're trying to compete with the Grinch character for the audience's attention. They're such awful people, I found myself rooting for the Grinch to take all of their stuff. Did the people who made this movie not get that the Grinch is supposed to be the villain of the piece? It's like they're all villains! Except for little Cindy Woo-Hoo. I get it, she's the innocent child who turns everybody else around, yada yada. But when the characters are so utterly detestable for the first hour and a half of the movie....uuuuhhh. In short, this film is....pretty awful. Yeah, once it ACTUALLY gets into the story we know, Carrey does a respectable job of playing the character we know and love. But why remake something that was so close to perfect in the first place? Do yourself a favor and sit down in front of the original: it's simple, to the point, has that great song--it should be a part of everyone's annual staple of holiday movies. This.....should just be forgotten about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You THINK this movie is great... but take another look.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people consider the live-action version of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" to be a holiday classic, but have you really say down and looked at it? If you scrutinize this film even a little bit, you'd see that the film falls apart. You know the story, originally based on the book by Dr. Seuss. "Every Who down in Who-ville liked Christmas a lot... but the Grinch, who lived just north of Who-Ville, did NOT!" Jim Carrey, donning some amazing and surprisingly expressive makeup plays the Grinch, a green, hairy, glass-eating, hazardous waste-loving, sarcastic and mean creature who decides to ruin the whole Christmas season for the residents of Who-ville.My brother is a big Dr. Seuss fan and had informed me numerous times that this film didn't really capture the feel of the book, that it missed the point of the whole Christmas season. I told him he was simply too attached to the source material, that books are different from movies and that of course they had to change some details here and there. Now that I've sat down and watched this Ron Howard effort, I have to agree with him. What's frustrating is that there are many elements that are incredibly well done and I can see how this could have worked and why everyone was on-board when they announced the project.Let's begin with what works. I can't comment enough on how good Jim Carrey looks as the Grinch. It brings me back to the wonderfully expressive makeup used in the original "Planet of the Apes". Even though Carrey is covered head-to-toe in green paint, prosthetics and hair, he remains swift and expressive. The face in particular is a true marvel. His yellow eyes, the way the wrinkles in his face appear when he smiles that most devious and iconic smile, the way he is able to contort his face, it's what every makeup artist dreams of. The visual greatness is not limited there. The Whos are very well done (I did not find them to be unsettling, I thought they looked great) and the sets are equally impressive. I loved seeing the wacky-looking bridges and machinery because it does feel like it is capturing the whimsical and fantastical source material. Even the costumes worn throughout are a lot of fun to see. They get more and more extravagant as it gets further along. Every frame of this film is packed to the brim with style.The problem lies with the plot. This movie feels incredibly padded. By adding two iconic songs and some lengthy descriptions of the Whos' presents, Chuck Jones made the book into a 25 minute short. How much material then, did the writers have to add to more than triple the length to make this an hour and a half movie?! And what's added; is it more of the most iconic parts of the film, the scenes where the Grinch steals Christmas? NO! It's additional back story for the Grinch, which adds nothing to plot and in fact makes the movie contradict itself (I'll get back to that). What is this contradiction in the film? Let me quote it directly: "The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season! Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason." Nope, not true. Many Whos know the reason for why the Grinch does not like Christmas. Are you ready for it? The mind-blowing explanation, the mystery that has plague Seussians ever since the book was written... it's a titanic letdown. Apparently he was born evil, and also mistreated during Christmas time.I found that a lot of the material added made it go in all sorts of contradicting directions. Is the movie for children? If it is, why do we have jokes about key parties and the Grinch checking out sexy Whos? Is the movie supposed to be about the true meaning of Christmas, or are the Whos not supposed to know what it's about? Not only are they quick to judge people on their appearance (since they make fun of the Grinch's look multiple times) but apparently to the residents of Who-ville, Christmas is all about presents and sales, popularity contests and being more extravagant than your neighbor. What a selfish and materialistic holiday. Is the movie supposed to make us like the Grinch, or are we supposed to cheer for the residents of Who-ville? The Grinch is funny and he's against the materialistic nature of the holiday. I can't blame the Grinch for not liking Christmas because I also disliked the Whos' celebration.Even the sweetest resident of Who-ville (Cindy-Lou Who, remember her from those three pages in the book? Now she's a main character!) is so stupid she can't tell the difference between Santa and the Grinch in a quickly-made Santa Suit. Then this film raises whole new levels of bewilderment when we see the REAL Santa shop up briefly too. Does he bring additional presents to everyone? Isn't that kind of derivative? ARE presents the true meaning of Christmas then? There are some moments that I genuinely liked about "How the Grinch Stole Christmas", but I really don't feel like it captures the book it's based on, or even the season it's meant to comment about. Technically it's magic, but the story is a contradicting mess. I still have some small affection for it, but there's nothing that this film brings to the table that you couldn't find in the animated special from 1966. They knew it too because they jack several moments from that original story and throw them in here, even if they don't fit. They managed to turn "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" into a bag of smelly socks, it's downright embarrassing. "How the Grinch Who Stole Christmas" is a movie that you THINK is great, but the more you look and really analyze it, the more you'll realize is genuinely weak.

		<shortDescription>Another horrible Seuss adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a timeless classic. A simple story about a grumpy green creature who hatches a plan to torment the simple denizens of "Whoville" by literally stealing Christmas only to achieve a heartwarming epiphany in the end. It's a great children's book and the 1966 film captures the spirit of Dr. Seuss perfectly.The 2000 live adaptation on the other hand doesn't come close one bit.It is one of the more unpleasant and mean spirited movies that I have seen and since this is an adaptation of a holiday classic, the mean-spiritedness really stands out.What do I mean? The Whos are absolutely horrible! Materialistic, ugly both physically and morally, their unpleasantness is made more prominent by the rather smudged cameras (well they seem smudged anyway) and the scenery that could be described as "polluted". Oh and the numerous adult themed jokes that do nothing but make everyone uncomfortable.Jim Carrey tries hard as the Grinch which is unfortunately a problem as he continually goes over the top and swallows the scenery at every turn. He sadly makes up the high point of the movie.Overall, to the film's credit...it's not the worst Seuss adaptation out there and whatever dark forces were at work controlling Ron Howard, they seemed to be excised. But yeah, get the 1966 cartoon and pretend this movie never happened.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey, hey, a great look, but just okay otherwise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah, I think that the makeup and the art direction is enough for a person to watch. Even if you have serious, very serious, reservations about Jim Carrey in this, and even if you feel that Ron Howard just didn't show the skill that he did in Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind, or The DaVinci Code, you can admire the technical knowhow. The biggest difficulty for me personally is that I kept wishing I was watching the Chuck Jones animation and hearing Boris Karloff's narration instead. It is a shame, in my elfish opinion, that Ron Howard felt it necessary to include vulgarisms, but we all know that G rating isn't supposed to sell as well as the PG rating. I believe a little research throws that assumption out the window when average box office figures for G rated movies are compared to those for those with "more mature" ratings. One other disturbing factor to me was that this film didn't come through as well with the theme of Christmas being more than receiving (and even giving) material gifts. I do believe that this is a good enough film to include in your Christmas viewing, but do compare it with the earlier cartoon version.</fullReview>

Lots of work have been poured over this film, and you feel that every little detail have been under the looking glass. The plot is and old-timer, but never the less, it is secondary. Just enjoy the figures and the tone, and let your self be driven in to a fantastic fantasy world. Ron has made a brilliant experience, in how to create a world of its own.Jim is playing strong, knowing that the figure character has a life of its own, which recommends a bad character.

		<shortDescription>How Jim Carrey stole his audience!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this may be one of his weaker movies, Jim Carrey still manages to impress. Just like most of his flicks, 'How the Grinch stole Christmas' is obviously a one-man-show. As expected, Carrey doesn't disappoint. The big question is, why only 7/10. Well it has got a cute story and very nice settings and make-up, but like I said, the only thing about the movie that's really good, is Carrey himself. He makes the rest of the cast look very poor. I know it's a film made for kids, but when it involves Carrey I always tend to take a look. He has proved that he's up to a lot more than this (Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind, Truman Show). When you see this with Christmas, it delivers, but you can't take this too seriously the other 363 days of the year.5 points for Carrey, 2 for the rest!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Cartoon feature of How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a classic. In fact it is one of my favorite Christmas cartoons even after all of these years. Ron Howard took the Grinch classic and turned it upside down and ruined it. This movie has the Grinch and Cindylou Who being the only two characters who feel the holiday should be about more, where in the original, the only one who didn't get the concept of Christmas was the Grinch. Talk about changing a story around. Howard, normally a fine director changed the whole concept of the story and gave us the typical Horrorweird cliche ridden crap where only one person isn't into the commercialism of Christmas and pretty much everybody else is. I've seen this on everything from the Bob Hope specials to the made for t.v. crap that comes out at the holidays. It's been done too many times and is beginning to sound way too preachy for me.It is way too old of a story line.On top of that, Howard throws in a love interest and a political rival. Instead of a classic, we are given a seasick crocadile of a film. Having said that, the only redeaming thing about this movie other than the effects, make-up, and costumes is the performance of Jim Carrey, He pulled off the Grinch excellently. Much too good for this movie. Can you imagine if they had stuck to the original premise of the movie? It would have been great! Instead we get this. You're a mean one Mr. Howard. especially on this. You gave us a film of unwashed socks and a rotten banana with a greasy black peal! Yuck!!!!P.U.!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the glitter and tinsel and goo in the world can't save this film from its obvious flaws. I was very disappointed on Christmas Eve at how surprisingly dull and un-inventive this one was. The directing is loathably shoddy. A very poor attempt by Academy Award Winner Ron Howard. Jim Carrey was attempting to be witty and clever as the Grinch but just came off as being annoying and a thorn in the side. To be fair, the sets were inventive and the costumes were simply dazzling. But this can't make up for the film's downfalls. Any trace of humour feels forced and harvested and doesn't flow naturally. Stick with the more traditional Christmas movies such as Home Alone and The Muppet Christmas Carol this year, but avoid this cheap plastic throwaway. 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Beyond the use of too much back story, beyond the decision to jam every bit of design and gimmicks possible into the film so that it is rendered unwatchable, beyond the ludicrous, over-the-top performance to the point that Carrey reminds me of Dr. Frank N. Furter wrapped in a green carpet, the filmmakers completely missed the point of the story. A previous poster said it best: Geisel wanted to give us a character who just happens to be rotten, period. His redemption in the book and cartoon are far greater events because he finds the love in himself to vanquish HIS evil nature which is HIS ALONE. Additionally, the film seems to work overtime to secularize the story, which Geisel didn't try to do.Read the book and see the cartoon, which is a truly uplifting experience. Avoid this load of green-and-red cotton candy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where is the redemption?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw this film when it came out on video in 2001, and I was very disappointed. But I couldn't figure out why. Initially I thought it was just that old nagging nostalgia that plagues us all. But I am not a huge fan of animated film, so this didn't seem to fit since I never really liked the cartoon version that well in the first place. It hit me while watching the 1951 version of "Scrooge" starring Alastair Sim. This version has little redemption!The back story created to fill time in this version ends up (possibly unintentionally) blaming the Whos for the Grinch's general grouchiness and meanness. But deep inside we all want a truly evil creature (someone evil for no particular reason) to be redeemable. It helps us feel that we are also redeemable. This version of the story takes the typical Western "politically correct" position that no one is bad for no particular reason--that someone besides the perpetrator is responsible for the actions of the perpetrator. But even Dr. Seuss seems to think that some people are bad for no particular reason as evidenced by the original version.Christmas is a time for redemption. The whole reason for the celebration is the redemption of mankind. And deep inside we all know that we need to be redeemed, even if we aren't as bad as the Grinch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Politically Correct Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An adaptation of the Dr. Seuss story, best known from the 1966 animated TV version.It was all right, but I didn't find it to be anything particularly special. Certainly good makeup work. You wouldn't have known that the Grinch was Jim Carrey unless you looked at the credits, and even the Who's were pretty well made up. But it just didn't grab me. The most original part of the story, in fact, truly bothered me.Turns out that the Grinch isn't really a bad guy, after all. He was just a guy who was different and so he got picked on when he was a kid. Please! Give me a break! Why can't the Grinch be just a bad guy? But in our politically correct world, no one can be bad; we have to find ways to make sure that no one is actually responsible for the bad things they do. Thus, the Grinch isn't really responsible for being cranky - the kids who picked on him are. Whatever. The fun part of the TV version was that the Grinch was so absolutely and completely unlikeable. Now, I think we're supposed to feel sorry for him, but I didn't. I just felt kind of sorry that I rented the movie.It wasn't a disaster, but the next time I need a "Grinch fix" I think I'll stick with the cartoon.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overdone, strangely unhappy film version of the classic children's story by Dr. Seuss (Theodor S. Geisel). Jim Carrey stars as the infamous Grinch, who is so terribly sickened by neighboring Whoville and their Christmas spirit that he sets out to defraud the town and ruin their favorite holiday. This film, while allowing Carrey to roam free and create some undeniable laughs, is overdrawn (and possibly scary to kids), and prevents us from using our imaginations like the original story did. It does add some interesting background information about the Grinch (namely a rough childhood as a spurned outcast in Whoville), and provides some fun, festive moments. However, this is always diluted by the ugly appearance of the Whos in Whoville (were they pig-nosed and repulsive in the story-book?), and the Grinch's menacing demeanor. A little less style would have done director Howard well here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well.Little bit of history here. When I first heard that they were working on a live-action remake of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!", I immediately filed it with "the Wiz", the live-action "101 Dalmatians" movies, and the rumored "Marilyn Manson and the Chocolate Factory" under Remakes Nobody Needs. I was as enthusiastic about this movie as I was about "Space Jam".Furthermore, the original "Grinch" film, directed by Chuck Jones (who is, like, a god to me) and personally supervised by Dr. Suess is as close to perfect as any Christmas movie; or any animated short for that matter; has ever come to perfection. It is sacred ground. Do not touch.So this here movie had two or three strikes against it BEFORE I made myself watch it.There is good news. Jim Carrey is an adorable Grinch. I don't think anyone else could have pulled this off nearly as well. Anytime he gives us the Patented Grinchy Grin, it... well, it made me nostalgic for the original. But, anyway, I can't blame him for this mess. Everybody else, on the other hand, has to be taken into account.But, you know what, it's Christmastime. And as the song goes, I'll let in light and banish the hate. So I can't rightly yell at anyone.

		<shortDescription>A vulgar and loud insult to Chuck Jones</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One hopes the screenplay, from the man who wrote Who Framed Roger Rabbit, might have been more clever and sharp than the product the incredibly talentless Ron Howard, and Jim Carrey (talented, but only when he's given some restrained direction ala The Mask) came up with in the end.Carrey does have a couple of good moments as he always does, but more times than not he mugs the jokes to death. Subtle he is not, and anyone who loves the original Chuck Jones/Boris Karloff cartoon as I do knows that subtle nuance is what made that cartoon a masterpiece.The Grinch should be more subdued rather than manic, shrewd with his mannerisms rather than in your face with them. He should have been presented for the first 30-40 minutes with some mystery, some build-up, some method to his madness as he presides over Whoville and comes to despise the sounds of Christmas' approach until he can't take it any more. What we get instead is instant gratification, throwing the Grinch at us in all his glory in the first 5 minutes of the story, then it allgoes downhill faster than his rocket sled from there. Until the last half hour anyway. The finale, as the Grinch decides to steal Christmas sticks mainly to the cartoon despite a modification or two, and is actually quite entertaining. What came before though was quite simply a mess.Having the Grinch's sad childhood depicted was just the worst possible direction the story could have gone in. Why do we care what the Grinch's backstory is. It could have been hinted at in the dialogue instead of shown. Howard has repeatedly shown in his films that he has no idea how to develop a character through thoughtful direction. Instead, like a previous member said, he just pulls out the giant mallett and hammers the character into our heads. Also, why couldn't the Who's have been depicted more like the Munchkins in The Wizard of Oz, just there to forward the plot along and not saying anymore than they should. Who cares about the overbearing schmuck of a Mayor or Cindy Lou Who's parents, or the fact the whoville beauty queen is in love with the Grinch. It's obvious Howard went after a kind of Munchkinland feel to Whoville, but again he hasn't got a clue what made that movie great either. There's just too much useless dialogue and subplots. Superfluous, as Cindy Lou says.If someone like Rob Reiner or Robert Zemeckis had directed this it would have been given the comedic treatment it deserved. Howard needs to take a trip back to Mayberry to relearn what funny and sophisticated comedy is.In addition to the overdone antics, the Grinch is shot looking straight at his face too often. The best angles are his profile or at an angle. The make-up does not resemble the Grinch at all looking directly at him. There are moments when the production DOES look spot on but they are few and far between.Carrey is a pretty good choice for the Grinch, if someone would ever tell him to keep his yap shut, but the first hour should have been erased and redone. Ron Howard must be the culprit for the tatty way this production was handled.The attractive production design, Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou ( what a little sweetheart!) and a few of Carrey's better moments aren't enough to save this one from sliding over the cliff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dr. Suess must be rolling in his grave with this "adaptation" that is currently playing. I have never once been so disappointed with a movie. It's hard to know where to start, but I'll try.Most of the blame falls on Carrey, who turned Suess' grumpy Grinch into a goofy Bigfoot. Seriously, any fan of the children's book and classic Christmas special knows that the Grinch was not a goofy maniac who said some zippy one liners and played practical jokes. I've read other posts that say no one else could have played the Grinch. Two words: Jack Nicholson.The second problem comes to the Whos. In Suess' work, they are an elitist culture who already knows what Christmas is all about. In this movie, they are stupid and materialisic, and it's up to the corny Cindy Lou to teach them all (even though she never does, all she does is ask questions). The best part of the book and Christmas special comes at the end when all the Whos come together to sing and welcome Christmas, with no thought whatsoever about the missing presents. In this film, we get that after they all whine and complain about not getting their presents.This film was easily the biggest disappointment of the year. It's a shame it's going on to make so much money. It really doesn't deserve it.This is what I've told for recommendations: if you want to go and see Jim Carrey goof off for 90 minutes, go see it. But if you want to go and see Dr. Suess's story, do not. That's the truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Hollywood Ruins Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview> There is so much wrong with the Grinch...but primarily it's just boring and unnecessary and that is the main feeling that kept coming up while I was sitting in the theater, watching this expensive experiment, waiting for it to find a point or direction. Did it want to be funny? Yes, most certainly so. Was it? It was about as funny as it looks, which is to say...not very funny...unless Jim Carrey squeezing everything he can out of a seriously not funny script...is funny. Whose brilliant idea was it to use a script penned by a team whose last effort yielded the disaster that is Wild Wild West? Come on. If you start with a bad script, which this definitely is, when do you ever get good movie? Seems like they purposely didn't write any jokes, figuring Jim Carrey would just improvise....It doesn't work well...actually not at all. One or two laughs...okay maybe three or four...But they aren't big ones. Howard stretches and stretches and stretches the story out....like it needed to be 1 hour 45 min. How about 1 hour 15...it could of been a nice short well paced movie and that was what you were hoping for the whole time. Unfortunately, the movie suffers the most from being just plain boring....everything good is buried under bad filler. The best parts are when it takes literally from the book...with Anthony Hopkins's narration and Jim Carrey's responses...although they never use it to it's full potential and it's too little too late. Another problem is the Whos...they're just obnoxious...you want the Grinch to ruin it for them. You want him to eat a couple maybe! You want someone to smack them in their ignorant and not so wholesome heads! Also there is this stupid subplot about what is Christmas...is it commercialism?...Hypocritical trash coming from a movie who has more tie-ins than most movies this year. Other questions that come up while watching (not after), which is a really bad sign:Why is the Grinch talking like that? Why is the Grinch manic?Why isn't the dog funnier?Why isn't the Grinch funnier?Why do the whos look like that? Why are they so annoying? Why does it look like they stole the Flinstones' set?Why is my foot itching? Am I still watching this? Is it over?I wonder how much this cost? Why is Molly Shannon in this? Why isn't she funny? Why oh why did they do this? Really so many other directions could of been taken and they chose no real direction at all. They touched on some. They teased you a bit but never followed any good ideas through. Well maybe half-ass spastic zannyness...they followed that through in spades, which was not what Dr. Suess was ever about. Suess seemed to be about dignified fantasy based on very real morals. Not Jim Carrey playing a bipolar fur ball, in Universal backlot heaven. Which leads to production design. The production design teeters between really good and god-awful. Whoville being a backlot seems to take most of the blame. The only winner here is Rick Baker's makeup...which sometimes is downright scary...it carries the movie. Ron Howard really needs to find his own personality. He is always imitating someone else. First Spielberg with Backdraft, then Cameron with Apollo, and now Burton with this. Should of left it alone. A story you all know and loved done perfectly as a cartoon which is probably why you'll spend the whole time picturing the cartoon and that great curly Chuck Jones smile that they gave the Grinch and of course the unforgetable voice of Karloff. Stop messing with stories we all love. Try thinking up something more original. If you want to pay tribute or homage to the stories you love, follow Burton's cue with Nightmare Before Christmas. A very original tribute to the stop-motion holiday specials...and look he didn't have to ruin a classic did he.Although Burton himself seems to be losing track of this idea. Sleepy Hollow... and now Planet of the Apes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunning visually; overlong; insincere in its message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. Whoville lives. It sure looks like Whoville, and Jim Carrey sure looks like the Grinch, and the Whos look more like Whos than anybody could. The look, the atmosphere, the visuals are excellent. Can't complain about that.It's a tad overpadded, though. It starts to drag a bit and the major-league test of movie interest failed; that is, I looked at my watch during the film.Jim Carrey does a fine Grinch, but unlike most of the reviewers here, don't believe that Carrey is the guy who had to play this role; any decently physical actor could have done it. All he had to do was be relatively animated and convincingly emotional. In fact, post-production work sped up the body movements in many scenes to look cartoonish, so Carrey didn't really have to look cartoonish while he was acting. He was great, but they probably didn't need to get a guy who wanted a Carrey-sized paycheck.What spoiled it for me was the message. The story really made a point about the overcommercialization of Christmas that is both true and is not approached enough in film. The problem is that this movie is going to be sold through Happy Meals and toys galore just in time for the Christmas season, which is sort of sickening. It's about as hypocritical as you can get.I gave it a 5/10. Not a waste of money, but you could go see something else and get more entertainment, even if you are a kid.Finally, I didn't need to see a guy kissing a dog's rump, or the dog wiping its rump on the carpet, or any wife-swapping jokes. That content is just stupid (and disgusting in the kissing part) and doesn't belong in a Dr. Seuss picture aimed at kids. No wonder his widow disavowed this picture after seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fun Holiday Movie For 2000.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been reading the comments on "The Grinch", and I have to say that they seem a little harsh. In fact, I even think I saw a review saying this was comparable to "Batman &amp; Robin". No, no, no. Nothing could ever compare to that mockery of a movie (but several have tried), and while "Grinch" has a few little nitpicks, it's certainly not a bad movie.The story itself is all too familiar, but now it has a lot of backstory and exposition and everything else. Initially, it sags a little at times, but immediately picks right back up before ever really dropping the ball, and as it gets closer to the Grinch's stealing of Christmas, it really picks up and doesn't stop from there. But you have to look at this objectively: It's a children's story with whimsical characters, so it gets silly at times, and overall, that's fine. What I didn't like were the camera speed up/slow down effects. *MINOR spoiler* There's a scene where the Grinch is driving a miniature car, and after he wrecks it, has to escape before it explodes. This escape is done in slow motion, and this totally just seemed to say "Hey! This is a big budget Hollywood film! Explosions are practically mandatory!" But then again, this isn't exactly "Die Hard" either. It does the same effect later for another scene, and it still bugged me. *End minor spoiler*I think the film could also have gone without the references to current trends, jokes and happenings. I think it would have kept more of a timeless quality that way. But it was still a fun ride.The sets were great. During a visit to Universal, I had a chance to see these sets up close, and they looked the way they should, and translated even better to film. While Tim Burton would probably have done a fantastic job with this, the sets were appropriately Seuss regardless. Colorful, weird, and imaginative all the way.I've noticed some people saying that Jim Carrey was wrong for the Grinch. As his third green cartoon character (Mask and The Riddler being the other two), he was back to the Jim Carrey of 5 years ago: Totally offbeat and just nuts. And it was nice to see him briefly return to that again, and it shows that he's pretty comfortable with both his comedy and drama roles. But something happens to Carrey as he begins to steal Christmas: He completely transforms into the Grinch, right down to the posturing, facial expressions and dialogue from the cartoon. The gradual change was a complete shock to me, and it left no doubt in my mind that he was more than perfect for the role. The costume looked great and it turned out to be more effective than I thought.The little girl who played Cindy Lou was pleasant for the role (proving that not all child actors are annoying), and her interaction with the Grinch was fun. Anthony Hopkins was fine as the Narrator, and while Boris Karloff made a great Grinch/ Narrator in the original cartoon, the man passed away over 30 years ago. There's really not much that can be done about that. Even the dog was entertaining.The music? I always like a good James Horner score (barring the over-played "Titanic" theme, and they even fit the songs in from the cartoon, so there's no disappointment there.So "The Grinch" got a little too silly for itself at times, but The Grinch himself was good, the sets were amazing, the adapted parts from the book and cartoon were surreally accurate, it had a decent message, and the narration even had Seuss-style rhyme. It's a film that you can take the kids to, or just sit back and enjoy all the eye-candy. You might even find some nostalgia in there as well. If you look at it that way, then there's really nothing to complain about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What happened to the great story by Dr. Suess?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's budget of $115 million dollars was primarily spent on lavish and exotic sets, incredible make-up, special effects and wonderful props. Of course, I am sure that Jim Carrey got his cut too.But it just proves that throwing big money around does not make a good film.Director Ron Howard has taken the delightful 26-minute children's Christmas fable by Dr. Seuss and padded it, overblown it and turned it into an over-long mish-mash of effects with little-to-none of the heart and soul of the original. It was also definitely not directed for children ? but for their parents. It also has the biggest make-up crew of any film I have ever seen.This movie does exactly what the cautionary story by Dr. Suess warns about: Christmas is not in the trappings and money spent ? it is in the heart ? and this movie lacks any heart whatsoever.The sound editing was near perfect; however, the best songs come after the audience has left the theater. If you are going to see this movie sit and wait for all the credits to roll: there you will find the best music in the movie.No one but the rubber-faced Jim Carrey could have carried off the role of The Grinch. It would take a hyperactive over-actor like Mr. Carrey to pull it off through all the layers of latex and dyed Yak fur that he is encumbered with.Christine Baranski is always a delight to watch ? though she is given little motivation for her character. The rest of the cast could just as easily have been done as animation. But wait! Isn't that how the original -- and still the greatest ? version of this delightful story was done?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HOW THE GRINCH STOLE Christmas (Ron Howard, 2000) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a live-action adaptation of the Dr. Seuss novella, following the classic 1966 animated short by Chuck Jones (narrated by horror icon Boris Karloff); for the record, I own a copy of both the latter and the earlier Stanley Kramer production of THE 5,000 FINGERS OF DR. T (1953) in my collection. This remake, on the other hand, features the voice of a bored-sounding Anthony Hopkins. The Grinch (actually the title of the copy I watched, shown on local TV) is an ideal role for the facial contortions and over-the-top antics of Jim Carrey. He is a hairy creature in the fictional town of Whoville (whose 'normal' inhabitants are elfish in appearance).They love Christmas and celebrate it in grand fashion, but The Grinch does not since he had always been given the cold shoulder at this time of year in view of his unusual appearance. Consequently, he has gone to live by himself in the mountains (attacking occasional trespassers from town) but a little girl feels pity on The Grinch and determines to help him (even carrying out a survey around town to learn what the townsfolk really think of him!). When a prize for the most prominent personality is to be handed out, she nominates The Grinch, even if the Mayor (the latter's arch-enemy and contender for the hand of the town belle) expects it to be given to himself. The girl convinces The Grinch to accept but, when the ceremony turns unpleasant ? with the people of Whoville making fun of him a' la The Hunchback Of Notre Dame ? he decides to take revenge by disrupting their Christmas festivities (the premise, then, is very similar to the recently-viewed THE Christmas THAT ALMOST WASN'T {1966})!What he does is wear the traditional Santa Claus clothing and, rather than delivering presents as he is supposed to, The Grinch goes round the Whoville houses on Christmas Eve to steal the gifts ready to be opened the next day! However, his triumph is short-lived as the townsfolk realize ? once again, thanks to the girl ? that Christmas is essentially a time of solidarity but, of course, this being at heart a morality play, The Grinch is himself reformed and finally accepted into the town's fold. Though reasonably engaging (the little girl's sincere portrayal helps a lot in this regard), occasionally funny (for instance, The Grinch dresses his dog like a reindeer on his nefarious expedition!) and undeniably good to look at (highlighted by the imaginative production design of the Whoville locale), this still makes for little more than a kiddie movie. Incidentally, Carrey would later 'star' in that other Yuletide favorite A Christmas CAROL (2009), which I also included in my schedule for this season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>5.6??? Sorry but I thought the film was surprisingly good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course it isn't as good as the animated classic, an immensely charming, beautifully animated gem, that is a family Christmas favourite. I will admit I was a bit sceptical of the remake, but other than some slow scenes in the middle half and a patchy script, this film is surprisingly good. Honestly if you thought this is terrible, and I completely respect anyone who thinks that, I warn you Cat in the Hat was much worse, and gets my vote as the worst Dr Seuss adaptation ever. How The Grinch stole Christmas is very colourful, with great set design, and an unrecognisable Jim Carrey was terrific as the Grinch, he was actually really funny, not like Mike Myers who was miscast as the cat in Cat in The Hat. Everyone else was fine too, particularly the girl, and while he is no Boris Karloff Antony Hopkins does a good job as the narrator. The script is patchy in places, but there are a number of very funny bits, and it was nice having some character context about the Grinch. All in all, a colourful, well performed film, not as good as the 1966 animated classic,and flawed it is, but actually one of the better Dr Seuss adaptations. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' is a mediocre children's film based on Dr Suess' classic tale. The film suffers whenever it deviates from the written text. Jim Carrey is good but occasionally too annoying. The humor is uneven but at least Carrey's Grinch has a lot of energy. The film satirizes the people of Whoville, a plot line that's interesting but not fully developed. The film occasionally feels too loud and many events feel unnecessary and seem to have been added mainly to inflate the running time. As a Christmas family outing, its certainly watchable but hardly memorable.Overall 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Whos in Whoville love Christmas, but have gotten away from the spirit of the season as they, like the rest of society, have over commercialized it, and the Grinch hates Christmas because of this. He decides that he must teach them a lesson and steal Christmas and impersonates Santa Clause to achieve his goals.This film has a few good points. Jim Carrey is a really good choice to play the lead here, and his gestures and acting style really work. There are also some good sets that look like they could have been taken from the Dr. Seuss books.But overall, the film fails for me. It is one thing to take some license and change parts of a story for artistic reasons in the adaptation from print to film, but it is another to completely change the message of the book, which this adaptation does. It is also overly long and just seems padded to stretch this short story to a feature length movie. Adults may find it a bit tedious because of this, though my 9 year old daughter was entertained throughout.In my home, this will never be one of the beloved family Christmas traditions. It might be worth a watch, but I will stick with the 1966 animated, Boris Karloff-narrated classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I already loved "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" when it was released and I'm still loving it now, 5 years later. Still lots of people seem to disagree with my opinion and this movie never really had received much love at the time it came out.Sure, the movie is over-the-top and campy but that at the very same is also the reason why this movie is so charming and fun to watch. All of the sets, costumes and characters are done perfectly over-the-top in a fun way, without ever becoming truly ridicules. It's a visually spectacular movie to watch. It's a campy movie making at its very best! Director Ron Howard really surprises with this fun little Christmas movie.Main reason why the movie works and why it's so much fun to watch is Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He truly carries the movie with his good and fun role. He is of course helped by the convincing make-up, which also received an Academy Award. Of course if you're a Jim Carrey hater you shouldn't even think about watching this movie. This movie is really his movie and he makes it all work and so much fun to watch. Other fun and memorable roles are being played by Jeffrey Tambor, Clint Howard and Josh Ryan Evans as the young Grinch.The movie has a good morale but it is all a bit sappy to me. Perhaps it's because I'm Dutch and we don't really celebrate Christmas that enthusiastic and big here, as in the United States or England. For me the movie was simply fun and entertaining and the morale just left me quite cold to be honest.The musical score by James Horner is good and fun, even though it's your average every day Horner stuff, it still all works perfectly for the movie and helps to make some of the scene's work.Perfect Christmas entertainment.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Jim Carrey turns in a performance that's just inappropriate for the Grinch or even the books. In fact, the Grinch in this film looks nothing like the Grinch in the books. He looks more like a mouse than a Grinch. I'm telling you, hire Tim Burton to make every live-action adaptation of Dr. Seuss's books and everything will be just fine.</fullReview>

Jim Carrey as usual is horrible and the direction lacks of everything. I just don't understand these kind of films. Here is the story thanks to Filmfreak.Based on the book by the famous Dr. Seuss. Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville. In Whoville, live the Who's, an almost mutated sort of munchkinlike people. All the Who's love Christmas, yet just outside of their beloved Whoville lives the Grinch. The Grinch is a nasty creature that hates Christmas, and plots to steal it away from the Whos which he equally abhors. Yet a small child, Cindy Lou Who, decides to try befriend the Grinch.Just rent Barb Wire or Skyscraper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Grinch` is very disappointing. It suffers form stodgy direction from a usually reliable Ron Howard, and a dire script. However it has one factor saving it. Mr. Jim Carrey. The saviour of comedy. Even dressed up in green fur Carrey produces a magnificent comic performance, worthy of his recent Golden Globe nomination. Here's how it goes. Young Cindy-Lou Who (Taylor Momsen, cute but cringeworthy) is eager to find out why the Grinch is so hateful of Christmas, and tries to tell him that Christmas is not so bad. With a few bits of poetry by Anthony Hopkins, the narrator of the tale. I expected far better than this and while some parts raise a smile, especially when it's Carrey provoking them, it's still easily forgotten the morning after.

		<shortDescription>The Grinch returns to try and Carrey off Christmas but Who can stop him?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry to upset either fans of this movie or this director from the very beginning but, let's face it, the tale of the grinch trying to steal Christmas from the Whos of Whoville is a safe bet as a live-action tale realised through the magic of modern effects and Ron Howard is the very definition of a "safe" director nowadays. So, it's no surprise that the end result here is something very safe.Despite an ill-judged beginning that depicts the Whos as townsfolk overwhelmed by the commercialism and one-upmanship of Christmas, the movie soon falls into line with the central strand of the story when the grinch appears and plots to ruin Christmas day. In fact, everything steps up a gear when the grinch appears thanks to a fantastic, fun performance from Jim Carrey, almost unrecognisable under all of that make-up (mainly all green, as per the animated version that changed things from the original illustrations where the grinch was simply black and white with only a splotch of colour shading here and there).Carrey is the undeniable star of the show, and rightly so, but that doesn't mean we should have to settle for a cast of supporting characters who are quite so bland and irritating. Taylor Momsen plays Cindy Lou Who and is stuck with far too many moments of schmaltz, including her own musical number that's painful to endure. Jeffrey Tambor fares slightly better as the vain mayor and Christine Baranski is entertaining as Martha May Whovier, a lady who seems to protest too much that she has never been the slightest bit attracted to Mr Grinch. Clint Howard is here, as is Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon. They may not have as much to do but they're watchable enough with what they do have. Oh, and Anthony Hopkins lends his voice to proceedings as the narrator of the piece.Yes, it twists the tale and adds far to much sugar into the mix for my liking but I still cannot deny that the movie is a sumptuous visual treat. The mix of practical effects and CGI is superb and it's no surprise to learn that the movie apparently features the most characters in heavy make up since The Wizard Of Oz. The design and feel of the thing, even if based as much on the cartoon as the original work, feels very much Seussian (is that a word? it is now) and it's that singular quality, paired up with Carrey's superb performance that elevates this Christmas movie just above average. He also gets to redeem the soundtrack by singing "You're A Mean One, Mr Grinch" that was so memorable in the cartoon. Given a choice, however, I much prefer the cartoon version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christmas mania from inside a Hollywood snowflake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the misgivings one may initially have about Hollywood turning the still-satisfying animated TV special from Dr. Seuss' book into a big-budget live-action feature, fear not over the look of the piece. Director Ron Howard and his artists have really captured the visual essence of the classic show, and one couldn't possibly hope for a better-looking movie based upon a Seuss story. Jim Carrey is marvelously cast as the Grinch, a green, furry, Christmas-hating malcontent who lives atop a snowy hill overlooking Whoville, although the inhabitants of Whoville present a problem. With make-up designs causing everyone to resemble relatives of Wallace Shawn, distinctive (or likable) personalities were apparently difficult to come by. In expanding this whole scenario, screenwriters Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman were unable to retain the angelic (some may argue, cloying) passivity in Whoville. We now get a Mayor who's a self-serving jerk, a Christmas lights contest between neighbors, and children who laugh and jeer at a moppet version of the Grinch in a very odd flashback sequence. Howard's attentions as a filmmaker begin to wander after a promising opening; he becomes exhausted by the material itself--the bombast wears him out--perhaps causing a few of his quieter moments to flag (particularly an awful sequence with Carrey having fun with his echo, later munching on shattered glass). Bits and pieces work crazy magic, though Howard is no Tim Burton and doesn't always grasp the deliciousness in the macabre undermining (he's too anxious to be funny). Anthony Hopkins narrates in commendable fashion, and there are some marvelous scenes, but interest for adults should wane after the first hour. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been a fan of the book and the cartoon for a long time, since I was a kid back in the States. At first I was skeptical about a movie conversion of this Dr. Seuss masterpiece, because I didn't think it would make the cut, it would be a turkey, or in this case a roast beast. But as I watched it, it turned out great! Jim Carey never stops making me laugh, and with a few emotional scenes. The man is back with green once again, but there were some scenes that didn't look like it was faithful to the book, there was more background to the Grinch's character, but I can forgive them for that, this was also touching as the cartoon was. Especially when the Grinch finally had a big heart, it made me feel all warm inside, Jim Carey was a perfect Grinch. Perfect for the holidays. I recommend this to everyone to kids from 1-92, it should be shown during Christmas, so you can all have a green Christmas. And the soundtracks were also great and wonderful. Forget the Cat In The Hat, watch this and have a Green Christmas! Thank you Dr. Seuss, this film proves that your legacy lives on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases, I feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of Dr. Seuss' classic tale, and well... it's not very good. First off, following a classic act like Chuck Jones' animated TV special is going to be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and padded as to be positively numbing. I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab, at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of Christmas. Jim Carrey is typically over the top here, but that is completely at odds with the character of the Grinch. As characterised by Boris Karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and sly. There is no method to Carrey's madness, and that is only the most obvious error made. Talented actors like Jeffrey Tambor and Christine Baranski are utterly wasted here. Why, Universal, why? I mean , I understand that Tony Hopkins will take just about any role offered (much like his countryman Michael Caine), but this one needs to be filed under "Films that should never have been made." This does not bode well for the Cat in the Hat, an even thinner tome that Universal is prepping for this Christmas. I get the feeling that I will be making the same recommendation for that one as I am with this one: skip it, and either read the book or watch the TV special. This is 2 hours you can never, ever get back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that this is quite possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema - or anywhere, actually. I thought Jim Carrey could have been doing better things with his time than playing a bizarre green thing, and the "Who people" or whatever were frankly Hollywood's most annoying creation. I sat and watched this with disbelief, but mostly I was embarrassed for Carrey. You wouldn't think it was the same actor in The Truman Show as it is here. 1/10. No, 2/10, and that's being generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How "The Grinch" was desecrated: Carrey is buried in depressing remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1966 cartoon special "How The Grinch Stole Christmas," co-directed by recently deceased animation pioneer Chuck Jones, has stood the test of time for over thirty years. It's a freewheeling masterpiece about the eponymous yuletide-hating green monster (voiced flawlessly by Boris Karloff), who is so mean and grouchy and so lovable at the same time. He had no complicated reason for his disposition, and there were no forced morals woven into the plot. Sure, he changed his ways in the end, but it wasn't shoved in our faces. It was, and still is, just plain fun. And who didn't sympathize with his loyal yet long-suffering dog, Max? On the flipside, this inevitable live version, directed by Ron Howard, does one hell of a disservice to Dr. Seuss's story. Where do we begin? The weak, preachy script reeks of modern-day political correctness. The sets are poorly designed and claustrophobic. The supporting characters are meaningless. There's even a (gasp!) love interest. And yes, there is dialogue about how Christmas "doesn't come from a store." (Meanwhile, the movie opens to all of Whoville in the midst of a collective shopping spree. Hmm.) The convoluted screenplay was written by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, who both penned the still-unrivaled "Who Framed Roger Rabbit."Here, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) is a maligned and misunderstood recluse. The film explains his nasty nature in a very unpleasant and utterly pointless flashback scene, in which he throws a temper tantrum as he is teased by his classmates. The role of Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen, in her film debut) is expanded simply because there has to be the obligatory lone character who sees good in the crabby Grinch. Speaking of seeing, some cartoons were not meant to be seen as live versions (this spelled the downfall of the two "Flintstones" films). With all due respect to Carrey's painstaking effort, which included three-hour sessions in the makeup chair, that company definitely includes the Grinch. Think what a live movie starring Bugs Bunny would look like, then immediately clear that sacrilegious thought from your mind.The movie is three times longer than the cartoon, and it resulted in a lot of excess baggage, particularly Carrey's overbearing yet familiar slapstick routine, which was used in order to fill screen time and perhaps take the audience's attention away from the script deficiencies. Despite having a Golden Globe Award to his name, Carrey's film career is in danger of being remembered solely for such minutiae instead of his otherwise solid acting.By now, you may have already surmised that I'm in favor of the animated classic. (On a side note, I saw the trailers for "Grinch" while watching another animated classic, "Chicken Run.") There's no gentle way to say it: this celluloid defecation is an insult to Dr. Seuss. I don't think I have to elaborate any further on that. Never mind the plot, the characters and the depressing atmosphere of Whoville; what viewers will find to be the most traumatizing scene in the entire film is seeing the Grinch in lederhosen. 3/10</fullReview>

First off, the add-in about the Grinch's past were unneeded and the thing about him loving one of the whos was retarded.

		<shortDescription>Why the Grinch lived by a mountainside garbage dump</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People seem to either love this movie or hate it. I am in the latter group, because I love the story by Dr. Seuss and I cannot understand what Ron Howard has done to it. In the original story, and in the cartoon that faithfully followed, almost no time goes by before the Grinch is cutting out his Santa outfit and trying to steal Christmas. But in the film, quite a bit of new story is told before we start seeing "How" the Grinch stole Christmas, so much so that the film might be renamed "Why," not "How." And it isn't even a very compelling tale. First, the Grinch moved to a mountain garbage dump because he was essentially driven away as a child by Whoville's mean-spirited youth. Then, when he was invited to return, he was driven back to the mountain by Whoville's mean-spirited Mayor. Where does all this come from? Maybe the film's title should also recognize that there are in fact several Grinches in Whoville now.I much prefer Dr. Seuss's simple explanation, that the Grinch was mean because his shoes were too tight and his heart was too small. After all, the story is not really supposed to be about the life and times of the Grinch but about the spirit of Christmas that overpowers even one as mean as the Grinch, a spirit so purely demonstrated, with and without the trimmings, by all the Whos in Whoville.The Whos in this film are not so pure: they drink booze, they envy their neighbor's Christmas lights, and they do say "Boo-hoo" on the morning after, at least momentarily, while the book's Whos are not even detracted from their singing.But maybe I am just "bitchin'," as Carrey's Grinch said when he slid face first into a Who girl's supple bosom. Merry Christmas, indeed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"It's Whoville, says Ron. God, What Has He Done?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's take on The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is a thoroughly uneven, much too dark, and often violent film that stumbles a fine line between cartoonish children's film and dark, adult comedy.Plot synopsis is unnecessary, because the story is extremely well known and the title says it all: a Grinch steals Christmas, only in true Hollywood fashion, the tale is trumped up with millions of dollars in special effects and elaborate production design, adding nothing to the story. As the Grinch, Jim Carrey gives it his best, but he is hampered by unfunny lines and Ron Howard's stiff direction.The first half hour of the film lacks any magic or laughs; Howard doesn't seem to know how to unfold the story and instead relies on the twisted scenery and often grotesque makeup of Whoville and the Who's to give a sense of an imaginative film. The set design seems more nightmarish than cartoonish however, and could easily have been pulled out of a Tim Burton film: curved, dark, twisted, and sparsely lit. It just does not fit. Equally out of place are scenes of the Grinch chewing glass, popping a red hot screw in his mouth, and engaging in drunken driving. At one point I was expecting to see Carrey actually murder one of the Whos in a blood bath.Then there's the little girl who portrays Cindy Lou Who, Taylor Momsen. She delivers her lines as if she's acting in a school play: example: *in whiny voice* "But Christmas is blah blah...blah blah blah...* Haley Joel Osment she ain't. SNL's Shannon and the always sharp and fabulous Baranksi are both wasted as two women who appear to be engaged in a bitter rivalry. After their first scene together, however, this apparent subplot goes nowhere.The Grinch is mired in scenes of grotesqueness and a truly nightmarish set design. Ron Howard's inept handling of the classic Seuss tale can't even be saved by a tremendously make-upped Jim Carrey. There are few inspired laughs, special effects to cover up the gaping holes in its pacing, and two very forgettable songs written probably to push the CD soundtrack. It's a heartless treatment, and call me a Grinch, but the spirit of Christmas is dead in this heap.3 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard's worst film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opie's worst movie, and Carrey's least appealing performance since the Riddler.This movie has none of the magic, Xmas spirit, and abundant joy to found in Suess' book, or in the cartoon from the 60's.Yes, Ron has made clunkers before ( Grand Theft Auto, Willow ) but at least those films had some entertaining moments. Grinch has none. A stale, annoying, unimaginative unfunny miscalculation, on the order of past cinematic duds like Toys, Santa Claus:The Movie, and Howard the Duck.Jim Carrey and the screenwriters must share in the blame. Jim's antic schtick and one-liners fall deadly flat. And unlike Robin Williams' Genie from "Alladin", which was good fun and clever, Carrey's Grinch grows tiresome.What's most disappointing about Ron's movie ( and Carrey ) is that they commit the worst cinematic sin of all : they're boring.Add to that the most grating Xmas songs in recent memory. James Horner seems to have channeled Barney the Dinosaur for inspiration.All the kiddies in the theatre seemed to share my view. Half of them were constantly fidgiting from the start, or passed out asleep.Parents, instead of the movie, read them the story, or rent the classic cartoon. Merry Xmas !!!!!</fullReview>

Taylor Momsen is the best part as Cindy Lou Who, although I miss the adorable two year old from the original. This Cindy Lou is a typical "smarter than all the grown-ups" kid like you only see in movies. Still, overly precocious or not, she's one of the few sweet parts of an otherwise charmless film. Garish sets and dark colors are a turn-off. See the original cartoon instead. It will save you a lot of time and you will come away much happier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing heart... among other problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that anyone who has even just a shred of common sense would see that making a live action AND feature length version of Dr. Seuss' "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" is asking for trouble. To begin with, just look at how this movie looks visually. Now, they could have managed to pull off the visual look - the movie "The 5000 Fingers Of Dr. T" managed to have live action Seuss-like visuals that worked. But in THIS movie, it looks horrible. It looks artificial, way overproduced, and to make matters worse the green and pink lighting makes it look even uglier than it was originally.Maybe if they had made this a 100% computer animated movie, they could have pulled off the visual look... but there would still be a bunch of problems, mainly with the script. The Whos, except for Cindy Lou, are a bunch of cold-hearted ugly-looking creeps - you'll actually wish that the Grinch succeed in his plans to ruin their Christmas. The story moves at a snail's pace, due to the writers feeling they had to put in a lot of back story. Further evidence of the writers' desperation is that they take several elements of the 1960s Chuck Jones' version of the tale and replicate them here.Carey tries - he is pretty enthusiastic in his performance - but even he becomes quickly exhausting to witness. But he's not to blame here - blame the director and the writers for shoving him and the rest of the movie down our throats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like most of Hollywood production. At least, in this very film, they don't hide their origin. Well. and in MY CIVILISATION, this is not what we call comedy or fun. It is just revolting, and boring at that!. Go ahead and rent the Grinch. Go ahead and please watch How the Grinch Stole Christmas.Around 20 minutes into the movie you will be sorry you did. I love dark comedies, I am a fan of violent over the-top movies, and I have seen some of the most perverse horrible flicks ever released (i.e Cannibal Holocaust). I liked Cannibal Holocaust to a degree, but no other movie has ever disgusted me as much as this, with the exception of Carpenters Vampires.Why did I hate this movie? It is physically upsetting to watch, all the characters scream and rant and are so blatantly stupid and idiotic that this movie probably gave me an ulcer! No other movie has ever upset me as much as this movie did, Some fans of the Grinch portray it has a satirical depiction of suburban life, or human nature in general. It is nothing but an excuse to show some of the saddest excuses for comedy the writer had: dog faced freaks, some of the most annoying children ever cast on film, and characters so hateful and one dimensional you cannot manage one ounce of sympathy for them.I know that is the point of the movie, to showcase these male headcases and make a statement about suburbia. But much like vampires, the characters are so dark, misogynistic and downright stupid that it takes away all the enjoyment of the movie. The point of movies is to entertain, or at least get something out of the movie.I walked away from Cannibal Holocaust, Tetsuo, Pink Flamingos, The Killer and many other violent, bizarre movies entertained and fascinated. I walked away from the Grinch physically and mentally upset with myself, my girlfriend and the world in general...a real gem of a movie Anyway: I'm really tired of this politically correct brainwashing in almost every flick, all those democratic Oscars winners. IMDb - well, new censorship, at its best. We need more films on holokaust, yeah ! There should be only one nation ! I give up on you Hollywood.But then again... where can I possibly go ?

		<fullReview>Yes, Jim Carey is fairly brilliant in what he does and how he does it. However, this is not the "Jim Carey Show", it's supposed to be about the Grinch, how he attempted to ruin Christmas and how in the end he finds redemption and all with appropriate humor applied. Not so here. This is, apparently, about Jim Carey, by Jim Carey, and nothing else but Jim Carey. Hence why for the last few years he hasn't been involved with anything noteworthy. People get very tired of someone who's ALWAYS "on". Same thing happened to Robin Williams. You may be the star of the picture but you are not the picture itself, or you shouldn't be. You are merely the performer hired to perform the material handed to you. The 1966 TV animated version is much better because of three things: the animation of Chuck Jones based upon Dr. Suess's characters, the adherence to the actual story and of course the profound narration by Boris Karloff. Watch this latest "grinch" along with Carey's Andy Kaufamnn "tripe" if you dare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Ron Howard usually makes wonderful films; 'Apollo 13', 'A Beautiful Mind', and I even liked 'Willow'. But he seems to have taken an off day for the big-budget Dr. Seuss adaptation 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas'. 'Grinch' is a mess, drowned in special effects and gaudy production design, and it completely misses the point of the original story.Howard does something here I would never have thought possible: He makes Jim Carrey unfunny. I am not kidding. Carrey is just NOT FUNNY. Oh, he gives it his all, milking every joke 'til it's dry, but his performance, I am unhappy to report, falls flat. It's truly depressing to see a great comic actor in a spectacularly bad role.The overcompensating script by 'Roger Rabbit' authors Jeffrey Price and Peter Seaman doesn't help matters. It tries to 'explain' the Grinch's antisocial behavior. I admire the effort, but that's just not a good idea. The movie does have one good thing in it: Taylor Momsen, who steals the show as Cindy Lou Who. Momsen is the only actor in the movie who understands what she's doing.Howard piles on the sap in the final act, and I groaned more than once during those last 10 minutes. Ron Howard: What happened, man? 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas' is a disaster.</fullReview>

VERY Dr. Seuss. So nice for the little kiddies. What the h--?!!!Because Dr. Seuss' wonderful rhymes were largely tossed aside (as they were NOT in the TV show.)Because everything sweet and meaningful about both book and TV show were essentially raped and converted into a typical modern-day sleaze-and-toilet-joke-fest.Jim Carrey was OK, but buried in make-up and swamped by this awful rendition.

		<fullReview>`Dr. Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas' (2000) *Out of **** This is a movie that everyone wanted to see and they left wishing they hadn't. I used to be a Jim Carry fan but after a while he is just another irritating, overpaid actor. The main character in this film is, without a doubt, Jim Carry, who we all thought would be perfect for the part. He is a lot less than perfect. He put so much craziness in the Grinch that he killed the character. It wouldn't have been so bad if the whole movie didn't revolve around him but when the main character is in every scene and the actor kills the character, there is nothing left. When this happens you look to the director but then when you realize that the director is Ron Howard you know you are severely in trouble. He just is not enough to save a film and there were no supporting actors good enough to help him. How can you call this film `Dr Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas' when that plot doesn't start until an hour into the show? In the first hour they attempt to give a little background on the story but it doesn't help the viewer learn anything. Then at one point in the middle of the film the plot is solved when everyone loves the grinch. He then is reminded of his childhood trauma and again turns into the grinch, why not end it there? Instead they take it to another level. This, finally is Dr. Suess' version. The part that I don't understand is that it didn't fit with the first part. The movie could have been a lot better if the would have just left it with Dr. Suess, but instead Ron Howard made his version and then used Dr. Suess. It can't work and it didn't. If you are one of the few who didn't see it and you are under 5 or over 80 go see it; otherwise I don't recommend it.  </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me say that making this movie was an abomination to the meaning of the story, and, unless the quality was good enough to overcome such feelings, the people behind this project have their hearts two sizes two small.I hated this movie. As much as I love Carrey (his one bad movie is Ace 2), this movie should have reigned him in just a little, and yet used his talents. But, alas, Ron Howard couldn't say "no" to a superstar. The movie then had the difficult job of stretching the small book into a feature length movie. This is difficult, but it could have been done, maybe in musical style or some other way.The movie seemed to want to become a musical, but it didn't. It had the "i want to be a hit single," sung by Cindy Lou Who "Where Are You Christmas?" While I really liked the song, it was unnecessary, demeaning, commercialized, and insulting to my intelligence. I think that the song should have been the intro to a musical version of The Grinch or something.Another thing that is bad is the whole new plots. The actual book really doesn't start for an hour. They spend almost an hour on WHOLE NEW MATERIAL. Once the actual story comes into play from the book, the movie is actually quite good, but before then, bleh. First, they make the Whos greedy. The Whos were never greedy. They had lots of material items because they could, but they never embellished their happiness on them. Their happiness came from their heart and from the Spirit of Christmas, not from anything else. Next, they gave The Grinch a traumatizing childhood. I don't know if this was added as a response to the Columbine shootings, or if they just were trying to attract more groups, but it DIDN'T WORK.So, the movie's first hour sucked. The movie also lasted too long. It was TWENTY MINUTES LONGER than South Park. It had less plot or storylines to keep it moving, and it dragged its feet and plodded along. There was so much that could have been cut out, the childhood memories, the unnecessary chorus-leader thingy, etc. CUT IT DOWN IF YOU HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SAY PEOPLE.THE GOOD NEWS: Ok, I guess that I liked Carrey acting like Carrey, to a point. It just would have been so much more endearing in a different movie. The styles were fantastic, along with the devilishly cool camera-work. The whole movie is almost over stylized, but so were Dr. Seuss' books. If anything, go see it for the sets, the angles, the hairstyles, the clothes, Carrey's make-up, etc. Its the only reason to go to this waste of celluloid.2/10</fullReview>

Here he selected to be the wacky wacko Carrey. Although he's brilliant, but NOT THIS TIME ! The whole deal is so strange; metamorphosing everybody's image transformed the movie's world into big monster for ever mysterious reasons ! So, it's not your typical fairytale's soft drawings but, in the same time, not a wild black comedy or a satirical take on our modern life's towns and people either ! This movie suffers from just too much of everything bad I suppose : hideous make-up, repellent lenses, nasty humor, in one word this is not the way to make a kids fantasy, it's the new way for making pure ugliness under the name of novelty, uniqueness, whatever. And even with the wise tone of (Anthony Hopkins) as the narrator nothing could bring any balance to this kids' story which gone queer. Even as a drama it's lousy; ask yourself simply why the lead got changed at the end ? Clearly for nothing but the movie makers' desire ! In fact they expended all the time, the efforts, and the money for building this huge crappy set pieces, and forgot about the story, relying on the fact that the audiences will laugh and be dazzled more than to think : aka Hollywood everlasting mean trick, but that was out of the question, because I didn't laugh, be dazzled, and more than once I found myself thinking furiously "what the hell is that ?, what they were thinking ?, is it the Dadaism ?, am I having a good time? HELL NO FOR THIS LAST ONE ! This is undoubtedly the worst of (Ron Howard) yet, frankly it looked more like it was directed by the twisted Grinch himself ! P.S : my review's title is a phrase has been said by one of the movie's characters, and once I heard it, I found nothing better than it to describe the annoying time that I was having.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched How The Grinch stole Christmas. It's a good entertaining movie to watch this year. Ron Howard represented this colorful movie to his father. He remade this 1966 classic. Jim Carrey was chosen to be The Grinch. I think Jim Carrey was kind of odd and stupid in as the Grinch, but quite liked the clothes and the background made out by Custom Design and Art Direction and I found out that the Christmas meaning is not only the presents. It's about love. Family gets together for this wonderful Christmas every year. Family and family they sing the songs and eat foods. Christmas is for everyone including Grinch. Grinch looks ugly. People hate him and laugh at him. Grinch is just like those weak people in the society. May be we have to love them more. That's Christmas Soul !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey...you should have taken it to a pure comic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey plays the famous Grinch, this sounds promising! Anthony Hopkins is the narrator..and Ron Howard the director, oh yeah, a nice Christmas movie this has to be! It's very idyllic, it's very charming, it's very nice all over...the only problem is; the moral actually! The Christmas moral with the Who people gets a bit too much, I don't know..it gets too much baby stuff, sorry to say it but..well, it is a pity. Jim Carrey does his performance as the Grinch beautiful, very nice! He shimmers him so...evil in a good way..so..very good actually! Very good! But..Carrey should have breaken threw and done this to a pure comedy with many laughs instead of just some laughs. To put it this way; the movie is very entertaining and nice with Carrey on the screen, but instead of that it's just okay. Mr. Grinch he is called...look, well..the movie doesn't entertain that much when it is more about Christmas spirit and taking care, than a lovely Grinch grinning and sniffing like a angry dog or something. If you haven't seen the movie, it's okay, but: The Grinch is a very Christmas coosy movie..and it's very worthy to see! But don't expect a ordinary Carrey hilarious movie.

		<fullReview>I am surprised that anyone DID like this film, as there was much I was disappointed with. The few highlights for me were the costumes / sets, which had some clever ideas, and the twist of a capitalistic / materialistic townspeople who have lost sight of the potential of the holiday. I thought Cindy Lou Who's acting was disappointing, as was much of the writing, especially the poor additions to Dr. Seuss' original poetry - it was VERY clear to me what was added. Also, I think the changes to the story didn't serve it well for the most part and were not well thought out. Carrey as the Grinch didn't have a lot to work with but I think he did the best he could - there were a few moments I couldn't help but laugh. Overall, I think they chose cheap glitz over substance, a good story, acting or detail like so many Hollywood cookie cutter films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Seuss's charm came from minimalism, a unique sort of theatricality that could be filled in by the reader/listener according to the sophistication of their own imagination.It was a minimalism in the story. Only one simple thread around which you could impute your own world. Trampled on here with all sorts of extra stuff as if our own minds didn't world.It was minimalism in the verse. Some scant remnant of that remains, buried deep in ordinary, vapid dialog.But most of all it was minimalism in the drawings. Those drawings were an anti art nouveau which started clean but ended excessively ornamented. Each line was a joke on itself, a self-referential comment on how the mind likes to take the simplest thing and can't help from elaborating until human limits are reached.His homeopathic style depends on this phenomenon and his simultaneous joke about it. It would require a rather clever and skilled art director to get behind that and realize it for film. What we end up here is `Hook,' except the strutter here is Carrey instead of Williams.The team that did `Casper' might have been able to pull this off. I don't understand why when they spend gobs of money, they don't spend part of it on a designer with vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Ron Howard Ruined The Grinch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After viewing "The Grinch," there's little I can say positive about it. Personally, I've seen Ron Howard and Jim Carrey do better. This film takes away the main point of the children's classic and Chuck Jones' memorable television special. It's not the gifts. So why doesn't anyone in Whoville know that? Of course, you can't cram a half-hour animated classic or a short Dr. Suess story without using a creative license, right? And, ya see, sometimes that license should be revoked. This film focuses on the Grinch himself. What exactly makes him tick anyway? What's beyond that cheaply-woven costume and the yellow contact lenses? It's as if they turned "The Grinch" into a psychology film! It states that the Grinch was originally an orphan who grew up under two sisters (?) and decided to leave for Mt. Krumpet after being humiliated in class by the pudgy kid (the soon would-be mayor). Now, remember that cartoon they would run on NBC on Saturday Mornings once a year? The one where the Grinch meets the Cat in the Hat. Now then, the Grinch had a mother in that show didn't he? My point exactly. More faults - classic lines which made the book and the animated special classics are now gone and Cindy Lou Who who was originally two, appears to be at least eight here! This movie really was a huge disappointment.I do not recommend it for those of you who have grown to love the traditional Grinch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>HOW RON HOWARD AND JIM CARREY STOLE MY MONEY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh, good, Ron Howard and Jim Carrey are getting together for a remake of the Grinch! This is going to be movie magic. I loved the Grinch on TV! What-a-dis-a-point-ment! I usually love Ron Howard directed movies. And Jim Carrey movies are some of my favorites. This movie never gets off the ground. For starters, the town's people just don't translate well from the cartoon form. The mayor is just boorish and boring. Cindy Lou-who, so cute and innocent in the cartoon, has too many silly lines and dull scenes. I never bought the idea where the Grinch is honored by the town. Ron Howard should have realized that many people who take their kids to the movie, also watch the movie with them. I guess the standard set by the beloved cartoon could not be met by the movie. The movie sets are more goofy than charming, and so is Jim Carrey's performance. He had his moments, but weighed down by a bad script and a bad costume, he failed to add to my holiday cheer. You're a bad one, Mr Grinch!</fullReview>

The Whos are great and resemble the characters in the original story. Instead of a silent film with nothing but a narrator this one has acting and i did like the touch. It shows kind of the history of the Grinch and the other whos involved in his hate for Christmas. It does a good job at that. But is it as good as the original?? I don't think so, but what is out there today!If you want a holiday movie to get you in happiness tears and reminders of your childhood watch the original Grinch. If you want a great holiday laugh, watch Ron howards How the Grinch Stole Christmas. 6/10*</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A loud, chaotic, unrealistic book adaption that I only got through because I was reading something at the same time. Only seven minutes in do I realize that this is going to be a long morning. Noisy, unreal scenes abound the first 20 minutes, with "people" (or whatever the "Whos" were) running about town, practically throwing their money at a store clerk and dashing off, then people crowding a post office counter in hyperspeed yelling for assistance. Then the introduction of Carrey, the title green geek who's constantly contorting his mouth and inflecting a Sean Connery like accent. You thought Carrey mugged in other films? Oh, man, look out here. Twisting, turning, dancing, putting emphasis on meaningless dialogue. Which is another glaring issue. How could you not take classic lines from a book and make a good movie? Cuz writers Price and Seaman have severely altered the original story, and left only a few bits from the book for Anthony Hopkins to narrate. The new material just isn't funny or interesting, and the characters too cartoonish to enjoy. The singing interludes are painful as well. Plus the Grinch is pretty sinister. Who knows why any kid would go for this. Everything was put into production design and making the Grinch as depressing a villian as possible. I'd bet there are portions that would probably scare kids, especially the moment where a little girl is trapped in a machine which is about to squash her with a packing lable. Released during the key Thanksgiving thru Christmas period helped it make $259 million bucks. But I was glad to see the budget was $123 million so their gross wasn't as great as it could've been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Visually this is beautiful, they stay with Seussical architecture and the Who look for makeup and costume. Hopkins does a wonderful job as a narrator, which won't surprise anyone.But don't bother watching it to see that. It's not enough to make this a worthwhile viewing experience. When you see this, you'll see elements of why The Cat in the Hat tanked at the box office. They don't how to take a short animated feature and extend it to the length of a movie, and in adding to the story, they add garbage and ruin it.Adding to that is Jim Carrey once more forgetting he's supposed to be playing a new character (the Grinch) and instead repeats a performance from his past (the Mask). Makeup and costume doesn't change that fact. I liked the Mask, but this is a different movie and a different character. A real actor wouldn't give the audience a repeat of old material. Stay with the animated version to experience the Grinch and the Whos. You'll get the best version of this story.</fullReview>

The pacing is wretched. the first 50 minutes seemed to say nothing and go nowhere. Perhaps that's the catch of doing a feature-length movie based on a book written in under 500 words.Jim Carrey makes a perfect Grinch when he isn't being Jim Carrey. The other characters were fun. I would of liked to have seen more of the town activities and imagination. The setting was perfect. They brought who-ville to life.

		<shortDescription>Ugly and lifeless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing more distasteful than a movie that helps perpetuate the very evils it supposedly tries to protest. With this live-action How the Grinch Stole Christmas, for instance, we have a movie that, like the original cartoon, tries to launch a thinly veiled attack on the American consumer culture. But this movie is a product of the very same ridiculous excess that Seuss tried to discourage. It is one of the most expensive movies of all time, to the extent that it may just barely turn a profit if it makes more money than any other movie this year, but a huge portion of its budget is completely wasted. Why hire such expensive actors if you're going to hide them behind those awful rat-nose prosthetics? Why hire the $20 million Jim Carrey and then render him unrecognizable with 40 pounds of latex (and do half his performance with CGI anyway)? Why even make the movie in the first place with a script this grating and unbearable?Watching the film, I got the impression that it would have been infinitely better if it had been directed by Tim Burton. Just look at Edward Scissorhands, or his stop-motion masterpiece The Nightmare Before Christmas--Burton clearly understands the bittersweet 'feel' of Christmas better than any other filmmaker in Hollywood. But then, of course, I realized why they went with Ron Howard. They obviously approached Burton first, but he replied, "A live-action version of the Grinch!? Are you guys NUTS?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful slapstick version of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The live action Grinch is so over the top it makes the eruption of Vasuvius which burried Pompeii look like a tea candle. It has so much unnecessary slapstick "humor" that the 3 Stooges seem like the height of sophisticated humor. It is like getting hit in the face with a 100 lb sledge hammer. The delightful story we are used to is gone except for a few minutes near the end. The Whos are made out as stupid nit wits who are more interested in how much they can spend on gifts and what they will get in return that I really didn't care if the Grinch did steal Christmas. The only decent, feeling Who is the little girl, Cindy Lou. The young actress playing her is wonderful. The only other decent character is Max, the dog, and he steals the show. Jim Carry is NOT the Grinch. He is simply Jim Carry in a green fur suit with lots of make up. He does not know when to pull back and let the story work. He always goes way over the line. But this is also the fault of director Ron Howard. He could and should have made Carry pull back.To give credit where it is due, the make up, set design and special effects are excellent. Unfortunately, the children today, raised on the violent cartoons of Saturday morning TV, will think this is the real Grinch and the classic tale will take second place to this misconceived mess. It will, no doubt, make money and be shown over and over on TV in future years, but it will NEVER replace the wonderful original book and cartoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Abysmal, overblown Hollywood tripe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This quite possibly the worst movie Ron Howard has ever put his name on. I live action film based on Dr. Seuss's book would have been a good idea, if it had been executed better, and by a director more skilled at this type of movie.Ron Howard is not an untalented director, but this is not his type of film. He is not gifted at this type of "whimsical fantasy," and it shows. His effort at making this film work is apparent, as the sets and makeup are all very impressive, and evocative of Seuss's original illustrations. Ultimately tho, for all his effort, Howard's attempts to make all the disjointed parts of this film work falls short.The main flaws with this film lie in the script by Jeffery Price and Peter Seaman, and Jim Carey's misguided performance as the Grinch. By expanding upon the story of the Grinch, the screenwriters could have done a much better job. As it is, the fleshing out of the Grinch and Cindy Lou Who ends up coming off trite and forced. I'm guessing the intent was to create sympathy for the Grinch, but his new backstory is rather cliched and comes off as uninspired. The expansion of Cindy Lou Who's character is an admirable attempt to create a focal character at the other end of the spectrum from the Grinch, but by the end of the movie, despite the admirable attempt by Taylor Momsen, Cindy Lou Who has become a fairly annoying and irritating character.However, the true failure of this film lies in the hands of Jim Carrey's dreadfully awful portrayal of the Grinch. Almost 180 degrees from the character's origins, the sullen, grumpy Grinch of the book and cartoon is replaced with a wise-cracking goofball who just happens to hate Christmas and the Whos. The transition does not work. Most of Carrey's scenes seem like they are meant to be funny, but end up being grating and unpleasant to watch. The Grinch is so annoying in this movie, I find myself completely untouched when he has his change of heart at the conclusion. Carrey's performance is irritatingly over-the-top, never letting down for a moment. This is not the Grinch I know, and as a result, it doesn't work for me. Carrey is definitely trying his best, but given the awful characterization of the Grinch he had been given, there's not much he could do to make the material rise above its own underachieving level.Overall, the film is unpleasant and not entertaining. Watching it is more like an endurance trial than watching a movie. I would not recommend this to anyone, especially anyone who loves the book and classic cartoon.My Rating (out of four stars): BOMB.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of Grinch was a nasty feast I couldn't stand in the least.This full length high budget extravaganza really has little to offer beyond what the classic cartoon already did so well. Truly, the only good moments are those that are directly taken from the original story. The new material that is added here is simply a montage of misguided, mean-spirited, over-wrought highly intense noise; led by the master of hysterical yelling and screaming for no reason whatsoever, Jim Carry. No moral, no insight, no creativity, no entertainment value. We get some long-winded flap-trap about how mean the Whoville residents are to Grinch. How everybody else disturbed him emotionally etc. etc. ad infinitum, ad-nauseum. Be on the lookout also for subplots about some of the Who's, that are unnecessary, unfunny, and inappropriate. Christmas spirit does not exist in this movie (except in the portion that retreads the original story). Kids will be bored, adults will be annoyed. Any fan of Dr. Seuss's work will be offended.The actress playing Cindy Lou Who is about the only positive in this film. I realize she was a no more than two, and a nice character, but I kept hoping she'd push the Grinch off a cliff and mercifully end this disaster.Your heart will not grow three sizes the day you watch this. Stick with the classic cartoon.</fullReview>

And this must be Ron's version of what a Tim Burton film should be, because much of the design is just plain creepy. While what had been a charming and heartfelt Christmas story here has turned into a frenetic, obnoxious parody of a holiday film now not fit for children. The original cartoon version is a MUCH BETTER version for children. Theodor Geisel (Dr. Suess) must be spinning in his grave somewhere and I can't imagine Mrs. Geisel (who approved this project on behalf of the Suess/Geisel estate) was thrilled with this film.

		<shortDescription>This movie is nasty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard directed this? The 1966 cartoon is charming, teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, self-centered Whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is movie magic. Much like Danny Devito's Penguin in Batman Returns, Carrey's Grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates. Where the 1966 cartoon featured a Grinch that we could all identify with, Carrey's Grinch is that angry, soulless old man that we've all seen at one time or another, sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane. This Grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity, humor, or insight whatsoever, and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false. The whole movie rings false: there is some stupid Christmas lighting competition, a failed attempt at explaining why the Grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood, and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the Whos have that weird lip extension and some of them don't. Contrary to the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine children would find this movie tiresome, irritating, and filled with contradictory messages. Did we really need to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. Throw in the requisite butt jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes, and other obligatory Carreyesque low-brow humor, and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon (or book that inspired it) as George W. Bush is from rational, lucid thought. Thumbs down on this big fat turkey.</fullReview>

Some of theother characters were good in their roles but if Jim Carrey had not been in this film it would have bummed out. Never the less the movie it self had a very interesting storyline but could never compare to the all time Dr. Suess classic. I realize they had to stretch thestory out in the movie considering it was an hour and a half long movie instead of a half an hour cartoon and they did OK. So if you haven't seen this movie yet see it if you like Jim Carrey because he did a fantastic job playing the grinch in this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas was a wonderful little Christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy, I never did see the reason for a remake. Not to mention a remake that was made with humans, the cartoon was just perfect enough, what's the purpose of this film? But it also seemed a little odd for Jim Carrey to be the Grinch. I mean he's a great comedic actor, but him as the Grinch? It just didn't make any sense to me. His performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments. Not to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not enjoyable. The whole story of the Grinch and Cindy Lou-Who was over done and wasn't needed. They actually just destroyed the story, period.All the who's in Whoville are getting ready for their best Christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly. But Cindy Lou-Who is curious and worried about the Grinch that lives above them and that he's not going to get as good of a Christmas as the other who's. He kicks her out and decides that he doesn't want Christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal Christmas all together to show the who's what his version of Christmas is all about. But soon he realizes that the who's may know that it's a little bit more than what is the materialized version of Christmas.How the Grinch Stole Christmas wasn't needed and was a bit over the top. I really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version, at least in my opinion. The make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done, not to mention that How the Grinch Stole Christmas! was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring Jim Carry. But at least this version makes you grateful for the Boris Karloff version that is played every Christmas.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tale of humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie some years ago. My wife told me that I hated it. During the years since I have learned much about trauma and the resultant impact on those who have suffered from trauma. It is blatantly clear that if a young life is rejected and unloved, there is a significant impact on that victim. I have read so much about how this story is about the spirit of Christmas but from my viewpoint it is a story about how a society cannot tolerate a person who is different to them. They scorn, they reject and push a person away. This generates anger in the recipient, imposed by that rejection.That a young girl identifies the Grinch's vulnerability is a view of a compassionate mind. She understands his vulnerability and seeks to heal. While the Grinch has become accustomed to being rejected he, himself, does not understand either until she encourages him to return the Christmas gifts to the village and, at the same time, exposes the village mayor as a self centered ? err? arse?The story, whether realised by Ron Howard or not, is a tale of our current society that cares more about protecting ourselves and rejecting others that are less fortunate. It demonstrates our own vulnerabilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Savour nostalgia and get ready to rhyme - the updated Grinch is a zany good time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all those who cherish the holiday season, there are many for whom it is worse than high treason. To understand all of those grumps, it's a cinch - just turn to dear Seuss' tale of the Grinch. But how to redo the cartoon classic, while avoiding a scornful mess most tragic? It seems that Ron Howard has deduced the way to make the Grinch shine in the modern day.He treats the source text with reverence and care, and set, props, and costumes beyond compare. The zany, wild energy makes perfect sense, with consumerist critique to amuse the parents. The obnoxious Whos are pristinely portrayed, with prosthetics and quirks to assuage the dismayed. Colourful, dazzling, a true privilege - The Grinch is still a Christmas film with an edge. To add depth to his lead and expand the story, Howard adds a childhood of woe most sorry And while a romance subplot may feel quite forced, it's maudlin enough to not feel too outsourced.But the real fun begins with our titular lout, whose charisma alone makes the film stand out. Jim Carrey's at his manic, contorting best; his wild riffs and improv are masterful jest. As the holiday hoopla verges on annoying, Carrey's WC Fields grumblings save it from cloying. Buried underneath a mound of green yak hair, Carrey mines pathos to ensure that you care. With his own (stellar) theme song and sickly Grinch smile, Carrey's at his most fun when flamboyantly vile. And for priceless one-liners to leave you reeling, look no further than Carrey's histrionic "I'm...FEELING!" And the second half setpiece, the great Christmas heist, is thrilling enough to fit modern zeitgeist. But for all of its flamboyant affectations, Howard's film warns against skewed expectations. The film finds its core with its sole doubting Who - precious Taylor Momsen owns Cindy, it's true. With gleaming eyes and screen presence triumphant, Momsen's charm helps make her song less redundant. As the piece's true villain, Jeffrey Tambour's superb, making his preening mayor a classic Christmas turd.It's rare to find a film so energetic - perfect tonally without seeming mimetic. Infectious sentiment with consumer critique: as a Christmas film, The Grinch is wholly unique. Steered by the serene tones of Anthony Hopkins, this Grinch is one live action update that wins. With wild laughs and no aesthetic compromises, Howard and Carrey will make hearts grow three sizes. For prime holiday fun without saccharine bliss dross... slide into the snowflake where Carrey Stole Christmas!-8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique gift from Ron Howard...brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely review a film that has more than 100 reviewers, but I'm going to make an exception here.I think it's brilliant! Most who really like it give the highest marks to Jim Carrey. But I'm going to give most of the credit to Ron Howard. It occurred to me while watching this that Ron Howard is one director who has contributed an unusually diverse body of work to American cinema. Everything from "Cocoon" to "Willow" to "Parenthood" to "Backdraft" to "Far And Away" to "Apollo 13" to "A Beautiful Mind" to "The Davinci Code" to "Frost/Nixon" to his current tale about "Moby Dick". The question with the Grinch film was how to make it relevant to adults, while still keeping the moral of the Suess story..and although it's nothing like the book, it does maintain that moral.And then there's Jim Carrey. Who else could have handled this role? No one. I couldn't help but wonder how much of his performance was scripted and how much was ad-lib.The special effects -- absolutely outstanding. The makeup -- remarkable. And all wrapped up in a film that is truly unique.I was interested to seen Christine Baranski ("The Good Wife") here. Somehow I missed that Anthony Hopkins was narrator.For balance, watch this film, George C. Scott's "A Christmas Carol" and Bing Crosby's "White Christmas".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very flawed but visually charming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not perfect, Ron Howard's Dr. Seuss's How The Grinch Stole Christmas is a dazzling blast of elaborate sensory overload and wildly inventive Christmas set decoration that it succeeds in whisking you along for its weird and wonderful tale pretty darn well. Howard's decision to go the live action route as opposed to animation was admirable, as it more than likely resulted in a much more daunting undertaking. The star of the film is the set design, starting with the quaint blueprint of Seuss's beloved book, and piling on decadent, surreal spectacle until we are presented with a world where every corner of every frame is a giddily cluttered piece of eye candy and raucous auditory nuttiness. Starting with the Grinch's lair on snow laden Mount Crumpet, a garbage encrusted haven of rickety inventions and off kilter lighting, to the loopy, majestically over the top town of Whoville in the valley below, every set piece is so overdone and buzzing with creative energy it boggles the senses. In that sense, the film succeeds glowingly. Now, on to the makeup. It's my only gripe with the film and one I can't get over no matter how much I try and look past it. This excludes the Grinch himself of course, they did a wonderful job with him, which I'll get to in a minute. The other Whovians, though, look slightly terrifying, and the decision to try and exactly recreate the way Seuss drew their characteristics, mayyy not have been the best idea. Little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) looks alright, but her dad Lou (Bill Irwin, the voice of TARS from Interstellar) and some of the other adults look very unsettling with their eerily upturned noses and clay set grins, like a drunk plastic surgeon had his way with them using only a cookie cutter. Then there's the baby Grinch.. Who I think was supposed to be cute, but ends up looking like something that a Mogwai would have a nightmare about. It's all in good fun though, and doesn't hurt the film too much, just a quibble I have. When one steps back and admires the movie as a whole, the positives outweigh the negatives. Jim Carrey must be commended for letting another funny, hyperactive performance shine through pounds of makeup plastered all over his face and figure. He never loses that spark that makes his presence so unique, and although great amounts of new dialogue and interaction that weren't in the book have been added, especially with his character, he still manages to retain that 'Seussy' outlook and vernacular (something that The Cat In The Hat failed miserably at, Mike Myers being the chief culprit). Carrey even adds poignancy to the Grinch's delicate, near manic balancing act of bitterness and hate, with a sweetness clawing to get out. That dynamic could have been suppressed into childlike simplicity, but he plays him at an adult level, to the film's advantage. The supporting cast is cool too, showcasing Jeffrey Tambor as the town's smarmy Mayor, Christine Baranski as foxy Martha May Whovier as well as Mindy Sterling, Molly Shannon, Clint Howard, Bryce Dallas Howard, Q'orianka Kilcher, Verne Troyer and a kindly Anthony Hopkins as the unseen narrator, the only person who gets to speak actual passages from the book. My favourite moment? The tiny, pint sized Who's driving around in their little football sized car. It's oddball little quirks that make the movie work and are its strong suits; a warm, weird sense of humour and endlessly creative visual palette that amp up the Christmas cheer dial to eleven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun family film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An entertaining family film. How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a good movie , what is most noticeable is the appearance. the Oscar nominated Production and Costume Design is great. The Oscar-winning makeup looks fantastic. The Cinematography by the late Donald Peterman is clever and inventive. The film is big , colorful and fun. Jim Carrey is in top gives an excellent performance. What is not as good is the script by Who Framed Roger Rabbit writers Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman. It has funny jokes. But not a good plot the backstory for the Grinch was unnecessary and not especially original. And i don't like the message. In the book and the original Christmas special "Try to be more like the who'sin your view of Christmas." In the film it is "Don't be like this in your view of Christmas." It is the difference between someone which gives a good advice on how to be and someone saying what shouldn't do. In the end is still a film that the whole family should sit down and watch at Christmas. It may lack in story. But it makes up for it in visuals and in Jim Carry's performance and there are worse children's films to see like Ulvesommer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The bottom line is that Jim Carrey made this film. Jim Carrey and the special effects that is. Jim Carrey as the Grinch could not have been a better fit! The special-effects and the looks of who Ville are spot on! Also Christine Baranski is perfect for Martha May! She really nailed her performance. And then you have Molly Shannon, who was very enjoyable here. The movie's script is OK it's not great but it suffices. Really all you have to know about this movie is that it's family-friendly and it's fun to watch at Christmas time, especially with young kids. It's also very family-friendly unless you are offended by a little crude humor. If you don't want to see that, or you don't want your kids to see that just beware that it's in there. Overall the Grinch is an enjoyable film with stunning visuals. That Oscar win was well deserved! 7/10 for the Grinch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the Grinch stole Christmas isn't great, but it's still enjoyable. Most of it comes from Jim Carrey, who steals every scene he's in as THE GRINCH! The girl who plays Cindy Lou is actually pretty decent, as with all of the actors in this film. The sets are pretty creative, so are the costumes, and the Grinch's makeup is pretty cool.Here are the downsides of this film: While the Grinch's makeup is spectacular, the Who's makeup are more creepy than cute. Also, some of the characters like Martha May and the Mayor of Whoville seem a little uninteresting and a little forced. Plus, some of the cinematography in this film is poorly handled. It's constantly moving and so you don't get to enjoy the sets as much as you want to. Finally, when the Grinch is stealing the presents, it feels like it's fast forwarding towards the end. That whole scene should have been a little slower and should've had played the "You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch." song in it.But all in all, the movie is still enjoyable even if it has problems. While the original cartoon is better than the live-action film, I still recommend it to people who love Jim Carrey, because he has a ton of fun in this film. Is it good? No, but it's not bad. It's a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Who, Not What, but Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With such an iconic 1966 animated 1/2 hour special, it's hard to imagine a reason to reimagine it as a live action movie. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. I'm not particularly angry or hate this. It's just that I couldn't stop asking Why? This one gives a backstory to the origin of the Grinch. He gets delivered by mistake to Whoville. The kids bully him because of his looks. In frustration, he runs away to live on the mountain. Now he is a fully grown loner. Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) is searching for the meaning of Christmas. She tries to see the good in the Grinch, and keeps trying to bring the spirit of Christmas to him. But the Grinch just can't get into the spirit.I don't have a big problem with the additional backstory or the greater role for Cindy Lou Who. That's to be expected for an expanded Grinch. And Taylor Momsen is a perfectly good child actor. But none of it excites me. The visual design is again expected but without the outlandishness of 'The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.' for instance. However it is still great once we get to the last part where the Grinch tries to steal Christmas. All the sentiments are there voiced especially by Cindy Lou Who's father. That part still works. Nothing can change that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ten years later, and I finally see this once over-hyped movie. The common theme with the banter about this movie was usually that "I can see Jim Carey" in the Grinch. In fact, there is little to no Carey, it's almost all Grinch. What I mean is the way that they made the Grinch a real thing truly did the story justice. They focused on the story, not the special effects - they didn't lose any of the whimsy in the process. You will feel for the Grinch, you will feel like you are in Whoville, and you will feel the true spirit of giving at Christmas.I really enjoyed the movie, it is simply adorable. I don't think they could have done a better job with it. This is an instant Christmas classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so impressed with this version anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this full-length live action adaptation of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" (one of the many classic children's books that Dr. Seuss is remembered for) in late 2001, the year after its theatrical run. I was a teenager at the time, and remembered the book and the 1966 animated TV special very well from my childhood. I definitely was impressed with my first viewing of this live action film the first time I saw it, and it didn't seem to wear thin with subsequent viewings, even though I certainly didn't find it to be nearly as good as the cartoon. This Christmas season, I have revisited both the 1966 short and this 2000 full-length movie. I still think that classic TV special is a little gem, like so many others do, but this version is far from it.Inside a snowflake, there is a town called Whoville, and in this town, everybody loves Christmas. Just outside their town, up on Mount Crumpet, lives a bitter hermit known as the Grinch, and his dog, Max. The Grinch hates Christmas and is greatly feared by the Whos. However, Cindy Lou Who, a little girl in Whoville who feels that the true meaning of Christmas is missing in the town with all the materialism she's seeing around her, is curious about this despised creature that lives up on that mountain. She asks other Whos who once knew the Grinch what they remember about him, and learns a lot about how he became the hateful individual he now is. Feeling that everyone should be together for the holiday, and that this creature can change, she then attempts to befriend the Grinch, inviting him down to Whoville for the Whobilation. Thanks to her, he has been nominated the Cheer Meister for this event. Will Cindy Lou Who's plan work?One reason why I don't care much for this version is Jim Carrey's portrayal of the Grinch. During my latest viewing, I couldn't keep a straight face through ALL his antics, unlike when I watched Carrey in "Batman Forever", but for the most part, he's still not funny here. I also found the characters in general here to be bland and not so likable, especially the nasty Mayor Augustus May Who, who can be perhaps a little annoying at times. I also think the flashback sequence showing the Grinch as a baby is a notable weak segment, with the "Santa, bye-bye" and such, and that's certainly not the only one. Basically, I just found the movie overall to be deeply flawed in a number of departments, and totally lacking the charm of the 1966 short. There are some mildly amusing moments, as well as some occasional touching ones, plus the visuals are very impressive and I can't complain much about Anthony Hopkins' narration, but these things are not enough to make up for the lack of heart in this adaptation. Not EVERYTHING fails here, but unfortunately, the vast majority of it does.This polarizing live action version of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" led to the making of another live action full-length adaptation of a classic Dr. Seuss book, "The Cat in the Hat", and that film's reception was generally very negative, which is understandable! The third full-length movie based one a Dr. Seuss story was 2008's "Horton Hears a Who!", this time not a live action film but a computer animated one. I said in my review of that film that it was PROBABLY the best of the full-length Dr. Seuss adaptations so far, but now I'm going to have to take that back and say it's DEFINITELY the best of the three! Clearly, live action doesn't work so well with these Dr. Seuss classics. It's been eight years since the release of the "Cat in the Hat" movie, and it seems there's still no sign of another live action Seuss film coming, which isn't a bad thing. I don't know how the upcoming CGI "Lorax" adaptation will turn out, but at the moment, I can say the "Horton Hears a Who!" adaptation is the only good one of these previous movies. This version of Dr. Seuss' Christmas story is not as bad as its 2003 follow-up, but was still unnecessary, and I would say you're better off sticking with the classic TV special to put you in the Christmas spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truth Be Told... I Like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ron Howard's interpretation of Dr. Seuss' classic "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" retells it in a sort of modern way. It draws a lot of influences from both the original book and the classic short from Chuck Jones.The basic premise is the same, the creatures called Whos all love Christmas, but The Grinch does not so he tries to ruin it by taking all the decorations and presents away. But there are a lot of tweaks they did to expand the story. This movie goes into detail of The Grinch's past, as a child he had a crush on a young girl Who and tried to impress her during Christmastime. But all the other kids laugh at him causing him to eventually snap and take out all of his aggression on the holiday. Not the best origin but it could've been a lot worse.We also get a sort of contest the Whos do every year at Christmas called Whovalation, which Cindy Lou invites the Grinch to. Without giving too much away(for those select few who haven't seen the movie yet)these scenes can either be viewed as a interesting interpretation of the original story or be seen as a blatant attempt to make the movie longer than an hour. In fact the Grinch doesn't don his infamous disguise and steal the presents until the movie is thirty minutes from finished.This movie is either a hit or miss for most people. For me, I thought for what it was it was a pretty good movie. Sure they could've toned down the adult humor(compared to Cat in the Hat though, it's nothing)but they did manage to capture the spirit of the book by the end of it. Jim Carrey does an acceptable performance of The Grinch while giving his own comedic flair into the character(which again is hit or miss). The rest of the supporting cast does well to give the movie a unique feel. The visuals of Whoville and Mt. Crumpit are very pretty and feels just like a live action Dr. Seuss book.Overall this may not be a movie everyone can enjoy but if you take it with a grain of salt and get past some of the crude humor you might have a good time with it. I've liked it ever since I was a kid and it continues to be a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It deserved the "Razzie" award for worst script...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of money was spent in turning this Ron Howard production into a full-length feature with JIM CARREY as "The Grinch," but I'll take the 1966 animated version any day over this overstuffed fantasy.The director obviously gave Carrey license to "go for it" with some moments of comedy enough to produce a few chuckles, but Carrey's lack of restraint reaches manic proportions before the film is half over and his sickly green and grotesque make-up is an unappetizing sight to behold in those huge close-ups. The film (at all times) strains too hard to be a quirky imitation of the original Dr. Seuss cartoon and is simply not up to the job. It's a mess. Furthermore, none of the supporting characters are more than mildly entertaining. TAYLOR MOMSEN is a lovely little girl but she can't sing and she substitutes a look of placid, wide-eyed wonder for acting while Carrey heats up the screen with his overacted mugging. CHRISTINE BARANSKI has a flair for comedy but she's been seen to much better advantage in other roles and looks more than mildly uncomfortable as the woman secretly in love with "The Grinch." Actually, most of the time she looks as though she can barely tolerate looking at him.There's a perky background score, some over-luxurious sets, some ghastly looking costumes for the Whoville residents, and the overall feeling one gets is that the slim plot has been expanded to the point where it overstays its welcome. The over stuffing doesn't just apply to the sets and costumes and special effects. The script tries to set up a flashback of "how" the Grinch became what he is, but it has a dulling effect that only succeeds in slowing down the ponderous pace of the film's last hourThe script rightfully won a "Razzie" as worst of the year, so the blame can't be placed entirely on director or star. My advice: If you want to do justice to Dr. Seuss, do it with animation and not live actors.Summing up: Not a shred of charm. It's as if "Opie" meets Tim Burton.</fullReview>

For one, there was too much padding applied to the original story to make it into a full length movie. The glitz was distracting, the build up as to why the Grinch was grinchy was long and unneeded, the side stories weakened the main plot (ex: the hikers climbing up the Grinch's mountain, the mayor's competing love interest, house decoration contest, the Grinch winning the award...) The reviews are much more positive than the overall rating. I think the rating is a more accurate indicator.

I feel an hour would have been plenty for this film. The music was also a bit much for children. I understand that movies these days have adult references to keep parents interested but I feel there are hardly any movies just for kids anymore. Having said this, Carrey pulls off almost a Faegen-gone-mad character from Oliver Twist with a humorous twist only he can provide. The make-up people did an incredible job with his facial mask without inhibiting Carrey's multitude of expressions, they poured through his eyes, nose and mouth without inhibition. In the end? I think it's a great flick for 9 years and up, mostly we parents get a kick out of the humor intended for us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diverting festive fare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the UK, perhaps the most well-known Dr. Seuss book is "The Cat In The Hat" (filmed in 2003 with Mike Myers), but in America the best-loved and most widely read Dr. Seuss story would probably be "How The Grinch Stole Christmas". Here, director Ron Howard takes the classic story and, with the help of an energetic Jim Carrey performance, transforms it into a diverting film experience. However, considering Howard's track record as a maker of excellent and moving films (e.g Apollo 13, Cocoon, EdTv, etc.) this is rather lightweight stuff. While it is fun to watch, and energetic, and diverting as mentioned, it is not a film that lingers in one's mind long after watching it. Rather like Christmas wrapping paper, it looks pretty and you have a fun time tearing into it, but ultimately it's something to be disposed of without much afterthought.In the town of Whoville, the Whos (residents) are preparing for Christmas. It is a time of year they love, going to extreme lengths to buy mountains of presents and trim their houses. One little girl who questions if all the hullabaloo surrounding Christmas might be a bit superfluous is Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen), daughter of the local postal worker Lou Lou Who (Bill Irwin). Cindy Lou figures that Christmas shouldn't be about who buys the most gifts or who trims their house most spectacularly.... somewhere deep down inside she senses that Christmas should be about love, family and community. Overlooking Whoville is a large mountain which is home to a grumpy, hate-filled green creature called the Grinch (Jim Carrey). The Grinch famously hates everyone, but more than that he hates Christmas (since it was a Christmas-event-gone-wrong which drove him to turn his back on Who-kind). Condy Lou decides that the time has come to give the Grinch a chance to make amends with the Whos - and vice versa - but her friendly gesture backfires and the enraged Grinch plots to ruin the festivities by stealing everyones' presents.Carrey's performance as the Grinch is amazing, both for his manic physical energy and for the skill with which he conveys numerous emotions from beneath so many layers of make-up. Likewise, Anthony Hopkins uses his lovely Weslh lilt to provide the film with a classy narration. While the remaining performances are competent enough, none of them really stand out in a spectacular way. The set design by Meredith Boswell is also noteworthy, bringing the town of Whoville vibrantly to life. There seem to me to be two principal flaws with the film. First is the fact that the story is incredibly thin, with little to sustain a running time just short of two hours. Second (and most damaging) flaw is the heavy-handed, sickly-sweet preachiness. It's a sad thing if people have really become so self-centered that they've forgotten the honourable values associated with Christmas. But this film lays on the sentiment too thickly to convert those people into a better way of thinking. People who DO hold traditional values don't need a message like this ramming down their throat; and people who DON'T hold traditional values won't buy into this kind of sugary preaching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i hate this film. a lot.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i hate this film. it has to be the worst film i have ever seen. even Bakshi's attempt at Lord of the Rings was better, that was bad in a laughable way, but this is bad in a painful and annoying way. i managed to get through it, but only just. firstly, Jim Carey as the grinch does not work. i suppose jim carey is rather like marmite, you either love him or hate him. and I'm afraid, no offence to the man himself but i fall into the latter category. although normally he is tolerable, in Bruce Almighty for example, i actually began to like him. however, in this film the grinch was loud, annoying, and spouted bad jokes at every opportunity in an annoying Jim Carey-ish way.i suppose it is not entirely his fault, but the fault of everyone involved in this film. bad script writing etc. anyway, i wont pretend to know what I'm talking about, i just really hate this film. and especially the grinch himself. i suppose that is the desired effect.. but still. bad film. very bad film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the Grinch stole Christmas is a horrible adaptation of one of the most beloved books by children.This movie completely ruined the book.There are other movies derived from books that are just like this, but this is the worst.As a child this was one of my many favorite books but this movie killed the book.This is the worst movie I have ever seen.Mortal Kombat:Annihilation is a Masterpiece compared to this crap.I regret watching this movie.It is not even worth being called a movie.I like Jim Carrey's movies.I'm a big fan!I also love Ron Howard as a director.They're both great!I'm surprised that this movie didn't ruin both of their careers.Don't watch it if you are a fan of Dr. Seuss' books.It'll crush your heart.

		<fullReview>The Concept: Seuss...or so Howard would have us believe.The idea is simple. Don't worry about plot, don't worry about tone, don't even worry about the Seussian dialect. Just create something with astounding design. How could Howard screw up such a simple task?Easy. He chooses a "comfortable" crew rather than a "visionary" crew. Even 'Dune' comes away better designed than this. The best directors know the importance of competent production design comes into play, so they make sure to manipulate it properly in their best works. Kubrick knew this with 'Lyndon', even Cameron with 'Abyss'. I guess the fact that Howard can't translate simple visual stories like this shows that he shouldn't be making movies anymore.The story, acting (including Carrey), and everything else are just jokes. Even the music.My prediction: Howard's version of the 'Da Vinci Code' will have the Moral Majority (his usual supporters) so enraged at him that he won't work again. At least that's how it should be...Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just came back from seeing Mike Myers in Cat in the Hat. Terrible piece of work, no further comment is necessary. But our local newspaper's film critic seemed to like it and compared it favorably to Jim Carrey's Grinch, more or less saying that Grinch was a terrible adaption of Seuss.Well, I remembered Grinch a little more positively, perhaps because I found Carrey's performance particularly outstanding. By and large, you have to pay me to watch Carrey, he's just not my cup of tea. But in Grinch he was perfectly cast to be the stinky old curmudgeon Seuss intended.I dug out of the closet my kids' copy of the movie, watched it again, watched my kids' faces while they watched along and came to this conclusion: The movie captures the spirit and texture of the good Doctor. Carrey and the cast of Whoville take the audience on a fantastic journey through the Christmas experience and succeed in delivering Seuss's message, God bless us, everyone. Merry Christmas!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't compare this to the original cartoon. Nothing can compare to the cartoon. If you come into the movie expecting the cartoon, you'll be p****d off at every minute that passes in this movie. If, on the other hand, you just come in expecting a holiday movie, it is actually quite good. Not the best, but still good for the whole family. Everyone knows the story about the Grinch, unless you've been stuck under a rock for the past fourty or so years. The original story was about the Grinch, a green, furry guy who lives on a mountain above the town of Whoville. Every Christmas, the Whovillians throw massive Christmas parties and celebrations, much to the dislike of the Grinch, who hates Christmas. He tries to steal Christmas by taking away every decoration, present, etc. He learns the true meaning of Christmas as the end, and a few other things happen, but that's it. It's a short story overall. Then they try to make a movie out of it. In order to make it run at least 90 minutes, Ron Howard had to add a lot of plot and such. The Grinch is also given the typical Howard-treatment; he hates Christmas because of a traumatic experience during a Christmas party as a kid. This completely contradicts the original story, which has him hating Christmas because he doesn't understand the meaning and thinks it's nothing more than a bunch of noise. Jim Carrey, however, does a pretty good job as the Grinch; there were a few faults, but we don't know much about the Grinch anyway, so it deoesn't matter as much. Rather, all the problems fall on Ron Howard's shoulders. What seperates this from other holiday movies of its ilk, however, is that effort actually went into it. It seemed like everyone really wanted to make a good movie, and even though it doesn't match the cartoon, it's still an enjoyable experience. So please, don't just compare it to the cartoon; just judge it as a movie itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Grinch is a good movie. Having said that, I'll now tell you why.Jim Carrey has done some bad films. This isn't one of them. He's played some bad parts. This isn't one of them. He's played some great parts in great films. This is DEFINITELY one of them. Carrey plays the Mean One to perfection! Of course, that really expensive, really realistic costume didn't hurt, either.Taylor Momsen is (or at least was as of The Grinch) a newcomer from the great city of St. Louis. She performs superbly in quite a large role for a 7-year-old first-timer. The only way Cindy Lou Who could've been better is if she was animated.Anthony Hopkins is no Boris Karloff, but he still gets the job done wonderfully. Hopkins has incredible range, as demonstrated by his ability to sweetly narrate a Christmas movie and viciously portray a canniballistic genius murderer.Ron Howard did a great job with this thing. Obviously, the original story wasn't long enough to make a feature-length movie, but the extended version by Price &amp; Seamen, along with Howard's directing, is almost as good as the cartoon version, and nearly as good as Suess's book.Great holiday movie. That's basically all there is to it.Whether or not you liked it, feel free to review it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the Grinch stole what could have been a good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas is based on the childrens book by Dr. Seuss. In this live action film, Jim Carrey brings to life one of the most beloved stories of our time to the big screen with the direction of Ron Howard. The plot is taken straight from the book with a few creative liberties along the way. Inside a snowflake exists the magical land of Whoville. In Whoville, live the Who's, A munchkin like species that all love and adore Christmas. Yet just outside of their beloved Whoville lives the Grinch. The Grinch is a nasty, green creature that hates Christmas, and plots to steal it away from the Whos which he equally loathes. Yet a small child named Cindy Lou Who, decides to try befriend the Grinch and teach him what Christmas is really about. What is probably the most interesting aspect of The Grinch is the cinematography of Whosville that Ron Howard brought to life. It would be very hard to live up to Dr. Seuss' standards in the book, but Whosville itself in this film is basically the only delight you have while watching. Jim Carrey does fit into the Grinch well, but too often we get an Ace Ventura vibe. Now I ask myself even in dramas why Jim Carrey always seems funny, even when he's acting serious, why is this? In the Grinch at times he seems calmed down to a certain degree, but the longer the camera rolls the more he starts to act up and eventually we can just picture Ace walking in that snow instead of the Grinch. One other thing I disliked is that in the cartoon the Grinch never talked much, but in this version all the Grinch does is talk. Of course both these films were taken off the book, but I still think Jim should have shut up half the time instead of rambling and doing wacky and crazy movements (like Ace.) The humor itself consists of only a few funny lines. In one scene the Grinch is sitting looking through his 'schedule' and is saying something like '1:30 Loathe-2:30 Have lunch with myself..I CAN'T cancel that again! 3:30 Feel sorry for myself..' And the scene basically goes on like that. I think that is probably the funniest scene in the film, and if you don't find that funny, you will hate the Grinch. I first saw this film in the theaters and expected too much. Perhaps that is why when I viewed the video release I enjoyed it more. If for some reason you do want to see this film, just don't expect it to be great and you might enjoy it more.  I wouldn't recommend this film unless you're an absolute fan of Dr. Seuss and in your opinion 'must see it.' Other than that, avoid the Grinch's good looks and charm, because there is not much of it in the film. 2/5 starsJOHN ULMER</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not really all that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So much invective, so many hurt feelings on this one. Bad press and word of mouth followed this movie around like the plague upon its release at Thanksgiving, 2000. On one level, of course, I can understand it; "Grinch" certainly didn't need the big-screen, live action treatment - the simple half-hour cartoon is, and always will be, a classic unto itself. But exactly because that version is in no danger of going away or being forgotten (or - perish the thought! - replaced), I for one was able to be more generous and forgiving when watching this movie. Oh hell, I might as well admit it - I watched it at all pretty much explicitly to see what Jim Carrey was going to do with the lead role. On that score, I was not disappointed; he took the basic character sketch that is the Grinch and embroidered it with all manner of tics, impersonations, and over-the-top shenanigans. As usual, if you're no fan of Carrey - and broad humor in general - there's nothing here that will convert you. Me, I'm constantly astonished by his resourcefulness and creativity, as well as the almost superhuman energy he brings to every role. Here it's especially impressive, as he coaxes a pulsing life force to come through layers and layers of prosthetics. In fact, it occurred to me, watching the film, that if anyone could be a modern day Lon Chaney, it would be Jim Carrey - I could see him making a good career out of bringing life to a rogues' gallery of monsters, grotesques, and other costumed or heavily made-up characters. It would in fact seem the natural extension of his talents and inclination; if there's ever been anyone constrained by the notion of being a "normal" person, it's Jim Carrey. But by the same token, no one - not Jack Nicholson in Batman, not Christopher Lloyd in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, not even Paul Reubens as Pee Wee Herman - has seemed so at home projecting the weightlessness and exaggeration of a cartoon existence more fully than Jim Carrey. This is no easy trick by any stretch of the imagination, and I hope for all our sakes that he'll always at least keep his hand in this style of performing; there's many who can do "realistic" acting (in varying degrees of quality, of course) - there's precious few, maybe no one else currently alive, who can do what Carrey does.As to the movie itself: is there anything here beyond Carrey's performance that makes it worth seeing? Not really. But then again there's nothing that really gets in the way, either. The sets and the basic look of the movie are reasonably well done: nothing overtly memorable, but not the ugly and barren wasteland many reviewers have suggested. Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou-Hoo is suitably cute in her part without being insufferable (and on that score let's not forget that even Dr. Seuss's Cindy Lou was impossibly precious and saccharine in the first place) and she develops a nice rapport with Carrey that helps anchor the film. The backstory which "explains" the Grinch and how he became that way . . . well, yeah, it's stupid, but it also doesn't take up much time, so if you just twiddle your thumbs for a few minutes you can get through it without too much pain or discomfort. But many objected to the film on the basic grounds that its portrayal of the Hoos was an abomination; that it took the simple, good-hearted creatures of the Dr. Seuss original and turned them into lunk-headed and materialistic busybodies - in essence, caricatures of Yuletide soul-lessness and consumerism. Personally, I think it's an interesting change. Seuss's heart was always more with Grinch's cynicism and disgruntlement anyway, so it makes sense to pile on those qualities in an extended treatment of the story. Furthermore, while the Hoos as paragons of perfect virtue and simplicity works OK in a 22-minute treatment (especially one where we don't see much of them), there's something fundamentally false and unsatisfying about it. After all, even in the original tale, these people *are* pretty ostentatious and materialistic in their celebration of Christmas. It makes sense to me that they - just as much as the Grinch - would need a reminder in what the true meaning of the holiday season really is before they would lovingly burst into song at the prospect of a Christmas without any presents or decorations. And, of course, this makes them closer in conception to the average American, and thereby more identifiable and accessible (if necessarily less admirable). Especially since, as I've said, this new version doesn't wipe out the old one, I think the change in the Hoos is utterly defensible and adds an interesting wrinkle that the film can truly call its own. So that's the Grinch, circa 2000 - no big whoop, but no big travesty either. And if you like Jim Carrey, another notch on his belt of impressive performances. That's really all you need to know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a spin-off from a 22 minute cartoon show, so now if you didn't like the show because you didn't get to see much of the whos. You may go for this. The movie's narrator is Anthony Hopkins. And we learn very early in the movie that the Grinch hates Christmas. We know that he hates Christmas, in less you have never seen the animated cartoon. Little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) is the daughter of the town's postman. The Grinch (Jim Carrey) lives up on a mountain top looking down on Whoville. The Grinch even hates the christmas loving whos. Jeffrey Tambor plays the town's mayor. Who tells the people of Whoville "There is no Grinch problem here" after a couple of kids, go up the mountain of the Grinch. When Cindy gets stuck in the mailroom where the resident's mailboxes are, the Grinch's dog Max (Kelly with the voice perfomed by Frank Welker) makes him save her. From then on little Cindy Lou bleives that the Grinch is not all bad, just mistaken. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard's version of "The Grinch" is a bloated, over the top Hollywood induldgence and would be utterly forgettable if it weren't for Jim Carrey's amazing performance. Apart from Carrey's screen time as the fascinating Grinch, this movie is more or less typical commerical fare, not particurarly original and quite noisy. However, when Carrey appears, the film changes into something completely different; wild, unpredictable and impossible to ignore. In the DVD collector's edition Carrey explains that he's was basically "buried alive" on a daily basis in the Grinch make up and costume. The results show in his acting, which is manic, possessed and in the end, quite ingenius. I'm not sure what the Academy looks for anymore as far as award winning, but Carrey's turn at the Grinch certaintly deserved at least a best actor nomination. My favorite Grinch moments are when Carrey interacts with Cindy Lou, the obligatory "big budget family film 'cute as a button' child actor." WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD; My favorite dialogue is when Carrey says, "Saving you? Is that what you think I was doing? Wrong-o." And when he finally agrees to become Holiday Cheermister he tells Cindy, "I don't know if its that adorable little twinkle in your eye or that non-conformist streak that reminds of a younger, less hairy me but you've convinced me." Carrey's pulls off some other wonderful zingers throughout the film; with the mistle toe, "Now, pucker up and kiss it Whoville." When he's terrozing the town, "Oh the who-manity!" And also when he rides his sleigh down at a crazy speed, "We're gonna die! I'm gonna throw up and then I'm gonna die." But the classic segment (also featured on the CD), is Carrey reciting the Grinch's schedule, "4:00 wallow in self pity, 4:30: stare into the abyss, 6:30 dinner with me. I can't cancel that again." As far as the non-Grinch scenes, they are well acted but under written. And the actress playing Cindy Lou is sugary sweet and highly annoying. The part where she sings is almost unbearable. In the end though, "The Grinch" succeeds because Jim Carrey loses himself in the role. The original Seuss grinch in the 1960's cartoon was a riot, the ultimate villain you love to hate. Carrey shows that even as we enter the new milennium, Dr. Seuss created one of the coolest, most unforgettable rebels in history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as it could have been.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I would like to say that this really isn't that bad a film. You've got to respect the makers for the amount of effort which has obviously gone into it even if the final product wasn't so good. Having not seen the original animated version I believe that I am able to give an un-biased opinion of this. Personally I think that Jim Carrey is back on top form with his highly amusing and eccentric portrayal of the Grinch. Admittedly some of the gags do the miss the mark but many hit the target full on and I found many suprisingly adult considering that this is a children's film. At this point in time I would like to congratulate the make-up department for their flawless effects and daring to make the big star of the film completely unrecognisable. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. As a child i watched the cartoon. When i heard it was being made into a movie, i flipped. And when i heard it had Jim Carrey as The Grinch, i just lost it. The vision of Whoville is amazing, a big WoW to Mr. Howard and friend's for that creation. I really liked the way that they gave the history of The Grinch as well.Even though this movie was made for kids, i still loved it. And although there is so much that is good about it, the only thing i didnt like was the way that they made the grinch an all-the-time snotty bully. The whole scene of the Town Party could have been more child-friendly also. But overall it was excellent. I'd give it a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The old Grinch is still better, but this new one is quite funny and entertaining. Jim Carrey really delivers the role, often slipping into the laughs of his other famed characters. The maniacal attitude and stagnant bitterness makes him the perfect Grinch. The supporting cast does very well, including Cindy Lou Who and her family and friends, but Carrey is the real star here. Every now and then, there are moments that will just crack you up. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the genre, and Jim Carrey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I feared, the story didnt hold. It might work as a 20 minute long cartoon, but not as a full-length motion picture. The plot is simply to thin and drawn-out. It circulates around the Grinch, a green monster whos terrorising the peculiar citizens of Whoville. He simply doesnt enjoy Christmas, but a sweet little girl tries to change his mind.Positive things about the movie are the set-pieces, costumes and the effects, they are well-made. And Jim Carrey, of course. He is perfect as the Grinch, even if his performance reminds a little too much of his role in "The Mask" at times. But the funniest scenes are definitely the ones with Carrey and his charmy dog. The rest of the characters are extremely irritating and thin, with the possible exception of Taylor Momsens Cindy Loo Who. If I got to decide how the movie ended, the citizens of Whoville wouldnt get any presents at all. But its not my call, and here we are with a hopeless movie that claims to be about the true meaning of Christmas. Which is, apparently, the presents.2/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you don't like this movie, then YOUR heart must be two or three sizes too small. This movie is very beautiful and perfect for the holidays. Jim Carrey gives a performance that should be praised highly! It is a grand performance and it should be recognized as that. The adorable Taylor Momsen is perfect as Cindy Lou Who: She's very cute, but not to the point where it gets on the audience's nerves. The rest of the stellar cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, and Clint Howard) is absolutely awesome! James Horner's musical score is so warm and heartfelt, and it really adds a lot to the movie. The elaborate production design is something you must see to believe!If you're in the mood for a hilarious, well-acted, well-written, and drop-dead gorgeous movie to watch with your family on Christmas Eve, then this is the one to pick up!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First let me say that I love Ron Howard. I also appreciate Jim Carrey. I've seen the half hour animation every Christmas my whole childhood. The way this movie was blown into a feature length film was fine. Most of the added stuff fit with the characters and story established in the original. But it was a little too loud. Sometimes, way too loud. The sets were incredible and the make-up was great, but it's much easier to sit through a half hour than two hours plus. Still, you can do worse for a holiday movie.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) Rating: 8/10Christmas movies, by and large, are movies you need to watch through a child's eyes. They tend to be feel good, gooey, sentimental ventures, and the cynical modern man might want to look down on all that. But then... It's Christmas, darn it, happy happy joy joy is what it's all about. And then again, there's the occasional Yuletide tale like Dr Seuss' classic Grinch book which cheers you up while remaining a bit edgy. After all, it does revolve around a character who DOESN'T like Christmas, and who takes it upon himself to steal it away from the Whos of Whoville. Of course, as we all know, the Grinch will end up realizing that the holiday spirit isn't something you buy in a store and his heart will grow three sizes, but before that he does get to instigate mucho mayhem and revel in his own evilness, and that's gotta be cool... Especially when the Grinch is portrayed by Jim Carrey in a manic (even by Carrey standards) performance!But then again, what was a perfect story for a little book with lots of pictures or a 22 minute animated TV special can't possibly sustain a feature length picture. Hence, director Ron Howard had to bring a lot of new stuff in, and for the most part, he succeeded beautifully. What he did was spend a lot more time with the Whos. In Dr Seuss' book just a bunch of odd looking people who dig Christmas, but in Howard's version, they're regular people who just happen to have snouts and live in a gorgeously designed, Tim Burton meets Candyland style town in a snowflake. They can be mean and selfish sometimes, they cheat on their wives, they are careless... And when Christmas time comes, they get lost in the stockings and ribbons and presents and decorations and shopping madness, and sorta forget what it's all about. Something little Cindy Lou Who is aware of, and she wants to do something about it. The way she sees it, how good can Christmas be if there's a Grinch left out in his mountainside lair? She feels that in the spirit of the season, the Whos should try to include him.But who is the Grinch anyway? Here's the other place where Howard expiates the source material, by giving the Grinch a back story. Not only was he born with a heart two sizes too small and green fur all over, but it turns out that he got picked on in grade school, that he had a crush on a classmate but only made a fool of himself and chose to leave the world behind and go immerse himself in resentment and self-loathing in the town dump. Mmm, I know, it's a bit annoying how there's always got to be a damn Freudian motivation to everything, like oh, the Grinch was humiliated on Christmas as a kid, so now he hates the whole thing, and he's even gonna steal it! As for the stuff with the Whos, it sometimes feels like just what it is, filling, but then again, how can you complain when the movie is such a marvel to be seen! I often found myself in awe before the wonderful images Howard shows us. Whoville, with the endless holiday decorations, the cute little pastel houses, the countless lights, the bright colors, the snow... Then the Whos themselves, who are very peculiar and colorful in their own right, with the bizarre make up job that gives them snouts and big teeth.Last but not least is Jim Carrey's Grinch, who lights up the movie every time he's on screen. Sure, there's the brilliant make-up job done by Rick Baker, hiding Carrey under all that green fur, a doggish face and yellow eyes, but what's really surprising is that Carrey still comes through, as if he truly morphed into the Grinch's skin. He remains exceptionally expressive and natural, and Carrey is free to chew up a whole damn lot of scenery and be gleefully mean, playful and sarcastic. For a harmless little family film, the movie can be quite offbeat and laugh-out-loud hilarious, especially in the scenes where the Grinch is by himself in his cave being self-conscious about his state of reclusion, arguing with his echo and going around hating intensely the Whos, alphabetically! If only for Carrey's hyperactive, larger than life performance, this How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a must see, but even beyond that, it's a fine Christmas film that will delight kids and grown-ups alike.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ghastly remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why is it that Hollywood moviemakers seem incapable of understanding the simple fact that works that start off as drawing art (be they in the form of stills or animated cartoons) have a tough time translating to the live action format? It didn't work with `The Flintstones,' for instance, and it works even less well with `How the Grinch Stole Christmas,' Ron Howard's labored and lumbering attempt to bring the whimsical Dr. Seuss classic to the big screen. Unlike the beloved half hour animated version made for television in the 1960's, this non-animated edition ends up burying the wise and witty tale under gobs of overproduction. Despite the best efforts of the costume designers, set decorators and makeup artists in bringing the Grinch, the Whos and their village of Whoville to life on the screen, the sad fact is that what appears charming on the two-dimensional printed page can often become grotesque when transferred to the more three-dimensional world of live action filmmaking. Even more detrimental than the film's garish visual style is the fact that the beautiful simplicity of the streamlined tale has been padded out and stretched to the breaking point to fulfill the demands of a 105-minute running time. Although the film adheres fairly closely to the original plotting in its final third (even using a portentous recitation by Anthony Hopkins of Dr. Seuss' original rhyming text), the first hour or so is overloaded with dreary subplots involving the various Who characters, a silly flashback showing how the Grinch came to hate Christmas, and enough Jim Carrey shtick to make us wish he had never left `In Living Color' to embark on a movie career. Much as I have loved Carrey in some of his earlier filmic efforts, I must say that his act is fast losing much of its original freshness and charm. Not that he can be forced to shoulder all the responsibility for the film's failure, since the writers, Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, have neglected to provide a single line of witty or creative dialogue to go along with the stunning makeup, art direction and special effects. It's a particular embarrassment when the screenplay shifts between the soaring ingenuity of the Seuss poetry and the flatfooted triteness of the Price/Seaman prose. The grinding of the gears becomes almost audible. One wonders why an industry, which used to do so well by Christmas in the past (`It's a Wonderful Life,' `Miracle on 34th Street,' the various versions of `A Christmas Carol'), seems to have had so much trouble lately putting together a decent picture with a yuletide theme. In fact, in the past 20 or so years, Hollywood has managed to produce only one holiday film that can truly be called a certified classic. I am speaking, of course, of the wonderful 1983 film, `A Christmas Story,' the only work that has been able to successfully combine the gentle cynicism of the modern world with the sweet sentimentality one traditionally associates with the holiday. Perhaps that perennial delight will forever stand as the one exception to the cold crassness of overproduced and over-budgeted dreck like `Jingle All the Way,' `Santa Claus ? the Movie' and `How the Grinch Stole Christmas,' which, by their very nature, drain Christmas of its childlike magic and charm. Now more than ever, `A Christmas Story' is the yuletide tonic we yearn for and need.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd never heard of this story before (probably because I'm from Europe), but I must say that I was immediately dragged into it. The film (I do not know about the book) really captures today's dealing with Christmas as being about gifts and presents, whereas it clearly should not be. At least the film does so during the first 30 minutes and the last 20 minutes or something. The rest of the time is filled up by Jim Carrey's usual goofing around (in a Riddler manner) and I felt that was pretty much of a shame, because the film could have been so much better if it had stayed focused on the main theme and would not have focused on Carrey's grimaces and stunts. It is just that Jim Carrey can overdo it sometimes and most directors just let him (why oh why???). I mean let him bring some character into that Grinch, I know he can do that.Anyway, besides the costumes designers, set designers and makeup people on this film there was also one person on screen that really impressed me. It was little Cindy Lou ? Who (Taylor Momsen). I mean she was just so sweet and charming it was really mostly her acting that will get you into the TRUE Christmas spirit. And remember: If anyone tries to ruin Christmas,don' t give in an inch Cause everyone likes Christmas, even the Grinch7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delightfully faithful adaptation of Dr. Seuss' children's classic story about a Tim Burton-esque outsider who decides to steal Christmas from the unsuspecting peaceful residents of Whoville when they treat him with fear and dread. Jim Carrey is perfectly suited to the lead role of the odious Grinch, while newcomer Taylor Momsen makes the most adorable Cindy Lou Who, the faithful little girl who decides that Christmas is for everyone, even the mean old man who hates everybody. It is to director Ron Howard's credit that neither the performances of the stars nor the fable-like production design overpower the simple magic of Dr. Seuss' story. Every time the story has the opportunity to be overripe and saccharine, Howard restrains himself and lets the charming (but somewhat hypocritical) message speak for itself: Christmas is more than just presents and commercial hype (please pick up your Grinch action figures and colouring books at the door). The production was also helped along by the supervision of Seuss' widow who had approval over the film's screenplay (and did make some major cuts during pre-production). Costumes are a complete delight, and the makeup design by Rick Baker is pure genius. Film's only weak point is the uncommitted narration by Anthony Hopkins, who tries but never EVER comes close to the hilarious menace of Boris Karloff's voice work in the original cartoon. A family-film must!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts as one of the greatest anti-capitalist/individuality films ever made; yet is not meant to be, and eventually falls flat on its face</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can tell you the exact moment when this film turns from being a great, dark-humored comedy into a typical American capitalistic piece of cow dung. It's when the Grinch gives in to being shoved around at the big party scene. Up until this point we are given some of the best anti-capitalistic monologue ever spoken on this (American) side of the Atlantic Ocean. The reason is that this character, the Grinch, is a perfect Mr. Cranky, or Scrooge, of the modern age. He is brilliant, and if nothing else this reveals just how brilliant can be some of the stock writers working in Hollywood when given the opportunity to vent their complaints against the conformed state of society, particularly Christianity, and our corrupt economic system, of which Christmas is the not-so-sacred icon.Had the Grinch kept it up, had he held on to his real life, dirtied and lie exposing beliefs until the end, the story would have been -- well, honest. One may have been able to place it in a favorable light next to such uniquely honest films as, say The Last Exit to Brooklyn, The Electric Horseman and The Magic Christian. But Howard of course is no where near these other, more earnest fellows. He's just another typical Hollywood cop-out, a conservative American who really believes that the 50s were "happy days" and the world would be a better place if we all just forget, for example, that a Panama invasion ever happened and instead concentrate on ways to make our nation a safe place to live for wealthy and middle-class white Christians. He's a lot like our new Republican president.And so, the cranky, brilliant Mr. Grinch is a villain, to be eradicated in the name of white consumer-capitalists with upturned noses. It is so disappointing to see him go, to watch as he gives in to being the phony-happy faced Master of Ceremonies. His unique, individualistic opinions could have been given more light instead. This would've been great wine for the Who's of Who-ville, and the rest of us Americans as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christmas Classic in the Making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How The Grinch Stole Christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing. Now, eight viewings later, it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time I saw it.Screenwriters Jeffery Price &amp; Peter S. Seaman of Who Framed Roger Rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of The Grinch to the screen. Ron Howard's direction brought the story to full life, and Jim Carrey's typically energetic performance as The Grinch steals the show.Some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story. Having read the original story, I must say I cannot agree. The movie makes the very same point about Christmas and its true meaning as the original story. Indeed, it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why The Grinch became what he was.*MILD SPOILERS* (They probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you... but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who wants to know NOTHING about a story until you've seen it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.)I think just about everyone can relate to The Grinch's terrible experiences in school. I think all of us, at one time or another, were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on. I know I was... and that's why I personally had so much sympathy for The Grinch and what he went through.And Cindy Lou Who's naive idealism, believing that nobody can be all bad, was heart rending. When everyone else had turned their backs on The Grinch out of fear and ignorance, Cindy Lou was determined to be his friend. If only everyone could have such an attitude.In fact, I think the only thing that might've made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content. It was already pretty restrained, but any of this adult humor (like when The Grinch slammed nose first into Martha May Whovier's cleavage) just doesn't fit in a story like this.This one's well on its way to being a Christmas classic, taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the Chuck Jones cartoon as a must-see of every Christmas season.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Carrey's finest moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I really enjoyed Jim Carrey's latest "serious" performances ("The Truman Show", "Man on the Moon"), I've always thought his real genious lies in physical comedy. This is not to say he is a fantastic, talented actor: those bozos at the Academy Awards seem to dislike him so much, he has never had a (truly deserved) nomination or award. Well, any "institution" that nominates for 11 Oscars a bore such as "Titanic" shouldn't be taken seriously.On with the review. "The Grinch" is the sweetest, best looking, best acted, more enjoyable seasons film since "The Nightmare before Christmas". Both movies seem very similar, too, with their highly stylized sets and the premise of someone stealing Christmas. Both make their principal actors seem like the villains (one in a higher degree than the other), both pack a strong moral lesson, and both are truly enjoyable.That is, until you realize that Jack Skellington is a doll, and The Grinch is a human being. But a human being that is so incredibly expressive, so fluid in his movements, so cartoon-like, so unreal, that never gets in the way of the movie. He can be hilarious, he can be a sad soul, he can be angry. He lives in a 3-dimensional world, where 3-dimensional people live. He jokes, he laughs, he cries, and ultimately he saves the Christmas. I loved this film to bits, and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. This is one of those films you will really enjoy 10, 20 years from now. As timeless as they come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reading the comments I think many of the people are trying to psychoanalize this one too much.

This is not a brillant movie but it is a good one and most will enjoy it. Will it become a Christmas classic viewed year after year and sell oodles in DVD? Hmnn I bet it will. The little girl who played Wendy Lou Who was excellent but could not sing and I found that to be part of her charm. Ron Howard's brother Clint as usual has a part in this movie (Mayors right hand man). There were comparisons to Tim Burton's work and the look was like something out of one of his movies but I think it was different enough to be uniquely Ron Howard (At least he did not let Danny Elfman score it!).

		<shortDescription>Carrey makes the movie worthwhile. Just don't expect magic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas is worthwhile for its performances, namely by Jim Carrey as the Grinch. I rated it a 6 out of 10. I am a big fan of Dr. Seuss' books and the original Grinch cartoon from 1966, and I had high hopes for this remake. However, I was somewhat disappointed with the movie. In particular, I felt that it could have been crafted a little better to be a "classic". After all, the story and characters are timeless. But a classic movie this was not. The pace of the movie seemed to drag a little bit, the town of Whoville (frankly) seemed a little boring and unappealing to me. There were also a few too many modern-day-Hollywood-like-add-ins in the movie which (in my opinion) dated it and detracted from its impact. I was also disappointed with the art direction and set design. The illustrations from the Dr. Seuss books and from the original cartoon are unmatched in their creativity. The movie dabbled a little, remaining true to the general feel of these designs, but it broke no new creative ground with its art direction and set design. Ron Howard has done some "great" directing in the past. His direction here was simply "good"--not his best work. But the movie is at its best when we are allowed to watch Jim Carrey as the Grinch. He was wonderful. His performance is perhaps even Oscar-nomination-worthy, depending on the competition. He is funny, menacing, sad and joyful; and I felt his character truly grew and developed throughout the film. Carrey makes the movie worthwhile. Just don't expect magic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The kids should definitely enjoy this one, so being an adult I feel a bit of a killjoy criticizing it. It's definitely got style and Jim Carrey is excellent as the grouch. However, I think it falls short of being a classic, which it could have been.It's hard to put my finger on why not, but I felt it lacked a bit of magic. The formula was all there, but there was something it didn't quite capture. Maybe it was to do with the sets for whoville. There was something about them that seemed as though they were a more expensive department store christmas display than a film setting. It could be that the supporting cast wasn't overly impressive - though this could have been due to the script. Cindy-lou borders on being irritating particularly when she sings. It's hard to criticize a child actor, but I think they could have cast somebody a little less irksomely cute.Perhaps it was the fact I wasn't convinced by the Grinch's conversion. Compare this to the way Scrooge is transformed in Sims' A Christmas carol - a far more dramtic portrayal. I just think the film could have been a bit braver as a whole, avoiding Hollywood conventions and making a bit less predictable. In addition, I didn't think it was particularly funny - maybe it wasn't supposed to be.All in all, despite the criticism, a competent children's tale, that less cynical beings should enjoy. But don't expect anything innovative. If I'm being honest, I think such a big budget spectacular would have been better in the hands of someone like Tim Burton or Spielberg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw it, and to be honest I really enjoyed it. There were parts that you could call simple story padding-mostly the young grinch scenes, yet I felt for the most part it moved along well and was quite well handled.Some of these complaints here are goofy. 'Film to dark'! Rubbish. The town is one big neon Ornament; the Grinch's lair is exactly what you'd EXPECT it to look like, at least if you have a clue as to what he's about.The little girl, I thought, delivered an Excellant performance, and if you put her alongside Haley Osment, she'd be Fine. She helps carry this flick, if she tanked, it would tank whenever Carrey wasn't there.He is great, perfect guy for the role. I like him in this about as much as I did as the Riddler and the Mask, it's really the kind of thing he does the best.Loved the heart shown at the end, the terrific F/X esp. the panoramic view of their mountainous world. It truly brings you into the Suess World.By all means check this out-it's not Great but it is pretty good-and well worth yer time.*** outta ****.The dog is good too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie, very, very well done and very funny. Jim Carrey is perfect as the Grinch, no one else could have pulled it off with as much humor as he did. The rest of the cast was very good, and the characters were very well defined. (yep, even Max the Grinch's companion) I liked the whole feeling of this fantasy, it looked very good and everything about it was done just like Dr. Seuss would have done it.-Great for the holidays-Happy Who-lidays (sorry i couldn't resist)</fullReview>

In a room packed with children and parents, my friends and I were the only all-adult group present -- and I think we laughed more than anyone. Jim Carey was absolutely outstanding in the title role, offering children and us children-at-heart new twists on the character that left me rolling in the aisle.

		<fullReview>I really thought this was a great film. I was expecting an average film based on the comments in IMDB but I was surprised by how good this film was.I think the purists are the people who criticize this movie. If you are expecting the movie to be exactly like the cartoon then maybe you won't like it. Of course if they kept it excactly the same it would be a short 20 minute movie.I'm glad they didn't try to make the movie exactly like the cartoon. I think some parts are better then the cartoon and this movie is certainly a lot more funny. They have taken the story of the original cartoon and added a lot more to it. If they had just done it like the original then there would not be much point in seeing the movie. This movie has all the charm of the cartoon, plus you get to see what happened during the Grinch's childhood that turned him into the Grinch.This film also had more humor then the cartoon. Some scenes were hilarious and some of the ab libs or creative ideas thrown in made the film very good. I'd give this movie a score of 9 out of 10 stars.If you like Jim Carrey, like special effects, or like to see creative films then see this movie. I've seen most of the new movies this year and this movie is one of the best films that has come out this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a delightful fantasy-comedy from director Ron Howard. The film, based on the classic children's book by Dr. Seuss, is a fascinating movie to look at. Jim Carrey makes his performance as The Grinch all his own. He was literally the perfect choice to play the unlikable hairy creature with a hatred of Christmas. Even though he's not quite as funny as he's been in some of his earlier films, he's still fun to watch. The supporting cast is good too, especially 7-year-old newcomer Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who, the adorable little girl who tries to bring out the sweetness in The Grinch. But I think the best thing about "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is the spectacular production design by Michael Corenblith, who worked with Howard on "Apollo 13". He and his art directing-set decorating team have made the town of Whoville come to live like you've never seen before. The look of Whoville is a feast for the eyes, and it's fascinating. Also excellent, the make-up effects done by multi-Oscar winner Rick Baker. He's responsible for creating the make-up job on turning Carrey into The Grinch, and once again he and his make-up companions do an A+ job. I sure hope the Oscar voters are paying attention to this movie, because both the art direction and makeup should get Oscar nominations. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a great film for the entire family, and judging by it's record breaking box office statistics, parents have been taking their kids in droves to see this. And well they should. It brought out the kid in me, and brought back memories of when I read the Dr. Seuss books when I was a child. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is fun, fun, fun. Only a few unnecessary vulgar jokes keep it from being perfect.***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie for kids AND adults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read a smattering of the reviews here about the movie and what really gets me are the adults who went to see it and state that kids wouldn't enjoy it. I went to see it the day after Thanksgiving and took three kids with me, ages 2, 6, and 9 and guess what? They all LOVED it. My 9 yo son and I laughed our butts off the whole time. My 6 yo daughter also enjoyed the movie a great deal. Jim Carrey was absolutely wonderful as the Grinch. His expressions and the way he moved were perfectly "grinch-y". I thought the humor was great and the narration very appropriate. My favorite part was the rendition of the song "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch". That really had me rolling. I think that the adults who went to see this movie and didn't like it need to really lighten up. Kids aren't interested in "acting ability" or "detailed storyline"; they just want to be entertained and the movie succeeded in that arena superbly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that up until now, I have always felt that the "Wizard of Oz" costumes and set design were the top of the line. Now that I have see the "Grinch", I must push the Wizard aside. The detail to the set as well as the costumes make this my new all time favourite. Even the egg nog cup on top of Cindy Lou Who was incredible. The liquid moved when she moved. Thumbs up for all sets and costumes. Ron Howard has given us his best effort to date. All segments keep the audience glued to their seats. Thanks for the great work Opie. (hope thats how you spell it) And last but not least, (but he who is last shall be first) Jim Carey has once again brought total entertainment to another level. He is just incredible. Thanks to Ron, Jim, the cast and crew. I truly believe this is going to be a classic. My only reservation is that I believe the level of humour might be above the comprehension of the little people. The 6,7,8, and 9 year olds will not understand some of the humour. I believe that the more mature adolescent and the adult kid (me) will appreciate the humour much more. But, the set and costumes will keep the little ones happy. Thanks to the Grinch, we can really enjoy some good family entertainment once again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good and funny film, if always not always as great as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey adds incredible humor to this, which could've been a dreary and stupid adaption of the classic cartoon and book, and is genuinely funny, which makes the film succeed on many levels. Christine Baranski and Jeffrey Tambor are also very good, as well as the supporting cast. Some minor qualms include the child grinch, which is played stiffly at best, and some of the liberties it took from the book. It basically includes all the essential elements, however, and is a very entertaining and funny family film. A lot of stupid children's films try and desperately show that they can be enjoyed by adults as well as kids, to try and increase their ticket sales. Every children's film I see advertised has some moron saying that it will be enjoyed by adults. The only kids movie I've ever enjoyed before this was Antz, and this works for everyone, not just kids. Perhaps thats why it did so astoundingly at the box-office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard's Grinch, in my opinion, sticks closely to the original concept created by Dr. Seuss. Dr. Seuss's Grinch was a scarry looking, mean creation until Warner Brothers made him a bit more "friendly". This film is not for the very young as Jim Carrey's Grinch will no doubt cause nightmares but for those 10 and up it's an enjoyable dark comedy with the usual zany antics of Jim Carrey.

Also, she'll discover that Christmas is a FAMILY and FRIENDSHIP birthday...Director Ron Howard (Apollo 13 - Ransom - Ed-tv) directs very well. Yes, Jim Carrey is Jim Carrey, but in his costume and his make-up (Rick Baker) make his character an other dimension. The camera of Howard multiplies travelling and panoramic. Jim Carrey is often in the camera to show us his  real  face... extraordinary.The film is coming very early, but the magic, the power of the art direction and set decoration are so fantastics and greats; the world of this city is like a dream, a dream of 120 minutes.Jim carrey is sensationnal; Ron Howard's directing is brilliant subject is cool and amazing... childrens and adults will adore</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while, a movie comes out that is so good it is hard to state what makes it so great. Let's put this way, I had high expectations for this movie going in. It exceeded them by leaps and bounds. Jim Carrey is Best Actor material for this role. It will take a whole lot to convince me that someone else is more worthy. It is his best role to date.The Grinch is the best movie I have seen this year, and I have seen a lot. Ron Howard deserves a nomination at the least for Best Director. If this movie doesn't win Best Costumes, Best Special Effects, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Score, and Best Sound then they should shut down the Academy. NOTHING WILL TOP IT IN THOSE CATEGORIES.Of course, it's commercial success and the fact that the Academy seems to hate comedies and what it feels are crowd pleasing movies seems to point to them ignoring it completely.It is funny, it is uplifting, it is Dr. Seuss brought to life in the way we always wanted it to be. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it has a smooth flowing pace.In short RUN to the theatres and maybe we can make this one beat Titanic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie much more than I expected to, especially since I was coerced into going. The STORY was essentially unchanged from the much loved book, and whatever additions which were necessary to flesh it out into a 2 hour movie were well done and not out of character. The VISUALS were beautiful and fabulous. The attention to detail was terrific and I will need to see it again to catch everything. I'm not one to fawn over Jim Carrey just because that's what everyone else does, but I have to say that he was absolutely incredible in this role. His body language is hilarious and he was a delight to watch. The little girl Who, Cindy Lou-Who is sweet and adorable. When she giggles while sliding down the shute I couldn't help but laugh along with her. I really enjoyed the way they put in the background story about the Grinch as a baby. The only drawback to this film was that it was a tad too long. Other than that I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent remake of the cartoon classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "The Grinch Who Stole Christmas" last night at a local Washington DC premier party. Overall... an great movie that will stand the test of time, much like the original cartoon special itself. Jim Carrey BECAME the Grinch, much like he throws himself into all of his roles (see "Man In The Moon"). Lots of ad-lib-style comments from Carrey as the Grinch provided chuckles. The first half of the movie explains how and why the Grinch became bitter toward the holiday season, and establishes the mayor of WhoVille as a villain in his own right. The second half of the film catches up to the familiar gift and tree stealing plotline from the original series, and fleshes it out with more scenes. The sets are incredible to watch, and don't be surprised if there may be times when you don't catch some dialogue because of the scenery.Taylor Momsen is delightful as Little Cindy Lou Who, the child who's persistence in discovering the good inside the Grinch, ends up saving WhoVille's Christmas. Jeffrey Tambor plays the thoughtless and subtly cruel Mayor of WhoVille to a "T", and the rest of the cast is excellent as well.Ron Howard also pokes fun at himself in several scenes, stealing notable images from movies such as Backdraft, and even having the Grinch direct his dog Max in a scene, wearing the same style hat that Howard wears when directing his films!I was surprised at the inclusion of two PG-13 style visual jokes (involving a female character's breasts, and a dog's rear-end), and for the parents of young children, these may be embarrassing moments that you may dread having to explain to the youngsters.But overall, The Grinch Who Stole Christmas is an excellent movie that reminds young and old of the true meaning of Christmas in a pleasant and charming way. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't be a Grinch! This live-action adaptation of the beloved children's tale by Dr. Seuss, wasn't that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand, why certain people might dislike this film. I agree that the live-action film didn't really needed to be made, and that the film will never outdo the original 1966's TV animation movie. Still, this movie directed by Ron Howard is not as bad, as people make it, out to be. Its way better than other live action Dr. Seuss adaptations like 2003's Cat in the Hat. Produce by Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment, based on the 1957 story of the same name by author, Dr. Seuss, the movie tells the story of the reclusive Mr. Grinch (Jim Carrey), who decides to ruin Christmas for the cheery citizens of Whoville by stealing all their gifts and everything holiday related. The only person that can warm his heart is the endearing Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) whom hopes to show the Grinch, the true meaning of Christmas. Because the film is based on a children's picture book, many additions had to be made to the storyline to bring it up to feature-length, including some information about the backstory of the titular character. Most of that backstory is pretty damn good, despite that the fact that it doesn't fit that well to the original story. Things get very confusing as Cindy Lou can't tell the different between Santa Claus's voice and that of the Grinch!?! How is that possible? I found it funny that the Grinch show his face to her, and she still can't tell them, apart. Is she really that clueless!? Another clueless person is the Narrator (Voiced by Anthony Hopkins). The Narrator speaks as if, he had no knowledge, why the Grinch is mean. It doesn't make sense. Did he not see that the Grinch was mock? Anyways, I still like the backstory. Remind me of the outcast revenge horror movies, just in a tamer kid movie. Sure, it make the citizen of Whoville look like materialism consumer jerks, but the Whos in the novel, didn't have much of a personality. It even gives us, more reason to feel for the Grinch. It made him more sympathetic, than pure unlikeable. The movie expands on the Grinch's character, actually creating legitimate motivation for his actions and a reason why he stole Christmas this year as opposed to any previous year, in comparison to the original story where he simply hated Christmas and randomly decided that after years of putting up with it, he would ruin it. I think this backstory, really gave the movie more emotional depth. Did it weakened the overall moral plot to an extent? Kinda, but it was really needed. Most audience members that saw this movie, had already readt the book in the past. So, most of them, knew coming in, what's going to happen. I think by adding depth, it made the movie a little less predictable and little more watchable. Don't get me wrong, the movie does have a lot of pointless filler scenes that run the time, a little too long. Most of the jokes in the film are pretty clever, and had lot of wit to it. Lots of pop culture references, wisecracks and insults, break the fourth wall humor, slapstick, gross potty humor, and wordplay and puns are some of the jokes, you'll see in this. Lots of adult jokes like sexual, ethic, dirty jokes, are mixed so well with childish humor under a PG rating. It's has everything for everybody, but it really depend on the parents, if they will allow their children to watch this film or not. Not everything is kid's friendly as there are frightens imagery. Most of the jokes for me, personal, hit the funny bone hard. I couldn't stop, laughing at how funny Jim Carrey makes it out to be. A lot of people might criticizing Jim Carrey's performance as obnoxious over the top. I find it, alright. After all, it's Jim Carrey. He's known for over the top, wacky performances before, where critics love him. I don't know what makes this role, any differ than Ace Ventura or Lloyd Christmas. I guess, certain people want the Grinch to be a one-dimensional Scrooge, rather a full-fresh out character. I also found the young actress, Taylor Momsen to be very good at her age. While, she didn't have the chops for a singing voice, she did carry the heart &amp; soul of the film with her performance. Most of the music in the film was pretty amazing to listen to. James Horner' score get you into the mood for the holiday. Faith Hill's song 'Where Are You Christmas?' awaken that Christmas spirit within you. Jim Carrey's 'You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch' isn't as good, as the original as he tend to overdo it with multiply voices, and volume tones, but it's funny as hell. Even some of early 2000's Boys Bands feature in the soundtrack wasn't as bad, as I thought, they were going to be. I still have mixed feelings about the production. The cinematography need a little more cleaned up. The sets are very beautiful, but you can't see it with all the mist and fog. I know, Ron Howard was really going for the winter type of weather, here, to make it look more surreal, but it's really distracting. Some shots like the CGI wide shot are really made well on the computer, but most of the footage film on the set, looks like it was film in a steam bath with a lot of muted gloomy colors. It doesn't mixed. The film won the Best Make Up award at the Oscars that year, but I didn't really think it was that good. It wasn't ground-breaking. I saw Jim Carrey in similar make up in 1988's Earth Girls are Easy. He look almost the same, but green, instead of red fur. Overall: I love this movie and watch it over and over every Christmas despite its faults. It's a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Opportunity for a great Christmas movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's unfortunate that this large scale production was not put into a traditional account of the Grinch story. Ron Howard, who has directed so many Frank Capra style movies for mainstream audiences, had to twist the plot around and use special effects for a movie that confuses young audiences and detracts from the message. The cast and special effects could have produced a classic from the Grinch story; a movie to reinforce the Christmas message from Dr. Seuss's wonderful children's book. In the end, the movie did return to the original theme but the story was already ruined. There were so many deviations from the story and over the top scarifying scenes that it amounts to a travesty of a great Christmas tale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I finally decided to watch this on VHS last night as I never seen this movie in over 10 years and I finally decided to watch it again as the last time I seen this movie it scared the crap outta me.The Grinch is a Dr Seuss book adaptation that got turned into a film by Ron Howard(who directed Splash) and stars Jim Carrey as the title charcther. It tells the story of the Grinch(played by Jim Carrey who's donning a suit and prosthetics)who hates Christmas and Whoville because he was bullied as a kid by a young boy who is now the mayor of Whoville (played by Jeffery Tambor who voiced Big Nosed Thug in Tangled) and to that day he never liked Xmas because of that. So he does all in his power to ruin Christmas for the Whovilles by stealing their presents and destroying their Xmas tree. But when a young girl from Whoville called Cindy(played by a very young Taylor Monsom)enters the Grinch's life can the Grinch ever learn to love Xmas?Overall the comedy in this is funny especially one scene that cracked me up where The Grinch is driving this little car that blows up and he jumps away from the car and does this funny thing in slow motion.Is it a good movie well its kinda stupid but still Jim Carrey is my favorite actor and you gotta give him credit for wearing that green suit(he first wore something green by playing The Mask in 1994 with Cameron Diaz where he wore a green mask that has magical powers with whoever wears it) but hey his a very funny actor and if you like Jim Carrey then check it out next Xmas as its a Xmas movie.Overall its a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A glossy, sugary confection saved single handed by Jim Carrey</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now might be a peculiar time of year to be writing a review for How the Grinch Stole Christmas. But then ITV just did the peculiar thing of showing it today. And at Easter no less! Oh well, there wasn't much else on TV, so I decided to watch Ron Howard's lovingly crafted tribute to Dr Seuss's most famous fictional character.I remember whiling away many hours of my childhood on the gleeful, charming absurdities of Dr Seuss. The Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham were perennial favourites of mine. And of course, so was How the Grinch Stole Christmas.And what an anarchic children's story it is. The tale of a lovably wicked creature, the Grinch who hates everything and anything to do with Christmas. Living on the top of Mt Crumpit, he loathes and despises the people of Whoville, who act like its Christmas everyday. So he hatches a plan to ruin Christmas for the people he looks down on, by stealing their presents right out from under their noses (and boy do they have noses!) on Christmas Eve.Now of course the book is a very slim affair, so Ron Howard has to expand upon a few things. He even gives us a Grinch back-story. But unfortunately, the film version disappoints. Although a visual treat, the appealing wickedness of the story book has become buried by the A-list machinery of the sets and production values.I don't think Ron Howard was the director to bring the world of Dr Seuss to life. What the film really needed was someone like Tim Burton at the helm. In fact I can't think of a filmmaker more suited to Dr Seuss' sensibilities. Some of the films he's made are clearly akin to the mind of Dr Seuss. The Nightmare Before Christmas is a perfect example. A film that achieved a perfect balance between the grotesque and the sincere. As well as his recent remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Ron Howard's films are ones designed to appeal to the Academy Award winning crowd. Ones that celebrate the strength of the human spirit. He hasn't really got the wacky imagination to let the world of Dr Seuss truly come to life. And while he's clearly put a great deal of thought into the world of Whoville, the film still looks very stagebound. Everything is crammed in as tightly as possible. From squashed in bungalows to tiny fieldmice. The film would be a glossy, empty confection, were it not for one thing......Jim Carrey. Now Jim Carrey can be an intensely annoying actor. Especially when he goes over the top. His antics have sunk many a film on his resume. Batman Forever, The Cable Guy and Liar Liar are all prime examples. Where the directors of those films foolishly refused to rein him in. So its all the more surprising than that Jim Carrey does just brilliantly as The Grinch.This is one of the greatest performances he has ever delivered. Like the one other really good manic character he's played, The Mask, his OTT excesses feel completely appropriate. Where in the other films I mentioned, Carrey was put into roles that didn't really suit his typically out of control theatrics, he gets it very right as The Grinch.The Grinch is a character that seems perfectly attuned to Carrey's manic energy. Much like The Mask. And Ron Howard seems to sense that too. Which is why he allows him to give a performance of zero restraint. And as a result reaches stratospheric heights.Buried under an impressive makeover by the excellent Rick Baker, Carrey is a thundering cyclone. Hopping about with energy, clearly enjoying himself immensely, he is the life and soul of the party. Whenever he's around, you sit up and pay attention (not hard considering he's green all over).I don't envy him either. The hours he must have had to spend in the makeup chair. Those contact lenses must have been torture. But it never shows through in his performance. His enthusiasm for the role shines right through the makeup. And its animated enough to allow him plenty of mischievous grins and lopsided smirks. Giving a sharp, edgy take on the role, Carrey makes The Grinch one of his most memorable creations.What is especially gratifying about the way Jim Carrey plays The Grinch is the fact that even as he softens, he never loses his edge. Yes he does come to understand the spirit of Christmas, but there's still a bit of a grouch left in The Grinch. One particularly delightful moment comes when his heart grows a few inches. His faithful dog Max jumps into his lap licking him mercilessly expecting high praise. Instead he gets a harsh rebuke: "Beat it! One step at a time!"Jim Carrey is the best thing in the whole film. The rest of the cast don't have a prayer of keeping up with him. He's the sole reason to watch the film at all. There's something tremendously satisfying (not to mention liberating) watching him tear down the superficial, hollow shell of Whoville. Its a pity he repents on that because Whoville looks better without all the adornments.You're never in any doubt who's behind the makeup, but Carrey makes The Grinch large as life. With lots of pithy, spiteful dialogue to spout as well as neverending insults and putdowns, Carrey does a superb job of bringing The Grinch to the big screen.Its just a shame the rest of the film isn't as good. It'll be interesting to see how Carrey does in the latest Dr Seuss film, Horton Hears a Who! Since he's an actor who seems very in sync with Seuss, I'm sure he'll be just as good there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this much more then Cat in the Hat.Jim Carrey pulled off the Grinch so well. It does have Jim Carrey written all over it. It really was a great performance from Jim. If Jim wasn't in this they wouldn't have pulled it off very well.There are some moments that make you laugh out loud and it really stays true to the story.They truly brought this story to life. Anthony Hopkins narration brought a really fuzzy heartwarming feel to it.The costumes and visual effects were great.The girl who plays Cindy Lou who did an OK job and i can't think of anyone else to play her.There are a musical moments in there. They are a bit corny but i guess they worked well.I recommend this movie. It is a heartwarming movie and nice time.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overall Nice Christmas Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this back in 2002 on VHS and it's still one of my favorite holiday films to watch it's funny, heartwarming and shows the true meaning of the Christmas spirit. Jim Carrey was hysterically funny in his portrayal of the Grinch,he's my favorite comedian Taylor Momsen was adorable yet sweet as Cindy Lou Who other supporting cast members Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Molly Shannon and Bill Irwin delivered top notch performances.At one point I wondered how could they take a half hour cartoon and turn it into a full length feature film it took a lot of hard work and dedication to create a piece of excellent movie magic. The set designs and use of props worked well , Anthony Hopkins did a fine job as the narrator of the story all in all this classic tale brought to life is a treat for kids and parents to watch around this holiday season.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't judge those critics and people (mostly US based) who dumps this movie just because it doesn't fit with their vision of this classic character. For me, considering that I don't give a snowflake about roots of this movie, it simply rocks. It is not overdone, it is quite long, but not so long as it could be; interesting costumes and hairdos, script is well balanced and full of enjoyable jokes and references, but in same time never letting carry the story away from audience. It is not perfect, but it is there.Yes, yes, it is all you can have in any another good movie with good supporting team, but this time, that all is just perfect add-on to one and one persona and character only - Grinch itself. You can hate or love Jim Carrey, but this time he has done it right. His spoof jokes, a little bit over-the-top emotions are right on target this time.And with all those jolts of fun and laughs, movie achieves to bring very simple and true message with it - Christmas and in fact, any celebration is about people, not goodies you get (common sense very frequently forgotten by children and their parents too). Very good, balanced family movie, which can be enjoyed also watching it alone or with someone dear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since I was a child, I always had a fascination with Christmas. The trees, the snow, and the lights -- to me it was an escape from the harshness of reality. And yes - I guess my views on this film can be viewed as biased. Even prior to sitting down to watch this film, I already knew 'spoilers' for it. Because - I was and still am a huge fan of Dr. Seuss's book of The Grinch; as well as the animated cartoon of it.To be honest, I am very picky of Jim Carrey's work. I liked very few of his flicks that he acted in, the majority I DID NOT. So, I really expressed concern: "is he right to portray Grinch"? And boy oh boy - I loved him in it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great, funny and gives a whole new look to the classic cartoon. The film gives a funny look to the grouchy character that we all know. It also gives more storyline. In this version the Mayor of Whooville embarrassed the Grinch when they were at school as their class mates were giving Christmas Presents to one another and as a result he climbed to the top of the Mountain and has never been seen since. Now when Cindy-loo whoo nominates him for an award, he is forced to come down to accept the award. When the mayor embarrasses him again, he ruins the town and sets the giant Christmas tree on fire. But when his famous plan comes together and is finally touched by Cindi-Loo coming to visit him on Christmas he....oh, you know the rest. All in All a great family film and very enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? THIS is the pinnacle of Christmas movies. We're talking grade A family entertainment here.Anyways, the plot focuses on the Grinch, played perfectly by Jim Carrey, being convinced to go down to a little town that's obsessed with Christmas called Whoville for a Christmas celebration. Needless to say, the Grinch hates Christmas and every living creature in Whoville, so all does not go well.So, the Grinch sets out to ruin Christmas that night. And that's when the fun REALLY starts.Overall, you should go buy this movie on DVD. Right now. I TELL YOU, MAN, YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS.My god, could the theme song get any more catchy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie that Gets Better with Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first sat down to watch this, I was skeptical that I'd find it enjoyable. My initial suspicions were confirmed when I saw the Whos with those EXTREMELY annoying upturned noses. It drove me crazy. Plus, the little girl's triangle-shaped hair made me want to take a lawn mower or machete or just something to it to make it go away.But once I got past that, I learned to appreciate the humor Jim Carrey delivers as the Grinch. While the movie is heavily reliant on pun-like jokes, there is a lot of visual humor that I found myself laughing out loud at.Plus, if you like surrealistic humor, this movie is definitely for you. It's wild and unpredictable in that nature.Basically, a movie that I thought would be painful to watch turned out to be very good, exactly what you need if you just want to laugh without thinking very hard. I know I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whodunnit . . . and why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unmitigated garbage. Ron Howard has never been a big proponent for subtlety. Most of his artwork is house painting, not oils or watercolors. And he uses a sledgehammer instead of a brush. Yet, he has produced a few excellent works--A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13 come to mind. Here, he takes on Dr. Seuss and his endearing story of the power of grace and giving . . . and repaints it with a Hollyweird 10 pound sledge.What infuriated me the most about Grinch is that Howard apparently, in his infinite wisdom, decided to fundamentally change the story of the excluded and marginalized monster of the Grinch, hateful of and hurting for the transcendent love of his neighboring innocents known as the Who's, who decides to punish them for their goodness, and realizing almost too late that he has nothing to fear from the Who's' limitless love. Instead, Howard turns the Who's into a pack of, to use a line from a Charlton Heston movie, "rapacious bastards." The Who's are so common, so greedy and materialistic, that somehow the Grinch will be inspired to goodness in spite of them. Howard's Who's are repulsive, nasty, and Republican (this is Hollywood, you remember)--there's very little to root for here, except the obligatory one, lone Who who models liberal virtue, Cindy Lou Who and Jim Carrey's breathtakingly funny Grinch.Why change a beautiful story? Probably because of one of two options: The producers of this trash figured we were (and still are) dumb enough as viewers not to notice that the Who's were now rotten to the core or changing the Who's was the only way for Howard to fill 90 minutes of screen time with 20 minutes of story. Either way (or both), How the Grinch Stole Christmas has sold a bazillion tickets and DVD's.I have an in-law who is intellectually stuck on "concrete-operational" and can't, for the life of her, understand why I hate this movie ("How can you hate this movie? It's Fuh-nee!"). I am not, never have been, never will be, any great intellectual wunderkind, but Ron Howard and company have banked on getting richer yet by playing to the concrete thinkers of the nation. The movie is depressing and dispiriting, and the only way to get away from this loud, offensive gas bubble of a movie is to quietly read Dr. Seuss's lovely little story to your children . . .With no special effects, no zillion dollar stars, nothing but Seuss's words and illustrations.But then again, you've got to be able to read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Advertised</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Panned by critics and loathed by Seuss purists, this movie managed to capture just enough hearts to lasso in $260 million when it opened in 2000. Ron Howard's recipe for The Grinch is more of a smorgasbord, and as such, reactions were varied depending on who liked which parts.The visuals, a combination of elaborate sets and costumes and computer graphics, are a stunning replica of Seussian illustrations. Buildings and walkways are odd-shaped, almost organic, and machines are crammed full of moving parts and oversized cogs. The colors are crisp but the palette is somewhat muted. It seems more natural for a Seussian world to look like a Technicolor musical but in fact the books were themselves simple and soft on the eyes. The costumes are festive and creative, like Cindy Lou's family dressed up like a Christmas dinner, with plates and cookies and hats shaped like mugs of eggnog. James Horner's score is par for the course, a mixture of the film's storybook mood and Horner's own penchant for stealing from his own work.The story is a melting pot of popular culture, borrowing heavily from the book, stealing settings from the Chuck Jones cartoon, and adding some modern flavor; some psychological background on the Grinch's troubled childhood mixed with a new twist on the Who's, who seem to have let their Christmas become commercialized. Seuss purists may prefer to think of the Who's as being more innocent; after all, the Grinch learned his lesson from watching the innocent Who's without their presents. Chuck Schulz probably wasn't happy, thinking he had the market on commercialized Christmas cornered with his classic Charlie Brown Christmas. I'm not really thrilled with this twist either, but it's one way to take the story from a ten-minute book to a half-hour cartoon to a 90-minute film.Roger Ebert was a little hard on this film, saying it was too dark and focused on the Grinch's meanness. I thought as one-dimensional as the Who's are in the story, they tried too hard to expand on THEM. The Fat One is never wrong, but I have to say, the Grinch is the central focus of the story, and as such deserves every second of screen time he gets. Hollywood is a town that recognizes Jim Carrey's comic genius, but still doesn't quite know what to do with it. Ron Howard is one of the more recent to try. Carrey is given all the comedic stylings he can handle; from a eerily good impression of Boris Karloff; to the Chuck Jones cartoon images of skittering on the floor on his fingers and toes, the old saw-the-floor-under-the-tree gag and the triumphant lifting of the sled on Mt. Crumpit; to physical gags of every variety (Carrey yanks a cloth off a table, leaving numerous pots and pans untouched, then returns to upset them all and tip the table); to spoofs of several popular movies (Chariots of Fire comes to mind); to other pop culture gags (Carrey checks an answering machine message, his greeting is "If you so much as utter one syllable, I'LL HUNT YOU DOWN AND GUT YOU LIKE A FISH! ... if you'd like to fax me, press the * key). With the combination of voices, facial expressions and overacting, I still hang on every word he says; to this day I'm tickled when he puts on a Navy ball cap and spoofs his own director.His supporting cast is more than competent. Christine Baranski, his unrequited love, is her typecast snooty self (and with a bit more cleavage than Seuss might appreciate). Taylor Momsen is the quintessential darling as Cindy Lou Who, and her father (Bill Irwin) is both naive (The Grinch wraps her up in paper, her father says upon finding her "You've been practicing your Christmas wrapping") and heartwarming (the mayor yells "What's the matter with you?!? She's a child!" and he says plainly, "she's MY child... and she happens to be right.") Molly Shannon is the standard annoying suburban housewife, Ron's brother Clint Howard steals scenes as the mayor's toadie, and the rest of the town is largely populated with stereotypes: old biddies, an Irish cop, a chunky self-important mayor, a prudish teacher, and so on). The whole story is wonderfully narrated by the gentle, articulate voice of Anthony Hopkins.I'm one of maybe 7 people on Planet Earth that actually enjoyed nearly all the pieces of this muddled Seussian story. But I recommend it all the same, no matter what the Fat One says.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me set the scene. It is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies. I am with my friend deciding what to see. We look for a movie that is starting soon and "The Grinch" comes up. We buy tickets not knowing what to expect. What we got was a roller coaster of fun.Jim Carrey (who may I add is my No.1 actor in the whole world) was absolutely magnificent as the Grinch in this Ron Howard's best movie (next to Apollo 13). The way that this movie was made, the scenery, the actors, the props and the music was just amazing. It really brought this childhood movie to life.The story is based upon the story of the grinch. As we all know the Grinch is a horrible person who just can't stand christmas. He lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk. But one little girl is going to change The Grinch's look on life and on others in a drastic way.Cindy Lou Who (played by adorable new actress Taylor Momsem) meets the Grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away. She attempts to break the barrier and to help the Grinch move in and mingle with the towns people.All up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents. A SOLID 10/10. Well done Jim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First an explanation on what makes a great movie for me. Excitement about not knowing what is coming next will make me enjoy a movie the first time I watch it (case en point: Twister). There are also other things that go into a great first viewing such as good humor (John Candy in Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors), good plot with good resolution (Madeline and Matilda), imaginative storytelling (all Star Wars episodes-George Lucas is THE MAN), and good music (again all Star Wars episodes, Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music). What makes me watch a movie at least six times in the theatre and buy a DVD or VHS tape? Characters. With that said, I present Cindy Lou Who and The Grinch. Excellent performance Taylor Momsen and Jim Carrey. The rest of the cast was very good, particularly Jeffery Tambor, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, and Josh Ryan Evans. But, every single scene with Cindy and The Grinch-together is excellent and very funny and/or heartwarming. Cindy Lou is my favorite character in this movie and the most compelling reason why the movie is better than the cartoon. The Grinch has a strong plot, good conflicts, and a very good theme (I can't get started because I don't want to spoil it). Jim Carrey was very funny as The Grinch-particularly when he interacted with Cindy. And the music! Wow! Excellent music by James Horner. I loved his selection of instruments and the compositions. Very good job Jim Carrey-I didn't know you could sing. Taylor Momsen! Whoa! Your voice is reason enough to see the movie at least once. On your solo - Where Are You Christmas - is your voice really as high as it sounds? Sounds like an F#? That is an obscene range for a 7-year old (obscene meant in the best possible way). Great job. This is the best performance by a child I have ever heard in a movie(Taylor beat out the Von Trapp Children-no small feat!). And now to the actors. Jim Carrey was great, funny, and, surprisingly very sensitive (this really showed through in his scenes with Taylor Momsen). Taylor Momsen's unspoken expressions(one of the secrets to a good acting performance) are very strong-she really becomes Cindy Lou Who. And when she does dialogue she is even stronger.******************************danger:spoiler alert********************* ***********************************************************************Examples: expression when she first sees The Grinch. This is a classic quote ("You're the the the" and then filled in with the Grinch line "da da da THE GRINCH-after which she topples into the sorter and then is rescued by The Grinch). The "Thanks for saving me" quote and subsequent response by The Grinch was also very good.My favorite part of the movie is when Cindy invites The Grinch to be Holiday Cheermeister. This scene is two excellent actors at their best interacting and expressing with each other. Little Taylor Momsen completely holds her own with Jim Carrey in this spot. I sincerely hope we see Taylor Momsen in many more films to come. All in all everything was great about this movie (except maybe the feet and noses).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RON HOWARD, JIM CARREY, AND TAYLOR --&gt; A+ + + + + + + +</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE GRINCH was the best American movie made since Forrest Gump. Absolutely extraordinary. I've read the other comments and I'm embarrassed of everyone that didn't like the film. The irony is that they're the very essence of what the film was talking about - needy, greedy, "what can you do for me?" type people. If the story doesn't tell you exactly what you want, then it's not good. If Jim Carrey's voice isn't exactly what you want, then it's not good. If the little girl doesn't sing exactly the way you want, then it's not good.I'm a filmmaker myself. I've made three films which are found on this website as well and suddenly, I don't feel as bad about some of the comments I've received.The bottom line is Ron Howard, Taylor Momford (?), and Jim Carrey poured their hearts out for this film. It is so evident. Jim Carrey brought so much humanity to the role. He was so likeable yet when he stood on that mountain staring down the "whos", there was so much pain and hate inside his eyes. Having worked with actors, it's easy to see that Jim was coming from a real place. The poor guy leaves everything on the set and he still gets criticised. I hope to God that Jim stumbles upon this review (which I highly doubt he will) but he needs to know that his effort was noted. But someone like Jim Carrey probably knows this already and steps on doubters like ants on the grass.I predict this movie will be a classic just like the Wizard of Oz and the Grinch television show itself. It will transcend the doubts of the doubters and will reach generations far beyond the ones that didn't like this film.Ron Howard this was your best work. It was seamless. The transitions were nifty and appropriate. You kept Jim under wraps and never let Jim slip out too much. Your choice of casting was excellent. The sets, the hair, the music, the pacing, everything - A+.And the girl. Oh my God the girl. She changed my life. I'm 32 without wife or child and she made me dream of both. She was magical without even trying. Her voice was pure and perfect. How dare someone critique her singing. She's just a kid and she was singing honestly and isn't that what it's all about!!!!!!? She was an angel. The way she smiled and laughed, and even better, the way she stood toe to toe with Jim Carrey. One of the best child actors I've seen since Natalie Portman's Professional.What a message that movie sent! Of course it was different than the TV show. It needs to be. We're different. Times have changed. We need to hear different things. Years ago, Christmas was different so the Grinch was appropriate back then but now try going to a mall and tell me it hasn't changed. Try giving your kid a hug and an apple for Christmas and see how he reacts. This movie was so appropriate and people can't handle looking at the mirror too long.Wonderful effort by all parties involved. I HOPE I can make a movie half as good.Mr. Howard, Mr. Carrey, and Brian Grazer thank you for the clues. I'm not just stopping the sled - I'm picking it up and raising it over my head. I think most people (judging from the comments) would let it fall of the cliff.Bravo. Fine work everybody!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! What can I say about DR. SUESS'S HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS? The old cartoon is a classic, really, &amp; if anyone disagrees they were drunk when they saw it. But when I heard that they were making THE GRINCH all I could think about is...how can you turn a 30 minute cartoon into an hour &amp; 30 minute movie? Well, no need to ask that question because it was done. Wow! The best movie of 2000 &amp; my favourite movie since TITANIC &amp; THE GREEN MILE. Jim Carrey is great! If you're a die hard Carrey fan then you'll love it. If you hate Carrey &amp; see it you'll love it! Jim Carrey gets so into character &amp; there couldn't've been a better Grinch. From Carrey's bad role in ME, MYSELF, &amp; IRENE to Carrey's best role in THE GRINCH, THE GRINCH will be a family movie to watch all year around. This is a family movie. Parents, don't worry about taking your 4 year old to it because it's PG. Take 'em. If you don't, perhaps its your heart that's 2 sizes to small!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My reaction will be inconceivable, heretical, to devotees of thecartoon, which is obviously deeply ingrained into the US Xmasexperience. In the UK it is largely unknown (as is Frosty the Snowman)and has been retitled simply The Grinch for distribution here. When Ifinally saw the cartoon in New York last Xmas I was disappointed by thequality of the animation, the narration and the crude black and whitemorality. I adored the movie, which greatly improved upon the narrative by making( spoiler alert!) the Grinch's feelings partly justified and shared bythe little girl in the town, the mayor less likeable than the Grinch,and the Grinch the object of the town's most glamorous woman's love andlust! This broke up the cartoon's simplistic duality, so that the townand the Grinch learn from each other, and not all just one way. Packedwith hilarious adult jokes such as references to other movies (e.g. thecar-keys in a bowl ? the Who community practice wife-swapping as in TheIce Storm) and beautiful on the eye. I entirely forgot that it was Careycapering before me on the screen. It was the Grinch, the real Grinch.However, almost all the things I admire about this are probably whatwill upset devotees of the cartoon. This will be the first encounterwith the Grinch for most British children, so I'm interested to see whatwill be the reaction of those I know on seeing the cartoon second. Iwouldn't be surprised if UK TV will start showing it on Xmas from nowon. I had just been given my first Xmas present so I fortuitously watchedthe movie with the wrapped box on my lap. I felt renewed by this movieand ready to enter the fray of Xmas shopping with a refreshedmotivation, thanks entirely to the Grinch's insight??????...............................</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am by far a Dr. Seuss fan. I disagree with how some of the stories are written. I wouldn't be surprised if children who read it, go around talking like it thinking it's the right way to talk. But I've ALWAYS loved 'How the grinch stole christmas' ever since I was little. I grew tired of all the other christmas shows like rudolph and frosty, and never grew tired of this wonderful classic so I couldn't wait to see it when it came out to film.I had gone to Toronto with my parents to visit my sister, her soon to be 5 kids. While visiting, me being 19, took my two nieces (8 and 4) to the movies to see the grinch. Of course, my father and sister came along as well.As soon as we stepped into the theatre and found ourselves seats, my 4 year old niece had her face glued to the screen as soon as she sat down (and this was when it was starting to show the movie (after the previews were aired, we never saw them).I absolutely loved it. And so did my nieces. Whether or not they caught the jokes doesn't matter because not everyone catches jokes or the meaning of things the first time through unless you're pure lucky. But as long as you enjoyed it whatever your age is, that's the whole point of the film. I mean, who would want to go to the movies and sit through the whole thing only to not like it.I recommend it to anyone out there who likes the grinch. My nieces loved it even if they didn't catch all the jokes but trust me, children laugh at things even if they don't get the joke. Annoying, but true :P But again, as long as they enjoyed it, that's all that matters.No one could have played the grinch like Jim and no one could have played Cindy Lou Who like Taylor :) So adorable ^_^;But course... *praise* my nieces are just as cute :D *end praise* :)</fullReview>

Poor Ted Geisel is turning over in his grave, and just about everybody involved in producing (not to mention marketing) this flick ought to be ashamed of themselves. It is one of the purest, schmaltziest "made for a marketing campaign so people will spend money" (wait, check that, spend a lot of money) movies to come out in a long time. And the worst part of it is, the original theme of the original story was "Shuck marketing hell. Understand what the *real* holidays are all about."And the least they could have done, if they were going to destroy the message, was at least make the movie fun. Make the Grinch somewhat hateable, instead of making the movie hateable. He was supposed to be a *mean* one, not a misunderstood practical joker sensitive man of the 90's.But I guess that's marketing.1 of 5 stars. You'll have to force yourself to laugh, and then you'll hate yourself for it afterwards. (Even the kids in the aisle below me were falling asleep.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cuter than I ever imagined (***possible spoilers***)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit, the only film I previously liked Jim Carrey in was "The Mask". Not anymore. I wondered if he was occasionally vulgar, but ultimately I thought he was cute and very funny. I thought the sets, makeup, and hairstyles were astounding, like the cartoon had literally "come to life". I didn't have a clue what the film would be like, and I wasn't disappointed at all. Jim Carrey's acting was inspired. I cannot compare Boris Karloff with Jim Carrey because they are both so different, but I like them both as the Grinch! I also appreciate that the quotes from the cartoon and book were in here too, but not so much that it got redundant. Jim Carrey was "The Grinch" as I never thought he could be!I thought that the way Ron Howard had lengthened the original story to fit a 2 hour movie was very good. Some of you, I know, will not think so, and to you who fit that description, don't be so hard on this movie. What else could they do but have a personal history of the Grinch if Cindy Lou Who wanted to find out about him? The cartoon should have been longer. The acting is almost completely over-the-top (except for the kind-hearted Cindy Lou Who, played by Taylor Momsen), but that is the way it should have been because this is a fantasy.The special effects Ron Howard also had a right to do. The Dumpit to Crumpit, Christmas light guns, flying sleigh, etc., were ingenious. You can't find special effects in the cartoon!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is amazing that Director Ron Howard &amp; star Jim Carrey could produce such an embarassing &amp; painfully unfunny film! This is the low point of both of their careers. It feels about 3 hours long and most scenes resemble the horrid outtake material that would be quickly cut from any quality film! The over-blown special effects are designed solely to cover up the complete lack of any original ideas or laughs. For adults, the sole highlight (or low point, depending on how you look at it) of this trash is a wife swapping gag (quick shot of keys dumped into bowl) that makes you wonder how it got into this film. Dr. Seuss would roll over in his grave if he had the chance to see this pathetic excuse for entertainment! In closing, both Howard and Carrey should be ashamed of themselves for shoving this mess down our throats! Holiday films have reached a new low!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take A Trip To Whoville</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When such an eagerly awaited, highly anticipated movie like this comes along, you have to ask yourself, can any film live up to the hype? Well, the answer in this case is, You Bet It Can. Resoundingly. `How The Grinch Stole Christmas,' directed by Ron Howard and starring Jim Carrey, is a triumph to be embraced by the ages. It's a warm and touching, funny and highly entertaining piece of film making, satisfyingly brought to fruition by Howard, seemingly the perfect choice to direct such a vehicle as this. But make no mistake about it, this movie belongs to Jim Carrey, who was born to play this part. Nobody, but NOBODY, could have pulled this off better than Carrey. It's a dazzling demonstration of his talents; he has all the tools and uses every one of them in bringing the Grinch to life. From the Sean Connery voice he affects, to the physical bits he manages, to the exceptional costuming and makeup that help make it all fly, it's an exemplary performance in every way. Amazingly enough, there's no trace of Jim Carrey left here; he manages to disappear totally into the character, a transformation so complete that what you see is pure Grinch from the inside out. He pulls out all the stops and lets himself go with it, without ever taking it too far over the top. Howard, who obviously knew exactly what he wanted from his star, must get some credit as well for keeping the naturally exuberant Carrey on track, while allowing him to find his own comfort zone that made it all work.  Howard uses a gentle touch with the film, letting the natural humor work on it's own without ever forcing it, while infusing some sly, subtle comedic bits that work well and keep it all from slipping into anything sappy or pretentious. It's a feel-good film without the maudlin overtones to which so many other films of this nature have succumbed over the years. And what a credit this is to the versatility of Howard, who proves here that he can take you into outer space or to `Whoville' with equal alacrity and expertise. The supporting cast includes Christine Baranski, who turns in a wickedly funny performance as Martha May Who-vier; Jeffrey Tambor (Mayor of Whoville); Molly Shannon (Betty Lou-Who); Josh Ryan Evans (8 Year Old Grinch); Taylor Momsen (Little Cindy Lou-Who); Bill Irwin (Lou Lou-Who); and Clint Howard (Whobris). With `How The Grinch Stole Christmas,' Howard and Carrey have provided us with an instant classic; a delightful film with a lot of heart that is thoroughly entertaining from beginning to end. A great way to kick off the holiday season, this movie is destined to become an annual tradition with audiences everywhere. In the end, this is what movies are all about: Pure Magic. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

Do yourself a favor, buy/rent the video cartoon done by Chuck Jones (and the screenplay written by Seuss himself, as well as the songs) or better yet, read the book to your kids. You'll like that better.Besides, all of the marketing and cross promotion associated with this movie is disconcerting. It is exactly the opposite of the point of the story.

The audience I saw the movie with did not laugh very much, along with myself. However, I did hear kids leaving the theater say they really enjoyed the movie.

		<fullReview>Anyone who has a heart that, as a kid, was touched by the wonder-filled, magical fable of the original animated Grinch will feel obligated to punch out Ron Howard if they ever meet him in real life. They took a pure and innocent tale we all loved and turned it into a hollow, lifeless piece of marketing, a movie that was more an unofficial sequel to the Mask, or the worst parts of the Batman films, than the simple story it should have been.Jim Carrey was exquisitely Jim Carrey, but even if he is the living embodiment of a cartoon, his casting was a disservice to the movie. Catchphrases, sexual innuendo, pithy references to current events and attitudes - these things are appropriate for 'youth-oriented product positioning', not a timeless fable of childhood innocence. The film needed much more in the way of wonder than it did potty humor and snappy jokes.Of course, one can't ultimately blame Ron Howard, because he was raised in Hollywood - his childhood may actually have been like that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The-the-the THE GRINCH was Awesome- Right-o</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie because... 1. Jim Carrey was in it and 2. I wanted to laugh my head out. And that is exactly what happened. I was cracking up during this whole movie. But there were some sad parts to it too. It turned out that the grinch dude wasn't so bad after all. He actually had a heart. If you want to laugh your brains out, I reccomend this movie. Even if you don't think this sounds like a good movie, you should still watch it. I mean Jim Carrey is in it. Jim Carrey= laughs, laughs= funny movie. So, if you like funny movies watch the-the-the The Grinch. If you don't think this movie is good, then I have only one thing to say... You're wrong-o. Jim Carrey rocks and so does all his movies. This is a got-to-see movie.</fullReview>

I am a big fan of elaborate children's movies, Labyrinth, the Dark Crystal, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, etc., that aren't always just for children, and found I was very pleasantly surprised with this movie.I really can't understand why many critics disliked this movie. Perhaps they were so wrapped up in picking it apart that they didn't take time to enjoy it. Jim Carrey was fantastic, (little Cindy Lou was even better), the set was magical, the direction was great, the rhyming and who-ing all worked - all in all it was pretty spectacular. And for the parents - there is a moral in the movie that all of us can appreciate (even us Jewish movie-goers).My husband, who is pretty much the Grinch in the flesh, that that he would see it again - so it must be good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't take things so seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I understand it, critics and viewers alike are giving this movie a hard time because, well, its not the greatest film ever made, and Jim's not as funny as he could be, and Ron Howard has made better movies, and...blah blah blah...its nothing like the original (book or movie). Well, you know something, they're all right, but this is still a great movie that everybody can enjoy. Sure, it lays it on pretty thick, from the cute little girl to Max, the Grinch's loyal sidekick dog, but its a family movie, and its suppose to be like that. Maybe its not anything like Dr. Seuss' original version, but I'm pretty sure that he's not turning over in his grave either. I think that Ron Howard and Jim Carrey achieved their intention to make a fun movie that leaves the audience smiling in the end. So for all you 'critics' whose hearts are a size too small, don't take things so seriously and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"All I want for Christmas is my family." Ron Howard is a genius in family entertainment. The direction of this movie is magical, from shot selection to editing to digital effects. This is the most creative vision since "The Wizard of OZ" and the most heart-warming motion picture since "Its a Wonderful Life". Jim Carrey demonstrates his full range of talents, from outstanding comedic contributions to enrapturing dramatic emotional appeal. This is the art of movie-making at its best. All of the negative comments anyone else provides simply demonstrates that they cannot let themselves relax and enjoy childhood emotions again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun and psychological look at Dr. Seuss' infamous character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Seuss' infamous character (as famous as any Seuss character besides Cat in the Hat and Green Eggs and Ham) no comes to the big screen. And I couldn't be happier. Especially because not only does the film team up to great film people- Actor Jim Carrey and producer/director Ron Howard, the makeup effects in this film is the best I've seen in years. It is simply amazing craftwork done on Jim Carrey as he is enveloped in the Grinch caharcter, and even though you can't see him exactly, his personality, voice and soul is shining through at all times. What also attracted me to the movie is that it takes a look at The Grinch in a way that you understand his phsyche. If you were to read the book or watch the 1966 TV cartoon (which was also fun), all you would see is the basics (and or the third act of this film). But in most of the film, we see how the grinch has been transformed into an antihero and how he may be mad outside, but inside, he has a heart (even if it's 2 sizes to small). But the seriousness beside, this film is pure fun. It's consistently funny as we look at Carrey use his grinch to make the audience yuckle up. And it works. A true family film (kids, adults and teens will range from being amused to being convulsed in laughter), this is the film of the season, that is unless Unbreakable passes it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Good Adaptation Of Christmas Classic!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey, Jeffrey Tambor, Taylor Momsen, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin and Molly Shannon star in Ron Howard's 2000 fantasy based on the Dr. Seuss book and cartoon. This takes place in the town of Who-Ville where we meet The Grinch (Carrey) who despises Christmas since he was young. Soon, he meets young girl, Cindy Lou Who (Momsen) who tries to get him to share the holiday festivities with everyone in town. He decides to take Christmas away from the Whos, but fails when he eventually learns the true meaning of Christmas. Tambor (The Larry Sanders Show) plays the Mayor, Augustus MayWho, Baranski (The Birdcage) plays the Grinch's crush, Martha May Who, Irwin (My Blue Heaven) and Shannon (Never Been Kissed) play Cindy Lou's parents, Lou and Betty Lou. Howard's father Rance, brother, Clint and son, Jeremy also appear and Anthony Hopkins (The Silence of the Lambs) narrates. Carrey is great as usual as well as Rick Baker's make-up effects and James Horner's score. This is a good adaptation of the Christmas classic I recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I loved this film. Carrey's best performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Carrey has done many great performances. From Count Olaf to The Riddler, Carrey actually gives his best performance as the Grinch. Jim Carrey is my favorite actor. I will see any film he's in, so it's no wonder I saw How the Grinch Stole Christmas. It tanked at with critics, but I must disagree. I couldn't believe how much I loved this film, it's an awesome film. Jim Carrey is fantastic as The Grinch, and I couldn't believe how much I loved this film. Like How much I couldn't believe I loved A series of Unfortunate events. Carrey is evil in that film but I still liked his character. Sort of like with Ralph Feinnes in Harry Potter. His character is a bastard but I think he is pretty cool. It sounds like i'm supporting evil, but trust me, i'm not supporting evil. Somehow, everybody hated The Grinch. I was one of the rare few who loved this film. Directed by Ron Howard(Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon), I think The Grinch is great entertainment. It's actually one of my favorite Christmas films. How The Grinch stole Christmas is funny, has great visuals, and a great cast. There is such a big cast I don't know if I can name everyone. But i'll sure as hell try. Here is the cast to How the Grinch stole Christmas:Christine Baranski(Cybil, Mamma Mia!)Jeffery Tambor(Too many things)Molly Shannon(SNL, Superstar)Even Narrated by Anthony Hopkins(The Silence of the Lambs)How the Grinch stole Christmas is a great film. You can sue me I don't care. I know everyone hated this film, but i'm one of the rare few who loved it. Definitely Dr. Seuss's best film adaptation and i'm proud of it. I actually prefer the film to the book, and that's saying quite a lot. I loved How the Grinch stole Christmas, and I think you should see it.The Plot:The Grinch, who was bullied as a child, hates Christmas. He happens to live above a town that celebrates Christmas all the time. So when Cindy Lou Who decides to get The Grinch to come down, he hates Christmas even more. He decides to take all of the town's presents for revenge.</fullReview>

This movie is one of my all-time favourite movies ever. I really love Christmas movies (my other favourite is Nightmare Before Christmas), unfortunately, not every single Xmas movie is good. This one is more than good. The characters and the plot line is so silly and adorable, it creates an atmosphere for which I can't say 'No'. The backgrounds, the special effects, the make-ups and especially Whoville is so precisely created that I simply can't believe it. And the most important of all...JIM CARREY! He was born for this role, he acts like he has always been the Grinch. I really like Max too, he puts an interesting twist into the movie, because he is the only animal (Okay, and the white cat, who becomes stolen by the Grinch). There is only one character I hate, that's the Mayor, but I think it's because he is on the 'evil side'. :)Trust me, this is a really good movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Adaptation of the Dr. Seuss Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolutely wonderful movie. I remember upon first hearing that Ron Howard was taking the Dr. Seuss book and creating it into a full-length feature I was shocked. Wondering how this could be done and thinking what a disappointment it would be. In reality how could you take such a wild story and cast it to remain true to the children's book which I love. After seeing the movie I was truly astounded at the awesome quality and I know that no one other than Jim Carey could have actually pulled off the role of the Grinch. As to all those who have rated this movie so mediocre and have called in overdone and blown out of proportion. I think perhaps they have lost their perspective in that the whole Dr. Seuss book is "bigger and more imaginative than life itself". To have produced this movie as a more "down to earth, layed back and not overblown style" would have been the tragedy. This movie is a joy to anyone who has never lost their childhood wonder and spirit of Christmas. If you don't love this movie I would ask myself, "Where are you Christmas". Fantastic Movie full of holiday cheer and the meaning of Christmas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Classic Gets Even Better Over the Years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a child, I wasn't fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to watch this classic cartoon as it just wasn't a tradition as it is in the U.S. to view this every Christmas time and so I only got to watch this as an adult while I was studying in your fine country and yet I was blown away. I had read Seuss as a child in the public libraries but this was the first time I had a chance to see the animated versions. The picture quality has been restored very well here on this DVD however the sound quality while is good at Dolby Digital Stereo quality is not remastered well enough coming without any DTS with THX or Dolby 5.1 option although whose of you with Pro Logic would have it a little better. This becomes apparent especially for the second great feature: "Horton Hears a Who" where the volume levels alternate from just right to too soft at various points of the cartoon. The special features here are very, very good with documentaries featuring great interviews with the voice talents and the composer Albert Hague who wrote the great music for the songs on the Grinch. Overall, this is a very good DVD of great value for money and I can only anticipate what a better restored version with enhanced sound quality perhaps on Blu-ray would look like and I await such a DVD with bated breath. In the meantime though, this DVD is still a very good tribute to that great classic, the original and still the best version of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey saves this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Grinch is a bad tempered hairy green creature who lives in the mountains overlooking Whoville, and he hates Christmas. While the people of Whoville look forward to celebration and festivities, the Grinch plans to steal all the presents and spoil it for everyone.I have to say that Jim Carrey captures the character with great precision and brings his usual comedy capers to screen once again. It's a good job that he did, because this film stretches Dr Zeus's story out too long, leaving it feeling a bit dull at times; some of the additional background behind the Grinch was interesting, but this film could definitely have been trimmed down to around 80 Min's.6/10 It's fun and Carrey is brilliant, but it's not great</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm something of a movie nut, and I have to admit that I really liked Ron Howard's version a lot. I do think that the earlier Chuck Jones version is a classic in its own right and I enjoy it as well. I don't think one can fairly compare the two versions; this version has a much more involved back story which explains the Grinch's motivation, while Jones' version is much more taut due to its lesser running time.I found this to be visually very attractive, with excellent computer animation and an awesome job by the artistic director. There's a lot of boffo humor in this version as well with inside jokes galore. I'm mixed in my opinion of Jim Carrey in general, but this is definitely one of his best performances. Overall, it's a slick, well-made popcorn movie--not exactly Citizen Kane, but Hollywood at its most competent...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most charming and funny films (in any genre) I have seen. I also have the original Grinch and was very skeptical about this modern version. Since my kids absolutely love this film (and that's what really counts, isn't it), I have had the opportunity to see it about 20 times - mostly out of the corner of one eye. Maybe that is the key - the film has grown on me. But, maybe not. I believe I liked it the first time even though I can't really remember.Some might complain that it doesn't stick to the original story and that it is a kind of blasphemy to update a Christmas classic like this. Although the Grinch was an important part of my childhood, I don't mind. I really like this film because it is one of the very few I see these days that makes me smile and laugh. This is entertainment the way entertainment was meant to be - damn the intellect on this one.Disclaimer - I tend to like Jim Carrie's films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film needs to be seen for what it is - it's not a Mystic River or a Midnight Express! It's a Christmas family comedy, and you need to remember this. If you do, you'll probably thoroughly enjoy it. Jim Carrey is unbelievably hilarious as the grumpy Grinch, his physical performance, vocal performance and facial expressions are out of this world, along with the excellent lines he has; "6 o'clock? Dinner with me, and I can't cancel that again!" Even the angelic 6-year-old girl is hilarious (and actually cute, not irritating) as the most mature character in town, "Dad, don't you find Christmas a bit superfluous?", who brings the Grinch back to town for the hilarious montage of Who-bilation events.The film is incredibly cheesy and emotional, but in an amazing way! The shocking Faith Hill song is entirely brilliant for its terribleness: "Where are you Christmas/Why have you gone away?" Eh?! (Then again, it is co-written by Mariah Carey, so.....) But its Jim Carrey that makes the film so numerously re-watchable as you'll notice more and more side-splitting things with every time. It's also unbelievably uplifting when you're feeling down, so I completely recommend you buy it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Carrey is a genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the funniest movies i've ever seen in my life. Jim Carrey has that rare talent to do hardly anything at all, and make you crack up. He excels in this movie at doing that.For those who hated this movie, I have 2 things to say. Firstly, if you are some kind of Christmas movie purist who wanted this movie to be like the old animated movie, why did you go to this movie?!?! You knew it wasn't going to be that way because Jim Carrey is in it. Secondly, if you don't like Jim Carrey, don't see this movie, because he is the main star and about 98% of the funny things in this movie is him doing something zany. I'd like to see the original screenplay of this film and see how much Jim Carrey actually said in it and how much he just made up on the spot because I don't think Ron Howard would have been like "oh, you should definitely bite this wine bottle". It's those kind of things that makes this movie so hilarious though.One thing that no one can deny is the excellence of the production. The costumes and make-up are completely original and the set design insanely seusslike. If Dr. Seuss saw this movie and hated it (which i wouldn't deny would happen), he'd still adore the Whoville set and everything. It is awesome.I have such a good time watching this movie and sometimes I don't wait until the holiday season to watch this. And after seeing it who knows how many times, I still laugh at Jim Carrey's funny antics as the Grinch. At times is performance is reminiscent of his Tony Clifton in Man on the Moon. He talks with his gut sticking out and his lips projected to the side.This movie is the perfect way to get into the holiday spirit or just to have a good laugh. Like the book and original cartoon or not, there's no denying that the real purpose of this movie was to entertain and not to copy. Given that the movie is much longer than the half hour original, you should probably figure out that it's not supposed to be exactly like it, and should therefore stop trying to compare them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the very good adaption of Dr. Seuss' classic Christmas story about the green pest who hated Christmas. The Whos down in Whoville are preparing for Christmas, and everyone is excited and happy about it, except for the Grinch (Golden Globe nominated Jim Carrey) at the top of a mountain. When little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) becomes curious of the Grinch, she wanders up to his lair and temps him to come down to Whoville to be the holiday Cheer Meister instead of the Mayor (Jeffrey Tambor), and in front of the woman that used to have a soft spot for him, Martha May Whovier (Christine Baranski). But it isn't long before the Grinch is haunted by his childhood past and he turns nastier. So he finally decides that to stop Christmas from coming, he'll steal it! So he steals all the presents, the decorations, the food, everything Christmassy. In the end he learns that Christmas means more than all of that and turns nice, a nice ending. Also starring Bill Irwin as Lou Lou Who, Molly Shannon as Betty Lou Who, Clint Howard (Ron's brother) as Whobris, Austin Powers' Mindy Sterling as Clarnella and narrated by Sir Anthony Hopkins. Filled with hilarious gags and good green make-up, director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer have done a great job. It won the Oscar for Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Costume Design, and it won the BAFTA for Best Make Up/Hair. Jim Carrey was number 47 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!</fullReview>

Looks like I have nothing better to do at the moment than critique a movie most people have seen already. A horrible adaptation to the classic book I loved as a kid. It was Carrey mugging through the whole film. Carrey is a funny guy, but this was just overdone and lame. I got sick of his antics after 20 minutes. If they would have stuck within the limits of the book and done a half hour show it would have been better. Seeing stupid additional crap was blasphemy, who cares how the Grinch was as a kid. That stuff is better left unsaid. Why are people obsessed with having to know the entire background of a famous villain (Darth Vader, etc) rather than leave it in a shroud of mystery.The only thing that's worse than this movie is the soundtrack. Poorly made up songs with stupid lyrics. I wouldn't even let a 5-year old listen to it for fear of corrupting the poor child with stupidity. Stick to the cartoon and book, which are timeless classics.Most kids love this movie (do they know any better? They also love today's sorry cartoons) most adults and anyone with a full developed brain will hate it. I liken it to sitting in a room for 2 hours with Jar Jar Binks. You'd feel like strangling Carrey's Grinch!</fullReview>

What made the movie interesting to watch was that there was a background behind the character, a whole new revoultion towards the grinch which made the film wonderful.

For the first time in my life I nearly decided to leave the theater. But I decided to stay and stick it out. It only got worse, so I decided to take a nap, but I refused because i paid my $6.00 matinee waste of money. All of that and I was only 1/2 way through this turgid pile of crud. Unfortunately, I stayed awake. The nap would have been worth closer to the 6 bucks than the last hour of this movie. The one thing that might have rescued this movie is if the whole of Whoville and all the snotty Whos were bombed into oblivion by the Burger Meister Meisterburger. The only redeeming quality of the whole film was that Cindy Lou Who was cute; old, but cute. I recommend this movie for use as an interrogation tool for the CIA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Growing up, I stayed away from How the Grinch Stole Christmas. It was not one of my favorites. I found it rather boring and silly. Therefore, when Jim Carrey did the Grinch, especially after seeing how it was advertised, I stayed away from it. It was inevitable that I should come back and watch it at a much later date since I am a Jim Carrey fan. I found it to be done excellently. Jim did a great job at portraying the Grinch, and for the first time, I found myself liking the story. He made it believable, and he actually makes you feel sorry for the Grinch. After all, he was mistreated; it is a wonder that he was not worse off than he was. Being on his own for so long, it is also surprising that he was not a total, stark-raving, mad lunatic and that he did not do much worse to the town. My other favorite characters, who did not receive enough credit, were Max, the dog, and Cindy Lou Who who also made the day. They both made the movie. I highly recommend this movie, not especially to kids because kids could not quite comprehend a lot of the things in it, but most especially to teens and adults. Even if you say "Bah Humbug!" to Christmas, you will still like this little jewel! Jim pulled it through and saved an otherwise bad story and made it a great story yet again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ron Howard has yet to let me down.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie, I thought, "BAD IDEA", since I grew up with "Dr. Suess' How the Grinch Stole Christmas" and didn't want a good thing to be ruined. When I found out that Ron Howard was going to direct and Jim Carrey was going to star I was ecstatic, but still skeptical. Even when I saw the previews I was a bit leery.I must say that the movie was excellent!!! Jim Carrey plays the perfect Grinch and Ron Howard directed a beautiful movie. There are a few times where the camera-work was a bit odd, but nothing I couldn't deal with. Also, the humor was excellent, because some of it was obviously for the adult audience and some of it was for the child audience...and there was plenty of both to keep you laughing throughout the film. Anthony Hopkins was an added bonus to the film. He narrated the film with his excellent voice. The rest of the cast was good as well; Jeffery Tambor, Christine Baranski, Molly Shannon (who I'm usually not a fan of), and Clint Howard. I also have to mention Taylor Momsen, she was the perfect choice for the role of Cindy Lou Who, and quite a fine little actress.Overall, I thought this was an excellent cartoon-to-live-action film adaption and was quite entertaining. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that likes the original animated film and/or is a fan or Ron Howard or Jim Carrey. I hope that you enjoy the film as much as I did. Thanks for reading,-Chris</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like Jim Carey, watch it! This movie takes the classic Dr. Seuss story (at times word for word), and adds a much longer story-line, looking back at WHY the Grinch hates Christmas so much, in a classic Jim Carey-esqe style. Very amusing once you get over the whole "I know this story already, and it was told a little differently" idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outrage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that I love Doctor Seuss, Ron Howard's films, and the stylistic acting of Jim Carrey. Not even the three of them combined could make up for this film.The original Grinch is a classic. No other word for it. It stays true to the original Dr. Seuss story, and was very well done, from the animation to the performance of Boris Karloff. Best Christmas special ever. And, of course, when I went to this movie, I knew they would have to add a few things and elongate the story to turn this into a 90 minute + movie. Fine. But I expected a lot better than what was presented to me as a viewer.I honestly can't find more than one good thing about this movie. The special effects were lousy, the music was forgettable, and the sets were obviously cardboard. Even the performance by Jim Carrey, hailed by many, was bad. I don't see the Grinch as being eccentric, I see a grouch with no sense of humor, which is the exact opposite of what Jim gave. Not only was his performance TOO over-the-top, the script was generally dull and boring. As you can imagine, I left the theater with a disposition that would make the Grinch look like a puppy in comparison. I was also angered at the thought that thousands of children will be exposed to THIS Grinch before they see the original.And the original story was ripped to shreds. The Whos are portrayed as being selfish and greedy. They aren't in the Christmas spirit, they just want to outdo each other with decorations and presents. Totally against the spirit of the book. Dr. Seuss must be spinning in his grave. Too much was added, in fact, so much was added, by the time they got to the main story, there was only 20 minutes left in the movie. Then, they had to cram the rest of the story in, giving little credit to the actual story of the Grinch and his plot to "steal" Christmas. There was little stealing, here.All in all, one of the worst, for everyone involved. I don't think I'm being to hard on this movie, because it deserved it. Maybe I should watch it again to see if I just didn't get it. Yeah. Or I could shoot myself in the foot. /********** (0/10 stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had hope. I love the Grinch, and while I had my doubts about a live-action version stretched out over four times the length of the original, I knew it could be done and I know Jim Carrey was passionate about this project...But it stunk. I was with my father and my sister, who both adore the story as well, and even they came out disappointed. Aside from how ridiculous it was having on of the most over-budgeted, over-advertised and over-merchandised film of the year try and preach about commercialism, it just didn't work in it's own right. A lot of the film was just down right spooky (the grinch as a young schoolboy, an over-the-hill Christine Baranski's breasts being shoved in our faces constantly) - they essentially made an average Hollywood kids movie our of a classic story that deserves better. Most of the movie is an entirely new story, with few redeeming moments, and when the real Grinch story finally begins, about an hour and ten minutes into the film, it had already exhausted my hopes and interest.There were a few good moments. Jim Carrey's version of the "You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch" would be great if it wasn't trapped inside such a horrible movie. But, during many parts, it seemed people around me were amused - even the millionth time they played the dog walking on it's hind legs for laughs.</fullReview>

I want to pretend that it was just a bad dream so that it doesn't totally ruin the wonderful book or original animated classic for me. This "Grinch" just goes to prove that throwing money at something doesn't make it better. My problem wasn't with Jim Carrey; he did fine considering he had to act under all that fake fur. My problem was with the unnecessary subplot to fill in about 75 unnecessary minutes. Shame on Universal and Imagine to serve up this obnoxious movie</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ The problem with this movie is that it changed the entire meaning of the story. In the original one, i was under the impression that it was the Whos who redeemed the grinch, and made him realise the 'true' meaning of christmas. I walked out of The Grinch with the impression that, by stealing all of their presents, Jim Carrey had redeemed The Whos, and made THEM realise the meaning of christmas, rather than vice-versa. All the c*** with that little Cindy lou who as the protagonist of the film made absolutely no sense. i knew that this story couldnt be turned into a movie, and i was right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of course a "Grinch" movie is going to make money with big names like Jim Carey and Ron Howard...At 104minutes long, the movie should have been 90minutes long. There was easily 14 minutes of pure GARBAGE. Jim Carey could have done such a splendid job of playing the Grinch; however, it seems obvious that Ron Howard allowed Mr. Carey to do his thing - unfortunately, it was severely over done! While I couldn't think of anyone more perfect to play the Grinch, someone needed to put a leash on Carey as he drastically overplayed and ruined this movie. It's unfortunate, the movie could've been so much more... with LESS! I just watched this movie for the first time in 10yrs with my little girls, and I hated it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why? Why was this made? Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's bad, necessarily, just pointless, which is almost as, well, bad. Amazing how all this money was spent and the final product doesn't even come close to either the 10-page story (or however many pages it was) and the 1/2 hour-long 1966 cartoon.Visually, this live-action Grinch is perhaps the best rendition (the Grinch himself, that is; the live-action Whos look ridiculous), but that's about all this movie has over the other two. Compare the flawless narration of Boris Karloff to the lackluster narration of Sir Anthony Hopkins (who sounds as if he'd rather be doing anything else; I got the strong sense that he was bored to tears doing this) and you can't help but wonder what's the point. Compare Thurl Ravenscroft's rendition of "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" to Carrey's spastic rendition and you'll want to sew Jim Carrey's lips shut.Finally, compare the pacing. This story didn't need to be more than a few pages or half an hour long. Yet, somehow, this film is 104 minutes! 80 minutes, I can perhaps understand, but 104? Why, for example, the protracted role of Cindy Lou Who? Not enough justification to make a movie, I'm sorry to say. At one point when she asks Grinch-Santa what Christmas is about and he tells her toys, she answers "that's what I was afraid of."Excuse me while I gag myself with a fork."Unnecessary" is all I can think of to say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dr. Suess must be turning in his grave...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a total desecration of Dr. Suess' classic children's story. The whole point of the story is that Christmas (and the holiday season in general) is about more than flamboyant decorations and superficial gifts. It's about generosity, compassion, and kindness. I know it sounds corny, but I believe it and so did Dr. Suess. Yet, this movie made millions of dollars while saying in its script that money is not important.The charisma exhibited by the grinch in the book was not exhibited by the grinch in the movie. Cindy Lou Who became a type of "good guy," constantly trying to edify the grinch. In the book, she is simply a symbol of innocence and childish wonder. That's already profound. She doesn't need to become a prostlytizer to proove anything. The simplicity of the Whos was also extracted from the movie. In the book, they had a wonderful appreciation of humility. In the movie, they, well, didn't. This holiday season, watch the animated movie version. Or, better yet, read the book to your kids. Dr. Suess was nice enough to share his extraordinary talent for writing children's literature with the world. Let's honor his memory by not changing his work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard has made some solid films over the years but I have absolutely no idea what made him think he could pull this off. In adapting the classic Dr. Seuss book, previously filmed as a charming cartoon, he seems to be going for Gilliamesque or Burtonish visual weirdness, but has instead ended up with an ugly, nightmarish, misconceived disaster of grotesque proportions.The sets are horribly tacky, the Who make-up looks like it was designed to give kids sleepless nights, the zany direction is beyond irritating, and any sweetness inherent in the source material is buried beneath an avalanche of padding and inappropriately adult humour (wife swapping in Whoville? Really?). As if all that wasn't bad enough, Jim Carrey is predictably unbearable as the title character.Truly one of the worst films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is very funny, but this movie was a complete failure to me. It was just a bizarre, poorly-written kiddie movie, which are among the worst kinds of movies. I'm surprise it did as well as it did. I thought it was pretty bad. There were almost no funny jokes, the Grinch was way too bizarre (the kid version of him was too sadistic also), and when those elements weren't being presented, it was filled with corniness often found in bad kiddie movies. The way the Grinch was written was what ruined the whole movie for me. He was just too bizarre and too sadistic. I'm sure Jim Carrey did what he could with it, but "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is one story that shouldn't have been made into a full-length, non-animated movie. I thought it should've stayed an animated, 1950s TV movie. This was an attempt at "improving" a beloved tale that failed miserably. No one should have to watch this bad flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can tell from reading these reviews that some people liked this movie. I have no idea why. I don't mean to seem Grinchy. I wanted to like it. I liked the original. I like Jim Carrey movies. I could see children liking it, but there were so many inappropriate parts for young children (of course most parents these days don't seem to mind). I haven't seen a movie I thought was this bad since Yor-Hunter From the Future.First, what made the original so successful was the rhyming in the background. That is why the last half hour was tolerable because the narrator is reading the story and we are watching the action that goes along with it. Without that, the story is just boring and it is for the first hour.Second, the original was pure. It was a simple story about Christmas and the Christmas spirit. In this they threw in a love triangle and a shaving incident gone bad that simply confused everything. It was almost as if they were simply passing time.Third, the flash back scenes made no sense. The Grinch was never a nice person, yet somehow they threw in other scenes that made it seem like the Mayor and his unrequited love were the reasons for his Grinchiness.I could go on, but I won't. Like I said, some people liked it, so I wouldn't avoid seeing it just because I said so. However, you can't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ron Howard takes an unusual and much loved Children's Classic and turns it into PG rated forgetable trash. Great makeup and creative props and sets, but the writers couldn't decide whether "Grinch" would be a children's Christmas movie or a pandering money-maker. The audience would have been as big without the crude dialogue, "kiss this, Whoville," "bitchin' ride," and a kiss on the wrong end of the Grinch's dog. My eleven year old son though these scenes, as well as the scene with the Grinch's head embedded between the breasts of his childhood love interest, were terrific. I wonder if Ronnie Howard's mother would be proud of her son's crude remake of a charming Christmas Classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1966 a great half hour of television was aired near Christmastime. It was the original How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and it was a warm and flaming work of art, in prose, poetry, and form. Two years ago it was remade into the most contrived film in a long time. One must give Howard's film the credit that it was well imagined--the landscapes were grand, the makeup was well-done (thank you Rick Baker), and Carrey was as eccentric as ever. But... The film failed horribly as a story. The cinematography was childish (not that one should expect grandiose cinematography in a family film). The plot was butchered, with the origin of the Grinch, a far-too-long delving into how the Grinch came about (a key party, no less), and a bad shave. This simply wasted time. The movie was too much like Space Jam. It took good characters and made them nothing more than billboards. Suess' storybook fantasy was bastardized, and Universal made millions. This is what is wrong with Hollywood. Go rent the original, you'll be doing the kids a favor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie of 2000 (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This adaptation of the classic Dr Seuss story is directed by Ron Howard, whose flair for stunning visuals is matched only by his full head of hair. This looks terrible. The sets look like something I got free with a Happy Meal. Remember the plastic rocks in the Flintstones movies? They were quarried to make these sets.Ron Howard is a great director, but he hasn't got any unique style. As much as I love Apollo 13, Backdraft and Ransom, they're not particularly exciting to look at. He's just not the right director for something like this. Couldn't the idiot-execs look for someone else? Tim Burton isn't the only guy in Hollywood with an imagination. Okay, he probably is, but you'd think there'd be someone who can fake it better than Ron Howard. In place of invention, we have only wonky camera angles. `Hey, guys, put the camera on a 45 degree angle, that'll give it an other-worldly kind of look.'Jim Carrey, in the lead role, is as annoying as always. Having toned things down for The Truman Show and even for Me, Myself and Irene, he's back to his old rule of comedy for The Grinch: loud = funny. Look! at his arms flailing around wildly. See! his face contorted into comical expressions. Yawn! as you realise you've seen it all before.I haven't read How the Grinch Stole Christmas, so I can't say how this works as an adaptation, but I can say how it works as a movie. It doesn't. It doesn't work at all. There's no magic, there's no awe or wonder. And it gets the pace and the tone so wrong you'd think this was a first time director. If this is how Ron Howard's movies are going to turn out from now on he'd better cross his fingers for a Happy Days reunion.The plot, which is covered in 60-something pages in the book, is too thin for a hundred minute movie. It is stretched more blatantly than Zsa Zsa Gabor's face. The result is 50-tog padding, where the running time is allowed to drag at the expense of the pace. The tone is lost completely. Most kids' movies have a few jokes that serve as a nod to the long-suffering parents in the audience, but the `adult' jokes here suggest that Whoville has racism, infidelity and wife-swapping parties. Unbelievable.In place of charm, we get sentiment so cloying that tie-in sick bags would have been best-sellers. The real meaning of Christmas isn't presents ? it's about love, it's about being with friends. The Grinch comes to realise this ? an hour too late for my comatose backside ? and celebrates Christmas in time for the finale. Hooray! We all come to realise that Christmas is about more than money and capitalism and commercialism. The Grinch took more than 50 million dollars in its opening weekend. Merry Christmas, everybody!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had a sense of foreboding watching ads for this, noticing it looked silly &amp; too far removed from the book or even the cartoon. But even that didn't prepare me for when my family rented it &amp; I was stuck watching it. I was right when I guessed it was a movie to keep away from; the whole time I sat there thinking "This isn't good, this isn't good". Usually when I love a movie I decide while watching, but it's AFTER that I say I hate it. Jim Carey wasn't to blame - like every other role I see him preform, he did very well. The zaniness he put into the Grinch matched that of other characters - the Mask, Ace Ventura, the Riddler. The problem w/the Grinch - &amp; just about everything else - was that it was anti-Suess in a way. Instead of being comical for all, it's not anything you'd understand if you're under 10. The writers fowled up too many points from the book. The Grinch is supposed to be an enigmatic Christmas-hater who isn't in public except to steal the holiday 1 year. In this he's an obnoxious prankster who wrecks havoc everywhere. The scene where he's in the post office cackling while switching notes "This is yours and now it's his; this was his and now it's hers" made me sick. The worst 1 was when he stands on the cliff overlooking Whoville reading a list proclaiming, "I hate you...Hate...Hate...Double-hate...LOATHE!" That works fine for a wacky Carrey character, but ruins the Grinch's. Cindy becomes a main character - in the book she's mentioned 1ce; in the old cartoon she's shown most probably because she's only named person. Here she's the 1 person who feels that there's more to Christmas than $/gifts &amp; tries to convince every1 else - even by dragging the Grinch into the picture. The audience never learns WHY he hates Christmas; he just does &amp; it's left at that. But here we get a ludicrous story of how he mixed w/the Who kids, had a love relationship ridiculed on Christmas, &amp; became a recluse. It's pretty stupid how after this the narrator goes "The Grinch hated Christmas, no 1 quite knows the reason" to keep the book's old line! It's almost as if the audience is supposed to give him a sympathy card &amp; hate the townsfolk! The attempt to let him join the holiday made him a target by his old rival, the current Mayor (Jeffrey Tambor) &amp; that's when he decides to crash the party, then "steal" Christmas. 1 change that seems small is actually a big deal - the Whos' being materialistic is 1 major change from the book &amp; ruins the story. After "stealing" Christmas, the Grinch hears them singing joyously anyway, &amp; realizes Christmas isn't about gifts. But since these Whos are greedy, they have to learn the lesson as if "stealing" it actually needed to be done! "Grinch" - his name here; his title is not "the Grinch" as it should be - having a romance w/a human is rotten. I just know Dr. Suess is turning in his grave at that. I'll admit this isn't 100% bad - the scenes of Max, especially dancing, the definition of potpourri &amp; the tunnel ride are laughable; the cartoon song is thankfully still around; the cat getting vacuumed w/the gifts is embarrassingly funny. But these details only save it from getting a 0; it's beyond help. As a movie on its own, I'm sure it's another funny 1 about the real meaning of Christmas, like "The Kranks". But if you have any knowledge of the book or even the cartoon, avoid this horrible mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Review: Big budget remake of the beloved Dr. Seuss cartoon about a grumpy green creature intent on sabotaging Christmas by stealing it from the unsuspecting, kindhearted townsfolk below.I'm going to take a quote from one user's post:This is a very good film. Better than the animated original.With all due respect to that reviewer, I'm going to put a variation to that quote:This is a very bad film. Completely inferior to the animated original.For me, the animated Grinch special was a special part of my childhood, and yes I proudly count myself amongst the diehard loyalists who border on the word "nerd", that had a genuine dislike for this movie. Granted, it really is difficult to take a cartoon and spin it into an hour and a half feature, but the way this film is shot, is completely obnoxious in every sense of the word. You get the feeling that Carrey and Howard weren't proud of this film as it caused them to betray their artistic sensibilities in favor of a really big paycheck. "The Grinch" is a far inferior live action remake/adaptation of the beloved Dr. Seuss character where it's lead character is an obnoxious buffoon, it's Jim Carrey in green makeup. Jim Carrey living up to his persona of being Ace Ventura. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Carrey, but I can honestly say I despised this movie 100%. "The Grinch" is a movie that feels genuinely fake, where you can't take yourself away into imagination and fantasy because all you really see on screen is just a bunch of movie sets and some makeup, there's no connection to the material that makes it feel like the cartoon. It's baseless commercial dreck that was only a bore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since seeing Ron Howard's How the Grinch Stole Christmas, I have been trying to come up with alternate titles to describe how I feel about it. A few came to mind: How Dr. Seuss Spins in his Grave, or how about How Opie Ruins a Classic. I wish someone can explain how a book with less than 200 words can be made into a feature film. Even after seeing this movie, I still don't understand. Howard has always lacked an identity as a filmmaker and here he does his best imitation of Tim Burton. The film is a cluttered mess that is endlessly boring due to some invented backstory of how the Grinch became the Grinch. Like I need to know. I firmly believe that if Dr. Seuss (Theodore Geisel) were alive today, he would have denounced the crude humor of Jim Carrey who prompts the mayor of Whoville to kiss his posterior by holding a piece of mistletoe up to his behind while leering at the cleavage of Christine Baranski. Shame on Audrey Geisel for whoring out her late husband's work to Hollywood. Shame on Jim Carrey for being so crude and destroying a classic character. Shame on Ron Howard for making a movie that shouldn't have been made. Somebody stop them before The Cat in the Hat with Tim Allen starts production!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas is one of my favorite films. You might think I'm crazy but I still have fun memories seeing this movie with my friends. The characters were superb, Jim Carrey and Anthony Hopkins were excellent and in fact I can do the grinch's voice very well. Anthony is probably the best narrator I have ever seen or heard in a movie. His voice is perfect for it. To me, this movie is an instant classic and way much better than that lousy Cat in the Hat movie. A very highly recommended film to see. See it please, it's a great children's story that I think every single person will enjoy. The best christmas film!!10/10!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie, but can't get what is in this movie tht is not to like. People who don't like this movie must be Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert. But I can't believe that is Mr. Carrey behind all that makeup. And I am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie has made film before this. And there is a new face in the movie. Taylor Momsen who plays Cindy Lou Who. As the opens, the Grinch (Jim Carrey) comes out of hiding. And causes some mean fun to the whos in Whoville. Sicne we know that the whos love Christmas. While The Grinch does not like christmas. And even makes fun of little Cindy Lou Who (Taylor Momsen) who is the daughter of the town's postmaster (Bill Irwin). The movie was directed by Ron Howard. And the narrtor's voice is done by Anthony Hopkins. And Jeffrey Tambor (Muppets From Space) is cast as the mayor of whoville. Who doesn't like talking about the Grinch close to Christmas time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't get why this only has a 6.0/10 rating. Despite a few corny elements, this live action adaption of the most famous Seuss classic is not only a wonderful Christmas film, it's a comedic gem. This in my opinion is one of Jim Carrey's best films, he is so darn funny and a comic genius. The film is obviously big-budget, but it works tremendously, especially the set design and the hairstyles of the Who's. It has a lot of humorous dialogue, and you don't catch it all until you see it a few times. The soundtrack is great, the acting is good, the scenery is spectacular. The storyline sticks to the original, and adds a lot of new elements, such as The Grinch's family backstory, a young girl who befriends him, and the evil Mayor of Whoville. I see this movie at least once if not twice every Christmas season, and it's just as great each time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the Grinch role is perfect for Jim Carrey's style -- overact and ham it up (when he's doing comedies at least). I have come to enjoy that from him. The Grinch story Dr Seuss wrote is genius. But there are plenty of praises already written among the 450 user reviews of this film published here. I had trouble with the middle part. Cindy Lou feels for him and invites him to town to receive an award. I don't think this was in the original story and the disaster that arises from this scene spoils a lot of the film for me. After getting a trophy and some praise, he is force-fed food and drink that he clearly doesn't like or want. His arms are nowhere to be seen and I have to assume that he is being restrained so he can't push the food away. It goes on for five minutes at least. At the lowest point in this torture, he has a tube jammed in his mouth and is force- fed such a huge quantity of liquid that he almost explodes. I found this unfunny. I found it repulsive and sick. That's no way to "honor" anyone. The Grinch reacts by throwing things around and calling them names and finishes by burning up their town tree. His anger is justified. What is Ron Howard trying to tell us? That the town that teased him as a kid still has a sadistic streak? That was never Dr. Seuss' message. For one thing it justifies his next act which is to steal Christmas. I think, therefor that it is a flaw in the film. It's still a good story. If one forgets that center lapse one can enjoy the rest of the film. It has a touching message: Christmas is in the heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's quite odd how we can enjoy a movie so much when we are a kid, yet find so many flaws and face-palms once we watch that very same film again as adults. Ron Howard's remake (or re-imagining) of Dr. Seuss's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is one of the best examples of a film I adored as a child, yet find many little problems with it now, at the age of nineteen. One of my best, most faint memories of my passed Christmases was my amazing grandfather taking me to the theatres to see this movie. I was excited because I knew the old short, and even owned it on VHS. My grandfather was excited to see more Jim Carrey comedy. We had a grand old time, I must say. To this day, we still have a spot in our hearts for this soft-hearted little film. Most people consider the greatest films on the planet are the ones that take us out of our lives and place us in a world that we've never experienced before. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is my favorite example of such a film.An unexplained green creature, called the Grinch, hates Christmas for the solo fact that it brings back the worst memories, which--in turn--made him the bitter, lonesome thing that he is. When on the parole to wreak a few mishaps in the town of Whoville before Christmas, he meets--and saves, as a matter of fact--a young girl named Cindy Lou. Cindy sees the good in the Grinch. Cindy believes that ALL people have good in them, but can sometimes be driven to bitterness through careless actions by others. This sets the film into motion, with Cindy Lou trying to get the Grinch to join the little place known as Whoville for a big, wonderful holiday bash.To begin, I must immediately state a major bravo for Ron Howard, for he has accomplished such a notable film for the Christmas season. As I have stated: there isn't many movies that take you into another world completely. "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" succeeds phenomenally at that. Ron Howard's directing is excellent, with all the set designs extremely well-crafted and suitable for Whoville. Even the mountain the Grinch lives in looks fantastic.In this film, Jim Carrey gives one of the most amazing performances in history. From what I've heard, he had an enormously hard time dealing with the suit, claiming it was extremely painful and hard to move around in whilst wearing (take notes Christian Bale). Not only is he hilarious, but he even gets the emotional moments of the film down so well that you cannot help but be moved a little on the inside. When you see hope on the Grinch's face, it truly touches you. Another bravo to Jim. Another standout was Anthony Hopkins as the narrator. Anthony gives a fantastic reading for the film, and definitely adds his own charm to it. When it comes to the rest of the cast, I can't say too much. Every role besides the Grinch and Cindy Lou were tiny, partial roles, so many of the other performances just weren't too extravagant. Cindy Lou was played by a seven- or eight-year-old, so you have to let her bad moments slide a little. This young girl plays a fine role, for the most part, and even has her very own moments that considerably warm your heart. The one character arch I thought was a little pestering was the slutty Martha May. Dear Father in Heaven, let her hang from Wholimbs upon Whotrees within Whoville.The writing is very interesting, in my opinion. Many, many subplots were added to the old, simplistic, thirty-something-page story to make it a nearly two-hour-long film. Besides the irritability of Martha May, I found other characters more of a necessity for this expanded version of "How the Grinch Stole Christmas". The jokes, for the most part, are only funny because Jim Carrey breathes a LOT of life into them. I laughed aloud many times, that much is true. Jim really knows what he is doing. He also plays off of the other characters very well, like with the "Cheermeister" sequence. No matter what others tell you, there is a heart underneath this mass of skit-like comedy. Think of it as you do untangling the Christmas tree lights for decorating; it may be a bundle of mess, but giving it time lets you learn to appreciate it.The soundtrack has to be mentioned! I consider "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" to be a fantasy film, in a way. This soundtrack helps develop the tone and atmosphere so well, and I think it is a major plus the film has going for it.Overall, many people will be divided on this little Christmas candy, but I am definitely for it. It could be that I grew up with it. Nostalgia tends to grasp me when it comes to me reviewing movies. However, I don't think it is just that. I see a genuine attempt at a warming film underneath the bundle of story and characters. My score for Ron Howard's "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a seven-out-of-ten stars. It it fun, but I do enjoy the original much, much more.Merry Christmas, and God bless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll never understand the people who don't like this movie. I guess those people don't understand what a good movie is. What was added to the movie that wasn't in the book made it much better than it otherwise would have been. I loved getting to know more about who the Grinch is and why he is the way that he is. It's always fun to watch this time of year. The insight into the Grinch isn't the only good thing about this movie. We also get to see more of the other Whos and how they do Christmas down in Whoville. As a fan of Doctor Seuss, I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to watch a good movie. You will not regret seeing this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Weird Adaptation: Great and Terrible At the Same Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine Entertainment forgot this was supposed to be a kid's movie that adults could enjoy; a quality found in Walt Disney's classic films. The film is too long and loses its magic when it strays from the Dr. Seuss book: "Who" cares about the Grinch's schooldays or that he has an aversion to shaving? (Or has a girlfriend?) The "Holiday Cheermeister" scene is just plain stupid and seems to go on forever. (It's boring.)Many things in this film are not appropriate for children: 1. The Grinch eats a glass bottle, tortures himself, hits his head and throws a tantrum like a 3-year-old. 2. He dresses like a test dummy and hurls himself into a cement wall. 3. A giant "toy monkey" that looks like a sick Batman film prop. 4. "Max" the little dog kisses the mayor's butt. 5. Force-feeding the Grinch "Christmas goodies" such as pudding and fruitcake. 6. A who-girl with cleavage and sultry clothes. 7. The use of the word "bitching" in a kid's movie? 8. The Grinch's nightmarish face and those abominable who-noses. The use of a "soft filter" presumably to provide a dream-like quality or make the make-up look better makes the film hard on the eyes and creates video scanning problems. The colors look "soft and weak" and details are "fuzzy". (The "Macrovision" anti-copy filter sure doesn't help the film's sharpness.)On a smaller screen, it plays much better. The make-up is not as scary when the faces aren't 8-feet wide. Thankfully, with disc chapters, you can edit this film for your personal taste or for a much younger audience. (Yes, it's called censoring.)The beginning plays well through the decorating and holiday shopping, then cut to the "Grinch Song" and the last third where he takes and returns all the presents and carves the Roast Beast. Touches of genius abound in this otherwise uneven production: The "Whos" live on a snowflake instead of a speck of dust. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as the narrator. The sets look just like the Dr. Seuss drawings. The new songs are excellent and the classic songs are also featured. Faith Hill belts-out a great "Where Are You Christmas?" Taylor Momsen "steals" the movie as the incredibly adorable "Cindy Lou Who." I Just down-graded my rating to a "7" after a recent viewing in 2013. I dislike (hate?) the middle part of the film. What doesn't follow the exact "Dr. Seus" storyline truly stinks. It is not a children's film. It is better suited for ages 10+ and Jim Cary fans.Consumer's note: The DVD copy comes in a paper sleeve in the Blu-Ray box, making it impossible to keep it scratch-free. That's so cheap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first Jim Carrey movie i've ever seen on DVD actually, I never got to see in it in the theaters because the day it came out, our friends took us to see 102 Dalmations instead.Now I have nothing against Glenn Close (who was a superb Cruella) but I felt kind of bummed out about missing out on this one.So the day it came out on video and DVD, I went on over to the local music/video store and I bought it.Since then, I have enjoyed watching the movie and enjoying it for what it is, which is an underrated holiday movie with very good set designs, makeup and special effects.If you like Jim Carrey, you should watch this along with the Mask, Dumb and Dumber, Liar Liar, Cable Guy, Ace Ventura, and Man On The Moon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the 1966 Animated short people were in there offices wondering if they could turn this holiday classic into a live action movie. Did they Succede? The film is about The Grinch played by Jim Carrey who lives right next to Whoville and hates it when they celebrate Christmas. So he comes up with a plan like in the original to put on a Santa suit and steal Christmas once and for all. But a little girl Cindy Lou Who played by Taylor Momsen tries to show him just how great Christmas is.This is a actually a really entertaining film with Jim Carrey providing some great material. The effects are really good, The little girl is adorable and the supporting cast like Jeffery Tambor, Molly Shannon and Christine Baranski provide some great material to. Well Did they Succede/ I like to think so. I say Check it out.Rated PG For Some Crude Humor.1hr 45min/105min.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jim Carrey is a comic genius. I know some folks find his shtick creepy, I don't. If you love Carreys style you'll love him in this movie, and I think he pretty much nails the title character on the head. Unfortunately Ron Howard and the screen writers are way off the mark with the rest of the movie. Anyone who has read the original Seuss story or watched the 60's cartoon understand the who's are a selfless fun loving race as opposed to the Grinch who is mean for meanness sake "No one quite knows the reason" Is the quote in the written work that describes him. But here the who's aren't the lovable diminutive creatures from the book, instead they resemble deformed humans and they are a mean spirited shallow lot, who celebrate Christmas for all the wrong reasons. As spiteful as the Grinch is he is at least honest about who he is and you almost root for him to destroy whoville and swipe all the presents from those snotty jerks! Add to that the unsettling camera work and visuals that depict whoville as not a happy little town but a carnival from a nightmare. So despite Carreys strong performance I can not recommend this movie. Read the book or re watch the Karloff cartoon again instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1966 animated "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" always has been and always will be one of my favorite Christmas movies. However, I was doubtful when I first got word of there being a live-action remake of the holiday classic, regardless of it starring the likes of the renowned Jim Carrey. Hoping to prove myself wrong, I watched the 104 minute film, only to be disappointed by the lack of relevance to the book and the failed attempt to re-write the plot of the book to make it last for 1 hour and 40 minutes.I do understand that many people enjoyed this movie, and I respect that. However, in my opinion the movie is mediocre, and nothing more. Stick with the 1966 version. Trust me on this.Christmas Movie Score (4/10) Overall Score (5/10) Not Recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS (2000) ***1/2 Jim Carrey, Jeffrey Tambor, Christine Baranski, Bill Irwin, Molly Shannon, Taylor Momsen, Clint Howard, Anthony Hopkins (narrator) (Dir: Ron Howard)Say what you will about Jim Carrey, but the man may be giving James Brown as The Hardest Working Man in Show Business in the latest of his tailor-made impersonations in his ongoing building to his big screen legacy as the titular, beloved grump that has entertained children of all ages for .well, all ages. Carrey, buried under all that wonderfully captured pear-shaped, mint colored fuzzy costume and scary affective make-up by wizard Rick Baker, gives all the gusto he can muster in making himself recognizable and making the iconic character a calling to his own brand of off-the-wall humor, riffing here and there, as Whoville's resident Sasquatch of sort. As the perennial Christmas season is in full bloom in the hamlet of Whos, all bustling in their eye-candy spectacular habitat of swirling, gravity defying environs and pastel colored schematics, it is tiny Cindy Lou Who (the adorable Momsen, fitted with chipmunk buck teeth) that questions why the nasty, ill-tempered outcast became the monster they all fear and have avoided dealing with for so many years. After all, it seems to her that the holiday is apparently more than the giddy rush of giving multi-colored gift-wrapped presents and stringing thousands of blinking lights across rooftops to depict the true meaning of the season. The Grinch makes no bones about his loathing for the soppy, sentimental denizens below from his garbage heaped mountain topped domain that he shares only with his skeptical, long-suffering mutt, Max. But even he begins to doubt his own behavior after several encounters with the well-meaning tiny Who, Cindy, who doesn't take him seriously at all. The script, adapted by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, nips and tucks the epic poem by the late great Seuss but allows its star to improvise and give a whirling dervish performance with much energy to spare not seen since his other green-faced incarnation of the party happy hero in `The Mask'. His voice is perhaps his best instrument inhabiting the original narrator Boris Karloff who served double duty in turn as the Grinch's speaking inflections as well as a pinch of Richard Nixon, Edward G. Robinson and dare I say Jimmy Stewart with a toothache. His eyes, hidden under reportedly painful yellow contact lenses, also get a full work out in his gleefully malevolent/benevolent turn here letting the audience in on what a ball he is having even if he is suffering for his art. Chuck Jones, who animated the television classic, was smart enough to have the ugly humbug sublime with the accent of a raised eyebrow and half-lidded indifference sustainingself-loathing rage that Carrey takes to the next level. The subplot flashback depicting The Grinch as a child ostracized by the nasty Whos in school is heart-breakingly familiar to anyone who ever endured ridicule for being `different' and seems a bit heavy-handed but the point is clearly ironed out to full effect in getting why The Grinch stole Christmas. Kudos to director Howard, who at first seems out of his element, but you'd have to go way back to `Willow' to recollect his keen observation that production design is a must in telling the tale equally as well as the tale worth being filmed. He has that in spades with a wonderfully true-to-form lifting from the book and the tv special with his team of Michael Croenblith's set designs, cinematographer Don Peterman's dark yet cheery on the edges photography and again Baker's memorable make-up (even if the Who's pig-snouted faces are a bit unsettling at first). The film also works to its seemingly adult overview with Carrey's side-of-the mouth WC Fields delivery of one-liners, double entendres and his slapstick hootenanny antics on full display here. You'd have to be a Scrooge not to enjoy this sugary candy cane of a movie.</fullReview>

I found the DVD of this movie on the shelves of my local county library, and brought it home to watch with my 14-year-old neighbors, Emily and Natalie. Jim Carrey is perfect as the Grinch. It's a story that has been around for a long time, everyone knows it. The critic Ebert describes the movie fairly accurately, but gives it a lower rating than I do. Aside from Carrey, I especially enjoyed Bill Irwin, a virtually unknown and underrated actor who has great body movements and facial expressions. The DVD is of course sharp and colorful with great 5.1 sound. It also has a number of very nice extras for those of us who like to go behind the scenes to see how a film was made.

		<fullReview>This film?one of Ronnie Howard's crowning achievements?was a triumph of perfect casting, namely in the person of one Jim Carrey. I have always believed that Carrey is our greatest living physical comedian, nearly eclipsing even the great Buster Keaton. But even Keaton couldn't have pulled off the part of Dr. Seuss' most memorable character, especially the superb vocal component (the featured song, "You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch" proves his astounding vocal control and versatility). Without his inimitable gyrations and astounding facial contortions, this would have been just another holiday film (albeit a gorgeous one), without a heart. And the fact that Carrey pulled off this tour de force weighed down by the uncomfortable and claustrophobic wardrobe and facial prostheses he endured for months, is a miracle in and of itself. He still managed to reveal every detailed nuance and humorous facial feature in this one-of-a-kind feature film, one that will never be repeated. With all of the bad holiday films that typically come our way this time of the year, this is one that will stand the test of time. It's certainly become one of my favorites, never failing to make me laugh out loud. It's drop dead funny, hilariously satirical for the adults, and equally entertaining for the kiddies, while never losing sight of it's objective?that Christmas is a time for redemption and joy?a very difficult feat to perform, indeed. Even more wise was the decision of Howard to clearly allow the singular humor of it's star to shine through, unencumbered, for the world to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carrey Is The Grinch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a family comedy based on book of the same title by Dr. Seuss. It was the first adaption to be a film feature. Jim Carrey stars in this live-action adaptation of the classic children's story as the Grinch. Molly Shannon, Christine Baranski, Jeffrey Tambor, and Clint Howard play several of the citizens of Whoville, while Anthony Hopkins narrates the story.The film is directed by Ron Howard.He's mean, he's green, and he's doesn't like the Yuletide season one bit.High atop Mt. Crumpet, the Grinch observes the residents of Whoville joyously preparing to celebrate Christmas.The Grinch was born in Whoville years ago, but was shunned due to his scary appearance, and his unrequited love for Martha May Whovier has turned him bitter; the good cheer of the Whos has been a thorn in his side ever since. Finally the Grinch decides he's had enough of all this happiness, and with the wary aid of his dog Max, the Grinch conspires to steal Christmas from Whoville, making off with their presents, holiday decorations, Christmas trees, and everything else used to enjoy the holiday.If a movie can unleash Jim Carrey at his finest, revamp the Grinch story, and still pay tribute to the legacy of Dr. Seuss, you can bet it qualifies as rousing entertainment.It is definitely a joy to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the Grinch Lost his Schtick in a Pinch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's any Dr. Seuss related works, I'm going to do the reviews in rhyme. Every who down in Whoville loved Christmas a lot, but the Grinch who lives on Mt. Crumpet did not... wait a minute! Does this story sound familiar to you? Well, I have a feeling this is similar to the animated classic too. However, the plot in this movie has been dragged too long. And whoever got this movie made did it all wrong. The Grinch in the Animated classic was crafty as a fox, but this Grinch looked like he escaped from the loony box! All the whos in this movie have been portrayed as materialistic while the whos in the classic taught us a message that is somewhat realistic. The only good thing in the movie is the dog named Max(And if you don't believe me, send me a fax.) I liked Jim Carrey, but not as the Grinch. Would you believe that he lost his shtick in a pinch. All I can say is that this movie stinks(And not like shoving a ton of onions down the sink).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Funny and Heartwarming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a huge fan of clich, commercial X-mas films, but I saw this movie when it first came out, purely out of love for Jim Carrey. I was NOT disappointed! Sure, it is in possession of a Hollywood ending, and a romantic back-story to boot, but I found this both hilarious and touching.Following the plot of the original cartoon and picture book by Dr. Seuss, "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" is the tale of one Grinch, masterfully played by Carrey as the bitter but witty green man, and his loathing for Christmas and all it stands for. The film goes deeper into his past, explaining that he was constantly mocked for his bitter disposition and hairy face as a kid, but when he finally got into the Christmas spirit and crafted a homemade tree angel for his heart-throb, Martha May Whovier, everyone simply laughed at his gift's lack of sparkles and beauty. Ashamed and heartbroken, the Grinch fled to Mount Crumpit, his only purpose in life to despise the holidays and all the Whos who loved it. Of course, this leads to his dastardly and outrageous plot to steal all the presents on Christmas Eve, therefor stealing the meaning of Christmas.I personally think that the movie, while embellishing on plots and characters like the darling Cindy Lou Who, had a good point to make; sometimes it seems like the holidays are nothing but material grab-bags for huge industries who take the opportunity to sell heaps of cheap junk to parents who are willing to fight to the death for their spoiled children. The Christmas ideal that is this rain of worldly wealth (oh, and a little good cheer) is happiness is sold to folk every day through advertisements and TV specials, and "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is the perfect stab back at those commercial standards.While this underlying message might detract from the overall plot and script in some movies, I think this one found a good balance; the kids can still enjoy the juvenile jokes and slapstick, while the adults can giggle quietly at the adult humour and the message.Overall, I found this a wonderful movie, not just at Christmas time, but basically all throughout the year!</fullReview>

Jim Carrey is funny but he's not funny enough to be the Grinch. And they kind of portray the Grinch as some sort of a*hole in the beginning of the movie. It's like someone thought. ''Oh let's make this wonderful cartoon which many kids know and love and turn it into some sh*t load movie'' IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF Film What are they gonna come out with next. Rudolph? The year without a Santa Claus? Are they going to turn those into crappy real-life movies too? Now I realize the 1966 version TOTALLY blows this piece of sh*t out of the water.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent remake of a holiday classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HOW THE GRINCH STOLE Christmas, in my opinion, is excellent remake of a holiday classic. I really enjoyed Jim Carrey singing, "You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch." However, I totally despised May-Who (Jeffrey Tambor). This was because he wanted the Grinch to have nothing to do with Whoville's Christmas celebration. Also, in my opinion, Cindy Lou-Who (Taylor Momsen) was a really cute little girl. In addition, another thing that makes this film worth seeing is Faith Hill's rendition of "Where Are You Christmas?" As a matter of fact, all the music is good. In conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent remake of a holiday classic to everyone, especially all you Jim Carrey fans who have not seen it. When you see it, prepare to laugh and have a good time.</fullReview>

Ron Howard's direction needed to be seriously toned down. The good makeup, the cute Taylor Momsen as Cindy Lou Who, and even Sir Anthony Hopkins doing the narration could not save this boring, deplorable and unfunny trash.

		<shortDescription>How Hollywood stole a good story...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The same way massive marketing schemes have turned Christmas into a big shopping fest, Hollywood has succeeded in turning a wonderful old heartfelt story into a giant Jim Carrey showcase. If there was as much substance to the story-telling in this as there was substance to the extravagant scenery, it might have been worth watching. I do, or did, have some respect for Jim. He does tend to put his heart into his roles, and there were moments, when I did feel like I was looking into the eyes of that old green cartoon character. However, a few less sarcastic one-liners might have been a bit less distracting. Overall, I feel that this is yet another Hollywood rip-off. A wonderful old story, with a clear lesson to teach, poisoned by sarcastic one-liners causing endless distraction. In future, when I want to help bring on the Christmas spirit, I'll rely on a good old time-tried tradition, the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very badly made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very, very, very badly made film indeed. Ron Howard's direction is totally wanton and gutless. The cinematographer obviously thought that if the camera went squint for about.99.9999% of the film it would mean that he was being creative. A little note to all: diagonal camera shots do not make good photography. It looks moronically awful.The art and set design is cheap too. Everything is way too close together and cramped looking. You cannot really make anything out at all. And in some shots you can see the roof of the sound-stage. I reckon about $50 in total was spent on production design.Half the film was pointless effects that did nothing for me. They did not make the film look magical. No, they certainly did not. The Whos look really stupid too. What on earth are they supposed to be? They look like the Beagle Boys from Duck Tales. To sum it up in 2 words they look 'totally ridiculous'. In the scene where the Grinch shaves the Mayor's head.why do they start screaming and running away? That whole scene was the worst directing I have ever scene. I know that this is a kid's movie and, believe me, there were many kids in the audience. There were hardly a couple of laughs among them.The type of humor in this film is the kind that expects you to laugh when someone walks into a lamppost or falls into a custard pie. Come on. This is the 21st century and we're STILL getting this trash that passes itself of as a movie?Not even the hugely talented Carrey can save this steaming pile of trash. I don't think anyone could. He simply is NOT funny. You'd think that playing the Grinch would be a role he could twist and manipulate. But no, it's a kiddie's movie. So he just acts stupid without being funny. The cartoon is way better. I suggest you watch that instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Seuss story is well-known and loved by all. But is this new version really necessary?The emotional and moral core of this film revolves around the question "Is Christmas all about presents (which can be extended to encompass commercialism and gross consumerism) or friends and family?" The warm feeling you get when the expected conclusion is drawn (and not very well) is muddled by the fact that you've just watched a $100 million juggernaut steamroll your emotional responses. How can you resist the cute little residents of Whoville? How can you avoid letting that "warm feeling" spur you on to purchase hundreds of dollars worth of Grinch(tm) -related items?There was a turning point in the career of Jim Carrey. That fork in the road was called "The Cable Guy". Instead of making movies that could push the envelope and his audience, he instead choose to push the high-water mark for the highest paid actors in Hollywood.There are some funny moments with Grinch and his dog alone in their cave. But you've probably already seen them on TV as part of the marketing campaign for this film.Jim Carrey's talent is literally buried in this film. Even Carrey's irrepressible mania cannot claw its way out from under three hours worth of makeup.If you aren't taking a seven-year-old, don't go see this movie. Even if you are, I would suggest reading the book or watching the cartoon Grinch instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"How the Grinch Stole Christmas" is a Christmas classic that usually receives repeated viewings in my household. The Grinch is a timeless tale of tolerance, discised as a fantasy. It's the perfect way to put your Little Cindy Lou Who to bed on Christmas Eve, or any night of the year. "Hurton Hears A Who" is another delightful story, which will be especially popular with animal lovers. The animated adaptations of these two stories are a "hateful" of fun! Here's more on each of the shorts, because a person is a person no matter how small and you deserve some good protect information. You can keep your Frosty the Snowman, Rudoplh the Red Nosed Reindeer, and all the rest. Just let me have my Grinch. Quite simply, this is the best movie that money can buy- a wonderful gift and you never can have too many Grinch movies. Any family should own this movie. After all, who can resist this tale of selfishness conquered by love? Not me, that's for sure. I'm not really into seeing the Jim Carrey version; nothing can top this Dr. Seuss masterpiece. Not even Hollywood. The Grinch is a mean one, and your kids will think YOU'RE mean if you don't stuff their stocking with this. It's collectively a perfect disc, and kids will be excited to hear that the soundtracks to both films appear unabridged on a single disc.

Never before has the term "wretched excess" been more appropriately applied. the GRINCH seeks to hide behind a patina of green hue his scarlet horrors. Yet, walks he not on cloven hoof? Much as the CAT IN THE HAT, whose merry cajoles seek to tempt the idle child toward sin, by covering his foul horns with a freakish hat. ? The horrible mole-faced people of Whoville are the stuff of nightmares. The sets are eyesores. Heck, the dog isn't even cute! Adults, be warned: if you are coerced by a well-meaning child into watching this ridiculous mess, you will welcome the urge to vomit afterwards, in the vain hope that doing so will purge the experience from your memory.

Still has the same ending you all grew up with.I think that this movie will be loved by children for generation, unless a remake is made. If so, it better be as good at this or better. Unlike most sequels to movies like the Mask 2.I recommend this movie to everyone, especially children.I took one rating off because this movie was sort of cheesy and predictable, but it didn't really ruin anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>how could there be a world inside a snowflake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this film I think it is very very funny mostly because of Jim Carrey but it still has some funny parts with him not in it. I watched this film in theaters and I was only 10 years old at the time and I still liked it. though I was almost 11 my birthday is in January and I think this movie came out in November. I know that it came out in 2000 and I think it came out in November I'm not really sure but I'm pretty sure.If it did I'm very sure it should have came out at Christmas. first of all it is a Christmas movie with people who like Christmas and Christmas decorations and a Christmas feel to it. so if it came out in November it should have came out in December. The only thing I found weird about it is that it had all the things in the movie in a snowflake they had humans decorations creatures in a snowflake. If you don't like realistic worlds inside something that can't have a world inside of it then you should not watch this movie. but besides that I like it for other reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then the DaVinci Code</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a fantastic re-incarnation of the best-seller book 'How the Grinch stole Christmas'. This is truly a great movie for all ages. Jim Carreys acting is absolutely perfect for the Grinch, you actually forget that its him during the movie, mainly because the make-up department did absolutely wonderful (i'm running out of 'really good' words here) but also I hear it was painful for Jim Carrey.If you don't see this movie, then I'll just watch it again and again for all of you because it truly is a classic.Jim Carrey really does steal the show, 9 stars from me, feel-good movie of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff not necessarily better than Carrey, just different</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up watching the Boris Karloff animated version of this story and enjoyed it a lot. I was concerned that too much would be added to the original, but I thought most of what was new here added something. It was toward the middle of the movie that flashbacks showed how the Grinch came to be so mean, though we didn't get to see a lot of detail about how his isolation became so permanent. And no one explained how the Grinch became such a brilliant inventor living in a cave by himself. Where he got all the parts for his gadgets, of course, was simple--he lived near where Whoville dumped its trash.The movie's best performances came from Jim Carrey and Taylor Momsen when they were together. Taylor did an outstanding job by herself as Cindy Lou, who had to be quite a bit older, with her role greatly expanded in this version. I wish I could say the same for Carrey, whose movies I have enjoyed for some time. But he was quite good at times. He perfectly captured the evil grin the Grinch showed in the book and cartoon (though part of that was makeup, I'm sure). And he showed that the Grinch may not have been that evil after all. Still, Boris Karloff did the Grinch better as a truly evil creature.I enjoyed it when this movie attempted to duplicate the cartoon and the book, though without Thurl Ravenscroft (best known as Tony the Tiger) to sing "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch", that song lacked something. Anthony Hopkins did a nice job narrating, and I don't think Karloff could have done any better himself. The dog was good too: we were constantly reminded of his talent during commercials because he is now on 'Complete Savages' on ABC. I have to question whether Carrey needed quite so much makeup: maybe the creature could have been more human. But the makeup was well done.Christine Baranski did an okay job as a Martha Stewart type who was always competing with Cindy Lou's mother in decorating her house. There was an interesting scene where a cannon was used to put up decorations. Visual effects such as these were quite enjoyable.I thought I was finally going to find out the lyrics to that song the Whos sang on Christmas morning. There seemed to be some disagreement over those lyrics, which was funny.The movie offers two lessons about the true meaning of Christmas. One was new for this movie--Cindy Lou's charitable attitude. The other ...SPOILERS HERE IF YOU DIDN'T READ THE BOOK OR WATCH THE CARTOON... was the Grinch's realization of the fact Christmas didn't depend on presents. And the reaction of the Whos to the Grinch's deeds made more sense when shown in detail.The Grinch had more reason to be in a foul mood at Christmas in this version, of course. I thought those scenes were great where he was being honored but embarrassed after Cindy Lou persuaded the town to accept him just before the big day.The scenes of the Grinch returning to Whoville after his change of heart were very exciting, with some new twists.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really enjoyed hating every minute of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Throughout THE GRINCH I laughed one (1) time, at a throwaway joke about a cash bar. But, generally, this is probably the worst holiday movie I've seen (well, maybe it's not quite as boring as TRAPPED IN PARADISE). I kept getting distracted:-Why did some characters have snouts but others didn't?-Correct me if I'm wrong, but did the Grinch Have Two Mommies?-The movie's secular worldview. Are there no churches in Whoville? Much was said about the true meaning of Christmas, but no mention of the birth of Christ. I'm not religious, but do acknowledge the birth of Christ.-And, speaking of, are there no Jews? I'm awaiting the sequel, HOW THE MESHUGGA STOLE HANUKKAH.-Are there other towns in the snowflake? Is that where the Jews reside, or did they move to the Whoville equivalent of Florida - in the drop of a hurricane's rain?-Why was the visual texture so fuzzy and indistinct, the sets so creepy and unpleasant? Isn't this supposed to be a kiddie movie? -Why didn't the little girl recognize the Grinch in the Santa outfit? Was she stricken with blindness during that scene, or just stupidity?There are other points I've already forgotten, but the biggest thing I hated was the general message. So, someone who hates Christmas is automatically a freak who should be pitied. Guess that makes me one, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Top Ten WORST Films of All-Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ugly, cheesy, noisy, messy, film adaptation of Seuss' classic animated holiday story.Sloppily directed by Ron 'Opie' Howard with a broader-than-broad performance by Jim Carrey in the part of 'The Grinch'. There is absolutely no warmth or charm in this train wreck of a film - and even less comedy. The Grinch eating glass did not make me laugh... it only made my teeth hurt. A modified script depicting 'The Whos of Whoville' as shallow individuals doesn't help. Forget about this one unless you're curious to see how bad a movie can actually be.'Dopey Opie' gets the blame for this pathetic fiasco.</fullReview>
