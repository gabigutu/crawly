		<shortDescription>It Oozes Elegance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This whodunit story by Dame Agatha is excellent. She has always been my favorite writer of detective fiction. I keep returning to the film version, however, not because of the story but because of the film's sheer elegance and style. It is awash in elegance ... the majestic cinematography; the glamorous clothes; the delightfully eccentric aristocratic characters; the mysterious yet refined musical score. The film is so theatrically regal I'm surprised that it did not feature a representative of British royalty.The setting is Europe in the 1930's. The pace is slow and relaxed. And while the dialogue is in English, the film has a deliciously international flavor, with a mix of interesting accents and word pronunciations. Heavy on dialogue, the film never seems overly talky, the result of a clever screenplay and lush visuals. Humor is included in the script usually in the form of tasteful put-downs. Example: an attractive Mrs. Hubbard comments: "Don't you agree the man must have entered my compartment to gain access to Mr. Ratchett?" The aging Princess Dragomiroff responds in a deadpan tone: "I can think of no other reason, madam."In his portrayal of Hercule Poirot, Albert Finney almost literally disappears into the role, a tribute to convincing makeup and to Finney's adroit acting. His performance is appropriately idiosyncratic, deliciously hammy, and theatrical, every bit as entertaining in this film as Peter Ustinov is in subsequent Christie movies. The rest of the cast has ensemble parts, my favorite being Wendy Hiller whose Princess Dragomiroff comes across as royal, proud, and very eccentric.With its snowy landscapes, ornate and cozy interiors, and subdued lighting, "Murder On The Orient Express" is an excellent movie to watch on a cold, winter night, snuggled under a blanket or next to a warm fireplace with a cup of cappuccino or a glass of cognac. Just be sure that all knives and daggers in your mansion are out of reach from your staff of servants.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cast To Die For</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That Sidney Lumet knows how to frame an actor within his or her character is a very well known fact - "The Pawnbroker" "Network" "Dog Day Afternoon" and some other spectacular pieces of acting prove that point unquestionably. Here, there is a sort of "divertissment". Agatha Christie given a first class treatment (not that Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple wasn't first class, but the production value here is as impressive as the cast) in the hands of Sidney Lumet who knew how to put a bunch of sensational actors in a confined space - "12 Angry Men" for instance and make it riveting. There a 12 Angry people here too and (almost) each part is cast with relish and delight. Albert Finney, marvelous, manages, not only to survive, under the weight of his characterization but to create something bold, exquisitely structured, great fun to watch and to hear. Ingrid Bergman won her third Oscar for her missionary looking after little brown babies - I thought she was a highlight indeed but in my modest opinion, Valentina Cortese for "Day For Night" deserved it that year, Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates's twin brother, also with a mother fixation and a compelling facial tic. Wendy Hiller was, clearly, having a ball and that, on the screen, is always contagious. Sean Connery and Vanessa Redgrave make a surprisingly hot pair, Lauren Bacall over does it of course but who cares, Jacqueline Bisset is breathtaking, Rachel Roberts a hoot. John Gielgud is John Gielgud and that in itself is a major plus. Colin Blakely does wonders with his moment and Dennis Quilley plays his Italian as if this was a silent movie. Martin Balsam is always fun to watch, no matter the accent. Richard Widmark is splendid in his villainy and Jean Pierre Cassel very moving indeed. The only weak spot in the cast is Michael York. Totally unbelievable. I suspect that "Murder in The Orient Express" 33 years old already, will continue delighting audiences for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Agatha Christie Finally Came Into Her Own Cinematically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agatha Christie lived long enough to enjoy something few of her contemporaries could claim.Movies based on Christie's novels and stories were being made back to the 1930s. One early one with Charles Laughton as Hercule Poiret so turned her off that she was hesitant about future productions of her work. But they were made - like the two versions of LOVE FROM A STRANGER. There were two high points: Rene Clair's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE and Billy Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (oddly enough with Laughton again, but in a better fitting performance). Then came the popular series of Miss Marple films with Margaret Rutherford, which were rewritten to emphasize Rutherford's comic abilities (and to give Miss Marple a companion - Mr. Stringer, played by Rutherford's husband Stringer Davis). Another attempt at Poirot was made, again as a comic film, THE A.B.C.MURDERS (with Tony Randall as Poirot). Christie was not amused. But in 1974 she saw her vision of Hercule Poirot as a character put properly on screen by Albert Finney in MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.It gave her a satisfaction that few mystery novelists of her age ever had. Dorothy Sayers did live to see Lord Peter Wimsey played by Robert Montgomery in BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON, but while entertaining it was not the Wimsey that she created - she died before she could see Ian Carmichael play the role on a series of television multi-episodes shows based on her novels. While Josephine Tey's novels occasionally were made into films, her Inspector Grant was not turned into a good running series character.I think that the reason that Agatha Christie was satisfied was the care that Sidney Lumet took with MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. Not only the all star cast involved, but keeping the story in the late 1920s to early 1930s style, with clothing, vehicles, and class snobbery maintained. It actually helped preserve the novel's effectiveness.The casting is quite good. Poirot is ably played by Finney, who is fussy but also serious and sharp when going over the clues and interrogations. Martin Balsam as his friend, the railroad official, is properly "watsonish", constantly jumping at conclusions as to who the killer is. Interestingly forgotten in the background is the only other passenger we learn of that is not under suspicion, the Greek doctor who assists Poirot (George Coulouris). In the 1940s Coulouris would have been a red herring at least.The suspects (led by Lauren Bacall and Wendy Hiller) are properly snobbish (especially Sean Connery). They are even snobbish towards each other. But the question of who killed the victim is handled to constantly throw off the viewers. It is one of the most perfectly balanced whodunits.I only have one minor criticism. The murder centers on a "Lindbergh" kidnap-murder tragedy of the past, and the killer has to be someone after the real brains behind the tragedy. So all the suspects happen to be connected to the victim(s). But as it turns out there was one victim who was overlooked - the patsy killer (based on Hauptmann?) who was frightened into committing the crime and was hanged. It would have been interesting if the family of this criminal also had been represented among the suspects.</fullReview>

I just wish this movie was longer, so I could relish the performances of these brilliant people even more. What a magic moment it is when LAUREN BACALL and INGRID BERGMAN clink champagne classes - you can almost hear "As Time Goes By" playing in the background.

		<shortDescription>Excellent Agatha Christie murder mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love murder mysteries. I'm a sucker for them whether it's reading a book or seeing a movie. "Murder on the Orient Express" is one of the best murder mystery movies ever made. Based on the novel by mystery sleuth Agatha Christie, it takes you on a ride by train where we meet an assortment of colorful characters all traveling on the Orient Express. When one of these characters is murdered, the rest become suspects. And it's up to famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot to solve the crime. "Murder on the Orient Express" has an intriguing script, good direction, and a spectacular cast to boot. Albert Finney is picture perfect in his Oscar nominated portrayl of the fussy Poirot. While watching Finney in this movie, I can't believe that this is the same man who played Julia Roberts' boss in "Erin Brockovich" because he's so unrecognizable here. Finney is supported by an all-star cast of mostly familiar faces. Of the actors playing the suspects, Lauren Bacall scores highest as an annoying American woman who talks loud and isn't afraid to say what's on her mind. Also good: the great Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar (her third overall) for her small performance as an African missionary; and Martin Balsam as the director of the line and Mr. Poirot's personal friend. Jacqueline Bisset, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Rachel Roberts, Richard Widmark, and Michael York round out the familiar cast. "Murder on the Orient Express" is a classy movie to be sure. Is this the best murder mystery movie ever made? Almost. A few years later came the next Agatha Christie movie "Death on the Nile", which in my opinion topped "Murder on the Orient Express" and ranks as my all-time favorite mystery movie. But "Murder on the Orient Express" places right behind "Death on the Nile" as the second best. There is no question that these two movies would be perfect to show on television as a double feature. Stick 'em on AMC, and your all set. ***1/2 (out of four)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding adaptation from Agatha Christie novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is an excellent whodunit and concerns upon one murder in the Orient Express train with Hercules Poirot (Albert Finney) as sleuth-man to solve it . There are many suspects , all support cast : Sean Connery , Ingrid Bergman , Anthony Perkins , Vanessa Redgrave , Jacqueline Bisset , Richard Widmark , Rachel Roberts , John Gielgud , Michael York , etc . Who's the killer? . Poirot is helped by a ¨Watson-alike¨ (Martin Balsam) and they will track down to culprit at the end .At the beginning of the film talks about a kidnapping and killing a baby similarly to the Lindberg's son and which the murderer was condemned to death row , this one will be related with the death of the train.The motion picture is only set on two scenarios : the station and train . However this doesn't make boring it.The runtime movie is overlong : two hours and some but isn't slow-moving and is amount amusing for suspense and tension.First-rate interpretation specially from Albert Finney and Ingrid Bergman , Oscar winner as best secondary actress .The set design and costumes are riveting , the flick is magnificently set by that time . Evocative musical score by Richard Rodney Bennett . Geoffrey Unsworth's cinematography is atmospheric and colorful.Sidney Lumet's direction is fascinating such as ¨12 angry men¨ .The movie will appeal to suspense enthusiasts and thriller lovers.Rating: 7,5/10 . Very good</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the best introduction to Hercule Poirot for non-readers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet directs a great cast through a brilliant cinematic interpretation of one of Agatha Christie's most popular Hercule Poirot Mysteries. The train upon which the great investigator finds himself is halted by an avalanche of snow in the Alps, and two horrible crimes seem to have intersected in the first class cabin. Despite the cramped quarters, the only witness is the murder victim himself, and Poirot must put together the solution from disparate and seemingly contradictory evidence.The three most striking qualities of this film are its production values, cast, and Finney's exhausting performance. Although a little over-the-top, Finney gets Poirot exactly right - Poirot is played as a somewhat obsessive, slightly manic, and flamboyant Belgian - not at all as a non-English Sherlock Holmes. The cast speaks for itself. Bacall, Perkins, Hiller, Redgrave, York and Bissett are all delightful in their supporting roles. But perhaps the most under-recognized achievement of this film is its cinematography. The film is extremely visually engaging from start to finish. This is achieved by perfect visual pacing, great camera work, spectacular - though somewhat cramped and redundant - sets, good costuming, and a stunningly attractive cast.Murder on the Orient Express also succeeds in sticking with Christie's original narrative (mostly), and sets a high standard for film versions of the great mystery writers repertoire. From my perspective, the film remains unequaled among the Poirot interpretations and meets the challenge of adapting and simplifying Christie's often complex exposition very nicely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well executed murder in every sense of the word.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murder on the Orient Express started a nice trend in filming some of the most stylish of Agatha Christie novels by producer John Brabourne. Although Albert Finney who does a fine job as the Belgian Sleuth Hercule Poirot declined to do further films with Poirot, Peter Ustinov more than amply took up the slack in later productions.Richard Widmark is an American expatriate traveling on the famous Orient Express train and he's been receiving mysterious death threats. As it happens Poirot is on the train also and refuses Widmark's offer to be a bodyguard. Widmark is later stabbed to death in his compartment and while the train is stranded somewhere in Yugoslavia due to snow drifts, Poirot investigates the murder in the best Agatha Christie tradition. Of course in that same tradition the plotters would have gotten away with it more than likely had Poirot and his little gray cells not been present.Widmark as it also turns out was a gangster who had to flee America because he was named as the mastermind of a horrific crime that shocked the nation. There are a whole lot of people who had reason to want him dead.Poirot conducts his inquiry of the other passengers and they are quite a crew consisting of among others, Lauren Bacall, Michael York, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Wendy Hiller, Rachel Roberts, Vanessa Redgrave, Jacqueline Bissett, etc. Of course I won't tell you the solution, but here's a hint. Note what Sean Connery says while he's being grilled.It's a great ensemble cast of course with a bunch of seasoned players doing their thing. Ingrid Bergman got a Best Supporting Actress award for her portrayal of a simple soul who is a missionary. I'm betting the critics noted that her part was offbeat casting for her which she pulled off. In any event she was surprised as all get out when her name was read at the Oscars in 1975. In accepting the award she got up and said quite matter-of-factly that fellow nominee Valentina Cortese deserved it. Of course she didn't turn it down.As I said, this was one elaborately planned murder and I think you will enjoy seeing Poirot unravel it and what happens later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave it to Poirot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That Poirot. Always a beacon for dreadful things which happen just within earshot, and only he up to the task of solving them. If only he could get a break and take off to some far-away land and relax from the evils that men do.But Agatha Christie has other things in hand. On a trip between Paris and Istanbul, something quite horrible happens to another passenger, one Mr. Ratchett, a man who has been suspected to have been the mastermind behind the Lindbergh baby incident in which she was kidnapped and killed. It would be up to the local authorities to come and intervene, but a snowstorm has stalled the train midway and Poirot has to locate the killer.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is drenched in style and reminds me of GOSFORD PARK, its much younger cousin. When a movie has so much acting and overacting and actors of such stature such comparisons will not be overlooked, but this story has a lot more up its sleeve which I won't reveal for those who haven't seen it. Suffice it be to say that the names alone (while in later years did not guarantee a good film, here they do) are of this caliber: Lauren Bacall, Albert Finney (as Poirot), Ingrid Bergmann (who won an Oscar, her third, for Best Supporting Actress), Sean Connery, Anthony Perkins, Jacqueline Bisset, Vanessa Redgrave, Sir John Gielgud, Martin Balsam, Richard Widmark, Michael York, Wendy Hiller, Jean-Pierre Cassel, George Coulouris, and Rachel Roberts.Boasting one of the most riveting monologues ever committed on film, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS remains one of the more sumptuous Agatha Christie whodunits and is another strong (if atypical) film in veteran film director Sidney Lumet's career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An all star cast aboard a luxuary train are questioned and suspected of a murder when one of the passengers who was already fearing for his life is found dead and all this seems to be releated to a child that was kidnapped and murdered years earlier. Exceptionally done thriller is a homage to the mysteries of Hollywood's golden age with fun and brilliantly done performances from a seasoned cast, but Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, and an unreconizable Albert Finney really stand out. Magnaficent score, sets, costumes, color schemes, dialogue, and a fine eye for detail just add to the fun. Never a dull or boring moment; the finale is really, really good. I just love everything about this film. Very highly recommanded film is in my top 10 films of the 70's and is in my top 100 films of all time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Elegant, star studded whodunit aboard the legendary train</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is both a glamorous and entertaining adaptation of Agatha's Christie's mystery novel. There's certainly a star studded cast but perhaps the main star is the luxury train itself, the legendary Orient Express bound from Istanbul to Calais. Black with gold crests, it hisses steam as it streaks dramatically through the Balkans. Inside are opulent interiors, intriguing compartments, gourmet cuisine, fine wines &amp; liqueurs, and elegantly costumed passengers. Of course there's the typical enclosed group of suspects with a murderer in their midst.The setting is 1935 and Belgian detective Hercule Poirot boards the Orient Express along with an assortment of colourful, suspicious passengers. One of them ends up murdered in his compartment, a man discovered to be a fugitive responsible (but never prosecuted) for the kidnapping some years earlier of a child that resulted in five deaths. Poirot is called upon to solve the crime, discovering that some of these intriguing passengers may not be who they appear but instead have links to this past case of kidnapping and murder.Albert Finney is convincing as the eccentric detective Poirot, with his slick black hair and elegant little curled mustache. He plays the role more seriously than Peter Ustinov in Death on the Nile, another film with a star studded cast. I enjoy both renditions of the detective, though my favourite may be A&amp;E's David Suchet. I have heard that Christie herself approved of Albert Finney, but agree with her conclusion that Finney's mustache is too small! My only complaint is the scene in which Poirot is screaming quite abusively at Miss Debenham. It's out of character for this very cerebral detective.Yes, as the tag line claims, it's definitely the who's who in the whodunit, with the passengers all portrayed by famous stars. These actors must have had fun with their roles. Richard Widmark portrays the obnoxious American businessman, Mr. Ratchett, with Sir John Gielgud his perfectly cast, reserved butler Beddoes, and Anthony Perkins his secretary MacQueen. Michael York and Jacqueline Bisset play the mysterious, foreign Count and Countess Andrenyi, who act guilty as all get out. Lauren Bacall is suitably irritating as the loud, outspoken Mrs. Hubbard, while Ingrid Bergman is a frightened Swedish missionary...or is she? Bergman was a magnificent actress in many roles, but I have to agree with some who question whether she deserved the Best Supporting Actress Oscar here for really, quite a minor part.Sean Connery is handsome as always portraying the indignant Scottish Colonel Arbuthnot, though I find him even more appealing now. Like a fine wine, he simply improves with age! Vanessa Redgrave plays his love interest, Miss Debenham. What are these two hiding? Obviously something! Of course there's an aristocratic and eccentric old dowager aboard, the proud and haughty Princess Dragomiroff, played to perfection by Wendy Hiller. You can just tell that this black clad and bejeweled lady is not telling the truth! Personally, I took a liking to the train's French conductor, though was previously unfamiliar with the actor, Jean-Pierre Cassel.The famous locomotive is halted by a snow drift and meanwhile, Poirot is designated to solve the crime, interrogating each suspicious passenger in turn. The detective must summon his little gray cells to ferret it all out, though I find little humour in him here. No spoilers, but I think this is one of Christie's more clever twists. Personally, I would never have guessed the murderer if I hadn't read the novel first. However, one of the suspects being interrogated does give a clue, if you're really sharp!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to introduce your children to the murder-mystery genre without scaring them or boring them, then show them this terrific film, which made instant Poirot fans of my 10 and 13 year-old kids. Albert Finney is so over-the-top that he towers over an excellent ensemble cast, and his performance became the standard that I'm sure David Suchet aspired to for many years. The opening sequence, showing the back-story of the 'Baby Armstrong' case, is very creepy and engages the viewer immediately. The sets and costumes (and even the opening credits) remind one of the grand Hollywood spectacles of the past. Sidney Lumet's direction is outstanding, as are the performances throughout.

		<fullReview>Great fun! The undeniably best version of any Agatha Christie novel and one of the most enjoyable films ever made. Incredible group of stars perfectly cast down to the smallest part. Ingrid Bergman won the Oscar and she is fine but Betty Bacall is the real scene stealer here. Blustery and boorish she is the perfect portrait of the overbearing tourist you want to avoid. Vanessa Redgrave looking great is loose, saucy and well matched with Sean Connery, a shame they never costarred again. Jacqueline Bisset, at the height of her beauty, gives a nice account of a high strung countess. Originally Marlene Dietrich was sought for the imperious Princess Dragomiroff and surely she would have been great but Wendy Hiller makes the part her own with a larger than life performance. Finney makes a terrific Poirot with an astonishing makeup job. Speaking of which both the production and wardrobe design are sensational. Even though it is on the long side Lumet keeps it humming along nicely with a musical score that sets the scene well without overwhelming the flow of the picture. If you've never seen this gem do so with haste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy detective mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like mystery films and TV shows, but I've never been a big fan of Agatha Christie's Poirot. The character is rather hard to relate to. Unlike the intelligent English gentleman Sherlock Holmes, for example, Poirot is more of a bungling, silly foreigner and despite his moments of brilliance, it seems to come off as an accident due to his demeanour than because of his brains. Still, the character is certainly memorable and he's always the centre of attention no matter what else is going on in the film, even if it is for the wrong reasons. Anyway, the most important thing about this film is the mystery, which is rather well done. We follow the death of a man on the train 'the Orient Express'. Of course, it isn't long before Poirot is on the case and it doesn't take him long to connect this murder with the murder of a young girl from years earlier. The problem with the mystery is that it moves very slowly, and in the first half hour, for example, all that really happens is that Poirot gets himself a first class room on the train. Still, once it gets going it moves well and the way that Poirot puts the clues together manages to ensure that the film is always interesting.This film features quite a few smaller performances from well-known screen actors, including Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Michael York and Sean Connery. The support cast help the film massively, as they're all integral to the central plot. Albert Finney takes the lead role and does excellently in bringing the detective to life. His performance suitably gives life to Poirot, and in this film he is everything that you would expect an eccentric Belgian detective to be. The fact that the mystery is set aboard the Orient Express is important as it ensures that the film exudes class throughout, and it also means that the small cast is always isolated aboard the claustrophobic vessel. I do think that more could have made of the train setting, as we're not always conscious of it; but what is made of it is good. Many mystery films fall down at the conclusion, but it's safe to say that this one does not. It takes Albert Finney about twenty minutes to run through exactly what happened, but it's worth the wait as there's practically no chance of guessing who did it! Overall, this isn't great or a classic; but it's very good and highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most famous of Dame Agatha Christie's novels. This is a glorious, beautifully directed, star studded production. I will be honest and say it took me a long time to appreciate just how good a film this actually is.The format and layout of the film works tremendously well, the dark and twisted kidnap and killing story at the beginning sets the tone well, it hits hard, and makes the end of the film all the more engaging and believable.The film looks sensational, it is a beautiful production (especially in HD) the scenery throughout is lavish, a true feast for the eyes. From the bright sunny beginning, to the dark, bleak and snowy scene of the murder. The film seems to get intentionally darker as it progresses. The costumes are glorious, Jacqueline Bisset especially gets to wear some wonderful outfits.Albert Finney is good in the part, he certainly looks the part, when I read the book he is exactly how I visualise him. He is wonderfully theatrical, and as Ustinov definitely suits the flavour of Death on the Nile, so does Finney here.The characterisations aside from Poirot are expertly brought to life, some glorious performances, Lauren Bacall and Wendy Hillier are sensational in their roles, how well the cast bring to life the class system of 1930, it really was a different world. Sir John Gielgud is tremendous as stiff upper lipped Beddoes, and plaudits also to Richard Widmark who makes Mr Ratchett as vile as possible.9/10 you can almost smell the gourmet cooking and hear the clink of Champagne flutes. A glorious film. Kenneth Branagh's new adaptation has a lot to live up to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ageless movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite it was filmed almost 40 years ago, Murder on the Orient Express still is great - even if you've read the book. Finney, I have to admit, isn't the best Poirot, but he acts well enough. And the rest of the cast is wonderful! Lauren Bacall is the best, I think: she manages to be an excellent actress twice, to play the part of Linda Arden who plays the part of Mrs Hubbard! When Linda's identity is revealed, you can almost see her turning into a totally different person!The humor of the book is kept in the movie. Pity that Monsieur Bouc's constant suspicions about the Italian are cut out, but instead we have him changing his opinion after every interrogation. Yet Mrs Hubbard's hilarious character is very much the same. And the questioning of Countess Andrenyi is accompanied by continuous looks of devoted watchfulness and almost grotesque jealousy of the Count. There are countless other details (such as Princess Dragomiroff's doggies) that give the movie some lightness a mystery always needs.And, last but not least, the film's very touching. It's actually the only film besides Titanic and Hamlet that always brings me to tears. Ingrid Bergman gives a perfect performance of the gentle, soft-hearted Swedish lady, who is hesitant even to strike the brutal murderer. And by the end of the film there also is a very moving scene with the calm official Pierre Michel crying over his dead daughter's picture - that was the director's brilliant addition that allowed us to further understand the struggles and suffering of the characters.Again, it's a truly ageless movie and you won't regret watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best opening sequences ever!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Particular praise must go to Richard Rodney Bennett for his compelling musical score. He and his colleagues have produced one of the most effective opening sequences in my memory. Over the opening credits (as I recall), as the Orient Express begins to creep out of the station, the music accompanies it, slowly accelerating as the camera captures the huge chugging wheels, the steam escaping at billowing intervals. The growing power of the locomotive, with its wonderful musical accompaniment, creates just the frisson of excitement one would feel at the start of a grand adventure on the world's most fabled railroad. A magical opening to a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't mind telling you that my head nearly exploded during the opening credits: Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Michael York, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, John Gielgud! Not to mention that 'Murder on the Orient Express (1974)' was directed by Sidney Lumet, one of my favourite filmmakers, and adapted from an Agatha Christie novel. It was only recently that I had my first encounter with noted Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, having enjoyed a few television episodes with David Suchet in the title role. Finney's Poirot is perhaps too much of a caricature, emphasising the cartoonish silliness of the character rather than the quiet superiority found in Suchet's portrayal (however, I'm not familiar with Christie's novel, and perhaps he was simply written that way). Nevertheless, the remainder of the ensemble cast provides stellar support.Hercule Poirot is aboard a trans-European express train when a wealthy man (Widmark) is murdered in the neighbouring sleeping compartment. Poirot has a dozen suspicious suspects to choose from, and you'll never pick who did it. Such a large supporting cast may have proved difficult to depict without placing undue emphasis on any one character (and perhaps two hours is insufficient time to thoroughly explore everyone's motives), but Lumet does a good job of bringing together all the loose threads. Red herrings are scattered from right to left, and only Poirot himself can discern the real evidence from the decoys. Ingrid Bergman won her third Oscar for her role as shy missionary Greta, and I do love Ingrid, but the highlight for me was Lauren Bacall's insufferably loquacious Mrs Hubbard. For some high-class entertainment with some prestigious company, 'Murder on the Orient Express' is a surefire winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not my favorite Poirot film, but undeniably a classic and enjoyable to (re)watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Murder On The Orient Express" is arguably the most famous theatrically released film based on an Agatha Christie book, but there are two factors that keep me from rating it quite as high as its successors, "Death On The Nile" and "Evil Under The Sun": a) Albert Finney has his moments as Hercule Poirot, but sometimes his stuffy, mannered performance comes close to obnoxiousness (some people might claim that he's trying to be more accurate to the character as written by Christie, but I don't think the Poirot of the books would ever tear up the menu of a restaurant and throw the pieces up in the air), b) although the solution to the mystery is one of Christie's most daring and unusual, it is also pretty tough to translate from the page to the screen because it is necessary to introduce a remarkably high number of characters and explain the connection of all their backgrounds to the present events. The script does not succeed 100% at this task, and some of Poirot's conclusions seem to come from pure supposition. Besides all that, however, there's still a lot to like about "Murder On The Orient Express": the superb cast (though I don't know why Ingrid Bergman won an Oscar for this role, if anyone deserved such an award, it was probably John Gielgud or Wendy Hiller), the exhilarating music score, the nostalgic train setting, and some memorably atmospheric scenes (the opening, the re-construction of the crime, etc.). Definitely a film that can be watched multiple times. *** out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Hollywood Adaption of a Christie Murder Mystery in the Modern Era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even if you are not a murder mystery fan, "Murder on the Orient Express" is the all-time masterpiece of crime puzzles and won't disappoint. The film has everything from an interesting premise to a huge cast of kooky suspects that is almost like a who's who of Hollywood in the mid-1970's. The characters include an aristocratic couple, an old Russian princess, a scatterbrained American actress, a neurotic young man, a British military officer, a butler, and an American business magnate. And of course there is the famous Belgian detective who is always being mistaken for a Frenchmen, played brilliantly by Albert Finny, one of the most underrated actors of the 20th century.A tendency with Agatha Christie murder mysteries is they often follow a predictable formula: introduction of the characters who will become suspects, a set-up for the murder, the murder itself, the investigation and interrogation, and a formal presentation of the solution to the suspects. "Murder on the Orient Express" does have many of these aspects. However, there are moments of unpredictability in which the investigation/interrogation becomes a kind of character study of the suspects. And the final solution is one of the most mind-blowing the genre has ever offered.Briefly, unlike other Christie offerings, the film begins with a kind of movie news story of the kidnapping of a little girl, Daisy Armstrong, most likely inspired by the Lindbergh kidnapping case of the early 1930's. Then fast-forward, and the narrative begins with Hercule Poirot, the internationally famous investigator, being called to London on important business while still in Istanbul. He decides to take the Orient Express back to Western Europe. Because the trip was last-minute, his accommodations are a bit precarious the first night, but after wards he settles into the trip. The next morning while on the train, a fellow passenger, American business magnate Mr Ratchett, solicits Poirot to investigate some life-threatening notes he has been receiving. Ratchett offers $15,000 (probably $200,000 in today's money) to look into the case, but Poirot declines the offer. The next morning, Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his compartment. The manager of the train asks Poirot to take the case, partially to side-step any lengthy investigation or bad publicity the train and the passengers might be forced to endure. Poirot accepts the case and begins questioning each of the passengers. He then learns that the murdered man has an interesting connection to the Armstrong case...A compelling case from start to finish with a stylistic flair reminiscent of the days of old Hollywood, which are at least partially represented by Lauren Becall and the late Ingrid Bergman. And, if you haven't seen this film before, part of the fun is to solve the mystery before Poirot does! But know there are many clues in unexpected places... The presentation of the final solution is one of the best of any of Agatha Christie's mystery movies. Great escapist fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEST ACTING PERFORMANCE: Ingrid Bergman in an interesting role for her. Pure acting, not a caricature as are many of the performances in this movie. Gives her "mousy" role some edginess by adding fervent religious undertones.MOST BELIEVABLE AND NATURAL: Jean-Pierre Cassel. Don't know him but would search out other movies he is in.MOST NOTICEABLE: Sean Connery (Honorable mention: Vanessa Redgrave).MOST DISAPPOINTING: Albert Finney. Appears to be working far too hard, to the point of straining. I think his speaking style is too bombastic for this role. An actor can say "he killed five people" multiple times and get the point across without shrieking the line. I didn't really notice his acting because he only looked like someone trying to be a high-powered actor, rather than actually being one.PERFECTLY CAST: Anthony Perkins.MISCAST: Martin Balsam (looks like a very American, New York stage actor who has been inserted into this European role for some reason known only to the producers.) Lavishly produced, beautiful to look at, well-paced. To its everlasting credit (thank you Mr.Lumet) this movie manages to deliver an aura of exciting train travel. Nostalgic, somewhat corny 1930's-tribute musical score.Very strong plot- almost too strong for movies but good for a book. Makes you nostalgic for the 1930's but not necessarily for the 1970's or 1970's movie-making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers. There is a delicious score, an elegant and whimsical 1936 waltz, on which during moments of suspense a bassoon plays comic variations. Nothing is to be taken seriously. Certainly not the story. The plot gives us incidents which are evidently red herrings designed to mislead Inspector Poirot but mislead the viewer as well. Why should "the clumsy cliché" of the smashed watch telling us the time of the murder be necessary? Because, says Poirot, it is supposed to lead him to believe the murder took place at an earlier hour than it did, an hour in which all the suspects had unshakable alibis. But if the suspects were in cahoots, couldn't they have improvised the same alibis for a later hour as well? After all, Poirot was asleep in his compartment, or at least trying to sleep, all night. And the lady in the white nightgown with the red dragons -- what was that about? It complicated the plot with an added detail but couldn't have confused Poirot much since it was of no relevance to his perception of what was going on. The acting isn't meant to be taken seriously either. First, there is Albert Finney as Poirot, who looks absolutely great with every visible hair waxed to perfection, and an indefinable accent that wavers a bit from scene to scene, as if he were, as John Simon put it, "sending up trial Walloons." Everyone else overacts hammily (and enjoyably) too. Especially enjoyable is Sir John Gielgud as the batman or butler or valet or whatever he is, explaining away a "contusion" on the back of his head with, "The result of a fracas in the mess, concerning the quality of a pudding, sir, know as 'spotted dick'." There were one or two other things in the script that Agatha Christie (played by Vanessa Redgrave in "Agatha") could not have gotten away with. Guilgud also does a marvelous job with the simple act of stabbing his employer, wriggling the dagger from side to side in the unconscious man's chest, and yanking it out with a theatrical flourish and an expression not of rage but of utter contempt. Likewise impressive is Sean Connery as Colonel Arbuthnot, that mess hall accent and demeanor, that mustache more firmly established than the Empire itself, snapping at Poirot that he would not have been stupid enough to use his "peep cleaner" and leave it in the murdered man's ash tray. The least interesting performances probably include Jacqueline Bissett, Peter York, and some minor characters, but this is partly because their roles require less of them. (How can you be a hammy wagon-lit conductor?) I haven't read the novel in years but my impression is that this movie, with its additional wit, is an improvement. The elegance of first-class travel on a train whose very name is suggestive of mystery and romance is nicely conveyed. It's snowy and scenic and bitterly cold outside, but in these beautifully appointed compartments we are well and snug and can order fresh oysters and fruit and poached sole with one new potato and a green salad with no dressing. It's cramped of course, but that merely adds to the impression of coziness. The Orient Express as I experienced it in third class isn't really very elegant. The only space I could find was on the metal floor in front of a bathroom, whose door kept swinging open and shut. Everyone on board seemed to have a digestive disorder. After buying a bottle of home-made chianti from a vendor at one of the stops, for twenty-five cents, so did I. I suppose you have to be well-to, British, and middle class, as Christie was. All her views of the world, gathered in the wake of her archaeologist husband, are tourist's views, which is just fine.The plot, as always in a Christie story, is as finely tuned as a watch and follows its format as closely as any episode of "Columbo." Poirot meets an old friend in some unusual place. A murder takes place. Poirot interviews everyone and pieces the whole thing together, no matter how improbable the feat. The last chapter (or reel) has the guests gathered together silently while Poirot strides around, or in Finney's case, shuffles around, and explains what has happened and why. The solutions are usually a surprise when they are finally revealed, but repeated viewings don't hurt. In fact, knowing ahead of time what the end will look like gives us a chance to appreciate better the display and character and the planting of clues, real and false. This is nothing more than a divertimento but it is a highly likable one, without pretense, and neatly done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Vanessa Redgrave, Sean Connery, Anthony Perkins and Michael York, to name a few, together in a movie. Director Sidney Lumet (from '12 Angry Men') has made a movie set in a train where all these great actors have the same amount of screen time, accept for Finney who is in almost every scene.The movie is set on the Orient Express where a murder is committed. Hercule Poirot (Finney) is assigned to solve this murder mystery, written by Agatha Christie. Since the murder is committed on the train every passenger is a suspect and with interrogations from Poirot we are able to think with him. Some of the characters are real suspects, others seem very innocent. It is all very interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat for a very long time.It has an ending it deserves. Surprising for some, I guess, although there are enough clues on the way. It is part of the fun with this movie. It doesn't cheat in a single way, it shares all the known information and therefore we have the feeling we are detectives ourselves. A great story, a great director, great actors (especially Finney and Bergman are terrific), a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murder on the Orient Express is definitely one of my favorite films ever. It has a lot of qualities that make it so, the acting, plot, cast, design, music, etc were all perfect. The book was very faithful to the novel, and the cast was absolutely magical! I don't think I have ever seen a movie with such a cast (Bacall, Bergman, Connery, Perkins, all of them). My personal favorite scene was when the revelation of how all of them killed Ratchett. The acting (especially Bacall) was spot-on. Bergman's Little Brown Babies scene was hilarious and well-acted. And I also found Wendy Hiller, who played Princess Dragomiroff, quite funny and played her part well. However, I did not much care for Finney's Poirot, I much prefer Ustinov's (and of course Suchet is the best). Out of the Agatha Christine films, this is a close second to Death on the Nile (my favorite). The score by Richard Rodney Bennet is one of the best film scores I have ever heard. The Orient Express Walzer was my favorite. I also loved the opening scene where Ratchett kidnaps Daisy; the music was great as well. All in all, the film was stunning, and is definitely a classic (though an underrated one, I must say).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Executed and Brilliantly Written</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this flick yesterday. It's a rather under-looked piece of cinema from director Sidney Lumet who absolutely does not disappoint with this feature. The film is a Hercule Poirot detective/Agatha Christie vehicle that works really well. The cast is incredible with the like of Sean Connery, Michael York, Ingrid Bergman (who won an Oscar for her role in this), Lauren Bacall, Martin Balsam, Richard Widmark, Anthony Perkins, and Albert Finney who does a fantastic job as Poirot himself. Overall the film is well executed and brilliantly written (thank you Agatha Christie!) I have found myself to really love Lumet's work. I don't give that many perfect scores and three of his films have that from me (12 Angry Men, The Hill, Prince of The City). Lumet is just an incredible storyteller even if he's had a lot more misses than hits. 'Express' is no different from his other work as it has an Oscar winning performance, great editing, a wonderful score, and (the greatest Lumet trademark) a film that takes place mostly in one setting. A take my hat off to you, Mr. Lumet. A recommended film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a shame the original journey is no longer available. They keep cutting the service. This is the best characterisation of Poirot I have seen. He reminds me of Mr Creosote from The Meaning of Life. What a cast! I thought the old Princess showed how Gothic can be an effective look even in old age. A formidable German maid for her. Sean Connery in tweeds. Michael York looking like Errol Flynn. Colin Blakely was the Colm Meaney of the time.A great send-off in Istanbul or Stamboul, looking at suspicious fruit, and the great family of man. Poirot's many short conversations with the suspects are a valuable insight into the tricks of psychology. Plenty of lines in the dialogue could be useful in every day conversation.A real sense of the train, lots of cuts to noisy, steamy rattlings and thunderings. Nostalgia. Trains were better then.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The key word for this film, in my opinion is elegance! From the titles and accompanying music in, the film oozes elegance. It captures the thirties perfectly - one of my favourite scenes in the one set in the station at Istanbul as everyone arrives to board the train - there is so much going on you want to keep freezing the frame so as not to miss anything! The Orient Express is as much a star as anyone else in the film, particularly the iconic scene when it departs from Istanbul and we hear it's theme tune for the first time - magic! Only one small quibble on style - IMHO Mrs Hubbard arrives at the station far too glamorously dressed for her character, but it's a very small quibble indeed! Its an incredible story of course and one of its distinguishing features is the cosmopolitan range of suspects. Lumet gives us an old fashioned 'all star' cast and what a treat that is. I daresay everyone has their own favourites but for myself I might pick Wendy Hiller's imperious Russian Princess (with a sense of humour), Rachel Roberts' truly natural performance as her German maid and Ingrid Bergman's awkward, frowsty Swedish missionary - I think she perhaps DID deserve that Oscar; her scene with Poirot is just mesmerising! On the whole, the entire cast is extremely impressive - just two very small 'pities'; its a pity that Anthony Perkins wasn't given the chance to play MacQueen as something other than Norman Bates' cousin and its a pity that Vanessa Redgrave wasn't given more to do as Mary Debenham - its a much bigger role in the book! For me (and this is very much a personal thing) the only real downside to the film is Albert Finney's portrayal of Poirot. I feel he makes the great detective too comical and clownish. Sure, there are glimpses of the great mind from time to time but there is just a little too much inane humming and bustling and too much raucous laughter. He has some very fine moments but too many irritating ones (for me at least). Perhaps I have been spoiled by TV's exemplary David Suchet in the role.I was lovely to re-watch it recently on DVD and it really felt like 'turning the clock back'. Personally, of the Brabourne/Goodwin films of this period, 'Death On The Nile' just has the edge as my favourite but 'Orient Express' runs it close and beats it for sheer elegance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been wanting to see this movie for a while, and as it turns out, I was really impressed by this movie. This is an enjoyable, intriguing murder mystery movie. The performances were terrific. Albert Finney was hilarious as Hercule Poirot. Lauren Bacall was perfect as the talkative American character, Mrs. Hubbard. Wendy Hiller was fantastic as the black-clad aging Russian princess; I got a kick out of her accent....and her appearance--she looked like a gothic zombie who arose from the dead. Tony Perkins was interesting to watch, playing another eccentric, fidgeting character. And, I definitely could not picture anyone else in Jacqueline Bisset's role....anyone nearly as beautiful as she looked--she looked absolutely gorgeous in this movie. However, I didn't see a need for all of the famous faces. Most of the characters had very little screen time. This movie could've been just fine with lesser-known actors or even unknowns playing some of the characters. I could easily picture lesser-known actors in the roles of the characters played by Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, and John Gielgud. Ingrid Bergman's performance was good but not great, and I wish her character would've been given more to do in the movie. In fact, I wish ALL of the characters would've been given more to do, so that way one could know the characters better. I guess that in just two hours you can't get to know very much about so many characters. Nevertheless, I liked this movie a lot. I especially liked the setting, aboard the famous Orient Express.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I realize it's probably the most clichéd and overused sentence to put in a movie review, but I couldn't care less and will use it anyways? Here goes: they don't make 'em like this anymore! Lumet's film version of Agatha Christie's immortal novella "Murder on the Orient Express" is ? simply put ? phenomenal entertainment from start to finish and, to me personally, the main reason why cinema is the greatest invention in the history of mankind. Straight from the atmospherically sinister opening sequences, recalling the vicious kidnapping and murder case of a young girl named Daisy Armstrong (which Christie based on the actual and notorious Lindbergh kidnapping case) through harrowing newspaper headlines, film fanatics will already know that they're in for an exhilarating two-hour thrill ride! Immediately after the intro, the greatest all-star ensemble cast ever assembled for one film embarks the legendary Orient Express for a long journey. Train director Bianchi is most ecstatic to welcome an unexpected guest and personal friend aboard; the brilliant Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. On the first evening already, Poirot is approached by the seemingly nervous businessman Ratchett who claims to have received multiple threatening letters. The next morning, Ratchett is found murdered ? stabbed multiple times in his compartment ? and Bianchi begs our detective to resolve the crime while the train is still stuck in the snowy mountains and inaccessible to the Yugoslavian police. Through his unique interrogation methods and unfathomable deduction skills, Poiret soon discovers that all passengers in the carriage ? all prominent people and their servants ? are suspects and even share a common motive for wanting to kill Mr. Ratchett. It's not the whodunit aspects of the script that make "Murder on the Orient Express" so brilliant (the denouement is actually silly and on the verge of preposterous), but the elaboration and the building up towards the climax. The dialogs and confrontations between Poirot and the passengers are elegant and perfect to meticulous detail, the cast members deliver stupendous performances regardless of how small and insignificant their roles actually are and Finney's monologue at the end is one delicious and expanded cinematic orgasm! Yes, really!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest Crime Classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This unforgettable film isn't only probably the best adaptation ever of any of the magnificent novels of Agatha Christie (she herself approved highly of it, which she didn't e.g. of the "Miss Marple" films with Margaret Rutherford), but one of the greatest movies ever made. Of course there is an all-star cast, but not just for the names' sake: every single one of the stars fits his role to a T (imagine that Ingrid Bergman was originally to play Princess Dragomiroff, but she chose the "ungraceful" one of Miss Olsen - and won an Oscar for it!), from Albert Finney of course as the original Hercule Poirot, literally as he was described by Agatha Christie (although he would have been at that time "too young" for the role, but an excellent make-up fixed that) to Martin Balsam as his eager friend and "assistant" who after every inquiry asks hopefully: "Please - HE did it?!". Lauren Bacall, as the "Nemesis", the instigator of the revenge on the cruel child murderer portrayed by a dangerous-looking Richard Widmark, plays with great care a talkative American tourist - and is revealed in the end as the famous stage actress Linda Arden, for whom THIS was her most difficult role... Anthony Perkins is at his best, once more as a shy young man with a mother complex, Jacqueline Bisset and Michael York are the elegant and snobby young couple from diplomatic circles, Wendy Hiller (who was also much younger than the make-up made her) is a Russian relic of the Czars' days, and Rachel Roberts her devoted maid who had obviously been in love with her falsely accused colleague at the Armstrong house who had committed suicide (in fact, her harsh German ways - although the actress obviously didn't speak German and was dubbed for a few lines - and her short, male haircut underline the suggestion of her being a lesbian), as was the seemingly hard-boiled detective Dick Hardman, who breaks down in tears in the end... John Gielgud plays the ultimate conceited British butler; and as for Sean Connery and Vanessa Redgrave, they make a magnificent and extremely beautiful secret couple! Denis Quilley as the temperamental Italian-American, Jean-Pierre Cassel as the quiet conductor who was necessary for the completion of the plan (and who was in fact the dead maid's father), and George Coulouris as the stoic Greek doctor complete a cast that is surely unequaled. Sidney Lumet also took care of ALL the other big and small details: the tight settings of the "prison-train" trapped in midst the snow just "stinks" with the atmosphere of the decadence of the "high society" between the two World Wars, the music further enhances both the suspense and the period-feeling, the dresses and the hairstyles are absolutely authentic... The dialogs switch between philosophy, politics, and humor: and in the end, of course, the great Hercule Poirot reveals the truth about the murder in self-justice - and lets the persons involved get away with it, which deeply occupies not only HIS conscience, but also the audience's. In short: "Murder on the Orient Express" isn't just a well-made, expensive, entertaining crime mystery - it's a Classic with ALL the required ingredients.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So good, even when you've seen it before you forget Whodunit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MOTOE is a B-movie in an A-list package. It's not anybody's "fault" it's a B-movie. The nature of whodunits is the red herrings and the final reveal in the last reel or two, so the structure is formulaic from the start and we've seen it countless times.But when the formula is as beautifully conceived and realized as this, on all levels, it becomes a rare jewel to be admired and loved over and over.Largely due to Christie's original story, then the magnificent yet economical script, Lumet's precise direction and (mostly) the once-in-a-lifetime playing by the incredible cast . . . it's really true: you can know who did it and yet be so swept up by these compelling characters and magical filmic structure that you almost have to FORCE yourself to remember whodunit! Finney (38 at the time) totally convinces as 55-60 Poirot. Amazing.Then again, ALL these actors, many of them working in accents completely foreign to their actual origins and playing delightfully against "type," embodying vivid characters from a tightly-written script, present a virtual workshop of what great acting is all about.Save, perhaps, Anthony Perkins. It's not that he isn't good -- he's wonderful. But we've seen it all before, from him. There's nothing new in his performance here, as there is from the rest of the cast.In fact, in retrospect, one becomes increasingly aware of Perkins' narrow range as an actor. "Tall Story," "Friendly Persuasion," "Psycho," "Phaedra" -- in ALL his films he involvingly and believably portrayed a variation of the same man.Of the entire cast, Perkins seems most camera-aware and "actorish." Ironically, his role is closest to his own natural "American" persona.Everybody else (but Connery, who is what he iconically is, no matter the role or the subtlety of his playing, so overwhemingly magnetic is he) gives us characters we haven't seen before and are obviously delighted doing so.Quibble.So brilliantly-produced is MOTOE that it's endlessly watchable and enjoyable for all the great talents in front of and behind the cameras.Yes, I know whodunit and how.But every time I sit down to MOTOE it sucks me in and I find myself thinking, "But how can that BE?" And delight, once again, at Christie's jaw-dropping construction and this -- the film adaptation of her work with which she was most pleased.It's a ball!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's "Murder On the Orient Express" is adapted from the classic mystery by Agatha Christie. In it, Christie's hero, the celebrated Belgian detective Hercule Poirot must solve a murder on the fabled train. In his investigation, he discovers that there is more to the murder than meets the eye. "Murder On the Orient Express" is a faithful adaptation from Christie's original novel, and is blessed with a stunning all-star cast: Lauren Bacall as Mrs. Hubbard, Ingrid Bergman as Mrs. Olson, Sean Connery as Col. Arbuthnot, Anthony Perkins as Mr. McQueen, Michael York as Count Andrenyi, Wendy Hiller as Princess Dragomiroff, and Albert Finney as Poirot himself. It's a great story from beginning, to the intriguing end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"...the murderer is with us now".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when I'm watching a murder mystery like this I'll have paper and pen ready to take notes of the characters as an aid in trying to figure out who the culprit was. Turns out it was a moot exercise here, and if you haven't seen the picture I won't spoil it, but be prepared for a novel surprise.As with a lot of these cable movie mainstays I delayed watching the picture for the longest time and as happens in most cases, I should have gotten around to it a lot sooner. All the performers are top notch, and Albert Finney simply cracked me up as the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. I can't imagine all those physical and facial contortions he had to put up with to interpret his character but it was a sketch. Tough call between him and Art Carney for Best Actor ("Harry and Tonto") that year, it could have gone either way.With Ingrid Bergman, quite honestly I didn't even recognize her in the role of Greta Ohlssen. Perhaps that was part of the calculation in awarding her Best Supporting Actress, however I personally couldn't see it. As for the rest, all bring something marvelous to their characterizations, with John Gielgud's Beddoes a close second to Finney as my favorite in the film.All in all a wonderful murder mystery with very obvious overtones to the famous Lindbergh Baby kidnapping case of the early Thirties. The resolution forces some critical thinking on the part of the viewer as to Poirot and Bianchi's (Martin Balsam) recommendation to the authorities. One thing bothers me though relative to murder victim Ratchett/Casetti. Without giving away the ending but considering the resolution, why would Richard Widmark's character have been getting death threats in the first place?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DIRECTOR Sidney Lumet distinguished himself in numerous films before turning his attention to Agatha Christie's classic. A founding member of New York's Actors Studio, Lumet began his directorial career in off- Broadway productions, then became a highly efficient TV director. Lumet was also known as an 'actor's director' having worked with the best of them during his career. Sean Connery, who acted in five of his films, considered him one of his favourite directors, and was reportedly used as the lead draw for casting agents to film. Once agents and actors heard Connery was among the cast (he plays Col Arbuthnot), they reportedly jumped at the chance of a part. Others have been reported to have taken the part just to meet such luminaries as Sir John Gielgud, Ingrid Bergman, and Lauren Bacall. Lumet's other works include Eugene O'Neill's A Long Day's Journey Into Night; Serpico with Al Pacino, The Verdict with Paul Newman, and 12 Angry Men with Henry Fonda. Apart from its stellar cast ? which includes Albert Finney as Poirot, Sir John Gielgud, Richard Widmark, Wendy Hiller, Ingrid Bergman (in an Oscar winning role as the nervous Swede Miss Olsen), Anthony Perkins, Jacqueline Bisset, Lauren Bacall, Michael York and others, the atmosphere of the film is striking. From the start, it has an eerie pre-sequence involving the kidnap of baby Daisy Armstrong from the Armstrong house in Long Island. Like many of Christie's novels, there's a hint of a pre-plot. But the film excels in the atmosphere of the train itself ? both when it is at its luxurious best ? and during the silence of the snowdrift in the Balkans in which the Orient Express finds itself trapped. In the still of the night, when the game is afoot, one can almost hear Poirot's little grey cells ticking. Poirot and the audience find themselves examining a world of communicating doors, wagon- lits compartments and red herrings, with sinister flashbacks. Albert Finney was accused of overacting in the film by some critics ? as well as being a little over-padded, but for me he excels beyond even his illustrious successor, Peter Ustinov. As ever, the denouement scene is key ? Poirot offers two solutions ? and it is here that Finney is at his best ? one long scene is notable for having few cuts in a long take. The film makes effective use of lighting ? a slight greased lens effect when the brightness of the snow outside permeates the carriage; and the subtle use of the blue night lights throughout the film in the carriages when the murder is being committed. And as always in Christie films, just when you think your favourite sleuth is being a little obtuse, or has overlooked a fact, he doesn't disappoint in the end. For us armchair sleuths, the clues were always there ? just why couldn't we see them? David Suchet ? an equally good Poirot ? starred in an ITV remake of the same film not long ago which, while being worthy, was a little too over gritty and dark for my liking. While playing effectively on Poirot's Catholic guilt at the decision he finally reaches, it lacked the atmosphere in the Finney version, or even the spirit of the 1979 remake The Lady Vanishes, with Cybil Shepherd and Elliot Gould, which, while being a workmanlike shunter compared to a sleek express, was nevertheless closer in style to Lumet's adaptation of Murder. ITV's drearier version lacked the savoir faire, panache and subtlety of the 1974 movie, which, perhaps. only the touch of a master director can bring, armed, no doubt, not with just a dagger in the night, but with a killer Hollywood budget and star cast, the magnitude of which might never be seen again. A sleeper ? not this one. If you've not seen it, enjoy the classy ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder on the Orient Express is a sinfully delicious retribution saga. In this film adaptation, Director Sidney Lumet brings old fashioned fun alive with a glorious ensemble.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murder on the Orient Express is a sinfully delicious retribution saga only Agatha Christie could've cooked up so deliciously. The author penned the famous novel in the year 1934 and its film adaptation comes exactly forty years later. Christie is too careful and smart to let anything go amiss, and she deliberately doesn't allow us to rack up our minds while reading her books; what I mean by this is that the cases she narrates become too much for us to make our own deductions and so we have no choice but to let Hercule Poirot, the famous detective protagonist in her novels, to solve them for us. There's a funny line in the film that tells a lot about how we watch this film. It's said in the scene where Poirot's friend Bianchi and a doctor, who accompany him as he interviews each suspect, begin debating passionately on whether one suspect has a significant motive or not. Poirot keeps quiet until he hears the word 'fairy godmother' from the doctor; the detective then springs up excitedly and says 'Ah, now you've accidentally said something valuable!'. We as the audience would probably figure out just as much as Bianchi and the doctor, which is like very little. We don't have Poirot's grey cells, and so we let him speak and listen to him all ears like he's some kind of oracle. We may accidentally catch something before Poirot does if we're lucky, but it's a level 10 Sudoku for most of us, and we're barely able to solve Level 6 itself.Agatha lays down her foundation quite neatly. Her novels usually consist of a lengthy exposition, where almost every major character is introduced (although true identities of some may not be revealed until later). In the Poirot series, our Belgian sleuth finds himself in the company of these characters, usually informally until there's a murder. Then his crime-solving begins. Paul Dehn, the screenwriter of this adaptation directly begins with Poirot's journey on a connecting ferry to Orient Express, doing away with his visit to a hotel in Istanbul which is included in Christie's book.Albert Finney plays our Poirot, and he's got a very distinctive appearance; in the first scene, as he's sitting in the ferry, he looks shapeless with his little head sticking out of an overcoat that's too big for him. His hair is so neatly oiled and flattened it looks like he's wearing a swim-cap, and his queer moustache curls up like bull's horns. 'What a funny little man' is the first remark we hear about him.The man who remarks this, Colonel Arbuthnot will soon eat his words back because he's later one of the suspects in Poirot's case. The British officer in British Indian army is travelling with a young English teacher named Mary Debenham aboard Orient Express. Others on this train include Pierre the French conductor, Natalia Dragomiroff the elderly Russian Royal and her personal maid Hindegarde Schmidt, Mrs. Harriet Hubbard the loquacious American socialite, Greta Ohlsson the Swedish missionary, Rudolf Andrenyi the aristocratic Hungarian diplomat and his wife Elena, Mr. Ratchett the incorrigible millionaire, his valet Edward Beddoes and secretary Hector McQueen. Poirot gets a seat with the help of Bianchi, who's a train company director; inside, he shares the compartment with Hector, who seems befuddled by this new guest. Orient Express takes off once its passengers are in, first with the sound of the engine starting, then steam billowing out. The whole momentum indicates us to brace ourselves for this totally mind-blowing adventure that's about to come. As passengers meet and greet each other, our Poirot is beckoned by Mr. Ratchett the millionaire at lunch. Mr. Ratchett ask Poirot to protect him from threats that he's been receiving from an unknown person, and Poirot seems interested until the crazy millionaire pulls out a gun and tries to get his consent by force. Poirot dignifiedly leaves without accepting the offer, and the next day finds Mr. Ratchett to be dead, stabbed about twelve times in his sleep.Under Bianchi's insistence, Poirot accepts to solve the case before the train reaches its destination; a snow storm the previous night gives Poirot more time for the same. The rest of the film is taken up by interviews with all the suspects one by one, ending with the show- stopping climax where Poirot has not one but two possible scenarios of the murder ? the simple one and the 'complex / Poirot' one. Most of us would've chosen simple, even though it sounds disappointing, only because it would've been possible for us to think further ? so it's better we ditch our theories altogether and listen to what Poirot's got to say. Director Sidney Lumet brings old fashioned fun alive with a glorious ensemble to support him. Christie's characters are diverse and peculiar in their personalities, dressing sense and accents, and the ensemble here successfully brings these characters to screen, whether it's Anthony Perkins as nervous, jumpy and fidgety Hector who keeps biting his nails in tension or Lauren Bacall as the overly talkative and rambling Mrs. Harriet. And once the big climax is revealed, we do end up sympathizing with everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First Class Production....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1974 adaptation of Christie's 1934 works so well for three reasons. Sidney Lumet's superlative direction. A great bunch of actors both (at the time) old (Bacall, looking and acting great, Bergman) and new (Bisset, York, Redgrave).Last but not least the material itself. It's the last item that I think a lot of people overlook when they consider "Murder on the Orient Express" either as a film or as one of Christie's stories. Without giving too much away, unlike a lot of her other material, "Murder on the Orient Express" deals with some real issues like revenge, mourning and finding the strength to move on after a tragedy. What has always intrigued me the most was how well Christie and this film handle the more than obvious parallel to the Lindbergh kidnapping and it is the fact that it plays the pivotal point in the story is what gives it much more weight than any other of her stories. This film adaptation serves the material superbly from the amazing opening sequence that brilliantly summarizes the kidnapping to the great, almost celebratory closing scene. None of the adaptations of Christie's films made after this one had this films impact.</fullReview>

Albert Finney as the little Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, gives one of his finest performances. The element of suspense in the course of the film is comparable to that of Hitchcock and the final realization of the truth just blows the mind away. Poirot's "order and methods" are a treat to watch. The unique look, accent etc. match Christie's description of the fictional detective word by word. For Christie readers and Poirot fans, this movie is 128 mins of pure pleasure. It is a must watch for all Christie fans as well as those who like crime thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel is absolutely wonderful. The story begins with reflections of the kidnapping and subsequent death of a child named Daisy Armstrong. As the story progresses we learn that there is a man on the Orient Express who is somehow related to the Armstrong case and asks for Poirot to be his bodyguard. I will not disclose anymore details lest it spoil the story for you. Now, about this movie: First it has the difficult task of throwing you into the time period and making you believe that it's actually 1934. It accomplishes that just fine. It also has the very difficult task of making you love the characters. This film features an all-star cast, including Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Anthony Perkins, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, and of course John Gielgud. You can't find this much talent in Hollywood pictures anymore. Albert Finney is fantastic as Poirot. I don't read the books but his mannerisms, acting and habits are exactly how I might envision them to be. I can't decide who is better as Poirot, Finney, Suchet, or Ustinov. To tell the truth they are all excellent as Poirot. Most important of all though the movie actually manages to construct a very compelling murder mystery that takes place on this train which is trapped because of a snow drift on the tracks. This plot point cranks up the tension as whoever committed the murder has to stay on board the train or risk dying of hypothermia in the middle of the Balkans. Furthermore, the climax and the finale is amazing, because there are some wonderful plot twists that are pulled off just beautifully. Murder on the orient express is quite possibly one of the best murder mysteries ever and so devilishly clever that it will keep you guessing.</fullReview>

Albert Finney is the best he has ever been and Bacall and Bergman are my two favourite ladies, they and in fact the whole cast are wonderful, the characters are brought to life with an immense vitality.The train pulling away from the station to the swelling music is genius, it sweeps the view up and along the journey with it and conveys an amazing sense of majesty.Definitely watch this, one of Christie's best books, the best adaption.

		<fullReview>"Murder on the Orient Express" is a classy film, in so many ways. With an an intriguing plot, based on one of Agatha Christie's best works, it has wonderful settings and costumes, beautiful cinematography, a great score and of course, one of the most AMAZING casts ever. While Ingrid Bergman's Academy Award winning performance doesn't impress me that much, Finney plays a perfect Poirot (in my opinion much better than Peter Ustinov's) and the rest of the cast create many unforgettable characters as well. My personal favourites are Wendy Hiller as creepy princess Dragomiroff, Martin Balsam as delightful Italian signor Bianchi, and Lauren Bacall, who's BIG fun in this. Fine work also from sir John Gielgud, Anthony Perkins and Jean-Pierre Cassel; Sean Connery is remarkably sexy as colonel Arbuthnot. With such a cast this film is really, as its tag line states, "The Who's Who in the Whodunnit!". It offers a good deal of suspense, but also lots of humor, and more, a great, great ending. Even Agatha Christie was completely satisfied with this adaptation of her book, and I am too. My rating is 8/10.</fullReview>

It remains a great production with wonderful performances from all involved and, despite obviously knowing the outcome, I still find it to be a fascinating story. This time, however, something else was added. For no obvious reason, on this particular viewing, I found myself imbuing each character with more depth than previously. Perhaps this is because I already remembered, more or less, the relationship of each character with the family and the impact the initial crime had had on each of them. I'm a self-confessed film buff and an aficionado of pretty much every film genre, but I suspect that, in my later years, I'm leaning more towards character driven stories, of which this is on of the greats. It's a movie I can happily watch every year or so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous, Sumptuous Classic Christie Puzzle With an All-Star Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great director Sidney Lumet was at the top of his game in 1974; with more than two decades in the business under his belt, he had already given us the classic gem 12 ANGRY MEN and the film version of Eugene O'Neill's LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT, which many critics feel contains Katharine Hepburn's greatest performance, FAIL-SAFE, THE GROUP, and SERPICO, establishing himself in the process as one of the great cinematic voices of his generation. DOG DAY AFTERNOON was still in the future when Lumet decided to take on lighter fare: the film version of one of Agatha Christie's most popular novels, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.The material may have been lightweight compared to what he was used to (A friend of mine always refers to an Agatha Christie as a "jolly good murder"), but it was not without its challenges. Set on the world-famous Orient Express, a luxury train that used to run from Istanbul to Paris, Christie's dandyish Belgian sleuth Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) is shoe-horned into an unexpectedly full Wagon-Lit car (it is full in the off-season, the film's first red flag). With Poirot on board, we know what we're in for, and it isn't long before it starts.Lumet had a formidable task on his hands; despite the light tone of the material, the stage set was even more claustrophobic than the jury room in 12 ANGRY MEN, and he had to cram roughly the same number of actors into it. There are actually two sets: the sleeping car where the compartments are, and the dining car, where most of the action takes place.I'll keep it brief: first night out, the train runs into a snowdrift in the Balkans and cannot proceed until the next station realizes it has not arrived and sends help. With nothing better to do, the characters have breakfast and chatter about this and that. Christie tended to draw her characters with broad strokes, which is often an invitation to actors to overact, and yet when they do, somehow it works.Breakfast is barely over when it is discovered that an American who had offered Poirot a lot of money to be his bodyguard the night before has been murdered in his bed in the night. With nothing better to do, Poirot gives in to the pleadings of his friend Bianchi (Martin Balsam), a director of the railway company who fears a police scandal, and takes the case.What follows is possibly the most fascinating series of interviews ever put on film. Clues have been strewn all over the dead man's compartment, which alert's Poirot's sensitive nose that something is up (Finney is hilarious when he asks Balsam and George Coulouris, who plays a doctor, if they've noticed that "there are too many clooos in this room??"). Worse yet, the clues point all over the place but all lead to dead ends. Of course, by the end Poirot figures it all out (and if you watch this one carefully you will too) and a grand time is had by all.Lumet is aided and abetted by a terrific screenplay by Paul Dehn and an incredible cast of international stars ranging from Finney to Lauren Bacall as a loud and irritating American woman to Sean Connery as a Colonel in the Indian Army to Wendy Hiller as a Russian Princess to Anthony Perkins playing yet another variation on Norman Bates (but no, he's not crazy here, just a bit neurotic) to Vanessa Redgrave as a private secretary/governess to Ingrid Bergman in a sensational performance as a Swedish missionary (Bergman would win her third Oscar for this, delivering a memorable acceptance speech in which she apologized to Italian actress Valentina Cortese, who had been the front runner for DAY FOR NIGHT).Yet it is Finney who draws the viewer's attention. Already of less than average height at 5' 9", he makes himself smaller to play the man always referred to in the novels as "the little Belgian." I won't vouch for the authenticity of his accent; he does not exactly sound Belgian, but he does sound foreign, and the rest of his performance is good enough to be considered the definitive Poirot (my apologies to David Suchet, who is as British as Finney and whom I never believed as Poirot); he keeps the viewer entertained with the character's many eccentricities.Christie wrote a lot of these "about-a-dozen-characters-assembled-for-a-murder" types of yarns: I highly recommend watching this one back to back with AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (dir Rene Clair, 1945).Murder is never quite so much fun as when Christie does it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great Christie adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agatha Christie is generally considered the greatest of all mystery writers. It is not just because of her wonderful setups, in which someone is murdered in a confined area so that it is known that the murderer is still there. And it not just because of her colorful characters, each with different personality traits. It is, perhaps, because of her solutions. She never makes it easy for the reader; everyone seems to have a motive, but also an airtight alibi. But when the solution comes, it makes complete sense. And it is never as easy as a whodunit usually is. In fact, the solution to The Murder of Roger Ackroyd was so surprising that many criticized it for being misleading. The most famous of Christie's novels is Murder on the Orient Express, which features her best character Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian detective with, as Christie put it, "the finest moustache in England". So how would a film adaptation fare? On one hand, it couldn't possibly succeed, for it would have to live up to such a great novel. But on the other hand, it couldn't possibly fail with such a great story as its basis. Sidney Lumet's 1974 version of the novel does not fail; in fact it is a great success. If you haven't read the novel, it is best to go in to this cold. It consists of a story in which Poirot is booked, at the last minute, on The Orient Express. But the train gets held up and then a man is murdered. It is Poirot's duty to find the killer, but when it seems as if everyone has a motive and an alibi (the aforementioned Christie formula), Poirot must use his most keen detecting abilities to find the murderer.Albert Finney's performance as Poirot, is one of the film's only faults. He plays Poirot as a cartoonish character with greasy hair and an unbelievably thick accent. It is, at times, too over-the-top. Perhaps the problem is that I had just seen David Suchet take on the role in the made-for-TV version, and he is the perfect Poirot. But still I was able to excuse Finney's performance because it did seem to fit with the rest of the film. Poirot interrogates each passenger on the train. An amazing cast consisting of Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Colin Blakely, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Rachel Roberts, Michael York, and Denis Quilley play the suspects, and each hold their own in the movie. One of the best parts of the film is seeing how Poirot treats each character differently; one he comforts, one he confronts, and most entertaining of all is when he keeps interrupting Lauren Bacall midsentence. It is a great way to show how Poirot handles his suspects psychologically to get the answers he wants. When Poirot solves the murder, he brings all the suspects into the dining car. It is a wonderful set piece of suspense that the whole film had led up to. The solution is genius, something so original and fresh it seems like it was written today. Any flaws in the film will be resolved in this scene. This film also deals with morality and makes one question what one would do in a situation like this. The cinematography is lush and beautiful, reflecting the 30s in which Technicolor was first used. Sidney Lumet, one of my favorite directors, does a great job. I loved how he introduced each of the passengers with a tracking shot through the train station. It is, overall, the best adaptation of a Christie novel I've seen and a wonderful ensemble piece. 4/4</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Agatha Christie, I am thankful. Your novels are clean yet dark and silent; your characters dimensional and your settings referential and provocative. Sidney Lumet; congratulations. You managed to escape the prototypes of directing mystery stories; changing the lanes of cities for an enclosed setting such as the Oriental Express, with a marvelous atmosphere that chokes the unprepared and satisfies the cravings for noir homage. Albert Finney; excellent job. You despised Poirot's brilliant straight thinking and impute your own sense of superiority to the character. Salute to the cinematography; never a camera did show you what you wanted with what you wanted to leave for the final. A smart script offers an entertaining time and the train takes life of its own. The music is chilling yet amusing, comfortably uniform. The illumination diffuses to the "real world", you'll soon be asking whether the lights got dimmer or the movie's atmosphere translated to your room. Reader; I highly recommend you "Murder on the Oriental Express". Its an old movie yet it seems to be an everlasting piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Murder on the Orient Express" starts with infamous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) making his way to London on urgent business. On the way he dines with old friend Bianchi (Martin Basalm), who runs the Orient Express, a classy, comfortable international train, and offers Poirot a ride on it, Poirot accepts. Also riding on the train is a colonel (Sean Connery), his lover (Vanessa Redgrave), a Hungarian Count (Michael York) and Countess (Jacqueline Bisset), a princess (Wendy Hiller), a Swedish missionary (Ingrid Bergman), a talky American (Lauren Bacall), an American millionaire (Richard Widmark), his servants (Anthony Perkins and John Gielgud), and others. Things are sleepy and quiet during the first day, but by morning of the second day two things have happened. One: the train has become stuck in the snow in Yugoslavia and two: the millionaire has been found murdered.After some persuasion from Bianchi Poirot takes the case, determined to solve it before the Yugoslavian police get there. We see Poirot's unmatched talent early on when he examines the murder site ? the victim's room ? and finds all sorts of things. We learn that the victim has a connection to a case from five years ago where a child was kidnapped from a millionaire couple and soon found murdered. I won't give away any more.Poirot then starts to interrogate the passengers, starting with the most important and moving his way down. The bulk of the movie is in the interrogation scenes, where we spend five or ten minutes learning about all of the twelve passengers and what their connection is (if any) to the murder. Poirot often turns from a playful, friendly inquirer to a fierce, unrelenting predator on the witnesses, depending on their character. This is where we see his skills flourish, he can analyze a person and figure out in what way he can get his answers just after a few seconds of talking to them. He is kind to the conductor, flattering to the princess, friendly to the butler and angry and fierce to the colonel and his lover. The latter two scenes feature an angry explosion from Poirot ? once when he's offended about something the colonel said and again when the colonel's lover won't answer a question.Except for a few brief shots at the beginning and a scene at the end, I cannot recall a single scene without Finney. Estimating, we'll say he's onscreen for two hours of the hundred and twenty-eight minutes of the movie. His task was to carry the film. He succeeded. Finney got his performance right on. He never loses his tough accent; he never emphasizes the wrong word or syllable, he moves like Poirot would, he smiles when Poirot would, Albert Finney is barely visible here, but you can't miss Hercule Poirot. And the best thing is, even though his job of carrying the film must've been terribly hard, you can clearly see him having a lot of fun onscreen.The rest of the cast has fun too, because they're allowed to. They all know their character perfectly, and it shows. Bacall's character is delightfully annoying, and she knows it, and that's how she played the part. Hiller's Princess is prideful despite her frail look; Hiller played her that way, whereas another actress may have tried to play the character as some sort of disintegrating annoyance. I think the one that stands out the most is Ingrid Bergman as the weepy, frightened and not-too-smart religious Swede. She won a surprising Best Supporting Actress Oscar for the role, but not an undeserved one. Like all the other actors and actresses, she nails her character on the head, all the facial expressions, all the times she breaks into tears, or when you catch a hint of smile. The performance is flawless.Sydney Lumet's direction is perfect too. He doesn't turn it into a claustrophobic thriller; we never have to little room on the train. Even when one car is full of all fifteen passengers it doesn't feel crowded. This is partly because of Finney's expert use of his given space; he explores every inch of every room he's in while delivering his lines.The writing is second best to the acting here, the characters never say something that their character wouldn't say. The pauses are never awkward and the speeches are never too drawn out. The way the plot unfolds is masterful to; there is never a plot hole or an unanswered question in the (quite surprising) ending.This is a classy, elegant film that's brilliantly acted, directed and scripted, a must see for all, 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brilliantly clever "Who-Done-It" closely adapted to Agatha Christie's literary work. Wonderful, fun, clever mystery.The direction of this movie was exemplary, the acting of all involved was dead on; and the scenery, settings, props and trappings were magnificent.Michael York, whose role is quite small, delivers a quite extraordinary performance. Sean Connery comes across as an indignant jilted husband beautifully. Star-studded performances deliver a masterpiece as an end product.The mystery begins quickly and never stops rolling. There is a clue in each and every scene, as there isn't one single inch of wasted film in this wonderful testing of the "old gray Delco." (quote from Warlock I) Every little segment is deliberately placed, meticulously shot and chosen for inclusion, to deliver some of the most intricate details of the plot.It's a shining tribute to Agatha Christie and her life's work.While Albert Finney, in my opinion, is the closest physical and manneristic match for Christie's Hercule Poirot, Ustinov is still my favorite. Finney pulls the character off in a marvelously witty, dramatic and intelligent way; however, and is a shining star in this production.Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sir John Gielgood, Sean Connery, Jacqueline Bisset, Vanessa Redgrave and even Rachel Roberts (who also played a pivotal part in Chevy Chase's and Goldie Hawn's Foul Play, 1979, and died in 1980 of barbiturate poisoning) all delivered convincing, cultured and believable performances.What else would you expect from a cast like this. However, as we have seen in the past, an actor's performance is only as good as the director running the show.Hats off to Sidney Lumet for his directing, and to Paul Dehn who lovingly slaved over the screenplay adaptation of Ms. Christie's novel. (Dehn also wrote screenplays for the Planet of the Apes movies, The Deadly Affair, the Spy Who Came In From The Cold, Goldfinger, Orders To Kill and On Such A Night 1956-among others) Great screenplays for great movies. Salute! to Paul Dehn, gone since 1976. This seems to have been his last and greatest achievement. Too bad he isn't still with us to help us translate the Stephen King screenplays into enjoyable movies rather than ... what they are.Wonderful, brilliant sleuthing movie.I won't bother with the storyline. If you read any of the other reviews, you already got that, and I figure, why be redundant? Rent it, Watch it, Buy it.Excellent movie which receives the very first 10/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating, impeccably constructed classic "whodunit"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a decade usually associated with chaotic cinematic upheaval and drastic change and experimentation, films such as Murder on the Orient Express, based on Agatha Christie's legendary mystery novel, proved that the classics could still be in style. Indeed, acclaimed director Sidney Lumet's film would have appeared less out of place if made in the 1940s than the 70s, but as such functions as a charming, elegant and impeccably constructed throwback to the classic, less sensationalist mysteries of old - in many ways, the definitive "whodunit". However, those expecting a more action packed, suspenseful thriller may find themselves rather sorely disappointed, as, for however engaging and engrossing the intricate series of interrogations attempting to decipher those accountable for the murder is, there is no real palpable sense of threat, of danger to the protagonist as in other such murder mysteries. But rather than a criticism, it is a tribute to Lumet's cinematic mastery that he can remain faithful to Christie's text rather than bending it to meet sub-par Hollywood conventions (Finney's Poirot in a fight scene would be hilariously ill-advised) and not compromise the cinematic scope of the picture in the slightest. This is an investigation of conjecture, not action, an intellectually stimulating talk-piece which would seem more fodder for a stage play were it not for Lumet's ingenious technical work. Caging in the action, making the intimate train setting appear all the more ominously claustrophobic and keeping his subtle cameras constantly moving (an opening sequence showing a kidnapping in progress, shot in jittery, dreamlike fades and sweeping cameras is simply superb), Lumet keeps the viewer unconsciously but consistently unnerved and on edge, making the investigation all the more gripping and enthralling. The joy of the film lies in the breathless attempt to follow the train of thought of the brilliant Poirot, and while the tension may be sacrificed through his rapid-fire matter of fact deductions, one would be hard pressed to find intrigue this intoxicatingly thick and compelling elsewhere to such a degree. And with such elegantly styled period costumes and sets (the Orient Express itself is a masterpiece of cinematic potential: masked in superbly artistic shots of billowing steam and chugging pistons, it shows a clear influence on almost any given train sequence since) the film makes its mark as one of the most sumptuously aesthetic pictures of the decade, perfectly backed by the sweeping and eerie musical score.While adjusting to Albert Finney's flamboyant accent does take time, he proves an unconventionally perfect fit for the eccentric but brilliant detective Poirot, showing the good sense to play the quirkiness of the character straight rather than overdoing it for comedy's sake and letting his fiery passion for knowledge and reason shine through enough to win over even the least interested audience member. The rest of the all star cast similarly do not disappoint, with standout performances from Martin Balsam as the warmly charismatic owner of the train, Lauren Bacall as a motor-mouthed passenger, Oscar winner Ingrid Bergman giving a nervously passionate performance as an obsessive missionary, a perfectly cast Sean Connery as a gruff Colonel, John Gielgud as a wryly humorous butler, Anthony Perkins as an oddball secretary and Wendy Hiller as a dignified elderly princess, all of whom may or may not know more about the murder than it would immediately appear.Of course the film is not for everyone, and may in fact alienate many modern audiences who have grown accustomed to associating the murder mystery genre with white-knuckled tension and palpable threat, or those bereft of the patience to sit through the dialogue heavy plot (particularly Poirot's near half hour final monologue). Similarly, it cannot be denied that in many parts the film appears self-indulgent and somewhat pretentious, caught up in giving each member of the all-star cast a chance to shine. However, criticisms aside, Murder on the Orient Express is a wonderful reminder of the sort of films that simply do not grace cinemas anymore, generating engrossing excitement simply through its intricate plotting and vibrant performances and managing to make a murder mystery with next to no sense of threat fascinating simply due to sharing the protagonist's passion for solving the case. For those willing to side-step the occasional self-indulgence, this is masterfully constructed and tremendously gripping cinema easily worth experiencing and inevitably appreciating -9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a friend first told me that Albert Finney was playing Poirot in the 1974 version of "Orient Express" that I was watching on AMC, I did not believe him. Even after I saw the credits, I could scarcely believe it. Finney's handling of the role was nearly perfect; only David Suchet had been as an effective Poirot. Besides Finney, the movie includes some of the greatest performances by some of the greatest actors. Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Sir John Gielgud are all fantastic in their roles. Ingrid Bergman's performance was truly deserving of an Oscar. This is, by far, the bast treatment of an Agatha Christie story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly boring All-Star Lineup -- terrifically Soporific!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>BISSETT ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS AT YEREVAN 2016, reviewed by Alex Deleon:British actress Jacqueline Bissett, 72, was the special guest this year at the 13th Golden Apricot film festival in Yerevan where three of her early films were screened. Viewed here as part of the Jacqueline Bissett tribute, "Murder on the Orient Express" (Sidney Lumet, 1974) is so bad it looks like a dress rehearsal for a film that never got made. If the Agatha Christie novel had suspense and snappy dialogue Lumet's film has neither. No suspense and painfully strained stiffly mannered quaint dialogue. Albert Finney's Hercule Poiret is so hammy that he is literally a burden to watch. The cast is practically a who's who of top ranking actors of the time from a fading Ingrid Bergman to an up and coming Jacqueline Bissett (as a sidekick of 007 Sean Connery) in a nothing role, via a still saucy Lauren Bacall plus two escapees from Hitchcock's Psycho, Martin Balsam and a very clean cut young Tony Perkins. Also seen John Gielgud, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, Wendy Hiller, Rachel Roberts, etcetera .etcetera. The film starts promisingly enough with Widmark, a wealthy American of shady background, meeting renowned Belgian detective Hercule Poiret in the dining car of the train, trying to hire Poiret to do a delicate protection job for him, getting turned down, and soon after getting himself murdered in his sleeping berth as the train comes to a halt blocked by a snowslide covering the tracks. From there it is straight downhill, lapsing into the coma of an enclosed space talkathon in which each star recites their part as if doing a reading for a theater audition -- all actors in early 1900s period costume. The costumes are just about the only thing about the picture that is even remotely interesting. Unbelievably boring considering the talent on view with the major interest being the attempt to identify the persons behind the heavy maquillage. Connery is particularly ridiculous in a bushy handlebar moustache straight from his roles as early James Bond. Fortunately, the print screened at the Moskva Kinoteatron was in such bad shape that it broke several times causing long delays and providing windows of opportunity for a quick escape through the side doors. Strange that the Yerevan festival picked minor Bissett screen appearances such as BULLITT (although third billed her part was minuscule) and Orient Express, but overlooked the one that made her famous, or at least made her breastwork famous --The Deep -- in which her underwater scenes in a tightly clinging t-shirt emphasizing her upper curves caused masturbatory syndromes world wide in 1977.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great, star-studded adaptation of the classic Agatha Christie novel.It is 1934 and master-detective Hercule Poirot is travelling from Istanbul to France on the Orient Express. On the first night the man in the next compartment is murdered. Once he starts investigating, Poirot faces a barrage of conflicting clues and potential motives.A great whodunnit, one of the best. The murderer is not at all obvious. As you go deeper and deeper into the movie, the plot gets thicker and thicker, but without any clear guilty party emerging. Great, unforeseen twist at the end. Fantastic story-writing by Agatha Christie, well translated to screen by director Sydney Lumet and his cast and crew.On the subject of cast, it is quite amazing - certainly one of the most star-studded every assembled for a movie. Just about every name is an icon of the silver screen - Albert Finney (as Poirot), Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Michael York, Jacqueline Bisset, Martin Balsam, Anthony Perkins, Richard Widmark.None of them put a foot wrong,Ingrid Bergman got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance, but I'm not sure why. While she puts in a solid performance, she hardly stood out from the rest.Albert Finney got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance, though I think his makeup artist deserved it more - he was unrecognisable while playing Poirot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Classic Agatha Christie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read many of Agatha Christie's works before seeing this movie, but I had not read this story. I kept myself away from the story until I had seen this movie. I was disappointed by the change made to the end of the "Then There Were None" movie adaption, but I have wondered whether it was because I had read the book first. So, I started this movie without knowledge of the plot. I only knew that Poirot would be in it and someone was to be murdered.The one thing I admire most about old movies is the scenery and culture included in their sets, and this movie certainly has these qualities. The lack of distracting sounds or music during moments of dialogue were very pleasant. The actors were wonderful in their roles and their quips in conversation were amusing indeed.In the end, it is a long movie which could try the patience of many and is certainly a movie that will send one to sleep late at night. It is not very exciting and there is little action. But for those who enjoy watching good acting and a good mystery, this is a movie to watch. I probably will not watch it again, for the mystery is gone the second time around, but I feel that I did not waste my time with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first really good Agatha Christie screen adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Albert Finney is one of the greatest of English screen actors, achieving the ability to be different in every role he plays: Arthur Seaton, Tom Jones, Scrooge, 'Sir' (in THE DRESSER), Winston Churchill. His Hercule Piorot in 1974 earned him an Oscar nomination as Best Actor, though it's a far more shouty and loud performance (completed with oily black hair and rich Belgian accent) than subsequent interpretations of the role by Peter Ustinov and David Suchet.When Sidney Lumet's MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS appeared in British and American cinemas at the end of 1974,audiences were not yet accustomed to the numerous Agatha Christie adaptations which are now part of ITV peak-time schedule. The film must have seemed fresh and sparkling and different in a cinematic landscape filled that year with disaster movies, cop thrillers and sex comedies. Here was a British- made film bursting with movie stars (Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, Jacquline Bisset, Anthony Perkins etc) all cast as various American and European murder suspects marooned a snow-bound Orient Express somewhere in the Balkans in 1935. Poirot - another traveller on the train - has to deduce which of them knifed multi-millionaire gangster Rachett (Widmark) to death. The film is technically very impressive.It has a fondness for the people, look and manners of the 1930s. Geoffrey Unsworth makes marvellous use of light and colour in a confined setting. Tony Walton's costumes have an exaggerated 1930s chic. Richard Rodney Bennett's music score is as lush as a Viennese waltz. Their contribution is in every scene. Paul Dehn's screenplay is packed with good dialogue and makes a relatively claustrophobic mystery highly watchable, especially when much of the second half comprises of Poirot interviewing suspects.The follow-up in 1978 - DEATH ON THE NILE - is even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murder on the Orient Express is one of a handful of movies that I recall seeing as a child, movies that left an indelible impression on me, their images and their meanings burned into my mind. Of course such "old friends" may hold a little more sentimental value for me than the many other high quality pictures I have seen since then, yet the lasting impact they had is in itself proof of their quality, as compared to the dozens of mediocrities I also saw but have since all but forgotten.And if ever a murder mystery was to fascinate a child as it would satisfy an adult, Murder on the Orient Express is the one. Unquestionably Agatha Christie's finest work, it comes from an era when murder and its investigation could be almost something of a sport, in literature at least. This is the time of Hitchcock's earliest morbid flourishes, the age of detective fiction ridiculed in Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth. And this film version keeps in tune with the general jolliness of the affair ? an wonderful upbeat soundtrack, light comical touches and above all a slight sense of irreverence; the corpse-like Wendy Hiller, the perfect butler John Gielgud, and of course Albert Finney's juicily over-the-top French accent.It's also apparent in Sidney Lumet's direction, which is full of knowingly melodramatic pans and cuts, not to mention the glorious all-round overacting which thorough coach Lumet no doubt encouraged. But Lumet, who started out in theatre, is doing something more cunning with the limited confines of the set. His plan actually begins in the Istanbul scenes, which he deliberately ensures are not too open, with visible ceilings and foreground clutter, with the occasional wider outdoor shot. Thus he establishes by choice a shooting pattern he will later be forced to stick to for the bulk of the movie. This helps to key us into the film's world early on, and stops the move to small sets being a jarring one. Lumet also gives his characters some great entrances, each unique and most of them purely visual; Richard Widmark hoving into the foreground as the camera pulls back, Jean-Pierre Cassel alone beside the steaming train, Michael York and Jacqueline Bisset advancing upon us as a basket of oranges spills before them.And this cast is deserving of grand entrances. I consider myself fairly good at stick-shaking, but still I would not even attempt to shake a stick at the number of irresistibly good players on display here. Wendy Hiller as an aging Russian aristocrat makes an unlikely comic relief figure, and yet she pulls it off with impeccable timing and manner. Ingrid Bergman draws us in to her story, making us believe in it and thus giving it a highly moving quality. Vanessa Redgrave as usual wraps the role around her own cheeky persona. An honourable mention also goes to Colin Blakely, a highly talented figure who was never quite right for the big roles but is memorable in dozens of little ones. Here he's at his emotive best as Cyrus Hardman. But most remarkable of all is of course Albert Finney. He totally gets the Poirot persona ? a man totally aware of what he is and what he is doing at all times, who has no need for dignity but achieves a kind of charisma through his indignity. Look at how his expression never changes during each interaction with another character ? Finney's Poirot ends an exchange exactly as he begins it.Murder on the Orient Express remains a favourite of mine, one I appreciate even more as an adult. The compelling imagery and characterisation is still there, as well as the unforgettable final revelation, and yet now I also feel its frequent dips into the personal and the poignant. Few mystery thrillers have as much appeal on repeated viewings because once the solution has been revealed the "thrill" has gone. Murder on the Orient Express has this added human dimension and, unlikely as it may seem, is one of a number of pictures that unfailingly moves me to tears.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I also really like And Then There Were None and Witness For the Prosecution, but this is a superb film nonetheless. It manages to be better than most of the Peter Ustinov films, though I liked Death On The Nile and Evil Under The Sun, not so much Appointment With Death.The acting was superb, as is nearly always the case with Agatha Christies. Albert Finney makes the role of Hercule Poirot his own in an Oscar-nominated performance. I do prefer David Suchet's portrayal as Poirot, as I am more familiar with him, but that doesn't mean Finney didn't do a splendid job, because he did. He was well-supported by actors such as Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, John Gielgud and Ingrid Bergman, among others.The plot is a little complicated, about the disappearance and death of a young girl, and then a man in connection with her death is found murdered on the train. Typical Christie fashion. The final solution, ranks along Miss Christie's best, if you hadn't read the book beforehand, like me, you wouldn't have guessed it.The cinematography is beautiful, the costumes are glamorous, the music is atmospheric. the film goes at a fast pace, and the acting and Sidney Lumet's direction are great. Young viewers will find it very complicated upon first viewing, but this film deserves a 9/10. Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Even in her acceptance speech, she reminded the Academy of Valentina Cortese's performance in "Day for Night" as the actress who forgets her lines during filming.Albert Finney has a field day in acting. As the inspector, he is suspicious of everyone and everything. He really acts like an inspector though at times it was difficult to understand him in a contrived French accent.The film is helped by a tremendous all-star cast.

		<shortDescription>Nothing is ever what it seems...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The heading is so true in the case of Agatha Christie. Here we have a typically baffling murder mystery, the old-fashioned kind set aboard an exotic train setting where a number of suspects are available for the final round-up by detective Hercule Poirot (ALBERT FINNEY).We've seen plenty of train murder cases before, but this one has an extra special passenger list of exceptional well-known star talent: LAUREN BACALL, JACQUELINE BISSET, SEAN CONNERY, JOHN GIELGUD, WENDY HILLER and VANESSA REDGRAVE are all rather first-class snobs, and MARTIN BALSAM, INGRID BERGMAN and ANTHONY PERKINS are members of the lower class.Naturally, they all become prime suspects when a murder is committed and they all have their moments to shine. Bacall is convincing as a pushy American, Bisset and Hiller are members of royalty, Connery is a stuffy colonel, and Gielgud deals rather brusquely with his secretary, Perkins. Ingrid Bergman won a Supporting Role Oscar for her role as a dowdy, rather retarded woman who is supposed to be a Swedish maid.The denouement is a surprising one, and not the kind anyone in their right mind is likely to suspect. The only drawback for me was that Albert Finney's Piorot seemed too theatrical, not quite as convincing as others in the role. Perhaps the make-up job was not the best. Nor did I think Bergman's role was really Oscar material. (Neither did she. She seemed rather apologetic at the Oscars that year, thanking all of the other ladies for their great work).Well worth seeing, a fascinating example of how suitable Agatha Christie's material is for the screen, especially when kept in the same time period as the original story--in this case, the '30s, where the authentic period costumes add to the proper atmosphere of the work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Accused and Excused...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a time when much of Britain's film output had descended to the level of Carry On and Confessions movies and adaptations of popular TV sit-coms, EMI Films bucked the trend to produce a sumptuously-mounted Agatha Christie mystery that gathered together a spectacular cast, a glamorous location and a top-class director. Casting Finney as Hercule Poirot, the mercurial little Belgian, was a bold casting decision that paid off admirably ? almost unrecognisable behind slicked down hair and a waxed moustache, Finney makes an entirely believable incarnation, although his accent is unintelligible at times, which is never a good thing in a film where any line may hold the key to the mystery.On a train journey from Istanbul on the famed Orient Express, a wealthy passenger (Richard Widmark) who has requested Poirot to act as his bodyguard is found murdered in his berth. The director of the line (Martin Balsam), a personal friend of Poirot's, begs the detective to solve the case. Poirot interviews the dozen suspects one-by-one and comes up with an incredible theory linking the murder to the kidnapping and killing of an aviator's daughter (inspired perhaps by the Lindbergh kidnapping) before revealing his conclusions to the assembled suspects.The only problem with a star-studded film like this is that each star receives too little screen time. Apart from one long scene (filmed in one take, apparently) Ingrid Bergman has little to do, but she is absolutely superb in that single scene giving a performance that outshines both Finney and most of the rest of the cast. Connery bristles as a stuffy military type embroiled in an affair with the elegant Mary Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave), and John Gielgud is the epitome of the reserved and upright British butler. The rest of the cast do well with their underwritten roles, although Lauren Bacall's disturbingly skeletal and gaunt appearance prove something of a distraction. Only Anthony Perkins fails to convince: in a role that had his name written all over it, he adheres too many of the tics and mannerisms we associate with his most famous creation.The story itself is pure Christie, following the trusted formula of having all the suspects being interrogated individually by Poirot before they are gathered together for the identity of the villain to be revealed. Although the identity of the killer must have seemed a revolutionary plot twist when the book was written, it's well known now so that the revelation is no longer such a surprise. For those who enjoy old-fashioned whodunnit's, however, this should prove to be enjoyable entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the action taking place almost entirely on a train, The Orient Express, this Agatha Christie novel works well on film. The cast is loaded with big names, and they earn their pay, as the murder mystery moves along to a great climax. Albert Finney is a better Poirot than Peter Ustinov in "Death on the Nile." As always, the Poirot character is full of himself, sort of irritating, at least to me. But that's part of it. A must see for those who like whodunits.</fullReview>

Perfect timing and acting, Albert Finney is as good as David Suchet in the role, and head and shoulders above Peter Ustinov.

		<fullReview>I've waited so many years to finally see this movie. Back when I originally wanted to see it, there were no videos to rent. Then, it was nearly always rented when I'd go to the store. So finally it was available and thankfully, I wasn't disappointed.The movie does the book a great justice. Finney, though not my favorite Poirot (Ustinov is), portrays M. Poirot wonderfully well. Anthony Perkins is actually cute. There is a little irony within his part as well. Perkins should have been more recognized here.All the characters are well drawn out. The film even offers clues that even Poirot doesn't mention. If you watch very carefully, you may just figure out the puzzle. ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French Accent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall, the film is very entertaining and certainly has a cast full of well known actors as well as award winning ones. However, Albert Finny's portrayal is awful. He gives Poirot a poor posture which never seemed to be how Christie described him. Finny also swings back and forth from what seems to be an Italian accent and a child's version of a French accent. It was the third time I've seen the film since it's release in 1974. It's really too bad the film is spoiled for me as I cringe to hear Finny fake a French accent. I understand Finny received a nomination for his Poirot; YIKES! What does that say about Hollywood? This is just how the film academy behaves, completely PC. They can't seem to tell the truth. It's as if they never left high school, afraid they'll lose popularity if they dare to honestly criticize the performance of a peer. Ugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murder on the orient Express is directed by Sidney Lumet and adapted to screenplay by Paul Dehn from the novel of the same name written by Agatha Christie. It stars Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Ingrid Bergman, Michael York, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, Jacqueline Bisset and John Gielgud. Music is by Richard Rodney Bennett and photography by Geoffrey Unsworth.1935 and the Orient Express is on route from Istanbul to London. On board is legendary Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. He is called into investigative action when a passenger is found brutally stabbed to death, just as the train is ground to a halt due to heavy snow. This will not be easy for it's a case where any number of the passengers appear to have links to the deceased.The best of the big screen adaptations of Christie's Poirot works, "Orient Express" is given a consummate sheen by director Lumet and his all star cast. Finney's Poirot has a hard edge to him, which is perfectly in keeping with the story that unfolds. From the beginning, which brings a sad and potent piece of news to our viewing experience, right to the Poirot deconstruction of the crime-perpetrator-motive sequence, picture has dark tints framing the array of thespians gathered for the occasion. The setting is gorgeous, but the confines of the period train add credible claustrophobic tension to the plot, and the reveal, while not surprising to the observant, is still a doozy that is given added emotional heft by a neat character development.Darker than you may expect, but still a bunch of fun to be had playing spot the star and deducing who has done the foul deed. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hugely underrated masterpiece of the 70's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murder on the Orient ExpressI've watched this movie after first reading the book, and I can say without any second thoughts, it was arguably the most eloquent representation of a novel on the big screen.Still, I have one objection in terms of choice, viewing the director's (the one and only Sydney Lumet) choice to specify essential pieces of information since the early beginning, namely the kidnapping and murder of little Daysy Armstrong. Besides this minor slip the film is flawless, both the acting and the technique details. The atmosphere was also very special, that kind of atmosphere which today it's impossible to render, because of the high-tech world we live in, where people care about how, more than what. It is useless to insist on the story since the film was based on a novel by Agatha Cristie, the most successful author in literature history. Suffice to say this is the greatest scenario centered around a crime. You get mixed up during the process only to be stunned at the end, a glorious one, to say the least.Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) a internationally renewed, Belgian detective, is emergency called in London, so last minute to board the Orient Express. On the train, more specific in the restaurant wagon, is asked by a certain Mr. Ratchett to assure his protection in exchange of 15,000 $, offer refused by Poirot. The next day Ratchett is found dead in his compartment with 12 knife wounds. Hercule Poirot takes the case, at the request of his friend, Mr Bianchi, and concludes that the killer is still on the train ...The characters are at least as original as the script, very different but still, so related. We have people of all races (Italian - Foscarelli, Sweden - Mrs. Ohlssen, U.S. - Hector MacQueen, England - Beddoes, Hungarian - Mr and Mrs Andrenyi),sincere people, others more mysterious than a shadow in the night. Some of them impulsive (Mrs. Hubbard), others most quiet, very withdrawn and timid, I might add (Mrs. Ohlsson). We see royal figures (Princess Dragomiroff , Countess Adreyi) and simple individuals at the same time (Foscarelli Michel). But what is most interesting, is that they all hide the same secret, same pain, same desires... It is hard to believe that so diametrically opposite personalities can share anything, not to mention something this magnitude.To conclude "Murder in the Orient Express" is nothing less than a timeless classic, an intense provocative masterpiece, and this poor rating is nothing but a proof that some people think with something else other than the brain, which in some cases may even be missing. Accordingly I rate this title a maximum ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christie's classic handled with care</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An absolutely stellar cast (Widmark joined the film solely to meet the other actors)is the perfect complement to a film loaded with old school Hollywood glamour. It follows the book's storyline - spoiler - a series of people impacted by a Lindbergh baby esquire murder and ensuing chaos enact a complicated revenge on the man responsible - very well, two exceptions being in character differences to the literary counterparts of Bianchi and Beddoes("Mr. Beddoes," as he insists), and with a minor tweaking to Mrs. Hubbard, who is actually better in the film as an twice wed natural acerbic instead of a smothering mom. Poirot does one of his rare about faces in this story, concluding that justice was done better through his silence. Agatha Christie liked to leave all her hints in the open before the murder(s) was solved. That is the only, unfortunate real problem here. Clues which were subtle in the book are painfully obvious in the film. Persons cringing at Poirot's presence, the shifty eyes, and the worst -a moment where Poirot is made to think the victim is crying out (thus changing the time of death)by one of his murderers. Its a crucial clue lost by its so obviously not being Widmark's voice. But looking past that it is a fine and fitting adaptation, especially the murder scene itself and a touching ending where a self made family toasts in relief.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of my favourite films based on an Agatha Christie novel.It is full of nostalgia you have the beautiful Orient Express train,the lovely furnishings,the period clothes, candle lit atmosphere eccentric characters and a great story with a good twist. The whole film just oozes class it stays true to the late 1920's when the story was originally set in,every detail is authentic for the time. The story was so cleverly written,i wont give away too much as it would definitely spoil the film for anyone who has never seen it. There is one murder and twelve suspects,all with reasons to kill the victim,all their reasons are slowly revealed throughout the film.It is very hard to guess who could be the murderer,you switch from one suspect to another,some seem shifty with something to hide while others seem too timid. The biggest red-herring is that the Greek doctor who is helping Poirot never becomes interrogated,yet he was just an ordinary passenger on the train like every one else,so you sort of think to yourself could he have had anything to do with the murder.For those of you who haven't seen the film i wont say. Another good reason to watch Murder On The Orient Express is that it has such a great all star cast,most of who are no longer with us,its hard to say who gives the best performance,i think for me its Rachel Roberts who plays Schmidt,as she usually played the down trodden woman roles, where here shes cast in a more stronger role and plays the character as being a bit on the butch side.Albert Finney plays a great Hercule Poirot,Lauren Bacall is also good. Murder On The Orient Express is a good film to watch as a who done it,it will definitely keep you guessing,and i particularly like watching this film at Christmas as it saves getting out the Cluedo Board.</fullReview>

A stellar performance by Albert Finney. His summation at the end of the film is an eight page monologue that is absolutely gripping. Of course it helps to have fourteen top-notch film actors and/or stage actors listening and reacting to his reconstruction of the crime. I never tire of seeing this one again and again. The DVD version has hours of behind the scenes material and almost every actor sharing their reminiscences. Richard Widmark said that he wanted to be in it just to meet all these people. Agatha Christie came to the premiere. She had never done so for any of her other hundred or so films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Murder on the Orient Express" - along with 1945's "And Then There Were None" - constitutes the greatest adaptation of an Agatha Christie novel ever. The plot of course has Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) trying to figure out who killed someone on the famous railroad. As is his protocol, he rounds up all the suspects and grills them. Ingrid Bergman won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance as Greta Ohlsson. The rest of the cast (among them Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, and Michael York) also does great. This is what whodunits are all about. Definitely part of Sidney Lumet's mid-'70s group of masterpieces (along with "Serpico", "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Network").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd never bothered watching Agatha Christie's 'Poirot' TV series prior to seeing this film, because I've always found David Suchet to be extremely annoying. Thankfully, that wasn't a problem here as Albert Finney takes on the role of Hercule "I thought you were French?" Poirot - and a good job he does too.SPOILERSBy randomly lowering and raising his voice, he manages to unsettle his 'victims' into revealing all sorts of clues that don't appear to be even noteworthy to the naked eye. But by the end Poirot's intricate process of finding the killer is revealed, showing how even the smallest details of manner and dialogue are all sewn tightly together: an Englishwoman referring to her 'lawyer' instead of her 'solicitor' meaning she must have spent time in America, Sean Connery proclaiming not to know somebody, then revealing in detail the military distinctions of that person, and Ingrid Bergman's limited English somehow being able to pick up the most complex words.As you would expect, the film is very wordy and how Finney managed some of those lengthy takes where he's linking every character together via all sorts of clues, is an achievement in itself.Amongst the rest of the all-star sprinkling is an Oscar for Ingrid Bergman (who I didn't even recognise until the credits revealed her - the shame of it) for her "little brown babies" speech, Jacqueline Bisset in her customary under-used window-dressing role and Martin Balsam who, in the end, turns out to be right with his prediction of "that was the killer" after each person is questioned.A very good film, which you won't fail to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is like a big happy dessert to be tucked into after dinner. The settings, the costumes, the color added by having such different nationalities, the safety of the past... it's hard not to fall happily into such lush surroundings.Those who dislike the movie seem to do so only by comparison with Agatha Christie's books or other adaptations. E.g., "this isn't the real Poirot!". Well, it doesn't matter to me if this is the real Poirot - if one takes the movie on its own, it's just wonderful. **** SPOILERS **** The only criticism that I can think of is the very beginning showing the kidnapping of the Armstrong baby. Why show this at the beginning? It destroys too much of the suspense. Obviously we know the movie must relate to that kidnapping or it would not have been shown. Why not save these scenes for the point after they decipher the burnt note?**** SPOILERS END **** It's a lovely confection - big and fluffy and with some remarkable performances - Gielgud has been a butler so many times that we fail to notice how fine he is at it; Bergman is just remarkable; Connery is fun to watch - and so is Rachel Roberts. I find Vanessa Redgrave's face radiant in many movies - incredibly warm and appealing. I'd never seen Bisset put on a foreign accent before (well, except her French) and found her very believable. York was good, so were the lesser characters - e.g., Colouris and Quilley. I find Bacall's character irritating - though of course that's the point. Wendy Hiller as the Princess was wonderful - and finally Finney was well, extraordinaire.See it - you'll have fun.</fullReview>

Lauren Bacall plays fantastically the American lady with her memoires about her second husband and Ingrid Bergman also the same charming with her part of the Swedish missionary with the little brown babies. Michael York and Sean Connery didn't give so much to the movie history and I can say the same about John Gielgud. The film was made very precisely because the Hungarian passport was a real passport and when the couple entered the train Pierre talked to them Hungarian. It was really good to hear. The ending of the film was a bit teatrical but at all it was really-really good. If you didn't see it, watch it!</fullReview>

You can almost see him now when you read one of the Poirot books... Hollywood, on the heels of remaking Ocean's Eleven, should definitely produce more all star vehicles. Outside of the cheesey disaster genre from the 70's, they haven't been attempted too often. Here's a prime classy example of how to do it right. Flawless and worth multiple viewings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet ("12 Angry Men", "Long Day's Journey Into Night", "Dog Day Afternoon", "Network", "Prince of the City", "Running on Empty") usually makes complex and serious films. This one is lighter stuff and not his most important achievement, but it's an exquisitely photographed, highly entertaining mystery movie with a well-playing all-star cast that includes Albert Finney, Sean Connery, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Vanessa Redgrave and Wendy Hiller. I think, it's unnecessary to summarize the plot here.When I began to enjoy movies, I was very interested in mystery movies. I particularly liked to see Agatha Christie adaptations, because I loved her books and stories. At this time, I cared more for the plot of these movies than for their cinematic qualities. I believe that's why I once enjoyed "Death on the Nile" even more than "Murder on the Orient Express." The plot of "Death on the Nile" is even more beautifully constructed than that of "Orient Express." Nevertheless, time has convinced me that the latter is a superior motion picture.The main reason is that Lumet is a better director than John Guillermin. Lumet's images, which give "Murder on the Orient Express" an ironically nostalgic tone, almost have the stylistic accuracy of paintings: each color, every use of light or lenses has its meaning. In "Nile," Guillermin primarily photographs pretty locations. He does that quite well, but the images are less interesting than Lumet's. "Orient Express" is an atmospherically brilliant movie. The scene that shows the start of the train is a masterpiece in its use of camera and music. Another advantage of "Orient Express" is the fact that it is more than 10 minutes shorter than the other movie. The visual storytelling in "Orient Express" is less repetitive than in "Death on the Nile" (Guillermin shows almost all possible versions of the murder in detail, which gets a bit boring after a while). And, while Guillermin has a good feeling for the action sequences in "Nile," the first half of his film could have been told faster. (I would have liked to see Lumet's version of "Death on the Nile.")Both films distinguish themselves by a high technical standard and good acting. I like Finney's version of the detective as much as Ustinov's, even if the interpretations of the role are very different.Along with Billy Wilder's "Witness for the Prosecution," "Orient Express" is one of my favorite Christie pictures. I'd rate it ***? out of ****. I also recommend "Death on the Nile" (***), "Evil Under the Sun" (despite its rather boring first half), the Poirot series starring David Suchet (especially the longer episodes, like the atmospheric "The Mysterious Affair at Styles") and the four Miss Marple films with Margaret Rutherford (even if they aren't very faithful to the Christie stories).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, Albert Finney gives a remarkable performance as Poirot : he looks exactly like the character described by Agatha Christie, so similar to what I had in mind ! I found him so much closer to the character than David Suchet, who turns it into a gay-like idiot with a very bad belgian accent.The rest of the cast (with enough big names!) works pretty well, I loved Lauren Bacall as a drama queen lady. Anthony Perkins plays with no problem the troubled, nervous secretary and John Gielgud is superb as the dignified waiter with his dead-pan humour. As for Jean-Pierre Cassel he is equally convincing.I admire the way this movie was adapted from such a book, given the theatrical aspect of the plot and their characters. It is a challenge to take an Agatha Christie story and make it successful on screen. This film lives up to my expectations, though you cannot beat the book as often the case !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS has got a feeling over it, a great suspense claustrofobic tight train feeling. Belgian mastermind-detective Hercule Poirot is going to take the train (Orient Express, of course), but finds it snowed in, and an all ready threatened man is found stabbed twelve times. Who did it? It is Poirot that is going to find out with his loyal sidekicks mr.Bianchi (Balsam) and Dr.Constantine (Colouris). The investigations can begin.This kind of movies can only be found the Agatha Christie-way. Spellbinding. Really. However, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is seen out of a direction's, editing, writor's view not that spectacular. The real 8 lies in the mood, the set direction and the amazing star-cast that makes this movie worth seeing. Finney is absolutely hilarious as Poirot, screaming and yelling all the times, almost disturbing. Bacall is also very annoying, by purpose of course, Balsam great ("HE DID IT!!!"), Ingrid Bergman speeks Swedish, Sean Connery is also fantastically rough. But isn't Anthony Perkins' position a little crude. He suffers from traumatic illness from the death of his... yes, mother. It was good, but I'd say that the follow-up DEATH ON THE NILE is a very superior film. Better directing, editing, writing (if you really pause and think a bit, you will found out who did it here, it is easy I see now). It was indeed a not so well written story. I mean the final confession is 30 minutes. Couldn't it be a bit smaller. It's a bit of a disappointment, all he does is question the passengers and *shwish* he knows who it is.Loved it all the way through, but DEATH ON THE NILE is the ultimate Poirot-movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely does a motion picture version of a great novel match up to the quality instilled directly from the author. Murder on the Orient Express, however, is one of those beautiful exceptions that proves the rule. A thrilling film that will keep you guessing until the end (unless one had already read the book), Murder comes complete with an all-star cast which includes such favorites as Lauren Bacall, Sir John Gielgud, and Sean Connery. (And as we've seen many times before, whenever Sean Connery gets on a train, something exciting happens.) The storyine begins understandable complex - while the viewer only sees and hears as much as Hercule Poirot - the film's hero. But through some master directing and writing, all of the once-confusing elements take shape and reveal a stunningly simple plot that seems all-too impossible anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Character-Driven Epic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first in the quarter of mysteries produced by John Goodwin and Richard Brabourne has the starriest cast of all of them - Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Perkins, John Gielgud and Jean-Pierre Cassel all have the chance to flex their acting muscles in a generally acceptable version of the Christie classic. Albert Finney is miscast as Poirot; as well as being too young for the role, he overdoes the gravelly voice and walks with his head cocked on one side, almost as if he is suffering from a stiff neck. Nonetheless he has good support from ex-Mercury Theater company member George Colouris as a bumbling doctor and Martin Balsam as the director of the railway, with a ludicrous Italian accent.In fact, cod accents are one of the hallmarks of this adaptation. As well as Balsam, we have Rachel Roberts as a German ladies' maid, Michael York as a Hungarian count, Wendy Hiller as a mittel-European aristocrat, and Denis Quilley as an Italian-American car salesperson. Add to that Bergman's comic Anglo-Swedish series of guttural grunts (she always refers to that "yung man," to complete a the linguistic panoply.But Christie adaptations are not the place to look for verisimilitude. What matters more is how the murder and the solution has been staged. Director Sidney Lumet has great fun directing his large cast in the confined spaces of a luxury train: one can sense the obvious discomfort experienced by Perkins' McQueen as Poirot comes to share his already confined cabin. In another sequence, Balsam has to balance Hiller's two Pekingese dogs in both hands while Poirot interrogates her; it's hardly surprising that he cannot drink the proffered glass of brandy. The film also benefits from bringing disparate sets of characters together: Poirot recoils in horror as he listens to Bacall's Mrs. Hubbard braying at the top of her voice about her second husband's exploits. Later on, Lumet shows Connery's Col. Arbuthnot becoming more and more disturbed as he sees Redgrave's Mary Debenham (his lover) being closely interrogated by Poirot in one of the train compartments. In an all- star epic such as this, it's characters that matter, and Lumet does them proud.The solution is particularly complicated; and the film benefits from showing it acted out in full, rather than letting Poirot describe it to the assembled company in the third person. For once in Christie, there is a sense of poetic justice about what happens.An entertaining piece, marred only by one historical inaccuracy. In the early sequences shot in Istanbul, we see an orchestra of Turkish musicians playing, all of them wearing fezzes. The action is supposed to take place in 1935; the fez had been rendered illegal in the previous decade by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Realized</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 1960s Agatha Christie (1890-1976) sold the film rights to several of her most celebrated novels--and although the public liked the ensuing films, she herself did not. She was forever after suspicious of the film industry and rejected one offer after another until the early 1970s, when Lord Louis Mountbatten interceded on behalf of son-in-law and film producer John Brabourne for the film rights to MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. Christie reluctantly agreed. In 1974, upon seeing the film, she declared it to be the ONLY film version of any of her novels that she liked.The story is famous. Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) is a celebrated private investigator traveling via the legendary Orient Express. The train is snowbound in the Balkans--and Mr. Rachett (Richard Widmark) is found brutally stabbed in the bed of his luxury room. At the request of Signor Bianchi (Martin Balsam), an official of the train, Poriot agrees to investigate the murder... but the more he learns from the numerous passengers, the more impossible the crime seems.Even today, most film versions of Christie novels are played with a bit of a twinkle in the eye, as if to say "this is all just in good fun." Not so MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. The all star cast includes John Gilegud, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Michael York, Jacqueline Bisset, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Perkins, and Rachel Roberts, to name but the most obvious, and they play out the story with tremendous style but without the self-knowing cuteness that tends to undercut most similar films. The novel is among the more convoluted Christie works, but the Paul Dehn manages to encapsulate it without simplifying it. And then there is the look and sound and feel of the movie, which is simply amazing.The Orient Express had passed into legend by 1974, but this film returns the celebrated luxury train to sparkling reality. From costumes to art design, from cinematography to score, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is so richly detailed that it becomes an almost tactile experience. This is truly an example of "no expense spared." The film was nominated for no fewer than six Academy Awards, winning one for Ingrid Bergman, and was also nominated for no fewer than seventeen awards from other groups, winning at least six. All in all, it was one of the most celebrated films of its era.For many years MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS was only available in mediocre VHS and DVD transfers, but this particular edition not only returns the film to a near-pristine state, it includes several memorable bonuses as well, most especially a "making of" documentary that includes many of the cast members; a short documentary on Agatha Christie; and a short documentary on the Lindberg kidnapping, which was among Christie's inspirations for the novel. Slick, beautiful, and seductive, the 1974 MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS sets a standard for mystery movies that few have equaled--and none have surpassed. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet managed with "Murder on the Orient Express" to do something no other director of film based on a Christie novel had done. He pleased Dame Agatha. No easy feat, but possible because of the brilliant cast. My personal feeling is that Albert Finney overacted Poirot, and was the wrong body type, from Christie's descriptions in her books, despite which he was believable. Ingrid Bergman deserved her Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actress in this film. Every performance in this feature was carefully and skillfully crafted, as well crafted as the beautiful sets of the train, recreated from only partial portions of the original cars. This is the kind of detailed movie that works without special effects and with very flavorful script writing. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Murder On the Orient Express is a very captivating and dramatic movie and it is one of those few movies that is a good adaptation of a work produced by a prolific author such as Agatha Christie.The movie is a smooth flowing movie and it is a must watch for those movie-goers who appreciate the movie for its fineness and crispness. Movie-goers who like to watch movies that demand the viewers paying a fair amount of attention to subtle details or dialogues will surely find the movie interesting.Here I would also like to comment on the cast. The cast is amazing and every person involved has done his or her part with finesse. The plot is very good and the movie flows very smoothly. However, the actors are sporting accents based on their national backgrounds. For instance, the lead character of Poirot would sport a strong Belgian accent. These accents may cause a little difficulty for non-seasoned movie watchers to struggle with understanding of vital dialogues and hence a DVD with subtitles would be useful.Direction, costumes, story, plot, acting and all other elements are dealt with very finely in this movie and this one can surely be rated as a classic.Highly recommended from my side. Cheers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hercules Poirot, the famous detective, is returning to his home in London after a professional trip to the East. Our story finds him in Istanbul, from where he takes the luxurious Orient Express train for Calais. The train is filled with many passengers, and (as usual) one of them is soon murdered. Poirot is convinced by his friend Signor Bianchi, who is the director of the Orient Express, to conduct the investigation for the murder, but he has to act quickly in order to avoid a big scandal. As usual, he solves the case in his unique brilliant style.The director manages to create a thrilling atmosphere. Albert Finney is simply outstanding as Poirot, and Agatha Cristie herself has approved of him. The rest of the cast are great stars and play excellently as well. The script is perfect, with the events flowing smoothly and at times (in particular, during Poirot's monologue presenting the solution at the end) I find it to be even better than the book.The film demands the viewer's concentration and attention to every scene and to every line spoken on that train. You cannot really understand why every detail is placed where it is placed without knowing the solution, so many things will become clearer during the second viewing of the film. But I really do not think that one can understand everything by watching the film only twice.Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm shocked by the people who don't like this movie or suggest that Death on the Nile (inferior in every way) and Evil Under the Sun (truly campy and bad) are better films. To say that Finney is bad in the part (despite his Oscar nomination) is to miss the whole point. He is brilliant as Poirot. He commands the screen in every scene, particularly during the explanation of the crime. It is wonderfully directed by Lumet in a stylistic, effective way other Christie films totally lack. The script is the real gem, reducing the complicated story into a comprehensible and fascinating crime investigation with the best exposition of a crime in any detective story movie. The cast plays their parts perfectly, creating instantly recognized types that are endlessly entertaining and word perfect. The script's witty and all the cast handle the dialogue wonderfully. This movie is an homage to Christie and to the 1930s and is (along with Witness for the Prosecution) the best of Christie adaptations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The classiest film version of an Agatha Christie novel as well as a real rarity --- a whodunit you can watch again and again knowing full well who did it. Directed by Sidney Lumet with stunning cinematography by Geoffrey Unsworth, MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS is the grand entertainment films like Daisy Miller and The Great Gatsby promised to be but weren't. The title tells you the plot and Albert Finney, heavily madeup, is great as Hercule Poirot. He was Oscar-nominated and deserved it. Co-star Ingrid Bergman won for her performance as an idiot missionary. It's open to debate whether or not she deserved it. Made at the height of the "all-star" disaster movie cycle, Lumet assembles a cast of TRUE all-stars: Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Vanessa Redgrave, Richard Widmark, Lauren Bacall, Michael York, etc. Gratefully, there's not a Charlton Heston, George Kennedy or Robert Vaughn in the large cast!</fullReview>

Poirot (Albert Finney) is on that very train, and begins to work on the case as soon as he can, finding out that Ratchett was none other than a mafioso called Cassetti (funny trivia - the name is actually the Italian word for 'drawers'), who had been responsible of the kidnapping and the brutal murder of a little girl, Daisy Armstrong, five years before, which also brought the death of five other people - Daisy's mother, her unborn child, Daisy's father, the falsely accused maid and the maid's mother, and that revenge for Daisy could be a motive.Any of the twelve passengers whose cabins were situated in the same carriage as Cassetti's becomes automatically a suspect, but who actually did it? The secretary (Anthony Perkins)? The butler (John Gielgud)? The Russian Princess (Wendy Hiller)? Her German Maid (Rachel Roberts)? The Hungarian Count (Michael York) and his wife (Jacqueline Bisset)? The American chatterbox (Lauren Bacall)? The train controller (Jean-Pierre Cassel)? The Swedish Missionary (Ingrid Bergman)? The Colonel (Sean Connery)? The Teacher (Vanessa Redgrave)?

This lead to the death (during childbirth) of the mother and the suicide of her father. This could be the vital clue to crack the case, but can he do it in time?

		<fullReview>Murder on the Orient Express is a British mystery film directed by Sidney Lumet.It stars an ensemble cast led by Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot together with Martin Balsam,Richard Widmark,Lauren Bacall,Ingrid Bergman, Sean Connery,John Gielgud,Vanessa Redgrave,Michael York and Anthony Perkins. The screenplay was penned by Paul Dehn and an uncredited Anthony Shaffer that was based on the 1934 novel Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie.It was directed by the talented Sidney Lumet.Having sorted a matter out in the Middle East, detective Hercule Poirot is returning to England aboard the Orient Express. During the journey, Poirot encounters his friend Bianchi, a director of the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits, which owns the line. The train is unusually crowded for the time of year: every first-class berth has been booked. Shortly after the train's departure from Constantinople, a wealthy American businessman, Ratchett, tries to secure Poirot's services for $15,000 since he has received many death threats, but Poirot finds the case of little interest and turns it down. That night the train is caught in heavy snows in the Balkans. The next morning Ratchett is found stabbed to death in his cabin.Poirot and Bianchi work together to solve the case. They enlist the help of Dr. Constantine, a Greek medical doctor who was travelling in another coach with Bianchi as the only other passenger and thus is not a suspect. Pierre Michel (Jean-Pierre Cassel), the middle-aged French conductor of the car, also assists the investigation, as well as being a suspect. Poirot soon discovers that Ratchett was not who he claimed to be. The victim's secret past indicates a clear motive for murder, even justification, but who was the killer?Dr. Constantine's examination of the body reveals that Ratchett was stabbed 12 times. Some wounds were slight, but at least three of them could have resulted in death.The stopped watch in the victim's pocket, as well as Poirot's reconstructed timeline of passenger activities the night before, indicate that Ratchett was murdered at about 1:15 a.m. The train had stopped, surrounded by fresh snow, before that time. There are no tracks in the snow and the doors to the other cars were locked, so the murderer is almost certainly still among the passengers in the coach in which Ratchett was killed.Most importantly, Poirot discovers that Ratchett's name was an assumed one, his real name being Casseti, a gangster who planned and carried out the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong five years ago, the infant daughter of a wealthy British Army Colonel who had settled in America with his American-born wife. The ruthless kidnappers demanded ransom be paid in exchange for infant; but after it was delivered, they murdered the child. Overcome with grief after discovering the infant's corpse, the pregnant Mrs. Armstrong went into labor early and died while giving birth to a stillborn baby. A maidservant named Paulette who was wrongly suspected of being involved in the kidnapping committed suicide. Colonel Armstrong, consumed by these tragedies, later killed himself as well. Cassetti's accomplice was arrested and executed, but Cassetti betrayed his partner and fled the country with the ransom, as he was only revealed to be the leader on the eve of the execution.Having established these facts, Poirot, Dr. Constantine and Bianchi summon the other passengers one by one and proceed to interrogate them.Despite the interesting premise of the movie and the power of the cast,it was short on thrills.Also,the movie wasn't absorbing and engaging enough especially when the interrogation happened.It became talky and not-so-interesting.But nevertheless,Finney delivered a great performance for an eccentric turn that's unlike anything else he's ever attempted as Hercule Poirot.Overall,it remains a fun and entertaining murder mystery film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Enhanced Valentine to a Brand of Detective Story That May Well Be One of the Last Unchanging Items in Our Volume-Increasing World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Deciding the pitch for this stylistically pleasing version of this classic mystery is Albert Finney's relentlessly entertaining performance as Hercule Poirot, Dame Agatha's Belgian detective whose haughty, self-possessed intelligence rivals Sherlock, or at least conventional interpretations of Sherlock. When Hercule initially appears in the film, feasting with refined revulsion in an Istanbul hotel, one can't even be certain it's actually Finney, so changed is he by black, out-and-out pelt hair, buffed mustache, corpulent, middle-aged build and a musical-comedy French pronunciation that drifts in and out, as is correct. The performance is comprised of the brand of riotously stagy exaggerations that are amusing both for the aim realized and the chances taken. This is the case with all the other stars: Lauren Bacall as a forceful, talkative American widow, Rachel Roberts as a very odd German maid, Sean Connery as a square British Army officer, Jacqueline Bisset as a good-looking Hungarian countess, Wendy Hiller as a Russian princess, Jean-Pierre Cassel as a doubtful sleeping-car conductor and, most notably, Ingrid Bergman as a wistful Swedish nurse-missionary.While all else are cheerfully hamming it up a la classic murder mystery cinema from the 1930s and '40s, Bergman remains in a solid, long, stationary take while she creates a real and moving character before our eyes for but one scene. Otherwise, everyone in the film is extremely occupied with acting, and one shouldn't be distracted by the detail that some of the actors have played comparable roles before, like Anthony Perkins as a maybe dangerous man of vague youth, John Gielgud as an exacting jeeves, Vanessa Redgrave as a serenely fervent Englishwoman and Richard Widmark as a callous American millionaire. Let me also make myself clear about how much I also enjoyed Martin Balsam, Michael York, Colin Blakely, George Coulouris and Denis Quilley. However comparatively minor it is in the filmography of one Sidney Lumet, Murder on the Orient Express is nevertheless a very unambiguous example of everyone being significant to a movie's accomplishment.The time is the mid-1930s, five years after an infamous kidnapping case on Long Island, particularized in a first-rate, purely cinematic introductory sequence, and it's set aboard the Orient Express. The puzzle of the killing, which is perpetrated the second night out, is disentangled by Hercule Poirot in the time it takes to burrow the train out of a stubborn Balkan snowdrift, but not before every single character has been seen in a distrustful light and identities have been twisted. Besides being the kind of whodunit that deals with murder as a generally nonviolent nuisance, a cerebral puzzle to be deciphered as courteously as possible, hint by hint, this Christie-approved adaptation evokes that simple, pre-WWII era when the Orient was still enigmatic and railroad travel was alive with mysterious promise.This is a striking departure for Lumet at a time when he was busy making some of the most important works of naturalism of the time. Unlike those films especially, there is too much music on the soundtrack. Above all when the train is on track I pine for hearing, shrill and unmistakable, the heavy, repetitive, wheel-on-rail mechanical heartbeat that The Lady Vanishes and La Bete Humaine used to so thoroughly pull us into the grimy atmosphere and sheathed world of the railroad. This isn't a thriller, since we're not thrilled, or fearful, just pleased. The slaying itself has an especially sterile, ceremonial characteristic, and the inquiry is a drill in stylish grilling and gasps of righteous anger. What I admired most about this movie is its style, both the consciously traditional visual approach used by Lumet, and the lively overplaying of the dozen or more suspects.They mold a properly off-the-wall character zoo and ostensibly have nothing in common with each other. It concludes with an incredibly extensive scene in which Poirot politely requests that everyone be quiet as he gives explanation of his innumerable hypotheses of the case. He does so exhaustively, and it's pleasure of a relatively spiteful variety watching a dozen expensive stars sit and hush while Finney expertly rules the scene. And thus we have an advanced, if very lightweight, commemoration of a trademark sort of whodunit that, much like the English themselves, may well be one of the last unsullied treasures of human experience in our ever-inflating, globalizing world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has there ever been a more elegant movie? The cinematography, music, set and fashion design, and most of all, the quality of acting, is unsurpassed. Albert Finney should have received the Academy Award for his performance.The premise is tragic; not the stuff of classy movies. But, since the bad guy gets his, every thing turns out all right. Each actor simply "is" his or her part; but then, each was the best in his or her field at the time.Tony Perkins was too typecast. He is excellent, but the role is distractingly familiar. It is a shame Perkins was forever cast into the "Psycho" stereotype.Even so, the only casting I would rather see changed is Lauren Bacall; she does not have the underlying substance to fill out the character she plays; she has always been, in her roles and admittedly, in her private life (via her autobiography) exactly like the person she portrayed as "Harriet Hubbard". I would have rather seen a deeper and more substantive actress for the part; Ingrid Bergman would have brought much more depth, for instance. Bacall just didn't make a believable transition to, "The Greatest American Dramatic Actress of Her Day." She has always played somewhat of a shallow floozie, and the image fits her. I loved her clothes though.This is indeed an escapist film. Sidney Lumet was a great director and several of these stars indicated they would not have made this film, were he not in that role. Indeed, Agatha Christie would not have allowed it to be made.This is a wonderful visual and intellectual experience.</fullReview>

Albert Finney plays famed sleuth Hercule Poirot, Martin Balsam plays his Watson, while the murder suspects include Lauren Bacall, Jacqueline Bissett, Michael York, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Rachel Roberts, Sean Connery, Vanessa Redgrave, Jean-Pierre Cassell, Anthony Perkins and Ingrid Bergman, who won her third Oscar (undeservedly) for her performance as a dowdy and devout spinster.The sheer number of characters virtually guarantees that some actors are going to be shoved to the sidelines, and that's exactly what happens. It's a bit of a disappointment to see such a talented cast given such plot-driven rather than character-driven material to work with, but this is a murder mystery, and it's simply part of the genre. If you go in with your expectations in the right place, you will probably have a pretty good time.Grade: B+</fullReview>

The speaker addresses actor Anthony Perkins, best remembered by -Pshyco- and its final scene whence not even a fly could make him move: the PANOPTICUM or focus is installed in this marvelous adaptation of beauty in the train itself where the passengers all engage in a synchronic act of murder and the kernel is resolute to stand-clear for the outcome: in a play of magicians, the seven samurais are revealed: all the passengers killed the dead man.

		<fullReview>Another jewel in the directorial crown of the late Sidney Lumet was 1974's Murder on the Orient Express, an expensive and stylish mounting of Agatha Christie's classic novel, which follows the train of the title as a weather delay reveals that a murder was committed on the train the day before. Luckily, Hercule Poirot happens upon the scene and goes straight into investigative mode in order to find out who the killer is.From the beautiful opening credits bathed against a pink satin backdrop, you can tell that you are in for an elegant and sophisticated cinematic adventure that entertains from the very beginning. For anyone who has read or watched a lot of murder mysteries, figuring out what's going on is no chore and you will have figured it out about halfway through, but the journey to the denouement is such a pleasure thanks to Lumet's polished direction and the impressive all-star cast he has gathered for this party.A nearly unrecognizable Albert Finney received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his icy and all-business Hercule Poirot. Finney's impressive supporting cast of suspects includes Lauren Bacall, Martin Balsam, Ingrid Bergman (Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actress), Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Perkins, Michael York,.Jacqueline BIsset, Jean-Pierre Cassell, Rachel Roberts, Colin Blakely, and Richard Widmark as the victim.Paul Dehn's somewhat rambling screenplay is made palatable by Lumet, who somehow manages to make a somewhat predictable story deliciously entertaining from opening to closing credits.</fullReview>

I concede it might be minor in term of global impact, especially in 1974, a significant year for movies, but there are chances that a minor Sidney Lumet film might be better than some major productions.Yet it does provide an awkward feeling very unlikely from the director who contributed to some of the grittiest and realistic dramas of the 70's, all set in New York City: "Serpico", "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Network". "Murder on the Orient Express" seems to belong to another filmography, much more to another era but the reason why it's such a good movie is because the feeling is deliberately created and by no means is fortuitous: by escaping from his usual time and space, Lumet made a tribute to Hollywood Golden Age classics, to old-fashioned dialog and even over-the-top and campy acting to the limits of parody. I don't mean 'parody' as 'slapstick' but as a sort of tribute in the same vein than Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein", directed the same year. Like Brooks, Lumet transcends the classicism of the original material and create something weirdly anachronistic but in its weirdness, always enjoyable and entertaining.The film opens in 1930, in a dark and foggy atmosphere, with a series of flashbacks relating the kidnapping of a rich Colonel's daughter. The succession of images is so confusing that I doubt the viewers would really remember the names, but what sticks in mind is that the central murder's mystery would probably have a connection with this sordid case, and that's what matters. 5 years later, the Orient Express takes its departure from Turkey to London, in one wagon, 12 passengers including a last- minute guest, Hercule Poirot cordially invited by the Italian line director: Bianchi, played by Martin Balsam. One of the delights of the film is to notice subtle details during a second viewing, like the entrance of Poirot that perturbed the French wagon intendant, Pierre (Jean-Pierre Cassel), it's almost imperceptible but you can see, and understand, that Poirot wasn't the most welcome. This point is important because that's precisely the trademark of movies like "Murder", they confuse first, but as soon as they make sense, they're watched again with much more relief and pleasure. As it's stated in the tag-line, everyone is suspect of the murder that is committed the night after. The victim is Ratchett (Richard Widmarck), an American tycoon and target of several threatening letters, constantly consigned by his personal secretary, McQueen (Anthony Perkins). Ratchett asks Mr. Poirot for protection, an offer declined by the detective. Next morning, Beddoes, Ratchett's butler played by no one else but the distinguished and irreplaceable John Gielgud, knocks at the door and as we expect, no answer. Ratchett's body is found dead, after having been stabbed 12 times by a knife. The only clue that Poirot manages to resurrect through a very scientific method is a piece of burnt paper revealing one name : Daisy Armstrong, Ratchett is revealed as the instigator of the kidnapping that opened the film.One revelation leads to another, not only did the ill-fated Daisy Armstrong die, but she also caused the death of her mother after she gave birth to a dead baby, then a wrongly accused maid and Colonel Armstrong himself committed suicide, elevating to five the number of persons killed directly or indirectly by the victim. By a simple deduction, anyone with a vague connection with one of these five victims is a potential suspect. But the film doesn't embarrass itself with twists and complexities; we see it coming despite some deliberately misleading clues. 12 suspects, 12 wounds, 12 reasons to kill Ratchett. One crucial discussion occurs with a Colonel played by Sean Connery when he mentions the fairness of a system where 12 people decide of the guilt or innocence of an accused person. An 'eureka' moment for Poirot who could see the implications of such statement but for me, I certainly thought of "12 Angry Men", Lumet's breakthrough film when another all- star was applying justice. Come on, the similarity of the two films' posters can't be coincidental.I don't dispose of enough lines to enumerate all the dialogs that enrich the film, but the talent of Lumet is to never make them repetitive because each actor plays a different character with a specific personality, Lauren Bacall is obnoxiously pompous as Mrs. Hubbard an American socialite, while Ingrid Bergman is unrecognizable as a Swedish bigot, with her constantly frightened look (she got the Oscar for that role), Jacqueline Bisset and Vanessa Redgrave illuminate the screen through their grace, and Wendy Hiller is scary as the ghostly Princess Dragoniroff. But it's Albert Finney who orchestrates through a virtuoso performance full of irresistible mannerisms and flamboyance the whole movie. I would have been upset if he had won over Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson or Dustin Hoffman that year, but the honor went to Art Carney, so let's call it a fair game.To Finney's credit again, when you can harangue a whole assembly of prestigious actors like he did during the final monologue without losing the audience, it's certainly a talent beyond the talent. I admit that it creates a sort of theatrical impression, that "Murder on the Orient Express" seems staged and old-fashioned but again, it was deliberate, and the magic of Lumet with the bravura of Finney and the stars' self-indulgence make the whole film a very enjoyable spectacle. And much more, it makes you want to read the novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be average, but it's quite good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a rather insensitive bit of profiteering, Agatha Christie repurposed the Lindbergh kidnapping (and recast it as a violent home invasion) just 2 years after it occurred, for this potboiler. But it's pretty good. Criminal Ratchett (Richard Widmark - as the heavy... again) is murdered on an international train trip, and detective Hercule Poirot happens to be around to investigate. The David Suchet characterization (tv) is very nice, but it would not suffice as the anchor of a two hour film. As Christies detective, Finney is off, but he's excellent regardless. It's a great performance with many memorable little flourishes. The British acting schools produce unusually adept talent, when it comes to language. The ending has always been one of Christie's most impressive solutions. Fasten your seatbelt for Finney's lengthy summation, in which he makes nearly every sentence in long, astute paragraphs vivid and memorable. It's a breathtaking sequence. The summation is punctuated by alternate takes of earlier scenes. It works very well. How rare it is when the last act of a movie isn't just a lazy unraveling of everything that came before. Wendy Hiller is a hoot as a seemingly thousand year old Princess. Cassell delivers the goods as a porter. Unfortunately, every frame featuring Anthony Perkins is atrocious. He manages to strike the wrong note in every scene, grotesquely over-acting and looking asinine. Luckily there are several good performances to distract you from Perkins incompetence.The movie is filled with smart camera movements you probably won't notice on first viewing. And since you don't see camera work like this in any other Lumet movie, credit probably goes to the cinematographer. A wordless prologue is very nice. If it has any flaws, it's in the rather staid middle section where twelve suspects mus be questioned. Bennett's score is generally good, but every time we cut to the exterior of the train, we hear that infernal waltz. We hear it five times in the first half hour, making it quite tiresome, but the rest of the score including the incidental music is very nice; a low oboe chord for threats, and a shrieking whistle as Ratchett collapses.I also don't care for the curtain call at the end, which seems like it could have been handled less artificially as three individual shots of four people toasting. As the film deals with nothing weighty outside itself, MotOE falls just short of being important. But it's an entertaining yarn capably assembled, with more than enough talent on display.TRIVIA: There are two re-pairings from popular moves: Martin Balsam &amp; Anthony Perkins, from Psycho -- Colin Blakely &amp; Rachel Roberts, from This Sporting Life. -- There are two references to Hitchcock's 'The Lady Vanishes.' Ratchett disappears in a tunnel, &amp; an initial is drawn on a fogged window. -- There are two musical references to Shirley Temple (The Good Ship Lollipop, Animal Crackers) -- Two characters are coded to appear gay: Hector MacQueen and Hildegarde Schmidt -- George Couloris who played Thatcher in Citizen Kane is along for the ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Agatha Christie tale makes for an entertaining yarn about a mysterious murder on a famous trans-continental express, the 'Orient Express'. There are some fine performances in supporting roles, and Albert Finney makes quite a credible Hercule Poirot. The support cast reads like a who's who of acting talent from this period, and included such stars as Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Vanessa Redgrave, Michael York, Sean Connery, Jacqueline Bisset, Sir John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller and Anthony Perkins!Sidney Lumet's direction is cool and professional as he guides his star-studded cast through its paces, while to his credit he lets the plot do the work. For it is the plot of course, which makes this the entertaining film it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Samuel Ratchett(Richard Windmark)asks Poirot(Albert Finney, having a field day as the sleuth)to be his bodyguard after receiving several death threats. He is later found dead and Poirot discovers quite a secret..Ratchett is indeed a notorious gangster Cassetti, the mastermind behind a kidnapping gone awry with the end result being the death of little girl Daisey Armstrong. Everyone on board is suspect as Poirot, with help by Signor Bianchi(the wonderful Martin Balsam)and Dr. Constantine(George Coulouris), will pursue the truth through a complex investigation that gets muddied when clues of a possible killer emerge as a concierge suit(a missing button from the suit is later found with a key to all the rooms hidden in the pocket)is found as well as the dagger. Through a collection of testimonials from each passenger on board, Poirot puts together his case.This film, as slickly directed by Lumet, does show the viewer little cues before and after the murder takes place who might've possibly done it. The opening set-up with the Armstrong family is a bit elusive, but after you watch the interrogations, Lumet allows you to understand what that opening montage of clips and such means. This cast is simply awesome, definitely the best I've seen assembled and that alone is novelty to re-watch this over and over. I consider it one of the all-time greatest entertainments. A good old fashioned mystery to escape into for two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unrecognizable under pounds of makeup, a portly looking Albert Finney fails to make Hercule Poiret a believable character. He's as convincing as Marlon Brando in The Godfather, which is to say not convincing at all. That error in casting takes much of the sparkle out of this movie despite the all star cast. The sluggish pacing doesn't help either. Nonetheless, that cast and the production values make this a worthwhile trip. Particularly effective is Richard Widmark as the victim and Anthony Perkins as his nervous secretary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad, but not nearly as good as I remembered it (CONTAINS SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my IMDb review for another movie, I said that this one was a masterpiece and that Albert Finney was the definitive Poirot. In fact I hadn't seen it for a long, long time, and after rewatching it I found out that I was quite wrong. The movie is still a pretty good mystery, but Albert Finney's performance is totally overacted, and, in fact, his Poirot resembles a toad, with his head sunk between his shoulders, and his eyes looking upwards all the time. He seems to be playing more of a mannierist spoof of Poirot in a comedy than Poirot himself in a mystery movie. I love Mr. Finney (and I'm a big fan of his criminally underrated "Scrooge"), but he performed horribly as Poirot. In fact, sorry to say he's the worst screen Poirot I've seen.Also, I found the conclusion of the mystery to be quite unrealistic: (WARNING: HUGE SPOILER!) I think that all those civilized people would better hire a killer that nobody could relate to them, or simply choose ONE of them to commit the murder, instead of all of them catching the same train in the same day, and stabbing their objective again and again like in a ritual, exposing themselves to be easily discovered by any investigator, even if he wasn't half as smart as Poirot. But then, you need a bit of "suspension of disbelief", and, if you have it, you'll enjoy the movie (END OF SPOILER).So, this movie is not THAT great ("Death on the Nile" and "Evil Under the Sun" are far superior for my taste, and Peter Ustinov is way better in the lead role), but still very entertaining, beautifully photographed and scored, well acted by most of the cast, and among the best work of Sidney Lumet (a director I consider to be a big bore most of times). Very worth renting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murder on the Orient Express feels like a bad sandwich encased in terrific bread. The opening sequences are very well handled (kudos to Jean-Pierre Cassel for delivering dialogue in at least five languages), but once the murder has been discovered, the middle, when Poirot must interview the passengers one by one, tends to sag. The pacing just isn't there. The final sequence, however, is among the best in the film, from Poirot's narration to the scene revealing the solution to the crime. The blue light was an absolute stroke of genius.Bacall is brilliant. There's no other way to describe her performance. She deserved a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this film. John Gielgud looks like he's having way too much fun in the final flashback, and it shows a side of him I've never seen anywhere else.If you haven't seen it, it's a worthwhile view, but sadly, not up to the book. One word of caution, though: DON'T TELL ANYONE YOU'RE GOING TO WATCH IT. The solution to the mystery is so outrageous and unprecedented that even non-fans know it, and you mustn't give anyone the opportunity to tell you what happens. The final payoff will be much more satisfying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1974, Sidney Lumet organised the first World Ham Acting Championships.Albert Finney opened the proceedings with a sparkling display of hunched shoulders, excitable gestures and funny French accent. He was the only entrant in the race for Best Male Ham in a Leading Role but it was universally agreed that his gold medal was fully merited.There was then a bitter dispute between Lauren Bacall, Wendy Hiller, Ingrid Bergman and Vanessa Redgrave as to who was qualified to compete for Best Female Ham in a Leading Role. No agreement could be reached, so it was decided to scratch the event.Best Male Ham in a Supporting Role was hotly contested.George Coulouris made the early running with his wild hair and his wild eyes but soon came under pressure from Anthony Perkins's stuttering, neurotic mummy's boy.Martin Balsam and Denis Quilley traded phony Italian accents until both were reeling with exhaustion.Richard Widmark was quick off the mark, with a fine exhibition of snarling and sneering, but picked up an injury and had to retire early.The hopes of the home crowd lay with Sean Connery. With his renowned inability to sustain an English accent he was thought to be a good bet for a medal, but a withering display of cultured disdain brought John Gielgud unexpectedly into contention in the latter stages of the race.Two contestants failed to finish: Jean-Pierre Cassel was disqualified for not trying, while Michael York thought he had entered the World Wooden Acting Championships and withdrew his entry when he realised his mistake.However, all this was just the prelude to the main event: Best Female Ham in a Supporting Role.Jacqueline Bisset and Vanessa Redgrave opted out of the main competition and engaged in a personal duel of girly fluttering and flirting.Rachel Roberts was not one of the pre-tournament favourites, but her crop-haired, butch German lesbian briefly unsettled the more fancied runners. However, they all came back strongly and the three medals eventually went according to the form book.Lauren Bacall unleashed her pushy, mouthy American Grand Dame and looked to be sweeping to an easy victory when she was suddenly caught in the final strait by Wendy Hiller's extraordinary Russian accent and unprecedented enunciation.With the two favourites going neck-and-neck, nobody noticed Ingrid Bergman's dolorous mangled syntax making a late surge on the outside. It took her abreast of her two rivals and it looked like there might be a three-way tie, but Bergman made a final desperate lunge and broke the tape with her 'little brown babies' to carry off the prize. The Hollywood Academy later ratified this as a World Record.The credits rolled, the crowd went home happy (me included) and the event was deemed a big success, so it was agreed to hold the next World Championships in four years time on the set of Death on the Nile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finney not really Poirot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having read most, if not all, of Dame Agatha Christie's works, I find that the 1974 movie falls short of expectations. The performances of Peter Ustinov (movies) and David Suchet (PBS) far outweigh that of Albert Finney. I believe that some of this is due to the stellar cast present in the movie, and the fact that Finney may have had difficulty in carrying his character. The low key Ustinov and the fastidious Suchet present themselves as more the Poirot intended by Christie, and not the greasy haired and pompous Finney. I respect Finney for having undertaken the role, but he does fall far short of the reader's expectations. When one reads many stories involving a particular character, a mental picture of that character is formed; Ustinov, to a degree, but Suchet, to the max, fit that perception.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie full of classic stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a big fan of Agatha Christie and read probably all of her novels. She is sure a Queen of mystery and it is always a joy to later be reminded of all the clues she gave us that would let us solve the mystery, this is where I preferred her books to those of Conan Doyle where one didn't have as many possibilities to solve the crime based on actual clues.So of course I was interested in this movie. Considering the great story it was based on and the amazing cast that we get to see here, it is sure worth watching. Some things were not really as great as I hoped but for the most part it was an awesome entertainment.Let just start with the few things that I wasn't too fond about. I was actually surprised to read that this was Agatha Christie's favorite portrayal of Hercule Poirot. Really, I never imagined him like that. From all the stories Hercule Poirot seemed to be a very intellectual and at the same time gentle and elegant man. Albert Finney's portrayal was a bit over the top for me.Also while the movie is entertaining, I actually preferred the story as a book. When a story is so much based on dialogues it is really much better to read it oneself and imagine it all and also I must say with the book there seemed to have been way more clues. When Poirot was telling the outcome at the end of the movie it seemed way more far fetched to me than when I read the book.But it has also a lot of points that make the movie worth watching. For once it has a beautiful setting and costumes. The scene of everyone boarding the train was magnificent. The scene when we see the murder being committed is also amazingly done, with all the lightning and angles. Also when we get the clues that we heard before they are using a different lens to it that contributes to the atmosphere.And of course the cast! Was very impressive. I really liked Lauren Bacall. Ingrid Bergman while not too long on screen did such an amazing performance that she absolutely stood out for me in this movie. Loved to see Anthony Perkins and the Psycho references towards his character.So this movie is definitely worth watching but its is far from perfection of the book.</fullReview>

It has all the superficiality of movies historical of the 1970's---and it's money came from its star power. But poor accents from the non Europeans and Finney combined with, as has been pointed out, his absurd 'constipated' look and nonstop barking and harsh throaty voice makes this hard to finish-particularly the last 20 minutes. Have you ever been able to listen to someone shout for any period of time? Strange choice Finney-but at this time he was trying many different roles on stage-and his Hamlet and Macbeth were similarly afflicted with vocal worries and brusk and "busy" movement.Stylish and fairly true to the story-but in the end rather a bore.The new 'movie, from 2010 with Suchet is far too obsessed with dark and cold and 'what IS justice" --so that it makes Poirot seem small minded and angry---and its limited budget shows. Yet he is a wonderful Poirot-the best so far-and- outside of the homophobic who misread his feyness---it is somewhat more watchable than this despite its foolish additions and too severe Poriot portrait......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A murder takes place on the famous train. Inspector Poirot happens to be boarding the train and so he investigates the incident while the train is stuck due to a snow avalanche. Poirot discovers the culprits, motives, and the method by which the crime was committed. At the end, he assembles all the suspects in a dining car and presents two possible scenarios. One is a simple scenario: a Mafioso disguised as a train conductor came in, killed the victim and left at a train stop, leaving a conductor's uniform as evidence. Another scenario is more complex: all 12 passengers on the first class compartment had motives to kill the victim, they conspired to ride the train on the same day and together killed the victim in the middle of the night. Between these two scenarios, Poirot decides to present the first, more simple one to the Yugoslav police at the next train stop. The second, more complex story, Poirot decides to keep it as a secret shared between the twelve passengers and himself.The world prefers simpler explanations. The world will not understand the complicated reasons and stories of people's pain, anguish and need for justice.Stories involving people are always complex. Never are they so simple. Yet the world prefers simpler stories and simpler conclusions. So the true nature of human incidents may be better to be hidden as a secret for those directly involved, and simpler versions be given out to the public.

Just watch the man in all of his quaint expressions and gestures. Why our working-class hero has gone foreign! He deservedly leads a cast of the day to die for. I won't list 'em; you can read the blurb. Sometimes the carriage resembles a club for Hollywood seniors.A disagreeable fellow has been murdered. Hercule Poirot must find the culprit before the snowbound 'express' can be rescued and the passengers disperse. The cream of acting get to play a cracking script that is timed and directed almost to perfection. The characterization is a little clichéd, but then this was originally a novel, and Agatha Christie wrote with a view to impressing the reader's less reliable imagination.This is a beautiful and engaging movie. Although filmed almost entirely within railway carriages, there is no sense of claustrophobia or set and scene limitation - quite a feat in itself. The train looks authentic, and in view of the significant budget I have no doubt that it is.No pyrotechnics, no special-effects, no blood-n-guts, but thoroughly absorbing entertainment even so. You can see why Agatha Christie has become a global institution, and why 'stars' usually deserve their fee.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Murder on the Orient Express</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From BAFTA nominated director Sidney Lumet, this is pretty much the only Agatha Christie novel I have always heard about and wanted to see, and I was glad when I did. Basically the film opens seeing the story of three-year-old Daisy Armstrong being kidnapped and murdered, before moving five years later to see many passengers boarding the Orient Express. On the train is famous Belgian detective Hercule Poirot (Oscar and BAFTA nominated Albert Finney), and not long after the journey begins he meets Ratchett (Richard Widmark) who wants to hire him for an investigation, which he refuses. Next morning, Ratchett (next door to Poirot) has been murdered with twelve stab wounds, with a smoked cigar, a handkerchief and a wound back clock as clues. As the train is stuck in a snow drift, Poirot is asked by friend Bianchi (Martin Balsam) to interrogate all passengers till the snow is cleared to find the guilty person or persons responsible for the crime. Passengers, or suspects, include Ratchett's secretary Hector McQueen (Psycho's Anthony Perkins), Ratchett's butler Beddoes (BAFTA winning John Gielgud), talkative socialite Mrs. Hubbard (Lauren Bacall), Swedish missionary Greta Ohlsson (Oscar and BAFTA winning Ingrid Bergman), British army Colonel Arbuthnot (Sir Sean Connery), aristocrat Count Rudolf Andrenyi (Michael York) and his wife Elena (Jacqueline Bisset), elderly Russian Princess Dragomiroff (Wendy Hiller) and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt (Rachel Roberts) and teacher Mary Debenham (Vanessa Redgrave). After questioning all the passengers Poirot pieces together the mystery to get a pretty accurate idea of how the murder played out, and the conclusion is quite surprising, so much so that the crime is almost let go (for justice) in the end. Also starring Jean-Pierre Cassel as Pierre Paul Michel, Colin Blakely as Hardman, Denis Quilley as Foscarelli and George Coulouris as Doctor. Finney is very compelling as the likable detective, Bergman does quite well in her award winning role, and the all-star supporting cast all get their moment during the questioning to make this a very gripping classic murder mystery. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Music for Richard Rodney Bennett, Best Writing, Screenplay Adapted From Other Material, and it won the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing and Best Film.

		<shortDescription>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (Sidney Lumet, 1974) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Agatha Christie was undoubtedly among the most popular crime/mystery novelists of the 20th century; consequently, her work was often brought to the screen ? but, ironically, the only adaptation she approved was the last to be made prior to her death in 1976. That film was actually MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, which I had not watched in some 20 years; it is perhaps the most renowned and commercially successful of the lot, but certainly not the best ? Billy Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (1957) and (my personal favorite) Rene' Clair's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE (1945) are far superior in my opinion. Lumet's effort is nonetheless commendable (particularly for someone usually associated with hard-hitting fare) for a variety of reasons: it spelled a revived interest in this type of old-fashioned entertainment, launched the Hercule Poirot series of films based on the cases undertaken ? and shrewdly ? solved by Christie's famous (if somewhat less-than-human, especially in Albert Finney's interpretation here!) Belgian detective. Besides, that outstanding cast is hard to resist: Finney, Richard Widmark (as the murder victim), Lauren Bacall, Martin Balsam, Ingrid Bergman, Jacqueline Bisset, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave (who would go on to portray Agatha Christie herself in a 1978 film), Rachel Roberts, Michael York, etc. Finney was nominated for an Oscar for his impressive but (it seemed to me) over-the-top portrayal of Poirot and Bergman won her third Oscar for virtually a 5-minute role as a religiously fanatical nanny! The clever ? if unlikely ? revelation involves the 'ambush' (getting his just desserts during a snowbound train journey) of the perpetrator of a fatal child kidnapping (the real-life Lindbergh case of the early 1930s served as inspiration) by relatives and friends of the people involved. Still, for all its reputation, the film is basically a flawed exercise in style (with a meticulously-crafted 'glamorous' look compensating for contrived plotting and a sluggish pace) and theatricality (as can be expected from the convergence of the various acting schools at work). Richard Rodney Bennett's lush score (which seems to have aggravated famed thriller composer Bernard Herrmann no end!) opted for a nostalgic feel but which puts the appropriate dramatic emphasis where required. Overall, it is great fun and clearly the best of the Poirot films (David Suchet later starred in a long-running TV series of which I own over 60 episodes!) ? though I am also quite fond of its follow-up, DEATH ON THE NILE (1978; with Peter Ustinov and another cast to-die-for)?being also the very first film I ever acquired on VHS (recorded off local TV) way back in 1985!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Poirot movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This murder mystery movie based on the Agatha Christie novel is good but nothing more as that.The movie starts of quite slow and waste too much time on some needless character introduction. The movie finally starts to flow well after the murder occurred. But after that the movie is almost over again. Poirot does very little detective work in this movie and every character is interrogated only once.But credit has to be given to the execution of the movie. The sets and costumes are great and the all star cast is impressive and of course the story itself is also interesting to say the least and contains quite some fun moments actually.Albert Finney was impressive as 'the little funny man' Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. You could hardly recognize him and he played the part very well with a good accent. Other actors that impressed in this all star movie were Anthony Perkins and Ingrid Bergman in an award winning performance.Good but too flawed to be regarded a classic.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but could be better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has one of the most impressive casts ever assembled in one film. But, does bigness always equal greatness? I don't think so. I think Albert Finney was not the right person to play Poirot-he is just too sluggish in the role. He portrays Poirot as someone who abrasive or irritating at times. For instance, when Poirot meets the conductor(Martin Balsam)of the O.E., after sitting down at a table on the steamer(or it maybe a ferry), Poirot tears up a menu and throws the remains behind him leaving a mess. I read quite few Agatha Christie books, so I do have a general idea of how he is portrayed in the novels-and not one of them has Poirot acting this way at all.On the other hand, the film has some fine moments(possible spoiler ahead-depends on who you ask)The first 5 minutes we get the reason why the murder takes place. It shows Baby Armstrong being kidnapped followed by the getaway. Then at the end of this montage, we see a newspaper headline encased with blood that reads "Daisy found slain" If you look closely, you will recognize some of the characters who appear later in the film.A man is murdered on the train(Richard Widmark)Who did it and why? It's up to Poirot to sort out the mess. This murder was carefully planned-five years in the making-but one thing the murderer hasn't planned on was that Poirot was on the train.This is a good movie, but Someone else should have played Poirot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most important part of any crime mystery is the final resolution - when the murderer is revealed. In this film I felt that this was done poorly. Bearing in mind that I had read the book - it was to be no surprise when I "found" out. But for people who had not read the book, I would expect that they would not quite understand what was happening. You see, instead of a short sharp shock, the resolution ambles on and it's a few minutes before one realises that Monsieur Poirot has actually told you who the murderer is.The rest of it, however, is pleasant enough. Although, I think that Finney's Poirot is too forced compared to the subtle charms of David Suchet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lush twisted film. Only minor scuffs of its pop culture regurgitation remain.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet's most ambitious work before his duo of masterpieces in the mid-70s adapted Agatha Christie's iconic novel Murder On The Orient Express vibrantly to the big screen. Assembling a world class cast of Brits, Americans and others from stage and screen for world class characters, the film already glistens out of the can. Granted, this is a story that's been parodied to death. It's a very familiar formula. Set up, crime, investigation, revelation, with frills scattered throughout. The film does suffer from aspects grown out of fashion. Transitions where the frame flips don't age well. But otherwise the film demonstrates engaging style in its opening montage, though it didn't need all of its 40 minutes to set the premise up. It improves as it delves into the potential vengeful natures of each character. Albert Finney's campy portrayal of Belgian detective Hercule Poirot is a treat. There's fine performances in its supporting cast too, ones that call to themselves with good reason, especially Lauren Bacall, Anthony Perkins and the Oscar winning Ingrid Bergman. It's a twisted tale that leaves you with a sly knot in your stomach despite all the lushness of its production and dynamic photography.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy, elegant touch to mystery movie. One of the best adaptation of Agaths Christie's story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well the movie starts with haunted music with dark, b/w and sepia tone images/scenes which gives us intriguing feeling. Sydney has shown the incident of kidnapping and media coverage in extremely thoughtful and creative establishing shot.What follows later is equally creative. Be it train scenes, character's introduction and Hercule Poirot's entry. Especially the train departure and background score is awesome as if it's musical journey. Camera moving backwards giving us long shot and slowly moving forward towards train's headlight. It's one of my favorite scenes.We have already seen Sydney Lumet handling lot of character in confined space in movie '12 Angry Men'. He does it with ease in Orient Express as well. Train compartment hardly gives privilege of camera movement which can make scene interesting. As far as screenplay is concerned he has completely justified the Agatha Chirstie's story. Remarkable attempt.Only thing bothers is character of Poirot played by Finny. I really find it difficult watching him playing famous detective monsieur Poirot. Certainly there were other options available I guess. Peter Ustinov would have been far better. Except that it's mile stone in mystery movies. There are very few movie which makes us feel as part of the movie. This is one of them. All other actors have played their part very well. I can see why Ingrid Bergman won Oscar. Her interrogation with Hercule was single long shot. Usage of extreme close up was necessary to show her expression clearly.Cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth deserves applaud for his work. Exquisite train sequences, train interiors scenes have shot with elegance. It must have been one of the challenging shots for cinematographer where they have to be on their toes to shot every frame carefully. It's not that easy for them to shoot train interiors with background scenes running through windows. Of course interior are shot in studio. Every time they had to change placement of camera they have taken care of continuity. At least I didn't find any continuity error. Unlike '12 Angry Men' where Boris Kaufman experimented with camera lenses to shoot small room which gives us claustrophobia, Geoffrey have avoided experiment with wide angle lenses and have concentrated on lighting which enhances the train's rich interiors.Rest of the crew have done their job very well. Must watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Murder on the Orient Express would appear to have all the necessary ingredients for a classic film. It is arguably Agatha Christie's most ingenious and atmospheric novel, and her cosmopolitan dramatis personae aboard the famous train are vividly brought to life by the largely outstanding star-studded cast. Yet it somehow seems to fall strangely flat. Having said that, the induction of the viewer into the mise-en-scene is superb. In an eerie silent sequence, drained of all colour and interspersed with newspaper headlines, we are acquainted with the kidnapping and slaying of little Daisy Armstrong. So when the perpetrator of the kidnapping is himself murdered, even the famous detective Hercule Poirot is inclined to consider it natural justice. But still, murder has been committed and somewhere amongst the strangers - whose destiny is controlled by the train - a killer is at work. But who is it? For they all have alibis, and yet, incredibly all have a motive. Aside from some initial scenes in Istanbul, the action is confined to the train, making this a psychologically interesting and character-driven story. Hence, it is a pity that many of the parts have been reduced to little more than cameo roles. In addition, Albert Finney (whilst visually very much Christie's Poirot) plays the Belgian sleuth with unfortunate crudity. The multi-cultural hustle and bustle of Istanbul Station is portrayed with vibrancy, but so much of the movie is spent in setting the scene and in the lengthy denouement, that important plot components are rather rushed and lacking in impact. Indeed, Poirot seems to deduce the killer's identity almost immediately, and with only a modicum of detection. However, in the end the excellent storyline carries the film to its unexpected and triumphant conclusion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The all star cast enticed me to watch this film. But what a disappointment! There's so little about this movie that gets it right. Some people have complained about the movie devoting too much time to showing this remarkable train. I disagree. Perhaps the film would have greatly benefited by showing the train in more detail, the life on board, the compartments, the activity in this little traveling city. Such shots sprinkled throughout would have made wonders. If only this was the one wrong thing with this film... Albert Finney is no Hercule Poirot. No class, no finesse. Ustinov will later on be far more likable and ring true. Finney's rendition of Poirot is anything but convincing, with his fake accent, not to mention the mistakes he makes when speaking french. Sean Connery is brilliant as always. Michael York also does a decent job while not saying much. The gem of this movie has to be Martin Balsam (Pelham 123). The female cast does a much worse job.We've come to expect better cinematography from Sidney Lumet. And there's little character development so we really couldn't care less about what goes on.All in all, there's a significant lack lack of charm and class throughout. Too bad, this could have been a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All-Star Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie begins in the year 1930 when a young baby is kidnapped and subsequently murdered. Five years later the man responsible for this heinous act boards the famous Orient Express in Istanbul and is murdered as the train makes its way westward. As luck would have it, one of the train's passengers just happens to be a world-renowned detective named "Hercule Poirot" (Albert Finney) who takes the case at the behest of the train's manager, "Bianchi" (Martin Balsam) since the train is stuck in a snowdrift. Now, rather than divulge the identity of the murderer I will just say that there are twelve suspects and they are all played by an all-star cast. Yet while the quality of the cast carries its own appeal it also hindered their performances as each member was limited by time constraints and--other than Albert Finney--none of the stars were really able to shine. At least that is my opinion. Likewise, there were a few parts which were quite long and slow. Even so, this movie will certainly keep most viewers guessing up until the very end and for that reason I rate this film as slightly above average.</fullReview>

Albert Finney, who was working in the London Theater during the making of this movie was transformed over a thirty minute ride in an ambulance. The transformation was amazing since it took me a long time to decifer as to who he was. Albery finney is a great Stage actor and he clearly overshadows the other stage actors and cinema actors even though he had advantage of more screen-time than rest of them who are seen in passing. The mystery keeps you you glued to wherever you may be seated. I suffered claustrophobia by just looking at the small cabins,the narrow corridors-this is tribute to the excellent cinematography. The movie has incredible casting-even though you feel cheated-not seeing enough of the beautiful Jacqueline Bisset. The last few scenes are anti-climatic and takes away the glamor and mystery.</fullReview>

Cut to 5 years later. Detective Hercule Poirot Albert Finney) is traveling to London on the Orient Express. An avalanche stops the train and a passenger (Richard Widmark) is found murdered. Who did it? Poirot has to question the all star cast to find out.This is a very big budget film. The sets and clothes are beautiful and the all star cast is having fun with their roles. Well-directed by Sidney Lumet too. Still this isn't that good. The movie is far too slow for its own good and I was getting bored by the end. The plot is (I thought) needlessly convoluted and Poirot's explanation at the end goes on forever. Also I thought the final revelation of who the killer was was more than a little unlikely.Still it is fun to watch an all star cast play suspects. The acting is pretty good--no one is bad. The standouts in the cast are Lauren Bacall, Albert Finney, Wendy Hiller and Ingrid Bergman (winning an Oscar). This led to "Death on the Nile" (which is much better) and "Evil Under the Sun" (good also but it bombed). So I give it a marginal recommendation for the cast alone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to cast aside all of the movie jargon and mumbo-jumbo such as directing, lighting, score, etc. In my opinion the two most important ingredients by far are the same that one would say of a book: plot and character.I have read all 79 of Agatha Christie's mystery novels. Hercule Poirot has always been my favourite detective and "Orient" is one of my favourite books. I had built up my excitement before watching this film, and so it comes as no surprise that I was very disappointed.The plot, I found very easy to follow. Naturally it was because I was familiar with it, and the solution. But I can understand others who have posted comments when they remark how obscure and far-fetched the whole thing was. But I get rather irate when they then start to criticise Agatha Christie for these faults. The responsibility lies with the DIRECTOR and the DRAMATIST to make things easy to follow: try reading the book and then re-evaluate the film. There is no doubt which one you will prefer.The character acting was touch and go. Out of the seventeen characters, I was satisfied with the portrayals of very few. Ingrid Bergman, John Gielgud and Wendy Hiller stand out particularly in my mind for being extremely close to their parts: Greta, Beddoes and the Princess respectively. There is no doubt that *all* of the cast members performed to their fullest: but their interpretations were somewhat misguided. Lauren Bacall added her own flair to the part, and did very well. But somehow she wasn't old enough, was too refined and a lot nastier than how I had imagined Mrs Hubbard from the book.The award for the absolutely worst portrayal of an Agatha Christie character EVER has to go to Albert Finney. His attempt was laughable. Poirot is infinitely more refined and polite, does not usually shout, and would never in a million years tear a menu up and throw it over his shoulder! As well as these added mannerisms, there were a few characteristics of his that were shamefully left out. Where was the reference to his methodical neatness? Or his pride in appearance (excepting the wonderful scene when he prepares to sleep)? I agree wholeheartedly that the onlooker is meant to chuckle at Poirot in an affectionate way once every so often - but not every FIVE minutes!In closing, I would say that his portrayal ruined the whole film for me. I could have put up with Anthony Perkins's and Sean Connery's typecast portrayals - but Poirot is meant to be the most important element of the film, and not to be constantly laughed at. Besides, he just *looked* wrong. Even grey-haired, overweight Peter Ustinov was better.My final advice: once again, READ THE BOOK! Agatha is unbeaten. Secondly: if you DO decide to watch a screen portrayal of Hercule Poirot, make sure it is DAVID SUCHET. In my mind, he *is* the Belgian detective with the "little grey cells".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing and forgettable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I want to start this by saying that I absolutely love movies set on trains. The closed, claustrophobic setting, the ensemble cast of characters confined to one location, it all has the potential for so much drama. Set it within a cold winter snow drift (my favorite season), and assemble an outrageously good cast featuring the likes of Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave and more, and Murder on the Orient Express had the potential to be some kind of masterpiece. Throw in Sidney Lumet behind the camera and the fact that it's based on an Agatha Christie novel and it sounds too good to be true.Turns out that it was, as the film is an undercooked and instantly forgettable waste of a lot of extraordinary talent. There are so many great actors here and aside from Finney they all get about ten minutes to do the best they can with thin and unmemorable characters. Thin is probably the best word to describe the whole thing, as the mystery is essentially just a long series of red herrings deliberately thrown at the audience so that Finney's Hercule Poirot can look like a genius when he puts it all together at the end, but it's not like any of that really matters if it's impossible to engage in the mystery in the first place.The actors all do their best and some of them, particularly Bacall, are able to leave at least some impression, but they have next to nothing to work with and even the greatest actors need something from the page. I'd put most of my blame for why this was a failure on the shoulders of screenwriter Paul Dehn, who adapted Christie's novel into something cheap and frustratingly pedestrian. I found it all to be a trying experience, with this weird attempt at a slightly comedic tone that never worked, making the comedic take on Poirot stick out like a sore thumb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film opens badly, with an overlong montage of press clippings, and it struggles to find direction after that. Some witty dialogue is offset by a lot more that is wooden and stilted. Since this film depends on information being conveyed to the audience verbally, the succession of strained accents from most of the cast does not help intelligibility. One is grateful for the few straight forward English accents such as from the ever dependable John Geilgud. One is given the impression that the film makers thought that the audience recognising the host of big name actors would distract from what was coming out of their mouths.Worst of all is Albert Finney's thick but unconvincing accent which is difficult to understand throughout but especially during the lengthy reveal scene near the end where he is required to deliver a lot of complex plot details for 5 minutes virtually without interruption. This is probably the only English language film which could do with subtitles!</fullReview>

But despite many attempts over the decades, I find it hard to warm to this film. It has no real charisma and Finney is very good but somehow painful to watch, it's all acting. Ustinov may have been more like Roger Moore's James Bond in his trueness to character, but there was something more appealing about him. He also had a useful sidekick in David Niven, to make him less of a loner and to help with exposition so it's not just Poirot being a windbag explaining everything when no one has actually asked.Another snag is the low number of murders in the film. It means it's just Poirot investigating for the entire length which isn't that dramatic. Often it's good to be wrongfooted by seeing one of the suspects get bumped off half-way through the movie.As for the pay-off, it's imaginative but not convincing at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>+++++++ THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS +++++++ I have always enjoyed Agatha Christie's "who did it?" mystery novels and particularly those in which Belgian detective Hercules Poirot is the one searching for the truth; "Murder in the Orient Express" is a film version of one of them.All of Christie's usual ingredients are in this movie: a mysterious murder, the scope of suspects, the luxurious atmosphere (in the train of the title), the misleading clues, the little details to consider, Poirot's interrogations and so on. The cast is excellent with such big names as Albert Finney (as Poirot), Vanessa Redgrave, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Sir John Gielgud, Martin Balsam, Sean Connery, Michel York, Lauren Bacall, Ingrid Bergman, Richard Widmark and Jacqueline Bisset. But somehow, in my opinion, "Murder in the Orient Express" is not among the best film versions on Miss Christie's work perhaps because the novel is not one of her best.The point is that I hadn't read the book when I saw the film and as the final disclosure came out -with the usual Poirot "show off" explanation- I was sort of disappointed. I remember that my sensation was that if everyone did it, then somehow no one did it; I mean, there was not a murderer among innocent people as usual and either they are all murderers or all innocent people. I don't know; its hard to explain, but the feeling was there. In fact I enjoyed more "Ten Little Indians", "Death on the Nile", "Evil Under the Sun" and even the clearly inferiors "The Mirror Crack'd" and "Appointment with Death".Don't get me wrong; "Murder in the Orient Express" is a very good piece of cinema no doubt; my complaint goes to the final revealing that -though sort of original- lacks tension and real interest. Its a 6 (out of 10) for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love watching movies, if you marvel at things you see and marvel at why, at who you and why film works, you'll like this.It is a phenomenal failure, peppered with pleasures. Oh, what a strange marriage it is to put our trust in a filmmaker!First the pleasures. Despite its failings of Christie in other ways, the Poirot character drawn here is closer to what Christie imagined than any other screen portrayal. I do like watching Suchet's prancing little twinkly man, and I am prepared to see any author's instincts compromised if it serves the larger construction. But the humor in Suchet's Poirot is there purely for the humor, not to support the stance of a detective, our surrogate watcher in the story.Finney's Poirot has little charm. He's obnoxious. That fact that no one else could possibly appreciate the things he loves about himself is a necessary part of the character, the real one in the books. Same with Marple. Its perfect.The movie as a movie is lush, and fun just on that score alone. Lumet's approach to film is to have a general feel about the larger scope of the thing, and then to fill whatever vessel appears in the creation that supports that grander vision. Few things have been as photographed as trains, and never so gloriously as here. The departure of the express from Istanbul (the "European" side) is one of filmdom's richest moments, especially if you include the appearance of our suspects (and their food).And it has one of the most amazing performances you will ever see an actress give. It is short, only few minutes, but won an Oscar. But to appreciate it you need to know something of the actress. You need to know how hard this Swedish woman had to work to sound Swedish; its a hard thing because it involves and actor moving close to her soul and since she grew up in the tradition of being-acting you see from Ingmar, this is a real challenge. Creating a simpleminded character by itself would be less of a challenge.Watch as she surrounds her lines with all sorts of silent conversations with herself, and carefully placed incidental expressions that the character wouldn't know showed her interior dialog. That the actress so carefully places what the character misplaces is magical. Instead of focusing on this, Lumet treats her like any other face on the train, like the stupid Hungarian couple played by stupid actors. Or the accident that was sold as Bacall.And the final pleasure is awarded you only if you know "12 Angry Men." Its one of the most amazing films ever made and precisely perfect for Lumet's strengths and weaknesses. It depends entirely on the story emerging from what the actors give us. Its not the lines that have power, but the space the actors inhabit, a single room. The magic of the film is how the camera circles and probes in ways that the individuals in the group hijack the group leadership and probe the mystery of a stabbing. Who did it?Lumet surely had this film in mind. Here is another jury, another group of 12, another claustrophobic, sequestered setting, another opportunity for camera and inquisition to merge. So sure is the overlap that the one neutral character in the story is Martin Balsam's, he from "12 Angry." So you'll revel a bit as the excellence of that earlier query is echoed in the dining car as Poirot is watched by us as he watches the 12.But while Lumet has great instincts, he is essentially an actor. He sees only the small, and completely misses the larger shape of movies, any movie. He is actually stupid when it comes to this, depressingly, amazingly stupid.Christie's story depends on the arrangement of compartments on that first class car. There's an intricate movement of people that has to be orchestrated in order for anyone to commit the murder. The challenge Poirot faces first is not who did it, but who could have. The way he works through it ? and the reader would too ? is by understanding how his unexpected presence in the car changed a careful plan. In the book, his key insight has to do with the geometry of a door lock. An alibi that was given in the book depended on what the witness saw when a practice session occurred. But Poirot's presence meant that the actual lock in question was on the other side, and therefore a mirror image of what the alibi "explained."This is not a small matter, because the magic of Christie is how the reader and narrator are related in inventing the story. Its a matter of joint discovery and one of the miracles of modern movies and books. Take that away and you don't have Christie. You have instead only a big name to put up with the other big names in a stew that has no coalesced taste.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie of interesting moments of perfection with some ingredients all wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie shows scenes of elaborate aesthetics. This includes usage of light, perspectives, timing and appearance of people. World famous stars are featured such as Ingrid Bergman and Sean Connery. The Agatha Christie novels focus on the illumination of the different characters. Also here, they have not lost their interesting features; unfortunately the movie does not let the audience experience them sufficiently on its own, but it is rather Poirot that explains them for you. The most surprising element of this movie is Albert Finney as Hercule Poirot. Both appearance and acting of Albert Finney would have perfectly fit for Dupond / Dupont in a Tintin et Milou story. The exaggerated acting ? shouting half of the time ? reminds of a comedy and his appearance reminds of a mixture between Mr Beans and Adolf Hitler. Unquestionable this Hercule Poirot is eccentric, but in a hysterical way and neither congenial, nor of dignity. Towards the end, the movie looses its preciseness in timing in an conclusion scene, which takes too long to be surprising and does not highlight the key elements sufficiently. So it is a pity after so excellent opening scenes that some viewer will just be relieved when finally the film is over and the end credits appear.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a newbie to Poirot, I came to the film with no expectations other than an appreciation of what a fine cast was on offer; and to be honest I was looking forward to a journey on the Orient Express.The film started off somewhat confusingly for me and continued likewise throughout.Individually each actor played their part well, however I found the storyline contained huge gaps which meant as a viewer I had to second guess how various conclusions had arisen within the storyline.The pace of the story was slow too, so much so that I continually 'nodded off', much to the horror of my husband, who then had to keep rewinding the recording so that I could keep up.When the end of the film was reached, it was a huge relief to me, albeit a disappointing end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've sat through this many times and each time I view it the only thing I would have done different would have been in the casting of Sir John Gielgud. He simply could never act on film with belief; his reputation was God-like but he couldn't even hold the dagger properly in the stabbing scene, and as for glancing at, obviously, the camera and crew behind it, simply spoilt the scene. He may have been a theatrical legend but as for movies I am never impressed. His only Oscar was awarded out of 'length of service' and surviving for so long. Also, this film isn't a patch on Death on the Nile which, although full of holes in the plot, is a feast for the eyes and if they awarded Ingrid Bergman an Oscar for Orient Express where the heck was Angela Lansbury's for Madame Otterborne? She was quite simply irresistibly over the top.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the all-star cast, nice touches of humor and some genuinely outstanding performances, the solution to this one is too ridiculous to be taken seriously. This could be forgiven in almost any other type of movie, but...a whodunit? With an impossible solution like this one? (Some have said that a sharp viewer can guess the ending. That's only true of a viewer that knows nothing at all about human nature, and about the limits of trust.)This movie might have been fun to watch, had I known not to take it too seriously.

		<fullReview>A murder mystery that is so convoluted and plodding that one doesn't care whodunit. And when the solution finally comes, it is stupid and underwhelming. The expository scenes go on too long, unnecessarily adding to the length of a film that is too long and boring. As Poirot, Finney looks and sounds ridiculous, kind of like Inspector Clouseau; he is horribly hammy and his accent is so thick that it is hard to understand what he's saying. The rest of the all-star cast doesn't fair too well either, partly because there are too many of them and none gets enough screen time to make an impact. Bergman, Connery, Gielgud, and Redgrave come off the best, but that's not saying much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of pomp and prestige, elegant old Hollywood glamor, but no suspense...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sidney Lumet directed this film-version of Agatha Christie's book "Murder on the Calais Coach", and his penchant for letting his actors carry on at length is tempered quite a bit by the setting here (a snowbound train) and by the large collection of characters (posers, as it turns out, all pretending to be something they are not). Albert Finney gives an exhaustingly busy performance as detective Hercule Poirot, piecing together the murder of a disreputable lout on a train after the victim was found stabbed multiple times in the cabin right next to Poirot's. The foreboding preamble to much of the discontent (centering around the kidnapping and subsequent killing of a high society infant) is jagged and eerie, yet the sweeping cast of glamorous stars who collect on the screen soon after do not quite fit into this terse introduction--nor the subsequent flashbacks--which Lumet has so vividly set up (it's rather like "In Cold Blood" as staged by Hitchcock). Poirot's interrogations of the passengers are jaunty and lively, and each of the actors gets a quick opportunity to have a little fun, but Poirot's summation is laid out for us in a didactic fashion which leaves no room for surprise, suspense or intrigue. The sumptuous movie certainly looks handsome, and Finney does have some fine moments, but the picture itself is rather staid and dry. Best of the supporting performances would be Rachel Roberts' somewhat lascivious turn as a cook, Wendy Hiller as an imposing dowager, Lauren Bacall as an actress, and Anthony Perkins as another of his Nervous Nellies. Ingrid Bergman won an Academy Award for her slyly humorous bit as a jittery missionary, but Michael York, Jacqueline Bisset, Vanessa Redgrave and Sean Connery are unable to bring much to the table. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boredom and hammy acting on the Orient Express</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am the only one to have spotted that suspense was sadly lacking from this suspense thriller? Who stole ze suspense? Who would have had le motif to do so? Who, monsieur? OK, it's got an all-star (and I mean all-star) cast going for it, it's directed by Lumet, it's based on the most famous book by the most famous crime writer of all times ... and at this point, I usually ask myself: What could possibly go wrong? And usually I am forced to concede: A lot.On a transnational train, a man we neither know much about, nor could bring ourselves to care for even if we did, is murdered. The suspects are all the other first-class passengers, whom we also know little about, and consequently care even less. In fact, there are so many of them with such diverse stories, it's hard to keep up. The detective, who's one of those people whom you immediately suspect of being a pervert, finds out lots of minute details which make absolutely no sense to us whatsoever. When he finally comes up with the big solution, it's so outrageous as to make the Jewish World Conspiracy (between Jewish communists in Russia and their Wall Street brethren on the other side of the Atlantic) seem absolutely plausible.And to make things worse, the acting is often totally hammy. Interesting -- it's fun to see Ingrid Bergman play a mousy missionary -- often even good, but still hammier than the hind legs of a pig.Overall, an OK but lacklustre movie that doesn't do what it promised on the tin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finney is no Poirot and too many stars spoil the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After one has seen David Suchet in the role of Belgian (and not French, as others have written) sleuth Hercule Poirot, no one else will do. The production was elegant, the cast impressive (actually too much so) and the whole movie... a huge disappointment. I think the main problem (other than the fact that Finney is no Poirot) is that I don't want to see people like Bergman, Gilegud, Redgrave, etc. in small roles; I want to see more of them. It's like soccer: take the best players in the world, put them into the same team, and he result is often mediocre because soccer is a team effort. So, apparently, is making a motion picture. I felt cheated not to have more screen time by such greats as the ones mentioned above. Add to this that this is far from being one of Christie's better efforts (and I have read all her fiction), and you get an eminently forgettable movie. Pity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>who killed plausibility?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A confession: I've never read any of Agatha Christie's books. But I have read the detective stories of GK Chesterton, which provide me with a benchmark to judge all other detective tales. Aside form their luminescent language, Chesterton's books have much to commend them. Among their merits is that the real solution is always much simpler than the obvious solution. Characters (and the deceived reader likewise) make false assumptions without even realising that this is what they are doing; taking these assumptions for fact, they build preposterous explanations to explain the crime. It takes Father Brown, Chesterton's hero, to solve the mysteries. Brown's chain of thought is always clear: if something seems implausible or impossible, then it didn't happen; and if such an unlikely detail is seemingly necessary to explain the crime, then the logic determining that necessity is false. The end is satisfying because the truth makes sense, even though we couldn't see it before. From my experience of Agatha Christie adaptations, her tales work in a very different way. A detective (in this film the Belgian Poirot) uncovers a series of clues that don't point clearly to anything at all; but he solves the crime by synthesizing a majestically unlikely conspiracy that happens to account for each and every detail. At the end of this film Poirot makes the point that the explanation he has produced is so contrived that the police are unlikely to believe it. So why should the audience be taken in?Other complaints: the characters are cliched and the performances hammy, some enjoyably (Geilgud, Connery) and other's less so (Albert Finney's explosive Poirot, choking and spluttering with random aplomb). Of course one takes pleasure in watching the set up, seeing the evidence slot into place; but had the poor victim been killed by a vampire, the story could hardly be less true to life.It's a pleasant way to waste a couple of hours, but Christie should have remembered the principle of Occam's razor: it is vain to do with many what could be done with fewer. Having not done so, all we have here is a load of fun tosh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Read the book instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's horrible how many times that after a movie I sit thinking, "The book was so much better." I know that a four hour long movie would not be reasonable, but that is what it takes to properly adapt a book into a movie! I am a HUGE Agatha Christie fan, and "Murder on the Orient Express" was one of the first books I ever read by her. It has been a few years since then, so I've forgotten most of the characters, but the plot was so unique that of course it has stood out in my mind. While watching the movie, I was appalled at how little screen time the suspects got! How could anyone (who had not read the book) have formed any guesses as to who the killer was before it was revealed? You call that a mystery movie? If you can't form educated guesses, then who cares who the murderer is! Anyway, apart from not enough screen time for the suspects and not enough time for the movie in general, I did not enjoy this at all. Where were the clues? I sure didn't see any that would have lead me to believe that a certain person was guilty. And Agatha's famous red herrings were not in the least bit conclusive or suggestive!! Apart from that, Albert Finney did not resemble the Poirot I picture while reading Christie's novels. The Poirot I picture is plump, with, of course, the twirling mustache (it wasn't twirly enough in the movie), and a rounder, egg shaped head (as is always described to the reader). Apart from physical differences, "my" Poirot is kind, not at all modest, does not yell, and has a certain way of questioning his suspects so that it is more conversation than questioning. The Poirot in the movie was way too snappy with his questions, and he yelled!! He yelled!! The calm, cool, collected Poirot, does not yell! Poirot is what makes his novels interesting, and yet it was mostly Poirot who ruined this movie for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the glowing reviews on the first page, I was relieved when I went to the last page and saw some reflection of reality. This movie starts out bad and stays at that level. As someone stated earlier, the scene where the train leaves the station goes on forever, and for no good reason - this is a detective story folks, not a travelogue. On top of that, they do away with actual train sounds and use violins playing a brisk waltz. C'mon, cut the elevator music - it's a steam locomotive. I'm somehow supposed to be impressed with the cast, but I could do without Lauran Bacall playing Lauren Bacall. Using "movie stars" in a story like this just pulls me out of plot and character and destroys any possible "suspension of disbelief." On top of everything else, there was nothing about Albert Finney that held my attention. Compared to Suchet, Finney could have been a guy pulled out of the "extras" line at the canteen.I got this at the library because I wanted to like it. I ended up turning it off after Poirot met Widmark's character. I had nothing else to do, but there was no sense watching something I just didn't enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If your a fan of the Hercule Poirot series on A&amp;E staring David Suchet, you'll be very disappointed in this over-the-top version of Poirot. Perhaps I'm tainted by the exacting, soft-spoken, intellectual presentation of Suchet, but I can't help but think that Finney's performance was annoying to say the least. Overall, the acting is quite poor, and comes of more like a small-town theater performance than a Hollywood production movie. Lauren Bacall, for example, is dreadful. Additionally, the humor and dialog is poor and often awkward, respectively.Read the book. dkar</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie very painful to watch, and had to do so in small increments. Good thing it wasn't in the theatre, or I would've had to leave. Well, may be that wouldn't have been so bad.Albert Finney turns in one of the most execrable screen performances that it's ever been my misfortune to see. His accent is ludicrous and every second he's onscreen speaking seems like an hour.I haven't read the book, so it may not be the movie's fault, but the "clues" are so pathetically tenuous as to make the whole case hang by a thread. The discovery of the victim's real identity is based on such circumstancial evidence that it's laughable they even take it seriously.It also has the distinction of arguably the worst cop-out ending ever, so expect to be dissatisfied. Of course, given the whole movie up to that point, you probably won't have high expectations anyway.</fullReview>
