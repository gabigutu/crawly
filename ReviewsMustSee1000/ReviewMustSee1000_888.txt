		<shortDescription>Brilliant mixture of social criticism and fantasy rebellion. One of the most powerful movies of the 1960s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'If...' is a fascinating and powerful film set in an oppressive and archaic public (that's private to us non-Brits) school. It is one of the most original and innovative of all British movies of the 60s, a decade which began in some ways with 'Peeping Tom' and ended with 'Performance', two much maligned movies which in hindsight are astonishing achievements. 'If..' is equally as striking (and disturbing) as those two criminally underrated movies, but in contrast actually achieved quite a level of popularity on its original release. Even so I don't believe the movie gets the attention it deserves. Hopefully it will be rediscovered by a new generation of movie lovers as it is still very relevant and powerful even now, thirty five years later. Malcolm McDowell (his film debut) stars as the ring-leader of a small group of dissatisfied students who don't fit in with their ultra-conformist contemporaries. His performance is first rate, and in several scenes you can almost see Alex, his droog to be ('A Clockwork Orange'). The movie mixes documentary like realism with fantasy sequences involving "The Girl" (Christine Noonan), and eventually violent rebellion. A movie very much of its time it still is very watchable today and has lost little of its power and ability to surprise. Lindsay Anderson, arguably Britain's most underrated director, continued to expand upon McDowell's Mick Travis character in two subsequent movies, but 'If..' has a very different feel from those "sequels", if they can truly be termed that, and can be watched as a stand alone movie. I was impressed with this movie when I first saw it on black and white TV as a young lad, and I was still impressed when I watched it again the other week. And I will guarantee it will not be my last viewing of this brilliant film! A must see for anyone with any interest whatsoever in 1960s pop culture or film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rejection and acceptance: Mick and Jute.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie, for the umpteenth time, when it was shown on T.V. last night and was happy to see that it hasn't lost any of it's impact or relevance. Like so many other British films of the same time "if...." is a classic. The storyline, direction, location and acting are all stunning and as an allegory the film has as much to say today as it did when it was first released, onto an unsuspecting public, in the late 1960's. Much has been said by other reviewers about Lindsay Anderson, Malcolm McDowell and the film as a social satire, so there seems little point in going along those, well trodden, paths. I guess one aspect of the film, which always struck me as pivotal, but which hasn't been mentioned, is the inverse negative correlation between the story of Mick (Malcolm McDowell) and that of Jute (Sean Bury). While Mick starts out as a mild non-conformist who becomes increasingly disaffected with society, as represented by the school, Jute, who is initially an outsider, a new boy who doesn't know the rules, is gradually accepted and becomes an active member of that very same society. Mick's initial revolt is that of returning to school still sporting a moustache. But although he is flouting the rules by virtue of not being clean shaven, it is done on a purely personal level and he takes great pains to hide his facial hair from those in authority. Later his actions become, by stages, increasingly confrontational and open. Jute on the other hand is first shown as a small, almost lost, boy with large, frightened, puppy-dog eyes who doesn't even know that prefects are not addressed as "Sir", let alone the myriad of other complex rules that make up the society into which he has been thrust. Gradually we see his self assurance blossoming as he is accepted firstly by the other "scum" and later by the powers that be. The small socially isolated boy of the first scene is later seen playing an active role in a rugby match, sharing an impromptu meal with the other scum, confidently carrying a trophy in College Hall and finally taking an active part (as an altar boy) in the very celebration of traditional values that Mick has, by then, utterly rejected. A thought provoking film, which like that other celebrated allegory from the same era, "Lord of the Flies" (1963), has many levels and can be as deep as you wish it to be. Utterly Brilliant. Oh yeah and my favourite quote was from Mick when asked why he was sporting a moustache, his answer, "To hide my sins".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To get the most out of this film you have to be English, male and a teenager; in 1979 when I first saw it I was all three. In the years that followed I would catch it wherever I could, be it on television, in the college bar or in some local, flea-ridden rep cinema. Now, of course, I own the video. Every few months I dig it out and watch it, and more than any other film or book it reminds me what it was like to be young and rebellious and have my whole life ahead of me.This was to England what The Wild One or Rebel Without A Cause was to America. Show it to your teenage sons; they'll remember it for the rest of their lives, and one day they might even thank you for it.To dispel an old myth, while I'm here. Some scenes in the film are in black and white while most of the film is in color. The reason for this has nothing to do with art; they were short of money, and black and white was cheaper in those days.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My word!"If.." has always been a firm favourite of mine, particularly as I have been in much the same situation (minus B+W/Colour changes, and gun battles, naturally), and indeed still consider myself a hair rebel. It captures perfectly the horrors of public shool-The fawning, smarmy head-master, the rigors of cadet training and founder's day, it's all drawn from horrible reality.Saw a late night showing yesterday, and on the cinema screen the fabulous direction and power of the photography- so still and unobtrusive, yet so iconic-becomes apparent. That final looped shot of Mick firing the brenn Gun is just stunning! I left the cinema feeling so goddamn moved!At times the sheer 60s-ness, and random dialogue ("I like Johnny") can seem to undermine the viewing experience, but the spirit of bold rebellion which saturates this marvelous film wins you over. A favourite joke which I had never spotted before, is near the start, where the whips tick off a list that goes something like "Measles, tape worm, conformation class"..marvellous..GO SEE!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If... not so far fetched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched "If?" about thirty years ago on a black and white TV. I'm not sure whether the sensors had been active or my memory has faded. Probably the first option although the second option is also valid as many movies can and have been watched in the space of thirty years. The film struck me at first as having a strong resemblance to the school that I attended ie. A Certain College which was an ultra conservative military type school run in the old English style where there was no room for individuality. Having attended there in the same time-frame as "If?", both Malcolm's and my headmaster's comments and policies were of a not so convincing attempt to be cool and trendy. The hair cut rules, uniform rules, and the underlying fear of homosexuality were all present. The pecking order where the seniors or "whips" could have a free run with any lad who they fancied or abhorred by piling pleasures or punishments on them was something I also lived through. If fact the film "If.." was not all that far fetched. Upon seeing the film after a thirty year lapse and then being asked to write a report for my daughter who is at the age that I was when I left the establishment I mentioned was certainly a treat. After seeing the film again, I believe the sensors did have a field day in 1975 as they did in many films of that era. Most of the gun-play in the final scenes was cut out as were Malcolm's dalliances with the young lady. Some of the scenes depicting homosexual innuendo were also missing although, as I mentioned earlier, my memory could have something to do with that. The switching from colour to black and white was something that went unnoticed the first time I saw the movie. Upon discussion with my daughter I was relieved to find it was a financial shortage rather than some sort of intense flashback that I missed or didn't understand. I was thrilled at the opportunity to see the movie again. It was everything I remember it as being and more. The cast was great and the plot was realistic until the end when all hell broke loose. I'm sure I will enjoy it again next time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when i was 15 and it shook up my world. I was aware of Malcolm McDowell having previously seen him as Alex delarge in Clockwork Orange. This film is a perfect surreal study of teenage rebellion and should be seen by everyone who is able. The direction is brilliant the supporting cast shine (Arthur Lowe etc)and the film as a whole is made up of memorable images that you'll take to the grave. Lindsay Anderson is one of the most important director geniuses of an era and i was very sad to hear of his demise. The memory of him lives on through this film and its two "Mick Travis" sequels!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson's 1968 film If... is a beautiful film with a simple message, yet the director's touch and the performances take it to entirely different level. If... takes place in all boys boarding school and stars Malcolm McDowell as"Mick" (McDowell in his first screen role). Mick and his two friends feelsomewhat distant from their peers, school, and society. Their general attitude towards such things as sex, war, and authority could be call revolutionary. With surrealistic touches such as unexplained occurrences and changing betweencolor and black and white. Lindsay Anderson paints a vivid picture of "teenage alienation" before there was a term for such a thing. McDowell would later reprise his role of "Mick" in two other Anderson pictures O' Lucky Man and Britannia Hospital. A must see for fans of McDowell. Just a great film with a message that sparks positive, pro-active thinking. An important film that makes you remember to question authority instead complying to it rules. Sadly If... is not available on DVD at this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absurdities of public school life run rife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw 'If...' in April 2001, when shown by RTE (Irish television). Set in a fairly typical British public school during the 'Swinging Sixties', the repressive atmosphere of the school creates tension and resentment, particularly among the seniors. Three of the seniors, Michael Travis (played by Malcolm McDowell) and his two study room-mates begin to defy the authority of the 'whips', an elitist group of four sixth-formers headed by Rowntree (Robert Swann), the head of college house. Power-games and petty bullying by the whips is the order of the day, meanwhile Travis and his friends leave college buildings and go into town without permission from the whips, and they get drunk in the study. Eventually, their rebellious behaviour is no longer tolerated and they are brutally caned by Rowntree - Travis' roommates get four strokes each, but Travis, saved until last by the sadistic Rowntree, gets ten. The entire school has been sent either to the 'Sweat-Room' (juniors) or their studies (seniors) so that they can hear the noise of the canings, in the expectation that any displays of rebellious activity,on the part of any other students,will be similarly dealt with.The canings prompt Travis to declare war on society, and the three initially disrupt Founder's Day ceremonies with smoke bombs in the assembly hall. The congregation rush outside to be met with mortar bombs and automatic gunfire from the rooftops around the quadrangle. It is to be pointed out that these scenes are fantasy, a product of Travis' fertile imagination. Filmed on location, partly at Cheltenham College, Gloucestershire, England - where the director of 'If...', Linsday Anderson, was himself a student- the authentic setting instils a very real feeling of a repressive public school in the viewer's mind, as does the dialogue and portrayal of the hierarchical structure of British society, represented by the school.While 'If...' was a significant product of its time, it still nonetheless has the power to shock the viewer, particularly if they are survivors of the public school system. While violent and amusing at the same time, both of these aspects being very well balanced, it is a very enjoyable movie. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first entry to the Mick Travis trilogy ("If...", 1968, O Lucky Man, 1973, and "Britannia Hospital", 1982), "If.." is a surreal black comedy about an English private boys' school and a student rebellion. In his three films, Anderson had covered all aspects, politics, and institutions of British Society from 1968 to 1982 with its complex system of class differences and privileges. "If..." which was released in 1968 at the peak of youthful rebellion in Europe and USA, received BAFTA and Golden Globe nominations and won the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival where it competed with 27 films from all over the world.Anderson was in part inspired by Jean Vigo's 41 minutes long "Zero for conduct" (1933) about the similar to "If..." subject. Like in Vigo's film, Anderson inserts some surrealistic episodes shot in black-and-white and according to him, it was driven by budget rather than style. Malcolm McDowell in his first big screen role and the first of three Mick Travis' movies is a charismatic leader of the rebel students who call themselves the Crusaders and like to break the rules. The cruel corporal punishments from the faculty and the older students provoked a bloody uprising against the school system.Made almost 40 years ago, "If.." still has a power to shock as well as to entertain and it remains an outstanding and controversial depiction of the problems that have not disappear from the English public school system or from any school system as well as from society in general.I am sure that Stanley Kubrick saw "If..." and was impressed by McDowell's debut performance, by his charisma that shines through his close-ups and especially in the final shot of "If...", and by his face that strangely combines innocence and youthful openness with cynical scornful almost reptilian contempt for humanity. I believe that "If..." was the reason Kubrick offered the part of charming psychopath Alex to the young actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and Surreal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched this film for the first time and I thought it was excellent. The plot of If... was it was set in a English Public School where senior students ruled and the younger students had endure a harsh regime. The teachers were not much better giving out harsh punishments including cold showers and caning. Malcolm McDowell plays Mick Travis who along with his friends refuse to conform to the system. The films shows how they resist and how the teachers and follow students are unable to deal with them. The films ends with Travis and his friends taking violence action against the school.The film was influenced the counter-culture movement of the 60s. It also would have been influenced by youth movements such as the Mods and Rockers. Politically the film was also Left-Wing, showing photos of Marxist leaders such as Mao, Lenin and Che Guenna and Travis practising shooting on photos of the Queen and Politicians. Travis and his friends are shown to be intellectual, reading and coming up with statements such as 'Revolution is the only pure act.' If... also coinsided with the Paris riots and has been mistaken for being influenced by the events.The film also combines a grim and stark view of the Public School system which was a target of the film, and shows things that possibly really did happen, but it also has surreal dream sequences. I feel the two together worked very well. If... also reminded me of A Clockwork Orange, which also started Malcolm McDowell. This was because of the idea of show a dystopia society (on a smaller scale) and the idea of youth running wild and uncontrolled. I would say if you liked A Clockwork Orange then you would like If...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grab a gun and shoot the establishment - If....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When If.. was re-released at the end of the 1990s, it came with the slogan: 'An Anarchist's Punk Dream!' This certainly summarises the film's main ethos, in which revolution and the dream of blowing up the old school master is a dream of every anti-social English school boy. MacDowel is superb in this film, and he apparently landed the gig for A Clockwork Orange through Kubrick watching this film several times. The direction is also brilliant by Lyndsey Anderson, who unfortunately never amounted to much after this. If you're interested in the changing attitudes of English society during the 1960's then watch if..., as there's no better illustration. One of the all time British classics, with a bizarre sequel called 'Oh Lucky Man'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With All Thy Getting, Get Under Cover</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson's "if...." presents a fable disguised (most of the time) as a slice-of-life set in a British upper-class boarding school. Bouyed by the twin-barreled audacity of Anderson and the film's breakout star, Malcolm McDowell, "if...." fiercely, timelessly encapsulates the spirit of 1960s rebellion even as it threatens to go off the rails every five minutes in the second half.McDowell is Mick Travis, a returning upperclassman at College House, one of several houses that constitute a British boarding school. While other older boys, called "whips", enforce a nasty form of discipline on their juniors, called "scum", Mick and two friends contemplate an act of revolution to disturb College House's rigid hierarchy once and for all."Violence and revolution are the only pure acts," Mick declares.In case one doubts his cold-blooded dedication and impatience for change, his next line sends Columbine chills up your spine. Told someone dies of starvation in Calcutta every eight minutes, his reply is a succinct: "Eight minutes is a long time."There are points where one can't help feeling the script needed another round of polishing, like the way it introduces characters like the teacher Mr. Thomas and the "scum" Biles and Jute only to drop them in the second half as Mick's story takes over completely. But Mick's hardcore attitude of radical chic and the surreal nonsense that spurts out now and then before taking over entirely actually give "if...." much of its rich, iconoclastic majesty. With its attention to institutional detail, the sound of boyish babble echoing off the linoleum, you really feel yourself another inmate in College House, and are eager for Mick to effect your escape as well as his.For me, that's why the first half works so much better than the second half. It sends up the public-school culture in such a way that its actual demolition later on seems unnecessary. Robert Swann sets the right tone as the head whip Rowntree, a toffee-nosed princeling who carries his thrashing cane like a kingly scepter and tells one young scum: "Markland, warm a lavatory seat for me. I'll be ready in three minutes." Swann's as brilliant a villain as McDowell himself would be in many later films.Watching McDowell here is to see his Alex from "Clockwork Orange" in embryonic form, his simpering smile, his animalistic fury, his waggish ease-putting charm. A case can be made that Mick is a more disturbing character than Alex, since he is presented so much more sympathetically and acts out even more violently by the film's end.Ah, the end, what can be said about that that hasn't been said. I won't spoil anything, but I do think the film's surrealism needs to be factored in more than it has in considering the moral implications of Mick &amp; Co's final act. Logic seems to flee from the corners of the screen long before. One long sequence features Mick and friend Johnny stealing a motorbike without consequence and Mick coupling on the floor of a coffee house with a town girl, who later waves to him when he spots her with a high-powered telescope. If you can't see the madness in moments like that, then maybe you deserve to think the end of the film was played straight.I'm not much for the ending of the film. "Do you find it facile?" asks the History Master played by the marvelous Graham Crowden, and my answer would be yes. As I said, I think it's a flawed finish, not just for its unpleasant resonances but the way nothing is resolved, no narrative or character arc.But "if...." is still bracing, still tough, and still refreshing in the way it presents McDowell in raw, undistilled form, in a setting fully deserving of his visible scorn. Anderson makes you want to lash out, too, making the most of "if...."'s enigmatic tagline: "Which side will you be on?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some sort of great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie about how three rebellious teens in a British boarding school react to a hidebound society is difficult to analyze. The theme of revolt of the free-spirited against a repressive society is there, but what is real or imagined, what is fantasy or fact is not clear. In the final analysis I came just to accept this as a work of art whose qualities I came to appreciate.There are many memorable scenes, some of exquisite beauty, some of harsh cruelty. The scene with the riders on the motorcycle is one of the purest representations of freedom ever recorded on film. But, don't break it down or it loses its effect. The motorcycle was stolen, someone stood to lose money on the deal, the pristine grass they were on was being torn up, the machine was polluting, standing on a motorcycle is dangerous, and so forth. So, just ignore all of that and appreciate the artistry of it - this goes for the movie in general.No matter what you think of the film, it would be difficult not to be captivated by Malcom McDowell's magnetic performance. He had quite a run there, what with this film, "O Lucky Man!," and "A Clockwork Orange," in a period of five years. And who will be able to forget the scene in the Packhorse Cafe between McDowell and Christine Noonan - it has to be one of the greatest sex scenes ever filmed. And in black and white no less.I think it is misguided to compare the revolt of these three students with the school shootings in recent years. The school shootings have been committed either by highly unstable individuals or by those desiring revenge for personal slights. Here I see the motivations as a revolt against a repressive society - the educational system, religion, the military, you name it - and not against individuals per se.The filming is quite accomplished and the music compelling, particularly the excerpt from the Missa Luba.The effect the final scenes had on me completely typifies my reactions to the movie in general. On the one hand I was horrified, but on the other I was laughing. I found the scene with the priest and the knight in armor running for cover disturbing on a personal level, but gleefully humorous on the level of the idea of upending dogmatic religion and centuries old traditions. And how realistic are those final scenes? The headmaster gets shot in the head, but in the very next scene there is no evidence of his being where he was standing. I imagine the final scenes had an appeal to the "don't trust anyone over thirty" generation at the time.The fact that you can take this for real, for absurdest comedy, for satire, or in many other ways, speaks highly of it.You are disposed to answer the questions, "What is freedom and how much does it mean to you?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest of all British films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best film ever made about school life; the rituals, the drudgery, the humiliation and ultimately the excitement. Anderson's masterpiece works on a number of levels, not least as one of the cinema's great pieces of surrealism. It's a state of the nation movie, a fantasy, an account of public school life told with an almost documentary-like precision and it's as fresh today as it was when it first appeared, (hard to believe that was almost 40 years ago or that Malcom McDowell was ever this young).Using Jean Vigo's "Zero De Conduite" as a template, (it's not a remake), Anderson's movie is quintessentially youthful and so accurately does it depict its milieu as to appear almost arrogant. He handles revolution with a grandstanding authority and homosexual, (and heterosexual), schoolboy yearning more romantically than any other film I can think of, (Wallace's display in the gymnasium as blonde, beautiful, tousle-haired Bobby Phillips looks on is blissfully homo-erotic), and he does this with a masterly control of the medium. (His comments about financial restraints dictating the fluctuations between black-and-white and colour photography may well be true but the choices seem inspired, nevertheless and the great Miroslav Ondricek's camera-work is superb).He was also a great actor's director, often working with many of the same actors both in theatre and in cinema and he extracts marvellous performances from the likes of Arthur Lowe, Peter Jeffrey, Mona Washborne and Geoffrey Chater representing the Establishment as well as pitch-perfect performances from David Wood, Richard Warwick, Rupert Webster, Robert Swann and Hugh Thomas, all new to cinema, as the students.The film made Malcom McDowell a star and for a few short years, (here, in "O Lucky Man", as Alex in "A Clockwork Orange"), that star burned brightly before he sold out to Hollywood and his career began to flounder in a series of mediocre American movies, reaching a nadir with "Caligula". But his performance as Mick Travis is a marvel and both it and the film that first encapsulated it remain among the finest achievements in British cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made in 1968, this film still made me shiver even though I started at public school in 1977. Things had changed somewhat by then, but not beyond recognition, and for sure I felt powerful echoes in this movie. By the time I left, the country was steeped in Thatcherism, and the style of self advancement that came with it was replacing the old guard watchers of 'If....' would recognise. The housemaster and headboy were 2 characters I can especially recall, but there are flashes of others in many of the characters.When you see this film, see it as a historical satire, with first the historical atmosphere of a public school being accurately recreated, then second the satire taking form just in time to administer the purgative judgement of the surreal denouement.There.

The changing from monochrome to full colour may have been due to budget constraints, but it is a stunning device, it really keeps you off guard and on your toes and Anderson's direction is some of the best you'll see from this period of British film making.

		<shortDescription>What "If"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other movie staring Malcolm McDowell as an angry young man hyperviolent anti-authoritarian figure, Lindsay Anderson's "If..." is just that, a question into the possibility of a figure, so in love with the idea of the romantic mix between Eros and Thanatos, combined with a certain amount of repressive environment characterized by a very classic English private school, may not just snap and...Of course school shootings have a little different meaning today, but a marked difference between what this film is expressing and what school shootings have come to express is the very act of expression itself: McDowell is quixotic, an hopeless romantic that poises himself and acts out his rebellion into the very physicality of his being. The real-life school shooters are mostly repressed quiet kids unable to handle stress. How "If..." differs is expressed in its title and the sequence where the scientific boy shows McDowell the stars: what alternate universe is this film, what sequence of events could occur, that eventually a boy could lead a fully loaded arsenal into direct combat against a similarly aggressively armed school faculty? What sort of religious, moral, and ethical grounds creates these institutions, and will they ultimately lead to their own destruction? It is important to notice that the movie is surreal, and pointedly so. The end scene could be argued away as a fantasy, but for moments such as the bishop sitting up out of the drawer, the sudden black-and-white, the full acceptance of McDowell's character's dreams by other angry young men. Is it so hard to accept that a cache of weapons could have been forgotten in a school attic when that very school contains weapons and trains its children in soldiering itself? The Institution in this film is its own destroyer, so that the warning extends just beyond the idea of a single kid breaking (McDowell doesn't break down, he actualizes) to simply assuming that this may be what the purpose of the school is for, in the end, anyway.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And it's not Travis! I've always hated the type of public school rebel portrayed by Travis. The finest rebels are those who stick with but subvert the system they despise. George Orwell (Eton) was such a person, who made fun of those who claimed to have been scarred by public school, or 'four years in a tepid bath of snobbery' as he called it. I admire far more the character of Mike (?) who finds release in his astronomy.Having said that, I did find the film an excellent satire on the type of person who loves rules and regulations for their own sake - these people exist in every walk of life. But attempting to defeat these people by hysterical overreaction such as that of Travis merely results in them clamping down further.I also realised how much Monty Python's Meaning of Life draws on the film - during the chapel scenes I could have sworn Arthur Lowe was going to stand up and intone 'Oooooh God you are so big!'What we don't see from the likes of Lindsay Anderson is a similar satire on state schools, with their equally vicious and degrading practices. The nearest I've come to seeing this is the excellent 'Kes'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than a warning, a prophecy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strange film from 1968. A film on education in Great Britain. The education of the middle class or what could be called the bourgeoisie, second social stratum after the aristocracy. Education in a boarding school, with prefects, whips, and everything like corporal punishments and mean nasty segregational attitudes towards those who have too much personality or do not accept to be wimps marching along to the dictatorial rule of the prefects, whips and other real or false headmasters. It is all wrong from the very start. It represses originality, initiative and creativity and develops the desire to be on top one day to become the torturer who will be able to impose on smaller ones what they have been imposed by bigger ones when they were small. Democratic slavery. You have to submit to the system totally in order to become the slave master later on and compensate your frustration when you were a slave on the slaves under your control. This is no education, this is taming. This is not teaching morality but teaching savage displaced vengeance. Of course the film is showing exactly what may happen when you victimize the more brilliant, the more original because they are more brilliant and original than you are (two meanings intended). It is the survival of the old feudal education system that was making all children who were to be in the superior class later on be pages or chambermaids, as soon as they had crossed the first year or so of puberty, in the hands of aristocrats. They just had to do what they were told to do, including personal service to their masters and mistresses, or they had to suffer punishment that could be of the most violent type. To educate the future leaders of our society by making them go through the false and fake choice of submission or rebellion, being used in the most debilitating ways or being punished with the most vicious means, being humiliated or being violently broken. It cultivates rebellion without a cause in these young people, and we say it is without a cause without any clue at all about what it is really, because to be humiliated, victimized, brutalized, and even violated is the best cause to be rebellious, though it is not rebellious they should be but plainly advocates of the violent change of this society. It is that survival of feudal customs and methods that produced the revolutionary movements of the 19th and 20th centuries, whose leadership had been too often forced to go through this process of humiliating the future master out of the humiliation itself. The end of the film then is purely phantasmagoric but it is exactly what this society deserves: good old strong deadly bullets right in the center of the forehead. This film is the British pioneering version of the American "Zabriskie Point", just a few years later. We are coming back from deep deep under in the dark realm of Hades and we are far from the clear and trans-lucid target of total transparency and honesty. This film, in its way is just as powerful and brain raking as "Clockwork Orange" or "The Dead Poets Society".Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine &amp; University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hasn't aged well - revolution or fake revolution?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(It's hard to "spoil" a movie whose denouement is the main thing everyone knows about the movie, but marking this as "spoiling" allows me to mention whatever I please.)I missed this film when it first came out, so I am now seeing it on DVD after nearly 50 years. Possibly it seemed totally daring to the critics of the time, a harbinger of youth revolution. Today, to me, it seems dated, narrow, and sad. Time hasn't served it well, and I don't refer only to the fact that we have now seen a lot of actual mass school shootings and are less likely to get excited about them. Nor to the fact that repression of the children of the elites and wannabes in UK "public schools" is not so much a contemporary issue.Possibly the world of 1968 was not so quick as we are now to notice that, hey, every named character in this film is an obnoxious misogynistic white male twit! I can testify personally that there was a period of a few years when misogynistic white male twits could get a lot of attention leading protests on US campuses. Actually one could take this film as a warning that people like Travis and his followers are to be shunned by persons serious about change, but if that was its message it gets lost.Particularly in the second half a lot of apparently surrealistic elements start to appear. When a clergyman who also leads military training was produced from a large drawer, this set me wondering about other events and images. Did an instructor's wife actually wander naked through the halls? Did Travis actually steal a motorcycle at all, or throw a crocodile on a bonfire? Or are these Travis's fantasies? And if so, is the whole concluding scene of violence maybe really just another fantasy, something that might happen "If...." ? (This would explain how the nameless "The Girl" ends up on the scene. I'm not confident that she even exists.) No doubt all these questions are answered in commentary or interviews somewhere, and if I were a professional I would look them up, but I'm only an amateur reporting on my impressions.But it doesn't terribly matter whether these are Travis's fantasies or the filmmakers' fantasies. The question is how revelatory or instructive or inspiring or artistically attractive they are. And frankly after it all I'm not terribly impressed.I would be more impressed if the 13-year-old enslaved "scum" had picked up arms to defend themselves against their manifest oppression, torture, and degradation, but that isn't the story. Instead, you have Travis. We learn nothing of his family or backstory. He is contemptuous of the whips and faculty, who deserve contempt, but what has he to offer himself other than some tired snippets of laziness passing for anarchism, about how "war and violence are the only creative acts" and "one man with a gun can change history", and a blood pact with his mates which is about what you would expect of Tom Sawyer playing Red Indians. Why does he stay in the damned school at all? If he left and tried to deal with the issues of his actual life that would also be more impressive. But he strikes me as someone with a sense of ruling- class entitlement just as monumental as that of any of the oppressors, who feels that he should be allowed to just wallow in inaction and play on someone else's dime, and, when he gets whacked on the bum a few times (not exactly the worst thing to happen to anyone in the year of the My Lai massacre), wants to just kill everyone in sight for it.So, to be fair, maybe the makers are entirely aware that Travis's "Crusaders" are as horrible examples as the powers and principalities of the school. Maybe they know that the dilettantish so-called resistance grounded in pique of these children of the ruling class is as much a target for "satire" as the institutions of privilege. Maybe. But they don't make it clear to me that they do. The Monty Python troupe satirized this whole ground a lot better, and apart from satire, what's left here?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For years I've heard how great this film is and I have always wanted to see it. I finally got the chance last night and I have to say it was not worth the wait. The utter pretentiousness of the whole thing drove me crazy, flipping from black &amp; white to color between scenes, the sudden appearance of unexplained characters. The parson in a drawer in the headmasters office. The total absurdity of the ending. Not to mention the fact that it moves at a snails pace. There's like a three minute scene of Malcolm McDowall just shooting darts out of a gun. The first half of the film, while dull, just shows the day to day life of the boys in a British boarding school in a realistic, matter of fact fashion. The second half is this absurd fantasy of violence begetting more senseless violence. The change in tone is jarring. If...we don't change our disciplinary structures this could happen. It fails as allegory and as entertainment. I give it 2 stars for the sterling British cast who perform well above their material.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(55%) A bad tempered poke in the eye towards not only pubic school, but the British ruling class. This is a very well made, well acted, and well written look into a part of the world that so few films ever tread, but for me it was just a little too barren in what it had to say. Most of the time the characters are just plain bored (which is at least true to what school was mostly like), so a need for surrealism to keep the picture going comes into play leading to a weird feeling of what is real and what is fantasy, as it becomes increasingly intermixed. The ending is beyond manic, and sadly no longer a twisted fantasy of angered youth. Very much an acquired taste, and it's not really for me, but I can understand the fondness many have towards it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this film in college when we watched it as part of our Media course. I was fascinated by it, particularly the 3 different film 'colours' it uses, colour, black and white, sepia. I am pretty sure the different uses represent different things, and not that they ran low on money as I've heard reported. I think they separately represent surreal fantasy, real life and something of a happiness in between. I once wrote an article comparing this film to the 1967 TV programme The Prisoner. I recommend this as well, so see it if you like this film. There is some violence, but it is quite mild by today's standards, so nothing to get squeamish about. There are a few bits of nudity as well. Overall, the film has been well put together, the acting is superb and you can't fault the direction or editing. The plot may be a little hard to follow if you are not used to this sort of thing and appears to 'jump' sometimes, but I think that is part of it's charm. This is also a good chance to see Malcolm McDowell out of his usual 'baddie' type character. He is the anti-hero of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven! The 1960's and revolution was in the air and watching If... again took me right back there to when I was a teenager. It is an excellent film and it achieves three things that all good films should aim for; it captures the very mood of the times, the spirit of the place (schools were exactly like that then - its no exaggeration) and it has an excellent rhythm.Which teenager then did not want to confront those who oppressed them and we all related to Travis' fantasies - especially to acquire the power over our oppressors which possession of guns would give us. But for us, as with Travis, they of course remained fantasies. Seeing the film thirty years on with the knowledge that some teenagers have since translated their fantasies into reality, it all seems rather sick. But for a couple of hours it sent me back to my youth when things were so very different and it was indeed bliss to be young and alive.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Appeal to the Essence of Being</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If.... advances a plot with a clear-cut and self-classified beginning, middle, and end. Regardless, it's transmitted through a domain of poetic license, where the facts of existence and castles in the air mingle and become the same. The events, which are sectioned like a book into titled chapters, tackle all sorts of content major and minor. From how new students are obligated to learn the school's incredibly particular casual dialect, and tested on it by the Whips, to the impulsive quirks of a teacher to the delicate liaison of Richard Warwick and Rupert Webster to the conservative barbarism of the Whips, who indeed whip our lion-hearted trifecta for their "general attitude," we are in another world, a complementary world corresponding to the highs and lows of our own.More than teachers and school administrators, it is fellow students, the senior classmates who literally dominate their lives, treating them not as equals but as prison inmates, who are the actual sitting ducks. As a result, it is hopeless to view If.... today without being reminded of the Columbine massacre. However, that was real, and Anderson's massacre is definitely meant to be symbolic. Nevertheless, American audiences of today are given a point of reference by a British audience of forty years ago. Not only is storytelling common to all cultures, but there is evidence that there are structural similarities between the tales, stories and legends produced by different cultures. The story structure found in the folk tales of one culture can recur in another, suggesting that there is something universal in the structure as well as in the function of storytelling. Because stories are human nature.If?. has no allusions to its era's events or pop culture. No drugs (though the boys do drink vodka). And rather than a pop-music score, the African Missa Luba is heard like parentheses. Anderson's focus may best be characterized as refined instead of contemporary. If...., strictly speaking, is about adolescent longings to rebel that are concurrently of its time and all. When the key figure of If.... says that "violence and revolution are the only pure acts," he's being radical in a manner usual for a teenager of his class and education. He also says, "When do we live? That's what I want to know," words that almost any kid eager for individual freedom, despite class or education, would say. If.... transpires in that many-sided period when youth falls away as the adult to be is developed. And it's the development of that coming grown-up that is the core motif.Black and white is sufficiently unusual to have some power as a special effect. If.... goes from black and white to color and back again without any evident purpose, the consequence underlining the reality that we're watching a movie, not life, and giving the movie the feeling of a hazily recalled flight of fancy. This feeling is everywhere sensed, as in such mystifying bits as when the prefect's libidinous but inhibited wife, rambling nude though the boys' rooms when they're out, or where our heroes, designated the task of cleaning out a cellar brimming with all kinds of refuse, find a dead fetus in a jar of liquid. And then there's Peanuts, the most intellectual of the boys, who peers through his telescope and expounds on the essence of the universe to Mick. However what Mick sees through his lens is the The Girl, whose introduction in the film is a signature of its total disregard for reality.Warwick is readying to do his gymnastics routine, and as he does so he looks up at the gym's upper balcony, where a group of younger boys are exiting. Webster is pulling his sweater up over his head. As he does so, Wallace clutches the exercise bar and lithely and exquisitely performs the drill, which we see in just the subtlest slow motion, intercut with Webster beholding Warwick, entranced. Warwick is yielding his body as a gesture of affection, in what might possibly endure as the most sublime homoerotic scene ever filmed. It's why, though we later see these lovers asleep in bed, no sexual act is ever exhibited between them: That's the function of the gym scene. And it's superior to sex.A good movie is one whose most noteworthy line comes just before the violence it motivates: "The thing I hate about you is the way you give Coca-Cola to your scum and your best teddy bear to Oxfam and expect the rest of us to lick your frigid fingers the rest of your frigid life." It's a very straightforward citation of a clear-cut turning point. And it's through this converging of the hallucinatory and the straightforward that If? comes most richly to life. It's the domain of illusions (or delusions) made authentic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The adventures of public school boy Mick Travis as he faces the obstacles of being in a lower year. This was the first of the Mick Travis films and looks at social class in Britain by setting society within a house in a public school. Travis represents the middle classes, trapped below the upper, ruling class, represented by the seniors and the staff, with only the worthless working class, juniors, below him.This sees Travis taking on the upper classes and refusing to yield totally to their ruling system. However his superiority towards the juniors is also seen, but not judged as much as I though it should have been. The story is quite thin in terms of actual narrative relying on the social commentary to give meaning to the film. This can make it quite frustrating for the first half until the meaning starts to become clearer.The cast is well filled out with British actors and Malcolm McDowell is excellent in the lead. The story may not be to everyone's taste - indeed the heavily armed retribution Travis may have taken on his school may not seem such a fantasy now and might not be something everyone can view as harmless fairytale (even if it is metaphor for rising up over the ruling classes).As a film it doesn't totally convince but as a message about social standings it is very well observed in not totally to everyone's taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lindsay Anderson's paper tiger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The British Public School system did not evolve solely with the idea of educating the upper classes despite that popular and widespread misconception.It was designed to produce administrators and governors,civil servants and military men to run the British Colonies.These people were almost entirely recruited from the middle classes.When the Public Schools had begun to show their worth the scions of the aristocracy were sent to them rather than be educated at home by tutors and governesses as had previously been the case.They tended to favour the schools nearer "Town" so Eton and Harrow became particularly popular with that class of parent. The vast majority of Public Schools took their pupils from lower down the social scale.Tom Brown,perhaps the most famous Public School pupil ever,was the son of a country parson,not a belted earl. Thus in late 1960s England,a country in the throes of post-colonial guilt and shedding the last of its commitments to its former dependants as quickly as Harold Wilson could slip off his "Gannex" mac,Lindsay Anderson's "If" was greeted with cathartic joy by the chattering classes and mild bemusement by everyone else. It must be remembered that the so-called "summer of love" was followed by the "October Revolution" a non-event that left a few policemen in London with bruised heads and the U.S. Embassy with one or two broken windows,but achieved absolutely nothing. So when Mr Anderson's film reached the cinemas the disgruntled former revolutionaries revelled vicariously in what they saw as Mr Malcolm McDowell's glorious victory over an amorphous "Them" despite the fact that he was ruthlessly gunned down at the end,a fate that would have undoubtedly overtaken them had they succeeded in their attempts to get into the U.S.Embassy. The film told us nothing new about Public Schools,homosexuality,bullying cold showers,patrician sarcastic teachers,silly traditions.an all-too familiar list .It was declared to be an allegory comparing Britain to the corrupt,crumbling society represented by the school.Well,nearly forty years on the same schools are still flourishing,the British social system has not changed,the "October Revolution" has been long forgotten except by those involved on one side or the other and Mr Anderson has completed his "State of the Country" trilogy to no effect whatsoever. If by any chance you should wish to read a book about schoolboys who did buck the system rather more successfully than Mr McDowell and his friends and furthermore lived to tell the tale,find a copy of "Stalky &amp; Co."written by the man whose much-maligned poem "If" lent it's name to Mr Anderson's film,a man born in colonial India,a man whose work is quietly being airbrushed out of our literary history.And do it before the chattering classes succeed in declaring him a non-person.Perhaps somebody should start a revolution about that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor milestone of British cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Complex psychological drama from director Lindsay Anderson, who would later complete his bizarre trilogy with O LUCKY MAN! and BRITANNIA HOSPITAL. Layered with subtext and impossible to fathom with just one viewing, this is the classic "rebellion" story, this time set in a posh private boy's school rife with hatred, class warfare, and struggles for power and leadership. Although the physical aspects of the storyline have dated somewhat in the turbulent years since this film first came out - with films like CLASS OF 1984 and others putting the violence in this one significantly into the shade - the artistry, visual style, complex characters, and detailed performances put it above the rest. The film always remains grounded in realism with no flights of fancy and the action is subtle and thus more true-to-life than many other movies using the school setting as a battleground.Physical aspects of the film are highly accomplished, from the photography to the music, even right down to the settings and costumes. Even the haircuts in this film are important as a symbol of rebellion and uprising. Due to budget constraints, many scenes are shot in black and white, giving the movie something of a pretentious tone but these were more of a result of Anderson running out of money than anything else. The film marks the debut of actor Malcolm McDowell, perfectly cast in the leading role of Mick Travis, a student who has had enough, and any fan of McDowell from later in his career will find him contributing his usual powerful performance at this early stage. Many strong actors fill out the supporting roles, with plenty of familiar faces from respected British actors willing to take part. Anderson achieves many powerful moments in his movie, especially the caning in the gym which stands out in my mind as one of the most shocking I've seen despite the lack of on-screen violence. IF.... is in many ways a brave and original movie and deserves to be seen at least once by those with an interest in British cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Sixties depiction of youth insurrection shocks today as it must have shocked audiences then</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 1968, directed by Lindsay Anderson with a screenplay by David Sherwin, IF... is a story of three non-conformist schoolboys played by Malcolm McDowell, Richard Warwick, David Wood, who plot revenge. Organized as a series of tableaux separated by title cards, IF... spends its first half depiction the harsh rules that these boys live under at their elite public school, and the arbitrary punishments given out by senior boys, headed by the sinister Rowntree (Robert Swann) and the distant school officials. This is all in an environment of bizarre old rituals, Latin refrains, and hardly more intelligible English public school slang (and of course, it wouldn't be a classic story of British public school life without some innuendo about buggery.) Then, as the storytelling takes on an increasingly surreal tone where we question what is real and what is fantasy, the boys and a girl from town get their hands on weapons and go after those who have wrong them.The 1960s was a time of war in Vietnam (and other violent conflicts brought to viewers globally by the media) and youth uprisings in the United States and France. Plus, these elite British school also featured compulsory military drill. In IF..., the walls of these boys' dormitory is covered with magazine cutouts of war photographs, as if to say that in a violent world, it is no surprise if the young too made recourse to violence. In this respect it feels very much like a precursor to Aki Kaurismki's THE MATCH FACTORY GIRL. IF... also reflects the new sexual freedom of 1960s Britain, and the frustration kindled in these young men who see such open sexual expression in magazines and town streets but cannot have any of it. There are a number of films from this era that document the rise of a counterculture and more open attitudes, but few are as sympathetic to these young people as this film of Anderson and Sherwin.The only serious flaw of IF... is that the main actors are too old to convincingly play teenagers, being in their mid 20s at the time of shooting. Imagine how much more shocking the film would be if it were real sixth-formers acting, though I suppose the (few) sex scenes made this impossible. Also, I must express my discontent with the quality of the audio, which is very muddy. Still, IF... is deservedly a classic, and it is available in a Criterion edition packed with enjoyable and informative extras, so I can give this a very strong recommendation.</fullReview>

The setting of an English boarding school, the hierarchy of it, a teacher who cycles through the hallways right into the classroom and straight after engages his class to think about and debate World War I, and many other wondrous specifics that come with these unique surroundings, have a great appeal to me; it is a fascinating world of knowledge, discipline, corporal punishment, innocence, adolescence, rebellion, order, and so on, which is portrayed magnificently in 'If....'. The fact that Monty Python didn't start airing until 1969 (I had to look that up), gives me the idea that this film must have been quite an inspiration...'If....' has quite a few absurd details in it, and black humour and vicious sneers pointed at the British (schooling) system. The changing from color to black and white is one of those; at some times I could understand why there was a change, at other times I couldn't, but that seemed to be deliberate, as to make the experience as much confusing for the viewer as it is for the characters in the story (what is real and what is not?). The escape per motorcycle and what ensues in the roadside caf is another - great - one. I'm not sure how much I liked the ending though, since I was more looking forward to a sober and sinister confrontation between the powers that be and our defiant trio.McDowell plays excellently, but never at the cost of any of the other actors, I'm very glad to say. I would call this a great film, yet the ending needs some more settling in with me. Oh well, I'll just watch this one again sometime... soon, I hope.A big 8 out of 10 for now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was shocked and captivated by this film when I first saw it at the age of 17. Rewatching dozens of times since it has not lost its impact. Reference is often made as to the significance of the monochrome and colour sequences. I wonder if the reason is nothing complex. All the monochrome sequences are of indoor locations in sets or settings used once or rarely. All of the outdoor sequences and the frequently-used indoor ones are in colour. Could it be simply that monochrome film stock was available in higher ASA rating and therefore could be used with less or no expensive lighting? Contrariwise colour film stock demanded daylight or lighting rigs which could only be justified for certain sets?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whether in color or b/w, an extraordinary movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson, the great stage director, made a rare foray into film with this counter-culture classic. Set at an English boarding school and focused on the anarchistic anti-establishment character played by Malcolm McDowell (in his first screen role), If... is a movie that captures a moment in time - the late 1960s - as well as the revolutionary spirit that governed that time.One of the most interesting features of the film is that it's half in color and half in black and white. I spent years trying to figure this out until I read that Anderson simply didn't have enough money for the project, so he picked his spots for color or b/w. Don't know whether that's true.One thing that's true is the use of the "Sanctus" of the 1930's vintage "Missa Luba," the African Christian mass, as a very effective piece of music. When McDowell uncovers his "revolutionary" mustache, grown over the summer, to the sounds of the Missa Luba, you know you are in for a special experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A memorable first viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended an English grammar school in the 1970s. - although a state school, it copied many aspects of public schools. No fagging, but teachers in gowns, houses, 19th century buildings, etc. etc. Grange Hill it was not. As a result I had never really seen anything like my school on the screen - until one evening I saw this. I was about 15 and - boy - did I identify with it. The teachers looked (and behaved) exactly like staff at my school, and many of the classroom scenes could have been filmed there. The headmaster was even the spitting image of my head! The setting was SO believable.Okay, a lot was also rather different (mainly the behaviour of the senior boys - fortunately our Prefects did not behave like that, though you suspected they would have done given half the chance). Also, although we had borders, I was a day-boy so the dormitory and study scenes were a bit unfamiliar, and as a rule we did not go around shooting the staff, but other than that it was sheer joy to watch. I recall cheering at the end.Having seen it again I do now view it rather differently, as the allegorical masterpiece that it is. But it still reminds me of school more than any other film I have ever seen,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal, echt-60s English public school drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very much of its time, but not dated. It fetters an anger but manages considerable control; the famous denouement is Orwellian, anarchic in content but not in temperament. It's a very funny film, even at its most grotesque.Of course Lindsay Anderson's wonderfully measured use of Surrealism also softens the fury, dissipating the growing frustrations of the disenfranchised public schoolboys into allegory. It's tricky to get one's head around this being Malcolm McDowell's first screen role. He's brilliant, charismatic and seems to know exactly what he's doing in such a complicated role. Naturally, he is subordinating himself to his auteur's whim but it reflects well on both that you can barely tell.The fairy dust of the piece is, for me, the use of the Missa Luba, the Congolese setting of the Latin Mass. At once martial and exotic it provides a penumbra of context that extends the ideas in the film beyond the stifling context of the petrifying public school in which it's set. Imperfect but compelling. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unsettling Fantasy- the Public School as Prison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are few British films that attempt, let alone achieve, such a wide scope and ambition as If..... Lindsay Anderson's admonition to the crass, backward complacence of the English establishment of the 1960's, is an allegory set in a traditional public school (the British version of a private, 'prep' school-very confoundedly English, I know!) which caught the zeitgeist of the heady, radical days of 1968, the year of mass student protest.But If.... does not glamorise, and thus vulgarise, youth rebellion the way films about student revolt seem to do (then again, a male single-sex, rural boarding school is a subject that would be hard to glamorise).It is through the adolescent eyes of Mick Travis and a small band of his fellows that we experience the loneliness, tedium, casual cruelty, claustrophobia, philistinism, and jingoism exhibited by his very conservative boarding school, and see him reacting to his desolate prison with a disturbing but darkly funny sense of fantasy.If.... is made beautifully, and clearly with great passion. Anderson handles with a stark realism the reality of traditional public school life, no doubt a development of his 'free cinema' days as an early social realist documentary filmmaker, and informed by his own experience of public school at Cheltenham College (where the film was rather cheekily made). And he moves forward and back with such seamless ease from realism to fantasy that is ironically full of life. In this, he was no doubt helped by his, at the time young first AD- a certain Stephen Frears.Still, it is the central performance, by Malcolm McDowell, one of the greatest in film, in what was his first leading role (arguably, he has never quite stopped playing Mick Travis) which stands out in this already outstanding film. His Mick Travis, with his arresting, adolescent eyes, is a callow youth who, at the same time, is also a startling and ominous rebel.</fullReview>

The VHS &amp; Criterion versions are NOT the complete film. They have been heavily censored. Among the deletions are: full frontal male &amp; female nudity (at least 5 minutes total), a sex scene where McDowell is "deflowering" (his words) a coed...again both totally nude and a dream sequence where males are being sexual active with each other. It's a shame that the advertised "English" release version is still not the complete version..If you don't believe me: find an old 1969 Playboy magazine where they used to have a feature titled "sex in the cinema" and you will see photos of the original film &amp; they are not in the versions mentioned above! If the original version was released into the theaters today it would have to receive NC-17..no doubt about it. I'm guessing there are at least 10 minutes missing in all available releases. It may have something to do with the actors not agreeing to sign off on some of their contents!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting postwar British film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky to see this memorable film in a prominent downtown Boston cinema when it first was released in America. It got good reviews and was much talked about at the time. I happened to be a young student in an all-boys Jesuit private secondary school, so I could relate somewhat to the setting of the film. My school did not have whippings, however. I remember laughing out loud when the big gun was brought out by The Girl at the end for the shooting scene, and of course this was years before the tragic school shootings in both the USA and Europe.Many New Englanders look up to British society. Anglophiles would frequently compare notes on various social issues between America and the United Kingdom, and find the USA wanting in some respects. That is why it amused me to watch this film and see young people being angry with their state of affairs. It seemed, to an American at least, that Britons should be happy to be growing up in postwar England with all the supposed benefits of the cradle-to-grave welfare state. What did they have to complain about? It seemed then that young Americans had good reasons to fight over the Vietnam War, but I tended to feel that Britain in 1968 was a near-perfect place to live. Now that I am older and have visited Britain many times, I naturally have a better understanding of the complexities and class problems in the UK. Perhaps this film was one of the first to question things considered sacred.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love Can Assist The Move To Violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just sat here and read many of the viewer comments. They were wonderful. There is just one thought I would like to add and that is "love can assist the move to violence".I think this was one of the ideas the writer and director were showing. I have heard it argued even with the recent violence on an Indian Reservation in the North of the USA that if only the boy had received love he would not have done what he did in his school. I have also heard that argument put forward about "Columbine". However I noticed as a sergeant back in Vietnam times that love in the platoon assisted in increasing levels of violence that were able to be performed.In this movie "IF" there is one definite forming of love between the younger student and the older student. In the last scene the younger was handing a mortar shell to the older to blast away at the faculty and students. They were working together as a team.Love is only a first step to solving our societies problems. I think that might have been one of the things that was trying to be said in this movie. The second step I think that was trying to be said was for us to find non-violent ways to do that, other wise: "Columbine". Anderson, Sherwin and Howlett had no way of knowing "Columbine" was coming. This might be a stretch but I bet those two boys loved each other too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The majority of those who saw If.... must have wondered into what strange world they had arrived - a world where chaplains were produced from drawers, where people were mercilessly machine-gunned yet survived, where tigerish fights were enacted naked in transport cafes. Odd places, English public schools [US=private schools], they must have concluded. And yet... my first reaction, on seeing this extraordinary film in 1968, three years after emerging from just such a school myself, was how accurately, to the last detail, Lindsay Anderson had hit off the atmosphere, the ethos, and especially the sounds of these places. Indeed I swore that he somehow must have had access to my own school, though clearly filming it eighty miles away in Cheltenham. Only later did I meet other ex-public schoolboys, each of whom swore it was based on theirs!If.... is a film of massive authority; a perceptive, funny, infinitely sad exposition of how a repressive regime can reduce its most promising subjects to a state of wretched nihilism in which even the ultimate doomed gesture is no more real than any of the others. My friends from the state schools could barely distinguish the surreal from the all-too-true in this film. I idolised Michael Travis and, like Wallace, Knightly, Bobby Phillips and the girl, would have followed him anywhere.</fullReview>

The acting by all is magnificent, the directing by Anderson is superb, and the score by Marc Wilkinson is downright haunting, as is the rest of the film. It seems hard to believe that this film was ever made, it most likely wouldn't be by today's politically correct society, which is a shame as this allegory should be allowed to settle in and indent itself into your consciousness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw If... a number of times at the cinema when it first came out, and it wasn't just because of Christine Noonan's nude scene with Malcolm McDowell (I was 16 in 1968, and a bit starved for such things).The reason I watched it a number of times, and have watched it a number of times since can't be because I understood it. As I've got older, and have learnt more about the world, the British education system (state and private), and Lindsay Anderson himself, I have come to understand it better, of course, but understanding isn't what hooked me.And it wasn't because I am a rebel myself - I'm not, I'm an enthusiastic conformist. Nor do I sympathise with (all of) the matters in respect of which Mick and his mates feel alienated.But the film speaks to me. The power of Malcolm McDowell in his debut is something to be reckoned with, of course, and I've always been a sucker for a little bit of is-it-fantasy, or is-it-reality? This film has such a strong sense of itself - there is no other film which looks, sounds or feels anything like If... It engages you and never lets you go throughout its length, no matter that you have no more idea of the idiosyncrasies - and sometimes twistedness - of the British public school system than I have. It doesn't matter. It's its own world, real within the context of the film, and that's all that's necessary, populated by real characters who do real things, even when those things are fantasy.A brilliant one-off, by a brilliant one-off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, But A Bit Rough Around The Edges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"If" offers a compelling depiction of life in what appears to be an upper class British boarding school for boys. Unfortunately, in the end, I also found it somewhat unsatisfying and largely unresolved, leaving too much open-ended. This is reflected, I suppose, in the title itself. I'm not quite sure what "If ?" is supposed to suggest. If what?The story revolves around the character of Mick (played by a very young Malcolm McDowell in a memorable performance.) Mick is a bit of a rebel, whose rebelliousness grows as he's exposed more and more regularly to the harshness of life in this place, culminating in his being caned along with several others for having a poor attitude. It's also at that point when the movie begins to break down a bit, though (the caning being what I thought was the climactic scene of the movie.) The downward spiral began immediately after with the scene in which the naked woman walks through the dorm (for no apparent reason that I could see) and then descends through increasingly bizarre scenes, culminating in a very violent ending which really didn't resolve anything because we don't know how the confrontation depicted ended.There were other factors that made this movie a bit difficult. Chapter numbers and titles may work well in a novel, but not quite as well in a movie. The scenes in this are separated by those divisions, and the end result was that the story was a little bit rough and lacking in flow. Director Lindsay Anderson also used a strange blend of black and white with colour throughout the movie, and, again, there didn't seem to be any clear reason for why certain scenes were filmed in B&amp;W. Again, it was ultimately distracting and took away from the flow of the movie.Even with those weaknesses, though, this was a very interesting and watchable movie. Whether it's an accurate depiction of what life in such schools was like in 1968 is an open question. If it was, then it's surprising that such things didn't happen more often in real life! It's well worth watching, and offers a clear reflection on the rebellious nature of the 1960's in general. 6/10</fullReview>

I have always thought she is simply a symbol. Mc Dowells character is in love with his friend.Those tender looks and the romance between the boys contrasted to the hetero action being ugly and shallow, like two tigers at play. Even the famous hand cuff scene is symbolic. The love scenes with the boys are just beautiful. So many beautiful moments.

		<fullReview>The film is a great portrayal of a public school. It starts off by not introducing the main character until after about 5 to 10 minutes. Confusing the audience, even the story line develops late. All of this makes the film a unique narrative structure, and is one reason some audiences cannot understand this film. It becomes too much of a muddle, the strange chapters and the black and white sections. All of which I belive add a unique feel to this great film.The film touches on so many issues a couple of them now days we just would not be able to show. For example the shooting at the school at the end did not go down well at all with my American friends, it was all to close to home as I belive many would agree. But it gets across a strong point of youth rebellion against the system. And you must remember that this film was made in a time when rebellion against the system was happening, the society in which we were living was rapidly changing, and this is portrayed well in this film. Showing the traditonal ways being rejected by the adolesent.Now to the issue of the black and white film. MAny would like to bleive Lindsay Anderson's explanation that they ran out of money, but look at the sections in the church each is in Black and white. This could be argued that these were all filmed at the end. But one scene in the final chapter tells us otherwise, whilst in the chapel Travis looks up at a stained glass window, which in a black and white scene appears in colour, and then reverts to colour. I would say that when the theme of tradition and the mundane is introduced black and white films cuts in, that and the obscure sometimes as it is less real to see this black and white film, (Erasor Head).Over all a great film that cannot be beaten or remade if you tried.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson's "If..." is a compelling portrait of nihilistic rebellion at a British prep school, where unruly pupil Malcolm McDowell (and two of his old, wise 'droogies') takes charge against a hypocritical system. The film cobbles together a very large cast of characters, to the point where it's sometimes difficult to recognize someone from scene to scene, but that could be part of Anderson's intent--the perils of conformity and the effect it has on the individual is a central theme. The lyrical style, with sequences divided up into chapters with titles such as 'College' and 'Crusaders,' aids in giving the story a richness in depth akin to a good work of literature. With its statements on the suppression of the individual and corruption through ideals of power, "If..." doesn't necessarily tread revolutionary cinematic ground, but has a graceful flow, a style rich with imaginative touches (random shifts to black-and-white), brilliant performances by a cast of unknowns, and a knockout ending that isn't as ridiculous as you might think.With the presence of McDowell (in his first film role) and the themes of the script, certain parallels can be made to "A Clockwork Orange" (1971), but "If..." has no problems standing on its own as a completely unique work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning: I mention parts of this film's plot in the comments below)Well after 17 years I recently saw this film once again and to be honest it just doesn't seem as memorable as I remember it. Maybe it's because of all that has happened the past few years but this film's ending seems just plain cruel, out of place and unnecessary. It's also odd but the last time I saw this film I could have sworn its title "If..." didn't pop up at the very end but was right before an ending that showed the school on a typical day as if nothing had happened and the violent ending was only a possibility (hence "If...."). I must have dreamed that ending.It's still a well made film with a provocative title and good original music by Marc Wilkinson (a song called SANCTUS from the African mass "Missa Luba" is also used).Unfortunately -- at least for me -- there's only one memorable scene in the entire film and it's a turning point in it. It occurs in section #6 (called "Resistance"). While Mick (another Mick?) the amateur astronomer gazes into the night sky with his telescope he tells Mick Travis "Space you see Michael is all expanding at the speed of light...". Mick Travis asks if Mick is with them in the planed rebellion by handing him a bullet. Mick (probably one of the few normal older students) hands the bullet back and offers Mick Travis a glance through the telescope. Mick gazes into the sky and lowers the telescope to see his girlfriend in a distant window. She waves back. (She either has very good eye sight or he adjusted the telescope's view while scanning down?). It's a well made scene that I still remember from 17 years ago. It's also funny but this time I noticed on this latest viewing how much the music in that section sounds like something off of The Moody Blues' "Days of Future Past" album (you remember: "Breath deep the gathering gloom...").If this is basically just an all boys high school in England like you would have in the U.S. (Is it just a high school? Am I correct about that?) then most students would be between 14 and 18 years old. Maybe it's because most of the older students at this school are played by actors in their twenties (Malcolm McDowell was 25 at the time) and the fact that most of the younger students look like they're about 11 years old, but for the older students it looks like the greatest sadness in their lives isn't the regimented environment they live in at this school but that they are basically treated like children or same as the youngest students. Sure the older ones have additional responsibilities but they are basically treated like they're 11 -- they can't go into town (it's off limits) and everyone must be inside by 5 PM, etc. One final thought: There are a few quotes mentioned under this Web page's "Memorable Quotes" section but not listed are the ones I always thought were this film's most unique, which are:Headmaster: Work, play, but never mix the two.Headmaster: Those given most, have most to give.</fullReview>

The film focus's on the cultural hegemony of a traditional hierarchy and the freedom seeking individuals who wish to rebel against the system. Although strikingly odd the film is also a powerful representation of the British class system at the time and even today to some extent.Malcolm MacDowell's cinematic debut is a great one showing himself to be a great British actor, even catching the eye of legendary Director Stanley Kubrick which would then lead to the actors infamous leading role in A Clockwork Orange. O how great things can lead on to much greater things.Lindsay Anderson's direction is interesting to say the least, with a lack of continuity at times and stand out surrealist moments that on the surface baffle any audience member but have much deeper connotations such as; abortion, gender (in)equality, individuality (or lack there of), homosexual repression and rebellion, just to name a few. This film has many interpretations and meanings embedded in its micro elements, so it is rather meaningful even if two people have weird animal fighting sex in a coffee shop...If... is an evocative statement about the British class system represented in the microcosm of the school. Many topics are touched upon in many different and frankly surreal ways making if.... a memorable and important film not just of it's time but for years to come as the title could signify. If this happened today, which side will you be on?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, Strange, but You Don't NEED to See It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If.... is a strange film since it seems to be on the border between the mainstream and the art film. It is definitely experimental in terms of its use of color as well as not being necessarily clear about whether certain moments of the film are fantasy for the characters (though some moments simply MUST be).For those familiar with a Clockwork Orange, it is made clear by this film why Kubrick made the casting decision of Malcolm McDowell for the famous anti-hero Alexander DeLarge. Malcolm McDowell is the driving force behind the film If.... even though he does not appear in every scene. He is wonderful with his disregard for the rules made to oppress himself and his classmates, and he pulls off this rebellious attitude with a convincing smart mouth and a bit of repressed evil.The theme of rebellion is practically shouted within this movie. When McDowell's character enters the story, he wears a cloth around his face and his classmates jokingly refer to him as Guy Faux, who you might remember as V's main inspiration in V for Vendetta. He and his closest friends are also constantly being punished throughout the film for acting against such seemingly unnecessary rules. But this is the environment they are brought up in - it is a private school for the upper-class in which they live and the adults will shape them to become upper-class adults through the means of rough discipline which at some points can arguably be described as abuse.The room in which Mick Travis (McDowell) and his closest friends hang out is also filled with photos focusing on rebellion. These photos come from various revolutions or wars, so most of the photos depict heroes (if you want to call them that) fighting in military battles.A sub-theme of this film seems to be repressed homosexuality. Rumors of a certain boy amongst the group claim he is homosexual, and this boy is given a scene where he focuses his attention on an upper- class-man exercising his gymnastic abilities. There is very little room for reading this scene as anything other than longing for the older boy, and it is a true example of the male gaze in cinema. Also, this is revisited later when the two boys are in the same bed together, smiling at each other with their shirts off.What is strange about this film is that there are moments of black and white footage, and these scenes do not seem to have a pattern. A lot of them are moments that are clearly within the diegesis of the film while others represent fantasy sequences - these fantasy sequences seem to be when the focus is on Mick Travis. But as said before, there is no true pattern as normal events and strange ones alike take the aesthetic of being shot in black and white, so it is peculiar why the director shot any sequence in color at all.Finally, if you are very sensitive or get offended easily this is not the film for you - the ending which the film builds up to is extremely disturbing.3.0/4.0</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If.... is a fantastic allegorical movie. Weird beyond belief, but normal enough that it doesn't stray into the surreal unbelievable. This film is like The Dead Poet Society for bad boys. With a stellar cast, it is obvious to see why Malcolm McDowell would later go on to play Alex DeLarge in Stanley Kubricks A Clockwork Orange. Truly a stunningly deep film which portrays war, society and school in all different directions. One of my favourite films ever to be composed. If it wasn't for this film, I would be continuing to squander in my life with no real direction. Truly a film that got me moving the right way. Excellent film and approach to some serious issues that have never been approached in the same way and probably never will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>surreal Lord of the Flies feel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The student are returning to a British boarding school. Mick (Malcolm McDowell) and his friends are the constantly chaffing at the Whips, the upper classmen in charge of the students. The adults defers to the Whips. The lower classmen or Scums are menial servants for the Whips. It culminates in Mick and his friends being canned by the Whips. Mick gives his friends some bullets. Together they go on surreal shooting sprees.I have never been in a boarding school and it's a little tough to get a feel for this movie. This seems more like 'Lord of the Flies' with rules and traditions. Then it throws in some surrealism. This seems very unreal but I can't tell what's reasonable and what's not. I was actually glad when the movie goes fully surreal in the last act. The last half is definitely shocking and takes a left turn somewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanna be ANARCHY !!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Themes of "Anti-Establishment" and "Rebellion" have always been widely used in all art forms, be it cinema, be it music, be it literature,etc. Specially during the sixties, non-conformist ideas and policies had a huge rise and people started to reject the conventional ideas and beliefs to lead a life that they believed in.Cinema is an art form which in its truest form can portray very accurately the plight of the common people and the conditions that they are living in, their daily struggles, their happiness, their sorrow,etc. So the cinema of the sixties couldn't possibly stay completely oblivious of the chaotic conditions that existed in the society. Films from different parts of the world and in various languages started being made with themes of non-conformism like "Pratidwandi" by Satyajit Ray, "Memories of Underdevelopment" by Toms Gutirrez Alea, etc."If..." is another such film that was made in the sixties which dealt with rebellion and themes of anti-establishment, and as far as I am concerned, it is a true masterpiece. The director Lindsay Anderson uses the class system prevalent in the British schools at the time as a metaphor for the class systems existing in society. We witness the goings-on in the school from the points of view of two students belonging to the different ends of the spectrum. Jute who starts out as an outsider completely oblivious of the customs and traditions slowly and gradually gets prepared by others to accept and embrace the customs and he in the end becomes part of the establishment by being accepted by the authorities. On the other hand there is Mick Travis, who has been a student for quite sometime, but who still can't accept the strict rules and regulations that he is supposed to obey. He continuously flouts the rules which leads to punishments and these punishments gradually give birth to a violent, rebellious spirit in him.The teachers and the headmasters represent the governments and all other forms of authority. All they do is give long and articulate speeches about life and the future of the students and the society. The whips are just students,but they have been given extra privileges to act as monitors and supervisors of other students and have the right to brandish punishments. I think they represent the elites and the rich people who don't care about the plight of others and abuse other people's rights while they themselves are nothing but the same as the same. The oppression and lack of freedom proves too much for some in the end which leads to a brutal finale. Lindsay Anderson tells the story in a very stylish way with a lot of surrealism. There clearly are some scenes which raises the question of whether they actually took place or whether they were just dreams involving wish fulfilment for Mick. Malcolm Mcdowell is brilliant as the young and vibrant Mick Travis. His character here is somewhat similar to the character of Alex DeLarge in "A Clockwork Orange", although Mick is in now way as wild as Alex.To conclude, it has to be said that "If...." is a great film which uses allegory to portray the problems of society in general. The director shows how the lack of freedom and relentless oppression can lead to chaotic eventualities. Although this film was made in 1968, but its themes make it relevant and accessible even today in the 21st century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" If the sword is all you're prepared to give us, then be prepared to carry it with you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Noted director Lindsay Anderson took a short script called 'The Crusaders' and brought it to the silver screen as " If, . . . ." which has since become a monumental giant from the 1960's. Revolutionary in it's day, it has since morphed into a Avant Garde, stand-alone film which has since earned it's place among the fore-runners of our modern movies. So to has it premiere English movie star Malcolm McDowell who has established himself as a true Thespian. The movie is set in a Traditional military school with it's deeply rooted equally traditional standards which center on rules, adherence to discipline and harsh punishments. However, in among the returning students are several 'misfits' who will not accept the standard rules and regulations and decide to rebel. Everything the 'Whips' or upper classmates demand, such as short hair, obedience to orders, and strict adherence to morality, is fodder for the rebels. Thus the school is ripe for rebellion and the rebels do everything to disrupt the school year. The movie is in short order a setting between the old guard and the new order. The color film is filled with innovations such as splits to Black and white which add to the odd assortments of images which create a new way to viewing a story. New additions to the screen include Sean Bury as 'Jute', David Wood, Richard Warwick and Rupert Webster. All in all, this is a groundbreaking film and has stood the test of time. Thus; in it's own way it has become a Classic. Recommended to anyone who wants to view something completely different. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lindsey Anderson's 'If' reminds one a lot of other films made before, after and during its time, for example, one remembers Easy Rider, Zero for Conduct, Medium Cool and even for that matter, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest among others. 'If' would still be special for its utmost refusal of establishment, for its outright defiant nature, for its ending (student firing at everyone openly without any consideration). And it is specially this ending that caused a lot of trouble for the authorities. For that matter, even today it raises certain vibrant questions for which, I believe, the film is still dreadfully relevant.Where and how far is Mick Travis different from a contemporary schoolboy of America, who guns down his teachers or mates? (Every now and then we keep reading this kind of news, don't we)? The answer to this question probably would be that there is no such significant difference between the two. When we read a story like that, we probably wonder, what is so damn wrong about today's world. A film like 'If' tells us that there is nothing drastically wrong about today' world, the world has been like this for a while, and this sloppy violence has a teeming history.Interestingly just about when the shooting of 'If" had finished, the student uprising in France begun. In May 1968, students of Paris violently attacked the police, they called out to a generation, "Be realistic, demand the impossible". In USA, youth rioted outside the Chicago Democratic Convention protesting against the Vietnam War. And not only in USA or Europe, the late sixties and early seventies saw youth and student movement in various parts of the world, including Asia, Africa and Latin America; looking back it seems kind of an astonishing co-incident. Whatever, 'If' captured the myth of 1968, the myth of worldwide student revolt. Naturally it was very popular among the students and the youth of that time.Many people saw 'If' as a political incitement to violence. And this assumption basically arises from the ending of the film. These three four students under the leadership of Mick Travis, had no intention of organizing other students against the authority, all they wanted was to kill them (probably that was the rule of the time). And even while killing, they didn't have any particular project. They killed anyone who came out from the function, including teachers, parents and assorted dignitaries. It's this aspect of the film that makes is somewhat unsettling. No wonders that in Greece, the final insurrection was cut out, in Portugal it was totally banned and in the apartheid regime in South Africa it was only for the 'Whites' to see. Even the director, Lindsey Anderson, faced great difficulty in funding his future projects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sixties' rebellion still speaks to us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Feature films set in English public schools are strangely timeless: their look, their feel, their atmosphere (and if they were in Odo-rama, probably their smell) are all very similar and, of course not forgetting the hazing, caning, abuse, humiliation, hierarchy, class structure and repression of all sexual orientations - all aimed at transmitting social strictures and structures to the next generation. Lindsay Anderson's "If... " doesn't depart from that template but the difference is that all those strictures are the film's main subject rather than its background to another story (as in, for instance "Another Country"). Malcolm McDowell's character resistance is existential rather than political and there was something marvellously 1960s about the movie, with its trippy escape into town ("out of bounds!"), street theatre and a joyride on a stolen motorbike, the hook up with the cafeteria girl and the dreams of free love. The ending is a little disappointing due to the cop-out into violence - the Sixties' hedonist culture did at the time reverberate through even the stodgiest of social institutions, for a while at least. The film switches back and forth between colour and black &amp; white film stock, which gives it an alienating and interesting feel. (Prosaically, this was due to budget restrictions forcing some scenes to be filmed in black and white for technical reasons). Marvellous sound track with Sanctus from Missa Luba.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a brief review of "If", "This Sporting Life", "Britannia Hospital" and "O, Lucky Man!", four films by director Lindsay Anderson.One of the defining films of the British New Wave, "Sporting Life" revolves around Frank Machin (Richard Harris), a short tempered guy who becomes a star on the rugby circuit. Eschewing the style of Anderson's later films, which tended to be stylised satires, it offers a gritty portrait of a Northern England rife with failed relationships, class anxiety and human despair. As Anderson cut his teeth as a run-and-gun documentary filmmaker, the film crackles with the energy of post-war neorealism."This Sporting Life" would prove a big influence on Martin Scorsese's "Raging Bull". Replace Scorsese's boxing scenes with Anderson's urgent rugby brawls and swap the tough-but-dim Jake LaMotta for the equally tough-but-dim Frank Machin, and you have virtually the same tale. Both also make extensive use of flashbacks, are shot in black and white, are preoccupied with masculinity and personal anguish, feature violent romances, mix poeticism with realism, follow the same narrative progression and are about men who express their inner turmoil through external violence.Where "Bull" differs from "Life" is in the former's refusal to put Jake within a larger social context. This is a direct result of a broader shift; from modernism to post-modernism, from art as social engine to art as social withdrawal. In Scorsese's film, Jake LaMotta essentially has no external motivation. When at the end of the film LaMotta strikes a wall and yells "Why? Why?", Scorsese is equally clueless. "I didn't want to give LaMotta any motivations," Scorsese would say in interviews (not quite true; LaMotta is reduced to a Catholic body bag, a suffering Christ who exists to absorb penance for his earthly sins), before going on to state that "all motivations are clich". "Reasons? We never discussed reasons!" he would tell the New York Times in 1980. Scorsese's dismissal, the unconscious stance of post-modernity, is chilling.But "understanding" is not necessarily "cliche", rather it is the essential component of character. La Motta's boiling anger in Scorsese's film does not make him a human being, especially once you've read how articulate and self-analysing LaMotta is in his autobiography. That makes the film, for all its power, somewhat shallow. Compare this to "Life", which has more direct and urgent ties to the neorealist movement. It portrays sporting clubs as the playthings of the wealthy, shows how club owners become Mephistophelian menaces, is resoundingly class conscious, portrays the sports community as being intertwined with the mining community, shows how celebrity and sports are seen to be a form of financial and psychological escape etc etc. And so Anderson's films are, at their best, rebellions against the inherent conservatism of British culture, akin to the plays of Harold Pinter and Arnold Wesker, and the contemporary working-class novels of John Braine, Alan Sillitoe, Stan Barstow and David Storey, the screen adaptations of which, in the late 1950s and early 60s, ushered in a new era of British film and formed the core of what was to be known as the British New Wave.Scorsese's film, however, functions more as a pastiche of New Wave aesthetics. He, like many Hollywood directors of the 1970s, essentially takes the sexy blood/violence of the European realists and new wavers, and then drops all political context.Scorsese has never spoken of "This Sporting Life", but in the late 1970s he did mention to David Sherwin that the name of his central character in "Taxi Driver", Travis Bickle, had been chosen as a homage to Mick Travis, Malcolm McDowell's character in Lindsay Anderson's "If". It should be no surprise, then, that "Taxi Driver" is essentially a remake of "If", now set in New York."If" is about life in a highly authoritarian British boarding school. We watch for an hour as teachers, prefects, priests and various other authority figures essentially make the lives of the students miserable. One young man called Mick Travis, however, refuses to put up with this any longer; he finds a stash of guns and, during a climactic, pseudo-fantastical sequence, guns down the school's staff from a clock tower.It's a great film, though it does, like many similar films of the era, degenerate into a simple revenge fantasy, revolutions - unashamedly cathartic - brought about by bullets and violence. Compare this to fare like "The Magdalene Sisters", Jean Vigo's "Zero De Conduit" or perhaps "Clockwork Orange" and "Zabriskie Point", where the "fantasy clich" at the end is reversed and the "anarchist" is absorbed/enfolded/manipulated into the very fabric he lashes out at."If" found Anderson developing a new aesthetic. He employs Brechtian distance, cartoonish antics and an acerbic, satirical tone. He'd develop this style further in "Hotel Britannia" and "O, Lucky Man!", both of which feature the Mick Travis character. A precursor to Terry Gilliam's "Brazil", both are also dystopian fantasies preoccupied with revolution, anarchists and abuses of state/corporate power. Attempting to portray life in a capitalist society dominated by powerful mega corporations, "O, Lucky Man!" (1973) was the more popular of the two films. "Hospital" (1982), though, was the more ambitious. Using a hospital to encapsulate pre-Thatcher, mid-1970s Britain, the film tackled everything from class bigotry to imperialism to problems of equity to Britain's love affair with monstrous dictators. The film's release coincided with the "Falklands War", and so was sunk by a rise in nationalistic fervour."This Sporting Life" ? 8.5/10, "If" ? 8.5/10, "O, Lucky Man!" ? 7.5/10, "Britannia Hospital" ? 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film about school and more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson was one of the few directors who could work successfully in such no-no genres as social satire and political allegory and get away with it, and this movie is part one of three, to be followed by O Lucky Man (1973) and Britannia Hospital (1982). Malcolm McDowell plays the viewpoint character (Mick Travis) as an ambitious rebel who finds himself smothering in the repressive atmosphere of an English private school. The school, of course, is both a school with all of its loathsome qualities intact via the memories of the writers (David Sherwin and John Howlett) and an allegory for UK society at large with similarly perverse social traditions and expectations. Cadet training, for instance, is presented as a boring, pointless waste of the students' young lives, while subtly hinting at the societal expectation to one day be called to defend one's country - right or wrong, no questions asked - a key political issue in the Vietnam era. That is one example. Much of what happens in the film resonates in this way, with small happenings and silly traditions within school hinting at a much broader context.Much has been made of the jarring shifts between color and B&amp;W film - the producers ran short of money and had to shoot some scenes in B&amp;W. Nevertheless, the B&amp;W film gives those scenes an unreal quality and leave the viewer wondering whether they took place at all or existed only in the overworking imagination of Mick. I prefer to think of these bits as a happy accident.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anatomy of a society</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is a film about everything and anything. It would appear that there is no plot in particular rather than be witness to what happens to a group of kids in a English private school. The story, without major shocks, follows Travis and his group of friends, their classes, their hobbies, their thoughts and reasoning. But at any moment, everything begins to change. In a subtle way the differences between "the dominant bourgeoisie", in this case managers and coordinators, and " student's proletariat" are increased to such an extent that breaks down completely that peaceful existence. Thus there is no longer reverse and the bloody end is only an analogy of intolerance by a society between one generation and another, between those who have power and those who suffer from it.Photography, direction, editing, art and the perfect performance of Malcolm McDowell combine to create a film that, despite its slow pace, from the sixth chapter and on seems have sense and it is too late to reverse the gear of a society, of an entire revolution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>40 years later, I watch it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film when I was living in Cambridge, England in the heady days of the late 1960s when it first came out and I was absolutely bowled over by it. I considered myself a member of the counter-culture then, and identified wholeheartedly with most of its sentiments, albeit somewhat troubled by the last scene. In other words, we ask, what will be the next oppressive regime, and I believe that violence begets violence. That part of the film tells that story in itself, and I do not believe it advocates revolution, but states that oppression will always lead to rebellion and violence.If.. is a very accurate description of Public School Life as it was then in England. The term public school in England would refer to exclusive private schools in other parts of the world. I assume also that the title If... also hearkens to the eponymous poem of Rudyard Kipling, the arch British colonialist poet. My father used to keep a framed copy of it on his desk!I myself went to a girls' private school (in the 1960s) in the colonies. Though not in any manner that oppressive, I found many similarities in the attitudes of students, and the hierarchical system of prefects, school monitors, competitive houses along with the emphasis on school sports as being of prime importance.The dialogue, acting and cinematography is excellent. I was so impressed with this film that I bought a book of the screenplay, but on reading it, it was clear that without the visual content and real actors, it could only convey a glimpse of the potential of this masterwork. I could watch it many times over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An impeccable surrealist satire about oppression, revolution and defiance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'If....' (1968) is one of the great British films of the twentieth century, and one of the greatest films ever made on the subjects of adolescent oppression, rebellion, hope and the nature of education. It would be the first part of a loose, informal trilogy of films, each looking at the character of Mick Travis and his often absurd, existentialist journey through life as a microcosm for the broader aspects of contemporary society, and all presented in such a way as to create a starker sense of lingering, surrealist satire. Although the world of boarding schools and this particular era of existence will now be alien to a great number of potential viewers, the themes behind the film and the feelings that the characters instil in us are incredibly relevant and should resonate with anyone intelligent and mature enough to reflect upon their own adolescence or teenage years in order to see the comparisons to the world and the characters that are here created.Like its characters, the film is alive with radical ideas and the spirit of revolution; drawing on the influence of the more exciting films being produced in France, Japan and The Czech Republic in the early to mid 1960's to create a work that is bold, imaginative and often dreamlike in its presentation (not only in the famous and seemingly random juxtapositions between colour film and black and white, but in the arcane and often bizarre images that director Lindsay Anderson inter-cuts in order to give a greater meaning to these characters and their spirit of defiance). Although apparently used for practical reasons as opposed to any kind of artistic pretence, the combination of colour stock, inter-cut with sequences of stark black and white, creates a tone to the film that manages to underpin the character's yearning for escape and the desire for something more exciting than the daily grind of soulless education and ritual conformity presented by the strict regime that the school here presents. It also demonstrates Anderson's command of the material and his expert handling of the script; taking elements that could have been used for traditional dramatic purposes and instead subverting them - creating a film that is brash, exciting and anarchic, whilst still featuring characters that conform to the recognisable conventions of heroes and villains, etc.This particular presentation suits the film incredibly well, particularly in the setting up of certain ideas that will be looked at more closely in the film's infamous final act. Whether or not these sequences work on a literal level or as a merely fantastical abstraction (a primal scream depicted in a purely cinematic sense) is one of the great questions that hangs over the final moments of 'If...'; with the influence of the script, the spirit of the characters and the striking approach to film-making creating a world of staggering contrasts that are enigmatic in design. By randomising the use of colour, we, as an audience, are unable to differentiate between scenes that seem to exist in reality and scenes that are more dreamlike or surreal. As a result, the entire film seems to work on a heightened level of reality; existing within some kind of twisted dream state in which emotions and feelings come to inform the changes in tone, pushing the story into abstract, metaphorical ideas seemingly at random.As with the two subsequent films in the series, the picaresque masterpiece O' Lucky Man! (1973) and the somewhat flawed but interesting Britannia Hospital (1982), the politics of 'If....' relate very closely to the politics of the time; creating a drab world of order and conformity in which abuse and the woeful misuse of power can be employed to exploit anyone that steps out of line or questions the basis of authority. The microcosm of the world created here exists, much like society itself, on a level of hierarchy; with the youngest kids at the bottom, the teachers at the top, the prefects existing like a militant force, and the other students simply trapped in the middle somewhere, forced to obey the often trivial rules in order to ensure the successful running of this makeshift social order. Only in this kind of environment would the more absurd elements of the plot work so seamlessly alongside the more realistic sequences; a thematic contrast that is partly aided by the great performances from the principal actors and of course, the stunning and then highly unconventional direction of Anderson himself. The archaic production design - which conspires to create a world removed from the time and place in which the film is set - combined with the cold angles and expressive use of light creates an oppressive world in which the repression and suppression of feelings produces a pressure-cooker like atmosphere that explodes in violence and misguided revolution.In the contemporary sense you could see it as a sad precursor to the violence and apathy now apparent in most secondary schools across the western world, whilst the context of the 60's and the spirit of rebellion in the face of the post-war generation's failure to contextualise the horror of that particular period can be found in Jean Luc Godard's similarly satirical and revolutionary masterpiece Week End (1967). Like that film, 'If....' is a masterwork of cinematic expression, thought and emotion that may require repeated viewings in order to fully comprehend the abstract tone and the intentions of the characters; though the experience is entirely worth it! The combination of David Sherwin's intelligent script, Anderson's direction and the great performances from Malcolm McDowell, David Wood, Richard Warwick, et al are impeccable, and mark this out as a truly great achievement; a compelling, powerful and imaginative work of revolution and defiance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunning comment on morality, rebellion, and war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IF.... is one of the most stunning and rebellious films I've seen in years. This is not the kind of film to watch to be entertained. It is an extremely challenging film, and you can either agree with what it's saying or disagree, but either way, you will not walk out of it unmarked. It is darkly funny and outrageous. It is the kind of film that time has caught up to. It was ahead of it's time when it was made in 1968, and now it must be listened to. It is about a boarding school in which there are the upper class students who rule the school. It is required by the law of the school that under class students must constantly obey the upper class students. When a group of under class students decide to revolt, they proceed to plan a violent raid on the sadistic school and destroy what is causing their downfall. The leader of the group is the charismatic Mick Travis, who just got back from seeing the outside world and is not happy by the small amount of freedom he and his friends get. He is accompanied by a woman he has a satiric encounter with at a coffee shop. The ringleaders of the group include his partner in crime, Johnny, who has less self esteem but less of a grip on reality, and Wallace, who is accompanied by his lover, Bobby Phillips. When the film gets to it's fierce climax, the audience no longer will have any real sympathy for the school, but will no doubt be surprised by what unfolds. What makes this film so interesting is to watch the interests of these characters take center place in all of the chaos and confusion. We see a newcomer to the school quickly be reformed while several others don't even seem to complain about their situations. The entrance of the Mick Travis character is unforgettable. He shows up with a black cloak over his face to shield what is undoubtedly something offensive to some sort of community. When he takes off the shroud to reveal that all that he's hiding is a simple mustache, the audience is shocked. Just as shocked as they were ten minutes prior to when an upper class student told an under class student to warm a toilet seat for him. A scene that comes later revolves around a simple gesture at a coffee shop quickly disintegrates into hyper passionate love making while the Johnny character casually looks on. The thee players have a sword fight in which slowly turns desperate as they feel a sense of freedom that they aren't allowed to even experience. There's the most homo-erotic scene in film history in which a student watches another student work out in a gym, which is really quite subtle in it's simplicities. Toward the end of the film, there are science fiction over tones that allows the audience to take in just how twisted and hypocritical this school really is. When all of this is taken into consideration in what happens at the end of the school, the audience is forced into a moral battle with themselves. Whose side are you on? The people who are being murdered, or the people who are committing the murders? This is a film that dares to ask these sorts of questions, and this is why I highly regard IF.... as one of the most important films ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original Fight Club</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If... takes place in n a gloomy, uptight, conservative and conformist boarding school in Birtain. Inept and pompous group of elders let a group of tyrannical elder students dispense justice and manage their fellow students like prison wards. Several rebel souls express their difference more and more subversively, until they are pushed past the breaking point.Alternating monochrome with color, and structured into thematic chapters like a novel, If.... owes its classic status to its seamless weaving of dream and reality, as the whimsical fantasies of our main protagonists (chiefly a mischievous and hypnotic McDowel) contrast with the sometimes even more surreal absurdity of their oppressive school. That and a killer cast, boosted by the sensitive screenplay and Anderson's brave direction, that mixes poetry and comedy with dark satyr, while creating a completely compelling and coherent whole.If.... is not, contrary to what some might fear, purely grounded in the 60s. It is symbolic of an enduring struggle between the hunger for freedom of youth and the constraining bitterness of age, showing why some sensitive souls can be driven to madness. Violence becomes, as McDowell's character Travis puts it, "the last pure creative act". In that way, Travis is the original Tyler Durden (Fight Club, 1999), although one who is far more real and human, and for all its comedic elements, echoes of If.... could be found in the Columbine massacre. It is a phenomenally authentic and resonating classic that speaks to any youth and parent that will listen, and sends a rousing call to all who watch it, as well as a disquieting alarm.One of those rare, timeless and essential films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If.... -1968 film about a British public school starring a young Malcolm McDowell and directed by Lindsay Anderson.It took me a couple of viewings to digest this film- it has familiar elements about life and the hierarchy in boarding schools.The movie starts off very grounded and almost documentary like but things get more surreal as the film progresses-mixing black and white and color and a non pop soundtrack.This movie still packs a punch as we watch the students struggle to conform and watch other students do their best to rebel against a suffocating and regimented life.The DVD has an engaging commentary with Malcolm McDowell and film historian David Robinson.The second disc of the Criterion Collection edition has a 2003 episode of the Scottish TV series Cast and Crew including Stephen Frears(who was the director's assistant),an interview with Graham Crowden,3 essays and an Academy Award winning short film Tuesday's Children(1954) narrated by Richard Burton.The movie still resonates days later and is worth viewing.

		<fullReview>Finally, this is what we all need, a proper movie made with the proper techniques.Set in a public school, it follows several students ( Mainly Mick Travis, played by McDowell ) on how they fit in with the school. Three students, however, do not want to be conformists and follows their exploits of expressing themselves and the consequences of their actions, leading to angry revolution.This is an excellent message, the old society must be crushed to end tyranny, no matter how understanding some of the conformists are. This is anarchy that must be launched, death to oppressors and the sheep who follow them, freedom for the expression of ourselves without facing hurt.This also seems to be satirizing the U.K. The film is very European-like which is a pleasant surprise. No idiotic Hollywood muck to ruin this film or it's messages.Please, watch this movie. It's very worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a what-"IF..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to be one of my favorites. Words do not describe the power of this film to provoke! Naturally, this is what Lindsay Anderson wanted, from us, the viewers. I will try not to repeat BFI's incredible text on this film, it really does nail what the film is about, and how and why it was made. There are so few films that are this pure, and it surely illustrates how unique the 1960s-1970s were for directors and those who wanted to leave their mark with a film like this. One can only hope similar artistic freedoms are waiting around the corner....Of course, the obvious parallel for this film--in-retrospect--would be the Columbine Massacre in Colorado, or even the events at Virginia Tech, but "If...." is a strange bird of a specific English context (though its themes of hierarchy and repression are universal). Nearly every Englishman I have ever met confirms that Anderson basically nailed it, and that this is a pretty close portrayal of the Public schools in Britain (which are anything but, they're private places where the leaders of tomorrow are traumatized into their current behaviors). Again, arbitrary pecking-orders are universal, which explains the wide-acclaim for the film.One could be forgiven in thinking this film is social realism, and in many respects it is. However, there are many scenes where Anderson slips into fantasy--such as the ending--but these are part of cinema, and they are usually thematic. This must have been one of the first British films to deal point-blank with homosexuality in-general, but "If...." is multi-faceted. Like Pasolini, Anderson was gay, and he makes some interesting observations about homosexual behavior (not necessarily homosexuals) that echo Pier Paolo's in "Salo"--that sex can be the inverse of liberation, even with the homosexual variety.Surely, this is an early postmodernist film in its ambiguity towards the rebels lead by Mick Travis (the "Crusaders," led by Malcolm MacDowell) and their oppressors (the "Whips" and the Headmaster, instructors, etc.) in the pecking-order of the boarding-school system. In a regular film, by a regular filmmaker, we the viewers would be prone to invest our loyalties squarely with Mick and his Crusaders. That is, "If...." it were merely a pandering to the radical left of its time, we probably wouldn't be interested in it today at all. There are countless films from that era that did this, and they aren't part of the public mind for a good reason: they were too topical, too much of their time, and they aren't very good. Anderson never cops-out in this film, and offers no simplistic explanations.The title of the film has perplexed a lot of people over the years, but I think it is there to be openly interpreted by the audience. "In the end, they all sign-on," states the protagonist of Derek Jarman's "Jubilee" (1977). Indeed, the ending of "If...." confirms that to violently-rebel (armed only with guns, an iconography and empty-slogans) is to become what one once condemned. It is a Nietzschean parable, rife with existential angst, and so much more. Anderson's "crusaders" are not very different from their tormentors, and, as strange as it may seem, there was a similar uprising at the Tonbridge School in 19th century Kent. Kipling even wrote indirectly of the event, and so the tale is closer to reality than one might think. The real Public school "rebels" went on to become vanguards of the British Empire, underscoring how rebellion is often more than it seems. More often, it's merely a "will-to-power." Thematically--and in his own experiences--the context of "If...." was a subject very-very close to Lindsay Anderson's own life and his heart. Other than Ken Russell and Michael Powell, I cannot imagine a better British director.See it, if you can! dvdbeaver.com has written that the new Criterion edition is likely the best we'll ever see in the digital domain. Note: "If...."(1968), "O Lucky Man!" (1973) and "Britannia Hospital" (1982) are sometimes known as the "Mick Travis Trilogy." This came about because of the collaboration between McDowell and Anderson, and stands as one of the most important series of British films ever made. It should also be noted that Stanley Kubrick hired Malcolm McDowell on the basis of his performance in "If..." for his role as Alex in "A Clockwork Orange" (1971-72, due to a re-release over an initial X-rating). After the student uprisings of May 1968, and the Chicago Democratic National Convention in August, the Tet offensive, the assassinations, the riots, the demonstrations, the division, the December release of this film in that explosive year must have been a real bombshell to Western audiences. Adults should wish to be so scandalized again. A movie can change one's life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An "Art" Film you can't call an "Art" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an amazing film for the first hour. Everything from its cast, the direction, the style of storytelling, it all comes together as a brilliant film. Then, something happens. The mood of the film goes suddenly south, causing the viewer to forget the entire first half of the film.The situation with the black &amp; white footage, the rude "Monty Python" humor that enters the film at such a weird moment that it becomes more Godard like theater than British humor, and the change of style in the acting makes you think John Cassavetes killed the director and took his job. Not including the ending, which many people will enjoy, it ends in a way that makes you throw out all possible reason to believe that the film is "important". Sad to say, the ending is one of the more famous and enjoyable moments in the film. It has remained forgotten from most movie renters throughout the world. If not for Malcom McDowell being in the film, it has no other stronghold to remain on movie shelves in video stores. I recommend watching this one if you are studying to be a film maker or actor. You will appreciate, or that is, you should appreciate its style of story telling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I have strange feelings about this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a peculiar personal significance for me, because I attended the school at which it was filmed (and of which Anderson was an ex-pupil), Cheltenham College. Admittedly I arrived at the school 16 years after the filming of "If...", and the public school system had mellowed dramatically over the intervening years - no corporal punishment administered by staff, let alone prefects - but some aspects were still the same in the mid-80's, such as the military exercises with the Combined Cadet Force.Despite the disappearance of the more barbaric aspects of 1960's public school life, the fundamental function of these schools remains unchanged; to turn out largely identical upper middle-class "gentleman" to become the next generation of lawyers, politicians and other leading members of the British Establishment. The high quality of academic education that can be gained at some of them is purely a means to the ultimate end.I can still remember the enormous pressure to conform, especially in matters of politics and social views, and this is precisely what "If..." satirizes so effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerfully disturbing social commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IF .... takes its title from the Rudyard Kipling poem, often held up by Victorian moralists as an example of the character exemplified by model British men. What we get instead is an indictment of the British public school system and the corruption and perversion bred there and passed on to its pupils. Of course, it's also a black satire of the whole British mode of thinking, one that in many ways looks to the past rather than the future, or so Lindsay Anderson thought in the late sixties. The loose narrative concerns Mick(Malcolm McDowell)a bucker of the English staus quo who flaunts the stuffy conventions of his school. But the film is not about a story so much as it is a series of images: the first day of term, with boys flooding noisily up staircases to their dorms(a scene recreated faithfully in DEAD POET'S SOCIETY); the headmaster's pale, vanilla-pretty wife, exuding repressed sexuality as she wanders naked among the boys' empty beds; the wargames sequence where the boys are learning to kill by out-of-touch old men; Mick being chastened by the headmaster for killing a teacher on the wargames playground, then opening a hugh bureau drawer, from which the teacher in question sits up and accepts a handshake; a priest suppressing an eager smile as a young man confesses "sins of the flesh"; an older boy and his pubescent lover sleeping peacefully together; and the final climax from the roof of the school overlooking the chapel. Bleeeck, you'd think the British public school system was full of nothing but warmongers, sadists, and latent homosexuals. In regard to the last practice(a source of infamy in British boys schools), the homosexual activity is presented as an issue of exploitation of power on the part of older boys over younger ones rather than anything sexual or lust-driven, with the exception of one case in which a younger boy has a yen for an older one. Still, it must have caused a scandal among those purveyors of tradition who still staunchly insisted that such institutions bred character rather than corruption. Anderson's version of the high traditions of public education looks like a nightmare. And after watching this fever dream of a movie, one is inclined to agree.</fullReview>

I thought at the beginning, it just made me bored straight away because there's pretty much no action. Its just like a typical all-lads boarding school which involves a strict timetable and strict teachers. I felt they should've developed McDowell's character more because he didn't seem to be confident in being a bad boy. Although in the end, he brought a gun to the school but i could be wrong. Ysee, i only watched 30 minutes of this film so I didn't bother finding out the end until i looked at the photos on IMDb.

		<fullReview>This ambitious (if a little pretentious) film is among the most interesting and intelligent in the history of British cinema. Certainly many of its themes: the casual cruelty meted out to boys (still an unspoken reality of society) and the need to rebel against stuffy and oppressive institutions are very powerfully depicted here, as powerful as have ever been committed to celluloid.Sometimes I feel that just too much has been crammed into the film and many narrative strands are not very well developed. A new boy is introduced at the start but his story is jettisoned in favour of a good looking boy who is fuelling everybody's (apparently) sexual fantasies. Even worse is the case of the new master introduced at the same time, and presumably to counterbalance, the new boy. His story fizzles out almost immediately.The female love interest of Malcolm Macdowell is rather superficially written, almost as if the writers felt the need to insert a girl into what otherwise would be all almost entirely male film (the other female characters are of no consequence).The once famous use of cutting between colour and black and white wears thin. It use seems entirely arbitrary.Despite this, If remains a powerful film with many memorable scenes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece which in spite of itself has survived the test of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film aged about 16 or 17 on television in a packed room at my school which was not unlike the one satirised by it. I initially hated the ending and despised the character of Travis. With not a little adolescent self-loathing, and being at the time infatuated with a boy of Bobby Phillips's age who exuded a similar aura of gorgeousness, I saw myself in Denson, the bigoted pro-establishment whip licking the foam from his lips as he gazes longingly at the young boy who is shaving him.Beatings by prefects had been abolished shortly before I arrived, our dress and customs were not quite so formal and there was a rather less pro-establishment feel, yet the film caught the essence of that type of school like no other. However I didn't come away fuelled with hatred for the established order as Anderson no doubt wanted; my only acts of rebellion after seeing the film were to buy a shaving brush and a dress shirt with a wing collar several years before they had come back in fashion. Instead I wished I had been there. The school's hellish oppressiveness and vulgarity had only served to heighten for me the love between Wallace and Phillips, so briefly hinted at, which seemed to me then the most beautiful thing in the world. Of course more recent films have, in very different styles and settings, covered this territory much more thoroughly, especially the wonderful F**king Amal.Watching the film again some thirty five years later many feelings were the same, but this time I was utterly charmed by McDowell's performance as Travis and I found much more humour. The revolutionary plot instead of feeling threatening now seemed rather childish, no longer a call to arms in the real world but rather a violent fantasy as a metaphor for the inner conflict of adolescence. This ambiguity (intended or not), the charm, the humour and the razor sharp satire of a lost, crueler yet in many ways more innocent world make this a lasting masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IF? is a film that penetrates the surface of student life at an English boarding school. Stout with tradition, the College House's rules are strict but simple: "work, play ? but don't mix the two". While the younger pupils are primarily concerned with conformity, the film's narrative focuses on a small group of older students who's thoughts are more inclined towards existentialism and rebellion. Their "when do we live, that's what I want to know" attitudes are confronted by a pompous group of "whips", who's use of discipline is justified "for the good of the country".This slowly engrossing film has a distinct English feel as it poses the topics of authority, tradition, conformity, individualism, and rebellion. Indicative of the late 60's, IF? is now a powerful retrospective - yet this bold production and it's revolutionary vision remain relevant in today's society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By far Lindsay Anderson's most popular film and one could argue deservedly so (though I personally like all his films other than the sad finale to the Mick Travis trilogy, "Britannia Hospital"), "If..." is an unforgettable, powerful rebel yell which I believe to be allegorical in nature but works perfectly fine if taken literally. Superb acting from the entire cast but particularly Malcolm McDowell in the lead, stylish direction and good photography, with a sly, effective screenplay which reveals more about its nature as the film moves on. For a film often accused of being very dated and 'of its time', a DVD-projected theater screening for twenty or so Canadian youth who had never seen the film before and knew nothing of public schools seemed to go extraordinarily well. The film doesn't seem to have lost any of its power to provoke or surprise.When do we live? That's what I want to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favorite films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, as a longtime fan of this movie and the "Mick Travis" series (continued with Anderson's "O Lucky Man!" and "Britannia Hospital"), we can all be glad that it's finally out on DVD and it's a very nice presentation.If you're reading this hoping for a recommendation, just stop reading and watch it, then come back. Not everyone is going to enjoy it, but nothing that anyone can say will adequately describe such a purely cinematic film. Its cinematic excellence is all the more impressive when you consider that Lindsay Anderson is mostly a theater director. One of the most striking things about the movie is the intensely realistic style of the beginning, which almost makes you feel like you actually attended a British boarding school. But then the film at a certain point goes into a satiric direction, at which point the cinematic style also becomes very surreal. In my opinion that isn't a clash or a lack of proportion, it's actually a cinematic depiction of a certain dialectic or progression that Anderson is trying to address in the film. Basically I think the film is saying that if you pile realism upon realism, eventually what you will end up with is something surreal. For example, this is almost literally depicted in the Colonel's speech close to the very end. At first he's giving the speech, and you hear a few coughs in the audience which doesn't really disturb us, it just seems like a realistic touch because anytime you see someone give a speech a few people will cough, although you rarely hear it in a movie. But then gradually we start to hear more and more coughing, and we see smoke rising up from below the stage. At this point everything becomes very chaotic and panic sets in. The whole process of the movie is basically like this. The very same "realistic" elements that we accept in the early scenes for documentary value become by way of repetition so thoroughly absurd that the surreal style of the last 1/3 of the movie is an appropriate way to depict the truth of what we've been experiencing.That's also why I've never been able to fully believe that the movie is mixed black and white with color just for economic reasons, which a lot of people claim. Even if literally true, most directors would just cut a few scenes out and finish the film in color. Anderson is the type of true genius who uses it instead as a strength. There's no clear dichotomy between why a particular scene should be in color while this other is in black and white, but the device does make the audience wonder and think about whether it could be for some particular reason while they're watching it, which engages them on a deeper level. Also switching back and forth brings out the beauty of both the black and white and the color process. The whole movie could have been color or it could have been black and white, but halfway through it our eyes would adjust to the scheme and we'd start getting lazy. This technique has the effect of constantly drawing our attention to the details in the film and the beauty of the film as literal representation of photographic detail.Malcolm McDowell was cast in "A Clockwork Orange" based on his performance in this movie, and you can see why. But this performance has many more different dimensions to it than his work for Kubrick. Here he sometimes sulks, he sometimes is exultant with the pure physical joys of life, he sometimes wonders about the larger significance of things (as when he views another student's telescope) and he sometimes is insolent and angry. It's remarkable how he's able to hold it all together. The rest of the cast, mostly Anderson regulars who also worked with him in the theater, hold up their parts of the film very well also. In particular I enjoy the homosexual relationship between Richard Warwick and Rupert Webster. The scene in the gymnasium is a stunning display of editing and photographic beauty. The whole thing is handled in a non-sensationalist way that directly contrasts with the "homosexual flirtation" between the "whips" and the "scum" which is really nothing but an expression of their sexual repression.The ending, indeed the entire film, can be easily misconstrued if one watches it strictly as drama. It's not holding up Travis as a hero or even saying his actions are justified. You could compare it to the apocalypse at the end of "Dr. Strangelove", but Lindsay Anderson seems to have more respect for human emotion in and of itself than Kubrick does. It's not satirizing just our institutions, but the way that we as individuals give ourselves wholly over to them, so that even the "rebels" end up caught in institutionalized patterns of punishment and reward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lyndsey Anderson's "If..." is one of those memorable movies concerning which I can't fully describe why I loved it. There isn't really that much of a plot, at least not for a 100-minute movie, and yet the photography, the impeccable acting, the interesting and occasionally weird dialogue, the brilliant casting, the great soundtrack (incl. "Missa Luba", to the unaware), and the strange goings-on, all combine to form something that isn't comparable to anything in the history of film. The film was controversial when it came out due to its violent - and surprise - ending, but this big finale is not the main reason to watch this movie. Malcolm McDowell's fans should by no means skip this film, or Anderson's follow-up to this, his quasi-sequel called "O, Lucky Man!" which is just as good.Btw, there was much discussion regarding the black-&amp;-white scenes. The simple truth is that Anderson for technical reasons had to shoot some scene that way. Sorry to disappoint all you pretentious movie reviewers: there was nothing "deep" about the colour-to-b&amp;w transitions i.e. no hidden meanings to endlessly debate about!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True to life - my old school</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great movie which I have seen many times over the last 30+ years. It's portrayal of English private school life is pretty close to the truth - the sadism and the bullying was for real. Of course we didn't actually mow down the school staff etc on the day of the big Cadet Force parade - but the option was there, we did have a parade just like the one portrayed in the film. The film is very close to home for me as I actually went to the school (won't say which one) which was used for the exterior (and many of the interior) shots. Actually seeing fictional events happening in locations where you lived and worked for 6 years as a student is spooky. Pity it came out in 1973, in 1963 it might have given us a few pointers!!! - despite the privilege and money inherent in that school system we were a bolshy lot and were always planning 'the revolution'. Of course it would never have worked - after 500 years the 'system' knew exactly how to protect itself. In that respect the film's outcome is not believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange and fragmentaric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not so much a movie as it is a series of very loosely connected scenes that only have in common that they all take place at a boarding school. Hardly anthing is ever explained (what's with the girl?), and some of the scenes in this movie are completely weird, but hilarious. For example: During one scene, the head master (or something) opens a large drawer from which the chaplain appears...what was he doing in that drawer?? It makes no sense whatsoever, but it was probably meant to make no sense anyway. It's very clear, however that the boarding school is NOT a very nice place to be (illustrated by some hilarious scenes), and this gradually drives a couple of students "over the edge". Overall, it's hard to say whether this is a good movie. It is clear that the movie wants to convey a message, but it does so through a series of hardly connected scenes instead of through a coherent story. The movie can be very funny, but usually because it's so very strange. I'd say, see this movie for yourself, I think it's worth it but don't expect a masterpiece.For once, I'm not going to give this one a star rating..I really have no idea what I would have to give it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall, this movie was fairly good. It was a little slow -- don't expect much to happen for the first hour or so. It might be best viewed on a rainy Sunday afternoon, to accentuate the feeling of being in a boarding school in rural England. There were a few memorable scenes which were rather bizarre and very 1960s (I won't give them away here). Might be good to watch this one along with Pink Floyd's The Wall, or the Australian 'Picture at Hanging Rock'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in high school when this film was released. It hit my friends and myself like a bomb. For comment, I have little to add to the many which I have read here. Except to say, little mention has been given to the soundtrack, variations on something called the "Missa Luba" (I think that was the name), sung by a children's choir, quite haunting and a foreboding backdrop for the events portrayed.Also, some of the images were extremely striking. The motorcycle scene was just lyrical; I bought a cycle the next year, in large part because of this single romantic image.The final battle scenes are unforgettable. In the post-columbine era, that episode seems more threatening than it did 30 years ago. Nevertheless, I can easily close my eyes and visualize the machine gun toting grandmother, shouting "bahstahds!" in between bursts. Taken together with the sequel "Oh Lucky Man", an argument can be made that this is one of the great satires of the 20th century cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anarchy in the UK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anderson's chaotic blend of anarchic humour was never so striking as in this highly satirised account of life within the English public school system. Of course the school is merely a symbol of the film's real target for ridicule; any society that imposes restrictions and boundaries and attempts to silence individualism and creativity. It achieves this by rendering the school's tradions and ceremonies as ridiculous.MacDowell plays hero, Travis, a rebellious senior boy we first meet wrapped in black hat and cloak immediately creating a mysterious aura about him. The prefects see him and his two associates as a serious threat to order. This culminates in a memorable scene (in a film with many), a cleverly filmed caning of the boys. We do not see the first two boys get their punishment but we hear them whilst witnessing the reaction of those tensely awaiting their own fate. It isn't until Travis goes in that the camera follows into the gymnasium where the caning is being administered. After the three initial blows, which was the extent of the previous boys castigation, Travis picks up his blazer to leave only to be told to stay put. He is beaten again and again by the head prefect, through each blow the camera slowly takes us through the school witnessing the pupils who somehow seem to share the cruel punishment. Despite the beatings Travis comes away with dignity, looking the enemy in the eye and even shaking hands with him.The shackles put upon the pupils are illustrated by the freedom they can only enjoy and experience in the world outside. Travis experiences a raucous sexual encounter with a young waitress in a cafe before riding with her on a motor-bike across a field with arms spread looking like a bird released. The traditions are eventually exposed in two marvelous scenes of rebellion. Firstly Travis and his cronies disrespect for a military drill culminates in reducing the school parson to a whimpering wreck, after he had been acting the noble general of war. Secondly one of cinema's most memorable endings where the pupils open fire on parents, teachers and ex-soldiers (all symbolising the establishment).Much was made of the stylistic significance of the film's occasional lapses into black and white. However, Anderson admitted this was merely due to funding shortages. Full of comic touches such as a "Monty-Pythonesque" moment where the wounded parson is pulled out of a draw (in fact the film does remind one of the 'Growth and Learning' segment in 'Monty Python's Meaning of Life" made in 1983). Above all the film captures the mood of the time where student revolts were common place and people fought for freedom and expression.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surreal and artful masterwork of rebellious British students</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite flicks of all time. This is maybe the archetypical alienated, surreal, rebellious British youth film of the 1960's. The film starts so quiet and boring. Annoyingly so. Then it hypnotizes you in stages, each with a chapter title. The last chapter 'Crusaders..' which should have been the title of the film, will wake you up with the stiff realization of what is at the core of quiet, well adjusted society. This film is logically coherent, yet psychologically confusing, and offers no truths. The viewer is left to realize their own truth somehow, and that is one of the surprising qualities of the film. The foundations of the status quo are so in doubt here that the quiet incidental scenes are the most disturbing and beautiful of all, merely because of what the VIEWER may read into them. The characters are seductive, and that is dangerous in this case. I am still looking for the soundtrack, if it was ever released. The scenes seem to be ritualistic, mysterious and metaphorical- things not easily projected onto the stiff, starched, 'proper' society of it's setting. All these elements combine into a stylized, surreal esthetic that makes the dialogue seem almost redundant. This is the true genius of the film to me, it's something that really transcends words. It's a feeling, a mood or atmosphere created in the film that communicates more powerfully than words that self-identity may lead to orgasmic revolution. It is this complex philosophical style that is so profound and wondrous to me about this film, and the creators probably had no idea what they were doing. They probably were simply drawing on their own authentic environment and context.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson's "if...." is a tour de force of British Cinema, a classic representation of the great films coming out of Britain in the late sixties("Blow Up", is another film that comes to mind and also a definite watch). The film is set in a British boarding school and concerns the exploits of three seniors who fail to conform to the strict rules placed upon them by the school, and society itself. A young Malcolm McDowell plays Mick Travis, the leader of the three rebels, giving probably the best performance of his career. Lindsay Anderson's direction is just plain amazing. He sets the tone of the stifling pressure that penetrates through College House and plots the movie like a time bomb; the audience feels the pressure bubbling throughout the 110 minute film up until its penetrating ending. The film is simultaneously filmed in color and black and white creating an environment that is real and unreal at times. Travis and his co-horts are free-thinkers to the core and definitely give a fair representation of the youth revolution that was spreading in England during the 60's. I have probably watched this movie a dozen times and I have never grown tired or bored of it. I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"If...." is a true rebellious movie, in which Malcolm McDowell and his close friends are kicking against the established system and customs, 3 years before he would be doing the same in "A Clockwork Orange", which does definitely shows some parallels with this movie.It's about the clash of new versus old really. The grown ups versus todays youth, old customs versus modern progress. In that regard this movie also really doesn't feel all that outdated. These are themes that are of all times and ages really. It's what keeps the world going and helps moving it forward, for better or for worse.You shouldn't take this movie very literally. Most of the movie its sequences can be seen as having a deeper and symbolic meaning to them. I won't pretend like I understood everything this movie was trying to do and say but let me make clear that the movie at all time still remains a perfectly accessible one, no matter how odd and symbolic things might seem, which especially gets the case more toward its ending.It's simply because "If...." is such a compelling watch. You get sucked in by the movie its visual style and slow way of storytelling, that sets things up very nicely. It helps to make the characters some really great ones as well, most notably of course the Malcolm McDowell one, who is a true, classic rebel, who's fed up with the current system and decides to stand up against it, on his very own rebellious sort of way.It's actually surprising this movie got directed by a woman. Surprising, since this is a movie that is clearly set in a 'man's world'. It's set at a boy's only, old, English, established private school. The sort of place that is being very strict about the rules and makes sure everyone knows about them and keeps to it, as well as knowing the importance of the, quite literally, ancient traditions. It really is a well crafted movie, that gets its point across but above all things is a really great and compelling one, that you just need to keep watching, even if you don't fully understand what its trying to say.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So that's why the Brits are such bullies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being of English descendancy, and a Mayflower descendant at that, I'm always intrigued by my brethren on the island. My daughter did her Jr. Year in Shakespearian Studies at York and have worked in Farham, so I'm a wee bit familiar. I asked her once why the English have no nicknames, such as 'Mick', 'Guinea','Wop', 'Kraut', 'Towel-Head' and the horrible N word. She said, "They do, Mom. It's 'Bully'." This movie shows you why. And the brainwashing those kids go through also shows you strangely enough, why they won so many wars. Certainly not through intelligence, but through this 'Obey the boss' mentality. The sight of those pseudo-battles those kids were taking part in, even the cerebral star-gazer, made you want to vomit. HOw could such 'civilized' people behave in such a barbaric manner?I should know, being from Birmingham, Al. NOw in Boston, I was once asked, "Don't you miss the courteousness, the hospitality of the South?" I answered, "If you look closely, you'll find it's color-coded. And after that, it's 'Anything Different From Me', so if you're Catholic, or hippie, that courtesy disappears fast. I'll take the equal opportunity rudeness of these Yankees any day." The rigid class structure is seen right from the beginning, even by the faculty. How the rebellious, bicycle-riding prof gets away with his idiosyncrasies, and on top of that, is teaching the boys to think, is incongruous. His little dissertation on the 1st World War, with the Kaiser's excuse that he can't stop the war because of the damage it would do to the train schedules, followed by, "Perhaps it was caused by you and me. Write a 20 minute essay on that, without notes." Although where those kids were going to get notes or Google up the effect of the middle-class English on WWI is beyond me. I saw it twice, 2nd time with the commentary from Malcolm McDowell and a reviewer, and it seems obvious that they didn't think much good would come from the public viewing, since it savages the very values that the public schools are supposed to teach. Every now and then honesty DOES attract. I also find it fascinating that no suicides were featured, since I would think that would be SOP for such horrid places. My grandson's middle-school featured its own 'twirling' while he was there a few years ago, with the kid thrust into the toilet by a gang of hoodlums. Except the hoodlums in this movie are all upper class Brits, from families that are putting out a huge amount of money to send them here to be brutalized.That abused young man is now a college senior and I would love to find out what effect that act had on him, but doubt that I'll ever find out. Great movie, and it explains a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tragically underrated satire about the life of a public schoolboy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first of three films about the charming but often Naive Mick Travis.(The other two being "O' Lucky Man" and "Britannia Hospital". The film questions the "elite" reputation of public schoolboys in Britain and the method in which they are not just educated, but ultimately prepared for their later life (top ranking universities and executive jobs). The film stars Malcolm McDowell, in one of his earliest screen roles, as Mick Travis. A role which would later inspire Kubrick to cast McDowell for his infamous 1972 classic "A Clockwork Orange". Travis' attitude to his schooling parallels that of the 1960s counterculture movement. Scenes regularly switch to visions in a manic fashion and the film gained notoriety for being the first motion picture to depict full frontal nudity of both sexes.All in all, Lindsay Anderson's 1968 classic does leave room for debate over the ethics of private, and in particular public, schools. Watch this film for the teenage rebel, anti-establishment anti-hero inside you. 9/10 (High praise indeed)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>about Britain, and a cork of anarchy ready to burst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In If... we get a view of British society wrapped up inside of a British boys school, and it's something indicative of the time period it was set (on the cusp of the counter-culture's significance on and in society), but it's also about the way that society crushes any who do the slightest bucking of the system. It's interesting to see this so immediately after another once-considered notorious Malcolm MacDowell starring movie: Clockwork Orange. While Mick Travis and Alexander DeLarge couldn't be further apart in how they respond to the world around them (one is a misanthrope who is building up to mass murder, another enjoys his sadism), they're posited in societies that can't wait to crush the hell out of them. But then again, that is where the comparison should end: Kubrick's realm was wild satire, and for Lindsay Anderson If... is set in a very real world, naturalistic and proudly for adults - and then it goes into surrealist beats and the harrowing underbelly of youth peeks its head every so often.This is not always a film concerned with plot, and this may turn off some viewers (some have just called it outright 'dull'). But I think that one has to stick with what Anderson's really going for here, which is a portrayal of a state of mind. While the film is an ensemble of actors, it's really focused on Travis and his fellow students. It's not the only reason but it is a crucial one as to Anderson's use of the constant switch between black and white and color film. The use is not entirely random (watch, for example, the scene where Mick and his friends are fencing and watch how carefully it switches stock between two rooms), and has something to do with this young mind-set, and of revolt against the natural order. One may question why Anderson chooses this technique just as one questions why Travis and his pals are so set in their revolutionary thinking.We don't know the characters very well past, so their development in the film has an ambiguity that is alarming. If one didn't even know what comes at the end (the video cover sort of gives it away) then lines that just spell trouble, like "There's no such thing as a wrong war. Violence and revolution are the only pure acts." We see how easily, it would seem, that the authority figures at school do their very best to maintain order- first with the constant checks of the rooms and goings-on, and then up to the whipping of Travis and his friends, just to make a point for everyone else in the school to hear. There's a choice to be made in If... and it's not an easy one: do you go with the status quo, or do you buck up against it? Or do you do nothing really at all, and play soldier with all of the others on 'army day' with the fake bullets? This is an "art" movie to an extent, but its pretensions make it far from unwatchable. On the contrary If... is a beautiful-looking movie, set against a centuries-old school and cast with professional and non-professional actors, and by the end it gets you thinking about what your school situation was like (even if, invariably, it was not at a British all-boys school during the 1960s) and when one may have been a wayward youth. Surely the film is of its time- it's hard to see it being released in the years post-Columbine massacre- but it doesn't mean that it's too dated to enjoy as thought-provocation and as a youth drama. It's about the not-so-logical progression of revolution in an upper-middle class setting, and its implications are spot-on and terrifying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Lindsay Anderson, a prime mover of British New Wave Cinema, from a scalding script by ex-public schoolboy David Sherwin, If.... proves to be something of a universal fantasy. An anarchic trio of disgruntled public schoolboys (McDowell, Wood and Warwick) - plus one girlfriend (Noonan) and a younger pupil (Webster) - rebel against their brutal establishment peers, before literally blasting their way through staff and sixth formers.Here, the school (actually Cheltenham College), with its chapel and firing range, serves as a metaphor for an archaic, conservative Britain. Fittingly (although the director always denied this was deliberate) the film does appear to echo political uprisings taking place the year it was made, in Paris, Prague, and the US.Sporting less of a plot than a series of crazily inventive, titled vignettes (comparable to those from Jean Vigo's 1933 film Zero De Conduite, which partly inspired the filmmakers), If.... blends English surrealism with a near-documentary style realism to astonishing effect. The use of monochrome cut into what is essentially a colour film is both a result of budget limitations, and a device to shock the complacent viewer. Anderson believed there should be no aesthetic distinction between fantasy and reality.If.... was also Malcolm McDowell's feature debut. His portrayal of the rebellious Mick Travis (wearing an expression somewhere between Archangel and Antichrist) was almost a dry run for his Alex DeLarge in Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange three years later. McDowell also considers it his "finest film." He may be right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you love Clockwork Orange or you are a fan of the baby faced star then you need to see If?. Before Malcom McDowell was the badboy for Kubrick he was Mick Travis in this revolution on the British private school (in the U.K. it is public). Mick tends to bring about the stark truth behind the public school life. It's difficult to defend the school life told by this realistic telling of the familiar life lead by students in 1960s Britain. Directed by India born and award winning Lindsay Anderson, the film is full of true pop culture of the day from issues of hair to violent rebellion.The film has not lost its vigor over the years or perhaps British culture is still one step ahead of the U.S. when it comes to rebellion. The story and the script are smartly written. There are some interesting directorial choices when it comes to some of the sequences. Until recently I thought that the use of black and white film (the majority of the film is in color) was used as an artistic choice, but I have learned it was used to save money. This would not be the first time director Anderson would work with McDowell but it is our first introduction to McDowell since this is his first film. ***/****.As for the posters, classic 1960s design. Its not hard to see why later when it came to Clockwork that Kubrick did not want to use any images of McDowell. Both early styles of poster have a terrific look with bold statements and economical choices, though the movie had some level of success. Some of the later release time frame and international distribution has more color and even more artistic flare.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson's 'If...' is a lightly visceral, fantastically enjoyable insight into the dehumanising state that the English private school was around the 60s. The film features the premiere of the acting career of Malcolm McDowell who would later star in Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 'A Clockwork Orange'.The film is about three rebels spurring on a revolution against the teachers.Anderson's film is such a well-rounded film, it covers the deep psychology these students go through. It references the idea of temptation, totalitarianism, rebellion and cruelty. But is this cruelty justified?, will this huge amount of discipline be beneficial to the students on the long run? This is what this film is about and the light hearted head-teacher is the mediator of this perplexing issue. He tries to understand these rebels but he is so far off.Primal instincts are another major issue in this film. The boys are deprived from female warmth and attention to almost insanity. This is epitomised in the fascinating scene where Travis (McDowell) first has a sexual encounter with a woman in a coffee shop. They square off like tigers as Travis releases his innate sexual tension. Yet this isn't real, this scene is fantasy and it makes me wonder to what extent this is a fantasy, and this is for the audience to understand.Anderson's direction was marvellous, the cinematography was fanatical. The ending was amazingly surreal and left me reeling. There was also the great irony at the end in that, the general preaching the importance of discipline in the promotion of peace, then a all out war breaks out! If... is a stunning insight into the issues of power and discipline in the education system and makes me wonder whether the old education system is better than todays. Anderson doesn't seem to think it is! 8.5/10 A very good achievement</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not all the lunatics are on the inside looking out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Malcolm McDowell makes his screen debut as a perennial bad boy in this send-up of British boarding schools. Like "A Clockwork Orange" that would make him famous, this involves his character's misadventures with his partners in crime in which the coldness, cruelty, and perversion of this peculiarly British institution is resisted.I enjoyed the film although it feels a bit like a guilty pleasure. I am not sure whose side I am on with this one. Perhaps that is the greatness inherent in this film, that one sympathizes and at the same time is horrified by the antics of these young men. Being a teacher in an American high school, I suspect that the collective education of young people requires a lot of control and supervision. On the other hand it seems inevitable that this control takes on the nature of prisons and lunatic asylums. And as with prisons and lunatic asylums, not all the lunatics and criminals are on the inside looking out.As with "A Clockwork Orange" it is a black comedy that says as much about the individual as with the society in which he lives. As the film progresses the world of the students passes farther and farther into surrealism. The final interview with the dean is weirdly accurate in its portrayal of school administrators, and the Alice in Wonderland quality of that interview is brilliantly demonstrated by the Chaplain who emerges from a drawer to shake hands and accept an apology. The mild "punishment" imposed by the Dean in the next to last misadventure, as well as the brutality of the cold showers and corporal punishments of the previous episodes were both wrong.The Columbine High School-like episode at the end of the film was both prescient and seemed like a bit of fictional desperation. Indeed how does such a story end? A more expected "punishment" would have been to send them all to jail for their next to last escapade if not for retail theft in the one before that. However in many ways the whole process of growing up is a matter of coming to terms with one's inner anarchy or (in the case of the characters led by McDowell's characters) not coming to terms with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Angry young men at an establishment school</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that came out of the sixties and tells us much about the temper of the times. It turns tradition, conformity and going along with authority upside down. The proper British school in this movie is a smug, class-conscious institution that deals harshly with the students who happen to find themselves there. What they are doing is being made into puppets of the old order who don't question authority and in the process are molded into pliable players on the social stage. There is much cruelty and bullying behind the facade of tradition, order and self-congratulation. This is tolerated as part of the process of making boys into men... or at least the kind of men they want to deliver to the outside world. We also hear rather hollow reminders that they are privileged and need to render service to the world in exchange for their privileged status. Little room for revolution here or so the authorities think or that there might be an "angry young man" in the crowd, who can only be pushed so far. Malcolm McDowell is the pivotal figure in this movie and he is an upper-class successor to the other angry young men portrayed in early sixties movies, who came from blue collar backgrounds. Lindsey Anderson directed the movie and Malcolm McDowell became the leading actor in this first of a trilogy he made with the same director. The movie also opened a door for him to star in Clockwork Orange.</fullReview>

I remember reading in either the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal about accident victims and ambulances being turned away from hospitals in England by strikers) are both available on DVD, BUT NOT "If..."

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting schooling tale, the film is nevertheless often typical of its sort, but it is competently made in all areas and it tosses around interesting ideas, such as rebellion, homoeroticism and the ranks that exist between individual students. It is rather stylishly assembled, with certain sections filmed in black and white, but it does have a bit a lagging and meandering nature, and some the sequences are hard to find meaning in. But what the film does well, it does excellently, and the cast is headed well by Malcolm McDowell in the performance that earned him the lead in 'A Clockwork Orange'. Anderson and Sherwin teamed up again in 1973 to film 'O Lucky Man!', which would chronicle the further adventures of McDowell's character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a fantastic little British film, directed by the late great Lindsay Anderson. This stars Malcolm McDowell(who will later go on to A Clockwork Orange fame) who plays Mick Travis, a young man in school (high school?). Mick Travis is unsatisfied with the tyrany of the teachers that takes place in his school, as are his friends. Mick decides to lead a rebellion against his private school with his friends and a girl he meets at a coffee shop. The film randomly switches from black and white and color, the results are great. The film has a lot of truly bizarre things going on during the film, such as (**SPOILERS**)Why is the guy in the drawer? Why did the girl suddenly want to have sex with Mick after she slapped him? And did that sex scene actually happen? Why was there a fetus under the stage in the cabinet? Why did they focus on the boy in the gym as he watched on of Mick's friends perform acrobatics?These questions may not be answered, though there are plenty more, the movie still is great, to bad there's no DVD yet. The film was originally rated X probably for the nudity(not that much though) of the girl and some naked pictures and male students. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb and Chilling Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a definite classic. The story takes place in the strict, male-only, public school College House, a place where the pupils are kept under control by ridiculous traditions, iron-bound rules governing every aspect of their lives and petty cruelties and humiliations. The film focuses on a group of unruly senior boys, lead by Mick Travis (Malcolm McDowell) who refuse to conform. The film is funny, surreal and violent. The acting by everyone is great. Especially McDowell as the charismatic but terrifying rebel. The main flaw of the film is that it is very much a product of it's time and place and it is starting to seem quite dated, but it is still relevant. It's about the struggle between freedom and authority, and, especially in the Britain of it's time, about the struggle between the old and the new.In fact, in light of some more recent events, certain elements of the film, seem more relevant than ever.McDowell reprised his role in two sequels, "O Lucky Man!" and "Britannia Hospital", which also deserve your attention. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beauty of Lindsay Anderson's IF.... is the director's ability to juxtapose realistic elements with the fantastic so gently that the audience finds itself questioning what it just saw. Set in the oppressive world of an all-boys school in 1960s great Britain, the film's three protagonists--led by mischievous Malcolm McDowell--escape from the fascist techniques of the schools prefects by departing into wild fantasies. The confusing thing is, Anderson gives us no cues as to when reality has ended and fantasy has begun.It is tempting, on first viewing, to assume that all fantasy sequences are in black-and-white; however, numerous sequences that are clearly grounded in reality often become desaturated as they develop. Likewise, many fantasy sequences will often begin in color, lose all color midway, and regain color before returning to the realistic world of the school. Anderson doesn't want us to see these fantasy sequences as seperate from reality, but rather gives us a window into this world via the imaginations of our three Crusader heroes.To this day many images stay with me: Mick Travis (McDowell) making violent, animalistic love to his Fantasy Girl (Christine Noonan) on a coffee house floor; Mick later spying The Girl across town via a high-powered telescope and watching as she waves at him; Mick's enranged murder of the school Chaplain and subsequent apology to the Chaplain for his actions (the Chaplain turns out to be very much alive and sleeping in a massive drawer in the headmaster's office); and of course the violent, Columbine-esque conclusion in which Mick and his mates join forces with the Fantasy Girl and attack the school with automatic weapons.While slow and deliberate, the story never lags for those willing to give it their attention. Good fun for troubled, outcast college students.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lindsay Anderson pulls out all the stops as this vicious mise en scene remains more pungent than either O Lucky Man or Britannia Hospital. MacDowell is at his snarling best with a restrained performance, far more telling than his little Alex in Clockwork Orange. The regular cast are all Anderson's usual suspects and not a single role is out of true with the film's skewed alignment. Radicals of the sixties and seventies used to talk of the Establishment, but who are they ? This film shows the inculcation of their values and the essential tawdriness of the alternatives available to those who cannot subscribe to the sterile comforts they espouse. I think that, sadly, this film is badly appreciated in the US as a result of its entire presentation within a recognisably British idiom. Even the colour/B-W debate issuing forth from the ill-informed artistic circles in the States reveals this, as a previous reviewer has said all that need be said on the subject. See it! Then put on "Who's Next" and the quandaries of a society coping with a decaying Empire in reality and the strains of new ideas will become apparent. This film, indeed this review, suffers from over-analysis. Take it as a whole and digest at your leisure later. I still return to it once every three months or so.....</fullReview>

The film plays to the outcast loner in all of us, and I have met few people who have not enjoyed it. Nevertheless, the film deals (or it seems to me to deal) with the imagination reaching for expression in a stifling environment. Each of the three main characters participates in a fantasy, but director Lindsay Anderson never alerts his audience with the customary visual cues. Rather, we find fantasy and reality overlapping to the point of surrealism, and only through successive viewings does the film's near-perfect structure become apparent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was a smash hit in the U.K., but also came under critical fire. Most contemporary critics immediately tried to tie it to the massive student protests that swept through Europe that year, but the single-minded violence of Mick and his acolytes really is at odds with that movement. Later critics tried to portray the film as a precursor to the Columbine shootings, in America, as well as similar 'going postal' incidents. Yet, those comparisons failed, too, because Mick's anger is not of the 'take all of the bastards with us' sort, but purposely directed at removing an evil blight- one of his mottoes being: One man can change the world with a bullet in the right place. As na?ve an opinion as that is, at least his acts are political acts, albeit different from his real world contemporaries on college campuses, and directed at no one person nor party, just the oppressive cosmos, whereas the Columbine killers were just psychotics and psychopaths. Of course, that critics continually missed the boat on this film should come as no surprise since most of them regurgitated the meme that the film was somehow surreal. While the film does stretch reality, and occasionally blend fantasy with realism, that is not what surrealism is. Surrealism is when there is a break with reality that is unforeseen, and seemingly beyond reality. There are scenes in films by Federico Fellini that involve moments- like a horse that appears where it should not be, and in others' films, that are surreal, but fantasy alone is not surrealism. There needs to be an initial seeming randomness that, after the fact, seems less random, something that invokes John Keats' Negative Capability. Nothing like that occurs in this film, nor are there any real 'poetic' moments. This film, despite some great moments, is always prosaic- in the best sense.I mention this because, in the two disk set, by The Criterion Collection, on the commentary track by Malcolm McDowell and film historian David Robinson, both claim director Anderson a poet of cinema. This is generally just a platitude that such moments accord, but it is nonetheless wrong. Filmmakers like Stanley Kubrick, Terrence Malick, Ingmar Bergman, Theo Angelopolus, Bela Tarr, and Andrei Tarkovsky, etc., are poets with a camera. Anderson is not. But that does not mean this is not a good film; just not one filled with poesy. That commentary for the film comes on Disk One. Disk Two has features such as a 2003 episode of the Scotch television show Cast And Crew, which reunites McDowell with the film's cast and crew (save for the deceased Anderson), and interview with one of the minor actors from the film, and an Oscar-winning 1954 documentary by Anderson, called Thursday's Children, about a school for deaf children. Before he made feature films, Anderson was a documentarian. The film runs about 110 minutes and is shown in a 1.66:1 aspect ratio.While the film's visuals, by cinematographer Miloslav Ondricek, and editing are solid, it is the lack of contemporary and non-diegetic music that make the biggest impact. So much of what McDowell conveys through his character is enhanced by the fact that it is character-driven, not manipulated via music. Along with some of the great films by Robert Bresson and Yasujiro Ozu, this film is one of the best arguments against scoring films. In fact, the only music in the film, diegetic or not, is an Africanized Latin mass called Missa Luba. While the screenplay, by David Sherwin, has its moments, the thing that most keeps the film from approaching greatness is that it is simply too one dimensional. While we get dimensions of Mick Taylor's persona, that's about it. All the whips, adults, and younger boys- even the nameless waitress, are little more than props to tell Mick's tale, and, while Mick has some moments, they are good pearls on a rather tattered string. The same could be said, in fact, for all the episodes in this picaresque film. Like so many other films that are hailed as masterpieces, If.... is not one. But it is a good film, and, perhaps one of those rare instances when it is something even better than a good film, it is an interesting film, warts and all- from its extended anomies to its over the top depictions of British youth. Its title is often claimed as deriving from the similarly titled poem by Rudyard Kipling, but Anderson never made such a claim, and the title (four dot ellipsis and all- gotta love that!) more likely refers to the film as a hope of some sort, a desideratum, if not of the filmmaker, then his lead character. In fact, the film could very well be a daydream of Mick's, much like the film American Psycho is a fantasy of its lead character, Patrick Bateman. Regardless, whether one sees affinities with American Psycho or The 400 Blows (especially the classroom scenes), If.... is a film worth seeing. Its ability to develop characters (via peering vignettes that move quickly) and mix humor and drama are admirable, even if it never quite meshes into a fine whole, makes it an important film, for both world and British cinema. But, as I've stated before, the import of a film, artistically, philosophically, or politically, is a different creature from its excellence ort greatness, and, unfortunately only the former beast lives on screen. Luckily, for cineastes, so did McDowell, even if Mick Travis may not have.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ricky Gervais fatuously claimed last year that no good British movies were made after the '50's. Lindsay Anderson's 'If....' came out in 1968, and is as good as anything from Gervais' imagined golden age. Set in a public school where discipline is harsh and individuality frowned upon, it focuses on a trio of friends - Mick Travis ( Malcolm McDowell ), Johnny ( David Wood ), and Wallace ( Richard Warwick ). After they are beaten brutally by other boys simply because of their non-conformist attitude, they decide to fight back. Discovering a hidden cache of weapons, they stage a mini-war, blasting away at teachers and pupils indiscriminately. Or do they? 'If....' blends fantasy and reality. It was made in both colour and monochrome ( for economic rather than artistic reasons ). You do not need to be a genius to work out that the teacher's wife ( Mary MacLeod ) wandering stark naked through a dormitory is a daydream, as is Mick and Johnny stealing a motorcycle from a showroom, and Mick's nude fight with a sexy girl in a cafe ( Christine Noonan ).According to McDowell, the school is a metaphor for life. I'm sure there are many ways to interpret the movie, but for me it works as a powerful indictment of the class system. Anderson and writer David Sherwin make the school resemble Hell itself, so that when the final battle comes it is incredibly satisfying. For a long time after seeing this, I could not go to my own school without imagining a similar battle taking place there.Those who find '60's films dated will appreciate 'If....' as it has a timeless, poetic feel. It also came out when student riots were sweeping the world, and caught perfectly the anarchic mood of the time. The cast includes performers who cropped up time and time again in Anderson-directed films, such as Graham Crowden, Mona Wasbourne, Arthur Lowe, and Peter Jeffrey. He certainly knew how to pick actors.McDowell played 'Travis' again in 1973's 'O Lucky Man!' and 1982's 'Britannia Hospital'. His performance here is the cherry on the cake, and can now be viewed as the dry run for his later role as 'Alex' in Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange' ( 1971 ). Mick's sneering contempt for the world is truly fascinating to behold.</fullReview>

I feel like you never got to know the characters. It was just a bunch of boys with the exact same haircut and clothes and i don't even remember if they ever mentioned any names. The only person i knew who he was was the lead character and the random coffee girl, thats all. I never really understood or cared about any of them or the story. I just thought it was about a bunch of sexually frustrated boys who liked to play innocent tricks on the teachers. That's what i thought until the final scene. The shooting scene. Then i just got confused and slightly shocked. I get that they hated school, but a massive shooting? Killing people? Why? Was the point of the movie that school can drive someone insane or what? Also the switching between black and white to colour was annoying as hell, even if i know it was because of money issues.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to seeing this after years of being a Kubrick fan and now understand after seeing this why he chose Malcolm McDowell to star in A Clockwork Orange. McDowell is very good in this very strange film and we do see occurrences of the future Alex De Large in his facial expressions and mannerisms, although these are mostly just the actor being himself. The film itself starts out so interestingly and almost tepid until we start to get to know the characters a little bit and begin to see who's who. I, like most others I presume thought there was something wrong with the film when it suddenly went B&amp;W in the middle of the movie. I found this crossing between color a very annoying stunt and it did nothing for the film in any creative way. There are some good young actors here and a fairly interesting story developing until it starts to get into the fantasy stages. The issue is not the scenes themselves but the lack of a distinct point of view from which they come. Who is fantasizing? We can assume McDowell is but are never really certain why. He hates the school authorities, and alone with his friends stages this coup at the end and murders half the school. But is it real? This is a very cool film for it's time and really unlike anything else of the period, but it could have been so much more with deeper character studies, more of a plot line and less confusing wackiness.</fullReview>

A pity I can't tell you what they are; it's best if they take you by surprise.A pity also that the film as a whole is such an incoherent jumble. Surrealist or semi-surrealist moments can give a coherent film a real kick - consider the giant face that suddenly appears on the skyline in "Brazil", or the ballet sequence in "The Red Shoes". Here, they do little more than keep us hoping against hope.You might have heard the film flits between colour and black and white in the most perplexing way. You may also have heard that the director, Lindsay Anderson, claims this is was done for purely economic reasons. Oh - so that makes it okay? I wasted a lot of time because I was under the impression that colour represented one thing, and black and white another; once that idea is abandoned, all that's left is to absorb the overall effect of semi-random alternation. It's like flicking through a scrapbook. This is appropriate, given the disorded nature of the film, and not ENTIRELY a bad thing.

Maybe that's true, if so, then this movie is outdated.*************SPOILER ALERT**************************************** The ending makes about as much sense as all the kids who're anti-government and anti-corporation without having any better solution that doesn't torch society to a Mad Max type cinder.Yeah, the main characters could leave, but they don't. The reasons they go about this don't make sense. There isn't enough character development to explain why. What shooting up a bunch of innocent people is supposed to mean is never explained or even hinted at. It is mentioned that war is the final creative expression, quite possibly the only revelation that any characters of this movie have, and it makes no sense.The characters who go on a murder spree aren't fighting the institution, they're just killing people. I thought they might've used all the explosives to blow up the place or at least the sanctuary at the end, that would've made greater symbolic sense, but they didn't.tl;dr - This movie is an adolescent's daydream of fighting against authority that plagues them, though in reality they need. It has no moral, symbolic truth, or meaning to it; this movie simply plays out the fantasy of killing teachers and people in "power" that annoy you.If you think a murder rampage/ school shooting similar to columbine or virginia tech is a rational and sensible way to deal with teachers and institutions you don't like, then I guess you'll love this movie. If you're like me and you're working towards making a life for yourself instead of just blindly (very blindly in this movie) rebelling against "the man", this movie is juvenile and boring.You can also tell in parts that funding was lacking, and the story seemed to have a touch of attention deficit disorder.All in all, this seems like a very rough draft of what could've been an okay movie, but no effort is put into the dialogue, character development, or moral so it's just... poorly done.If... only I could get my two hours back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some movies are like milk...they don't get better with age.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "If..." came out, it was the right sort of film at the right time. However, when seen today, the movie looks terribly choppy, lacks focus and especially humor. Like a gallon of milk, this film does not get better with age! Roughly first half of the film is like a documentary--a recreation of the horrid life in a British public college (to translate into American, a 'private high school'). It appears to be a fascist system where there are many rules just for the sake of rules, abuse of arbitrary power the norm and a rather homo-erotically charged atmosphere predominates--and it was both interesting and a bit said. However, when it came to the actual story, this is where the film really let me down. Despite setting up a horrid atmosphere where the plot should have been easy to construct, the plot just seemed, at times, irrelevant and very episodic....and often incoherent and meandering. I know many consider this a classic and it's achieved a level of respectability now that it's part of the Criterion Collection, but the movie just seemed cheaply made and incomplete---and not just because random portions of the movie are in black &amp; white. While controversial and counter-culture back in the 60s, now it just seems bad.Who was Malcolm McDowell's character and who were his very nameless and faceless friends? We never know anything other than very superficial things about them--like Malcolm's character steals a motorcycle. But WHY did he do this? And, why wasn't there any follow up on this? And what about the naked lady towards the end the film who walks through the dorms?! What's all this about--what is going on and why? It just seemed random and pointless. And why did a few scenes seem funny and surreal...and yet NOTHING was done with this and it was never exploited!?! For example, I loved seeing the minister in the drawer---but with nothing preceding or following it, what was this?! And, with 95% of the film very serious, this seemed out of place and irrelevant. And, for that matter, the entire ending was that way. While having the four problem students (though at times they are only three--did you notice that one appeared and disappeared in scenes?!) destroy the big ceremony was potentially a great idea (like the ending of "Animal House"), it was a lost opportunity for me because instead of ruining things, they started killing people. Killing people in a mass murder like the Columbine Massacre didn't seem funny...just awful. Nothing's funny about mass murder (I know, I know...I am quite a prude in this department).Had this film appeared in 2010, critics would have rightfully torn it apart for being incomplete and incoherent. Yet, oddly, it's a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has a certain resonance with me - not least because i went to the school where most of the interiors were shot ! The character "peanut" is actually in a bed I once slept in.The general atmosphere is very authentic especially the usually words like "scum" for the new boys (who where actually called boyees pronounced boy-ee) and the practice of shouting "scum" (or boyee) to call the lower year boys so tasks could be allocated. The "bunff" test (in reality "chivvy" test) and the scenes of drilling a new boy in the names of masters etc all authentic. As is the "bogwashing" although they had put doors on the lavatory by the time I got there.Rather strangely Peter Jeffrey the head master - looks and has the mannerisms of the headmaster when I was there about 8 years after the film was made. We also had a master who would cycle into the classroom corridors - although no into the classroom and would open all the windows even if it was freezing ! We even had a guy who stole hundreds of rounds of ammo from the rifle range - I actually found the stash when call to help search for "illegal" contraband - cigarettes booze etc. Which certainly puts a different light on the ending for me ! However overall I think the ending is one step too far - I think suicide of partial shooting of a few people then suicide would be probably more effective</fullReview>

It touched my soul and shook me to my depths.I thought it was a poetic vision that described the world I lived in.I looked forward to a revolutionary uprising occurring similar to the uprising in the film. In a way I still do.Watching it again today, for the first time in 30 years or more, I now see many flaws in it. The characters are not well developed and they are not as smart as they once seemed. Still, this is poetic cinema at its greatest.Still I remember the deep impression that the film made on me 50 years ago.

I was expecting Malcom Mcdowell to be the kid who revolts against authority (teachers and prefects or "whips" as they're called) and it would be violent, exciting and interesting. "If..." was certainly interesting but it wasn't very exciting like I thought it would be and I didn't really get the point of it. It might be because I'm a bit thick to get the message, but what it seemed like, was the director was trying to make a connection between boarding school and war. How they're both similar, only I didn't get why! The film seemed to confusingly swap between colour and black and white, why? This wasn't clear either and it just made it look a bit amateurish really and I know that this film is far from amateur.The whole film felt like a build up until that little 5 minutes at the end when Malcolm and his droogs were shooting. I just feel that maybe it would've been better if our build up was shorter (say half the film) and the rest would be Malcolm leading a revolt.The film never really ended as well, which I found a bit disappointing. I was left speechless at the end, but for the wrong reasons.Don't get me wrong here, I did find it interesting and almost compelling, but I also found it slow and weird at times. Why was that man lying in a drawer? Why did that girl in the coffee shop suddenly join? Watch it for yourself. See if you get it. It won't be a waste of time, but I didn't get it</fullReview>

Regardless of the education quality, this is not to be a pleasant experience. The cliques have a stranglehold on everything and like to haze the other students. But things may be about to change; Mick Travers (Malcolm McDowell) looks ready to rebel."If..." is one of the many masterpieces to come out of the United Kingdom in the years since WWII.

Two things hold it together - one is the charismatic and clever performance of McDowell, and the other is the beautiful mute scene in which a love-struck junior watches Warwick exercising on the bars.

		<fullReview>if.... is the cinematic equivalent of Sgt. Pepper's: Revered by baby boomers as the pinnacle of creation, and viewed as rather a silly bit of business by preceding and subsequent generations. Now that the children of the middle classes the world over are seemingly super human due to the internet, and view the prospect of boarding school as a wonderful opportunity thanks to the Harry Potter books/films, the relevance of if.... couldn't be further from modern concern. In fact, many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for Pink Floyd's The Wall.One should never hold personal bias against a film while reviewing, and the cemented date of this film aside, there are a few flaws which others have overlooked. Lindsay Anderson was known to be a fan of Luis Bu?uel, on top of generally being too smart for his own good. And despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second acts, the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by cod Bu?uel surrealism and strained attempts at symbolism. Anderson wasn't capable of this feat due to his over-intelligent cynicism, failing to see that Bu?uel was jovial in his work. I have not found a critic whom champions the 'Chaplain in a drawer', and am almost certain it still gets sideways looks from those who adore this film. The ending is not so much a concise punch to the established class/values system, as a wet slap on a moving target.The British public school system was firmly for the middle classes (the upper crust being educated at home by private tutors). And the modus operandi of if.... was to check the boxes of public school life which Lindsay believed had been unexplored in film, thereby savaging middle class pretense. Homosexuality, generational cutlery, cold showers et al. In reality, such issues HAD been covered in many other great British films, if.... merely brought them to the fore. The Browning Version was a more oblique damning of such pomp, to name but one.if.... is oddly quaint, and simply can not be viewed with modern (especially American) eyes. Kudos to Anderson for avoiding Mick and Kieth in favour of African chant, and a few brownie points for the latent homoerotic overtones. Points deducted for pretension, establishing characters who disappear, and inciting a glib revolution which came to naught.</fullReview>

My question is - did the screenwriters deliberately give an incorrect answer? The organ was playing the Toccata from Widor's Organ symphony. It may well be that they were disclosing the Chaplain's ignorance, knowing that the Headmaster had no idea what was being played in chapel. Or maybe they, too, were ignorant! For the record, I am not trying to nitpick. It might well be a very subtle point &amp; one would like to think that it was intended that way. After all, the producers would have been able to check.

I don't know that I feel that way anymore but that certainly was the dynamic back then and I'm glad the film was available to help express that rage. I suppose the main character is merely looking for an alternative method of purifying or disciplining himself, taking on the mannerisms of a "primitive" culture when the one he's grown up in offers nothing but a crushing conformity and materialism.</fullReview>

Director Lindsay Anderson even follows the tradition of Vigo's disjointed sequences, which seem both precisely calculated and intuitively constructed simultaneously, to make the film somewhat surrealistic and to shockingly confuse the audience to evoke their emotions. While it may be cliche, the ending, Malcolm McDowell with his girlfriend and buddies keeps shooting from the roof, is unforgettably intense.

The end of "Heaven Help Us"(1985), barely comes close, and "The Breakfast Club" (1985) should've had something like it.

		<fullReview>After receiving a recent rerelease to DVD, I had my 2nd viewing of 'If...' in about 20 years. The action takes place at the usual sadistic English public school, which, as has been noted in the movie "Another Country," seem to only be good at creating homosexuals and Communists, sometimes both. It's played for laughs, which it certainly gets, but it still falls on the shrill &amp; unpleasant side, even if the goal was to expose a debauched culture giving way to a new one. The awfulness depicted compounds itself. The milieu is generally hostile. The characters are overtly &amp; enthusiastically hostile. The authorities are either clueless, cowed Torys whose moment is over; or preening pederasts who will ascend to rule the country. In order to survive in such a setting, one has to (in turn) reach down inside oneself and extract the most loathsome personality one can find, not just for defense but for offense as well.The film treads the tightrope between revenge-tale and wishful thinking, hence the title. Although it builds to a machine gun massacre, the violence is mostly a put-on and the editing undermines reality. The school lawn is filled with bodies, but then it's not. No one ever receives a visible wound. Is it really happening..., perhaps only in Mick's mind.'If...' had it's day but with it's cultural context fading into the past, it's becoming more of a curio. It's kind of a paste-up board in an unusual format, of all the ideas that young people made current in the 60s. Technically it's average. Structurally it's not much. If 'If...' did no more than inspire the phenomenally better film Rushmore, which riffs on it, we could still call it even. The parade of loathsome Britons in the film draws me back to my favorite rhetorical question; Why do people hate the French when the English exist? Prince William, Posh Spice, Prince Charles, The Queen, Elton John, Blllllllecccchhh. Guh, keep them all. (Although it must be said, British humor almost redeems the whole culture.) If you want to know anything about the ideas in this film, skip the terrible commentary track; which is just one more actor (MacDowell) going on about how terrific everyone was, and telling stories in which he figures. Why even make a movie about ideas if you're going to eventually transform into this self-impressed, bourgeois thespian?This reminds me of two movies; The Devils Playground which is about a sadistic Australian public school (packed with self-loathing Catholics) albeit with a winning performance at it's center that suggests the boy will make it through just fine, and Blow-Up which trolls the same period, but which is aging much better.Arthur Lowe as as the headmaster will move on from here and play the combative Commie butler in the uproarious "The Ruling Class" which I favor. A movie like this (which ends in a mass school shooting) could not be made today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If..." I could have my two hours back. A bad '60s movie beloved by political dilettantes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw "If?" I can remember the advertisements for the movie from 1968, so I was interested in finally seeing it. It may be the perspective of an American who never went to a British public school and misses some of the social references, but I thought the movie was awful. For one thing, as others have pointed out, it takes almost the entire movie for the much ballyhooed-at-the-time revolt to break out. For another, whether the last scene is real or imagined, what occurs isn't a revolt, but a shooting rampage. There's quite a difference.I know it may be bad form to judge a movie on subsequent events, but one cannot avoid doing it here. One person wrote a message board posting asking us not to compare the end of movie to the incidents at Columbine High School and Virginia Tech. But if there's a scintilla of difference between Klebold, Harris and Cho on the one hand and Travis (Malcom McDowell) on the other, I simply can't see it. All four of them were under the delusion that their gunfire is going to purify a f___-ed up world that they arrogantly take no responsibility for.Which brings me to: why the hell are Travis and his chums even in a school they so despise? They are adults, or close to it. They're not in a military prison, like the inmates in "The Hill," a much better British film from about the same time. No one is forcing them to go to College and take beatings from the the whips, except maybe ambitious parents in need of a wake-up about the nature of their sons. I had the opportunity in college to join a frat, except I couldn't stand to be given silly, cruel orders by delinquents claiming to be my prospective "brothers." I took the consequences of not having the "in" with the Establishment that frats provide, and I can't say I regretted it.If Travis fancies himself the second coming of Lenin (whose unbearded picture hangs prominently in his room) he's free to go out and organize a fitter's union or work for Michael Foot in the next election. If he wants to be Jack Kerouac, then get on the road and start writing. What possible benefit is he giving the world in joyriding a motorcycle and getting drunk in his room?Sometimes reviewers have to be like the person who responded to the scene in "Last Tango In Paris" where Brando mopes about having had to go on a date with cow manure on his shoes. In the real world, the person said, a listener would say "Why didn't you scrape it off? Change your shoes?" --Don't allow fictional characters to lay a self-pity trip on you because you don't dare point out an common-sense alternative course of action for them. So it is here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could've been something truly great but falls short due to its inconsistent content.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would seem that 'If....' (with four periods after it) is in actual fact a bit of a miss-mash drama trying to say one thing, trying to be another and suffering from that tag of 'cult status' that some films fall under. I won't deny that If.... is an interesting film and it is unpredictable at the best of times with several short scenes standing out but that's what most films are in essence and everything that revolves around these more memorable scenes just seem dry, uninteresting and pointless.The film switches between black and white and colour. It would seem that the black and white footage is only present when the scenes in the church are occurring and there is probably a reason for this although I've racked my brain and still failed to come to any conclusion as to why this was included. When I think of other films that have done this, I think of Wenders' 'Wings of Desire' which used colour and black and white to tell-apart reality to the world in which actual Angels inhabit; Rodriguez' Sin City used colour at small intervals to emphasise minute details that characters notice on others: Goldie's RED lips and The YELLOW Bastard in particular; also, Ross' Pleasantville which included colour carefully into a black and white 1950s sitcom very carefully to tell apart numerous things but here, it just seems misused.If.... starts out in pretty iconic yet ironic fashion: Mick Travis (McDowell's first film appearance) has his face covered up with a scarf hiding anything below his eyes, thus delaying the glee of seeing the youngest form of McDowell in a feature film but the real irony behind the iconography is when he slowly unwraps his scarf and the unveiling is complete: a brilliant cinematic moment, albeit accidentally, as McDowell reveals........a moustache. There is also clear identification with the timing of the film as the school staff themselves state that the school needs to be modernised and upgraded to the 60s; the 60s being of course Britain's 'boom' decade. This shows excellent awareness of the life and times the film is set during although the 60s were already eight years old.When you break the film down scene by scene, If.... is very reminiscent to that of an avant-garde film although at times I felt it didn't want to be one and this clash is both distinctive and distracting. The introduction of the character known simply as 'The Girl' (Noonan) suspends all reality and defies the films attempt at trying to create a realistic and intelligent commentary on public schooling and/or the educational status in Britain at the time; the caf in which they meet is completely empty and their journey there although entertaining, just felt out of place. Consequently; when she pops up for the finale and carries out the final act of violence in the film's most famous shot, there is just no need for her to be there, there is no explanation of how she got there or why: it's not like she went to the school and suffered like Travis did ? the spatial leap as well as the poor characterisation was not good. What's more, the bizarre content about the tiny babies in jars of fluid in the basement next to the guns twinned with the actual use of black and white now and again suggests to me the filmmakers just wanted to try some shock tactics by throwing in any sort of odd content they could think of.If.... may seem like some sort of social commentary or morale message but it's not. The only things in this film I found evidence of regarding messages were either completely false or totally unknown: in a Math class early on, a teacher who looks to be a holy man since he has that white collar priests wear around his neck (I forget what they're called) actually bullies a boy through physical contact as he sits at his desk ? not realistic for a priest to hurt a child. Another example occurs in the church when another (maybe the same) priest states something like: 'deserters will be shot' regarding not choosing the right path ? does this mean Jesus Christ will somehow smite us or 'shoot' us in punishment? Why was this guy filling up all these boys' heads with crap at such a 'privileged' school? If.... just had too much of content that was so blatantly trying to be controversial that it's just a victim of its own downfall. I liked the way Travis has war posters all over his wall instead of women and the final scenes of violence are well done but If....'s problems lie deeper in its approach and overall commentaries.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before starring in Stanley Kubrick's controversial A Clockwork Orange, and the even more over the top Caligula, Malcolm McDowell got his first leading role in this film I knew only a little about. Basically the film takes place in a 1960's British independent boys school, and among the returning students is sixteen-year-old non-conformist Mick Travers (McDowell). He and his friends prefer not to stick to the rules of the school, even with the usual assembly with the Headmaster (Peter Jeffrey) and House Master Mr. Kemp (Dad's Army's Arthur Lowe), and of course the caning. Soon enough Mick steals himself a motorbike from a showroom, and has an affair with a waitress, and fellow student Wallace (Richard Warwick) ends up bedding junior boy Bobby Phillips (Rupert Webster). After many trouble making scenes, the ultimate revolt is planned by Mick and some of the others, they arm themselves with automatic weapons on Founders' Day. The parents are visiting the school and attending church, and soon the rebel students led by Mick open fire on everyone from the rooftop, and the camera closes during this with only the word "if..." Also starring David Wood as Johnny, Christine Noonan as The Girl, Robert Swann as Rowntree, Hugh Thomas as Denson and Mona Washbourne as Matron. McDowell makes a great young leading actor, the moments of black and white (from lack of funding and some lighting issues) do actually add something, and of course the final scenes are the most gripping. I could tell this was a satire seeing such things as the teachers being lazy not the students, the rule of running in the corridor not walking, and other little subtleties, it a most watchable drama. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Direction for Lindsay Anderson and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best English-Language Foreign Film. Very good!</fullReview>

I`m very much of the view that cinema should be a universial medium ( The best Brit movie makes are those who try to emulate Hollywood in my opinion ) , if you want to send a message try pony express , and I find the movie dated , pretentious and too set in the 1960s . 1968 was the summer of love and the year of student rebellion in France . You can just imagine every single French leftist worshipping this movie especially the climax . French new wave film makers will also admire the abstract surrealism of some scenes but a mainstream international will dislike it , and many will dislike it intensely</fullReview>
