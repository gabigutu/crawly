		<shortDescription>A Sci-Fi with a capital "S".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been attracted by science, since my early childhood. I remember seeing this movie and being fascinated by the science and technology on display in it. Today, as a MSC EE, I can see that the science in "Andromeda Strain" is accurate. In fact, it's the most accurate of all Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen (and I have seen the great majority of Sci-Fi cinema).That's one reason I love this movie.But there are other, probably subjective reasosn for my adulation of "Andromeda Strain": believable people and believable situations (no "last microsecond decision/action/occurance", no over-the-top behaviour, just human quirkyness, no one-man-does-it-all but teamwork and birth of ideas) and the avoidance of the cliche of only-1-will-survive. So, yes, I liked the script a lot.I also thought the actors were good and the setting was brilliant. I am not put off by dated computer technology: the film clearly illustrates the computing capabilities at the beginning of the '70, and I find something educative and strangely reassuring in that.I give it 10/10, and am sad that nobody produced a Sci-Fi as scientificly accurate ever since.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Wise is an under rated director but in his body of work are such gems as 'The Body Snatcher', 'The Set-Up', 'The Day the Earth Stood Still', 'Odds Against Tomorrow', 'The Haunting', 'West Side Story', 'I Want to Live!' and on its own terms, 'The Sound of Music'. He managed to make genre films more interesting and watchable than other more celebrated directors.'The Andromeda Strain' is an engrossing film from beginning to end. It is science fiction, alien virus comes to earth type thing, but has more depth than just that. The scientists, played very well by Arthur Hill, David Wayne, Kate Reid and James Olson, are fallible and have real emotions. Yet in them is a longing to know, to discover, to solve. Most popular cinema celebrate the fist or the gun but part of the excitement of this film is the use of the intellect to tackle the problem. Brains and not brawn is key.The early scenes in the town of Piedmont are fascinating. Nothing dramatic, only small details adding up to a large tragedy. Restrained film making is not common but in this case it is really effective. After these scenes the film moves on as fear and wonder grip the scientists to a satisfying conclusion. The electronic music is just right, the sets are atmospheric, the hard ware plausible and the photography simple and effective. A mention should be made of Paula Kelly as a nurse, an excellent actor and shamefully under used in films. (She is great in 'Sweet Charity' too.)In a supporting role she gives an intelligent, spirited performance. A near perfect film. Hopefully no one will re-make it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And yet, you just can't help yourself. Under Robert Wise's direction, this tale of microbiological Armageddon unfolds with such perfectly metered suspense that by the 100th viewing, you STILL find yourself glued to your couch. You HAVE to see how it turns out, even though you already know.Although the film is well over 20 years old, and the computer equipment at the Wildfire laboratory shows its age, this is a perfect change-of-pace film for any movie monster fan. Heck, you've probably already let your kids see the bloody carnage in "Jurassic Park" anyway.Instead of the usual radioactive mutated towering apparition that flattens cities and topples skyscrapers, the monster in "The Andromeda Strain" is so tiny, it takes powerful electron microscopes to see it. The average movie monster can only cause damage wherever he can stomp, smash or exhale a blast of fiery breath. Andromeda has the potential to be carried to every corner of the world by the winds, where it could conceivably wipe out all life. Try to top THAT, Godzilla!The real star of the film is Wildfire itself. A government facility located (we thought) safely away from populated areas, it bristles with everything a microbiologist needs to avert a biological disaster. . .or does it?Seeking an unprecedented realism, director Robert Wise insisted that everything on the set be real, from the computer terminals (with their quaint light pens) all the way to the electron microscopes. The Wildfire set is every microbiologist's dream come true and it's populated by a quartet of actors!Since the presence of a big-name star might blunt the impact of this high-tech visual feast, Wise carefully assembled a cast of fine actors who just don't happen to be household names. Without rehashing the characterizations, we'll just say that Arthur Hill, David Wayne, James Olson and Kate Reid couldn't possibly have been more perfect for their roles. With a less competent cast, "The Andromeda Strain" could have degenerated into a parody of itself. This is gritty work, saving the world from biological annihilation. It takes real ACTORS, not just pretty-boy movie stars!Go ahead. Be scared out of your wits by something so tiny, you can't even see it. I dare you to try and get up before it's over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The finest example of how to make science-fiction movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Andromeda Strain is virtually perfect. And it doesn't need the special effects of Alien to succeed in telling the similar story of alien life and our contact with it. The movie is captivating right from the starting credits that introduce us to story. Of course, the director had a brilliant novel of Michael Crichton, but he also did his best to bring this novel to the screen sacrificing neither the main idea, nor the minor details. Actually, all the details that mark every scientific thriller by Crichton are there in the film. The Andromeda Strain doesn't have any dinosaurs, it only has a small virus, but overall it is a much better film than any of the Jurassic Parks. And it succeeds in telling us a great story about science much better than some modern CGI-filled movies like Invisible Man.Finally, the acting is flawless, the actors are great, sets are excellent. If you want to see a great sci-fi movie, choose this one and you want be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really love this film, and its funny because most people Complain about its slow pace, but I believe that this is one of the reasons that the film is so good, and pace does build up towards the end.I understand that this film isn't for everybody, but I am a Michael Crichton fan, and I enjoy the way he introduces his sci-fi characters into his novels. I agree with other user comments that this film was way before its time, and disagree with others who don't seem to be able to differentiate between the music and the sounds in the film.The film has so many qualities, and is a must see for any sci-fi fan.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Easily - EASILY - the best film Michael Crichton has had anything to do with. (That is, of the ones I've seen. For the record, the rest are: `Westworld', `The First Great Train Robbery', `Disclosure', `Jurassic Park', `Twister', and `Congo', although I've never made it to the end of `Congo'.) Does this say something about Crichton's career, or the state of film-making, or neither? Can't say.Whatever - this is pretty darned good science fiction. Sure, it has the vices we've come to expect: scientists with a tendency to act like the crew of the Enterprise, and central protagonists who begin the film by swimming through treacle and end it by leaping tall buildings in a single bound. As for the former problem, well, it's not so bad here as it usually is. As for the latter, well, it's easy to forgive, because we're put through a very tense ride before our heroes crawl out of the treacle - even afterwards. They don't make films this tense these days. Or at least, this particular film would have been less tense if it had been made these days. I don't think a modern director would have resisted the temptation to goof off at some point.THAT'S part of the charm. The film's idea of how scientists behave is rather a silly one, but at least the scientists aren't forced to act GOOFY in order to show that scientists are really human, after all - as if there was any need to show this. And I'll say this: whatever the scientists were like, the SCIENCE is much more intelligent than a modern public has any right to expect. So far as I could tell (not that I'm an expert in anything) it only stretches into fantasy when it needs to. Wise gives us information, and plenty of it - not techno-babble.I've heard people snicker at the thirty-year-old look of the film, but I think they're nuts. The art direction is wonderful. In a way it does the same thing as the original Star Trek: it creates a coherent, claustrophobic world by force of sheer simplicity. But to see `The Andromeda Strain' is to see it done WELL.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the day I first saw this movie back when it first came out, it has stuck in my mind for over 30 odd years. Kind of makes you think about how many of the same facilities the government has and has had in operation doing the same functions. New military toys, area 51 and on and on.A very well made movie that has etched itself into my mind. keeps you thinking and watching the movie keeps you glued to your seat.I would advice anyone that has not viewed this movie to give it a shot. These same type of facilities are all over the world, the question is how many are really as secure as they were designed to be.Just like in the movie there always could be some unknown or alien substances that cannot be contained, or might just feed on the materials used to restrain them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadly Boredom From Above</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This movie is an example of the adage; that is too much information. The movie will submerge you in all the scientific minutia of biological investigation that would have bored Stephen Hawking. Look, could we not quite go this deeply into the science? The film is one of the most boring, slow moving pieces of crap in history. Get ready because after a promising exciting beginning we are taken into a lab the point of which seems to induce total unconsciousness in the audience. Did you think Star Trek The Motionless Picture was slow? That is like Shoot Em Up compared to this. I am an intellectual with two degrees; I read Kant and Sartre and it bored me to death. The science lab from hell. Yes, that is great the organism is resistant to radiation, buckle my boots, could we move the movie along now? Why don't you tell me you tried dancing with it and it doesn't know the twist? Awful, that puts the C in coma inducing, get ready for boredom you have never seen the like of. It is hard to make a value judgment about the movie; I kept falling asleep. That is the core of the film: the organism is resistant to: disco, wing tip shoes, Indiana Jones, milk shakes. Look, do we give a crap? Do you have to relay every negative result to us? They should have tried showing it this movie, that would have killed it for sure!You will wish you had breathed in Andromeda when these geeks keep sharing every test until you will beg for death. The most boring movie ever made; it makes the Motionless Picture look like Grease. Terrible overrated poop</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They wouldn't make it today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It reminds me a bit of "The Forbin Project" in that it presents us with a puzzle that needs solving by intellectual means, and with a problem that has momentous overtones. They wouldn't make it today. Look at the cast. Arthur HILL? Kate REID? They'd need DeCaprio and Roberts at least. And "angstrom units"? And not a single gun or punch in the mouth? And the bomb doesn't EXPLODE? No, no, no -- all wrong.Well, the movie IS dated, true, but not in ways that count. I can handle the fact that clerks still use typewriters instead of PCs. I can live with the awe that is supposed to be instilled in us when we watch somebody use the mechanical hands. And the references to "love ins", and "SDS", and "protest marches," and the notion that the collection of deadly organisms from space may have been deliberately carried out by the DOD. (I forget who objected to that implication but I don't find it the least implausible, not anymore.) The story proceeds logically, step by step, through the introduction of the characters (with Kate Reid providing some welcome Thelma-Ritter-type comic relief), the introduction of the organism (if that's the proper word), and the identification of its nature. Never for a moment does the script lapse into mumbo-jumbo. We're never lost. We always know who's doing what, and why. And in the age of ebola, AIDS, and SARS, I think we can forget about the fact that some of the technology is dated, because the issue certainly isn't.On the other hand, I wish the end had never come, because the movie completely implodes during its last ten minutes or so, by deus ex machina. I mean, here these guys are, working like hell to solve a problem, and when they're just about to do it, the problem goes away by itself and is completely forgotten. Instead we have a conventional chase scene. Can James Olsen stop the nuclear device from detonating, while alarm bells ring and a recorded voice counts down the minutes and seconds, and automatic lasers are shooting at him? Are you kidding? The Wildfire station may not be destroyed but the heretofor well-constructed story is. Still, this is worth seeing, for a number of different reasons. One of the main ones is that they so rarely make 'em like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treading a thin line between science fiction and science fact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Michael Crichton's first novel, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, released in 1971, is a long but constantly intriguing science fiction drama whose concerns verge very close to science fact.The movie concerns a satellite that crashes back to Earth, carrying with it an unknown but deadly organism. All but two (a drunk, and an infant) of the sixty-eight residents of the tiny town of Piedmont, New Mexico have been killed by the organism. It is up to a team of scientists working at an underground lab in the Nevada desert known as Wildfire to study and, if possible, eliminate the bug.Arthur Hill, David Wayne, James Olson, and Kate Reid are the quartet of scientists who are given the task to learn more about this space organism. At Wildfire, they have all the equipment they could possibly need, including a nuclear device that is set to go off should the lab become contaminated. They learn, however, that the bug, code-named Andromeda, actually works like a reactor, changing matter into energy and vice versa. This means that the nuclear device meant to destroy it would only enhance it and spread it all over so that the human race will never be rid of it.The nightmare they feared comes true, as Wildfire becomes contaminated. With only a five-minute delay between activation and self-destruction, Olson is given the task to get to a shutoff switch. He struggles but manages to prevent the unthinkable...with eight seconds to spare.Brilliantly directed by Robert Wise, whose 1951 film THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL is one of the genre's all time greats, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is highly entertaining and strikingly intelligent, with a suspenseful climax. The four lead actors, neither of whom were big names, do extremely good work, giving this film a realism not found in many other films of the genre. The Wildfire lab is as accurate and realistic as anything today's production designers could come up with. Furthermore, the technology doesn't seem too terribly dated despite the film's obvious age. This is because of the innovative special effects work of Douglas Trumbull (2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY), James Shourt, and Albert Whitlock (THE BIRDS).Rated 'G', though 'PG' would be more accurate (some scenes are frightening), THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN remains a significant film of the sci-fi genre as it confronts the increasing realities about biological war and contamination. Dated or not, it is a very prescient piece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great hardcore sci-fi. Crichton's best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970s were a time before some of the "intelligentsia" of American culture began to abandon rationality and reject science on pseudo-ethical grounds. Unsurprisingly, then, 1970s sci-fi is often better informed by science than the sci-fi of later decades, and it is also often more thoughtful and intelligently written. The Andromeda Strain is one of the best hardcore sci fi epics from a decade which brought us such genre classics as 2001, Solyaris, Silent Running, and the original Rollerball. Unlike most of these films, however, Andromeda Strain does not strain believability beyond its bounds, nor does it indulge in metaphysical tangentializing or philosophical moralizing.Developed from what I consider to be Michael Crichton's best book, the Andromeda Strain takes its cue directly from the hard realism of that book, along with its documentary style and scientific background research. Though aspects of the plot defy biological probability, if not law, almost the entire film is plausible. Also borrowed from Crichton's writing is the general point the film attempts to make - one which is present in nearly all of Crichton's work - that along with technological advance comes risk. Fortunately, however, this story does not reach the near-paranoid levels of technophobia which sometimes appear in later works.A great ensemble cast full of not easily recognized character actors represent a team of scientists called together to contain and manage a deadly virus-like organism which has arrived on a crashed space research probe. The virus has already wiped out an entire town, and now the scientists must work at a breakneck, sleepless, pace to determine what the organism is, how it spreads and grows, and how it can be killed or contained. Their only major clues, it seems, are an old man and a baby who survived the initial outbreak. To avoid spoilers, I will avoid any further details regarding the plot.The only aspect of the film which really seems dated is the strange electronic soundtrack, which, at times, seems more derivative of 1950s sci-fi than more modern stuff. Suffice to say that this is one of the best uses of the 'as-it-happens' documentary film-making style. The entire film is delivered in a very refreshingly straightforward manner, with believable dialog, actors that look like real people, and a pace that builds constantly from start to finish.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is one of my favorite movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I must confess that I am a Si-Fi nut. I've seen lots of Si-Fi movies and The Andromeda Strain is definately in my top five. The plot is very interesting in that it deals with a microscopic organism from outer space that is brought back to Earth by a satellite. The cast is outstanding, especially Arthur Hill who plays the leader of the research team. One of the great things about the movie is that it moves right along. So many movies seem to lag, especially at the beginning as the characters are being introduced. However, in this movie, even the beginning is exciting. I've watched this movie over and over, and never seem to get tired of it. It's just plain fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A swift, riveting thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most rigorously complex books by Michael Crichton has managed to withstand the sands of time to remain a taught and gripping thriller. Instead of big special effects, this film relies on situations and dialogue, letting the intensity of the characters tell the story. All of the actors involved were excellent, exhibiting the complexity of their various roles and the scientific savvy they had to possess. While some will put down the film for its strange colors and lack of a bombshell actress (oh boo-frickety hoo!), the strength lies in the people's eyes. This technique is now being reused in films like Signs, and let's hope this method of fear and paranoia reasserts itself in the modern world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best Sci-Fi movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly top-notch film, which never once insults your intelligence. Four top scientists are assembled to unravel the mystery of a deadly substance that has fallen to earth inside a satellite. An entire town, where it was found, is wiped out save for a crying baby and a wino. The survivors and the satellite are taken to a state of the art biological research facility to figure out what the substance is, how it works, and why it killed the townspeople and just as importantly, why it didn't kill the two survivors. Arthur Hill is perfect as the Nobel Laureate Dr. Stone. David Wayne, Kate Reid and James Olson are all quite good as his team. This film covers the entire range of the scientific realm from technology, to politics, to Murphy's law, to scientists egos. Of course the technology in the film is dated (1971), but the interaction between the team members is entertaining and Murphy's Law rears it's head at every turn. The supporting cast is particularly good, and Roberts Wise's direction is on the money. Read the book and watch the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of Crichton's fabulous works have been made laughable when filmed. However, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is a wonderful adaptation of his classic novel. As others have told the storyline, I will not waste your time be regurgitating it. The one change of Dr. Leavitt from male to female improves the film, IMO. It also adds some great humor. It's also enjoyable to see scientists that look like scientists, not hot studs and big breasted bimbos. The story is realistic, and as I said, a perfect adaptation of his novel. My only complaint is the thrown in narration explaining the piece of paper that had caused the machine to not ring its bell when the new messages came in. Other than that, it's a fabulous film. :) (I was able to get one of the few remaining copies of the now out-of-print DVD widescreen version) Go to an auction site and get it if you can..

And we'd need a Baldwin brother. Probably Jean Claude Van Damme as the head scientist too. Wise doesn't pander to anyone except people that want a realistic believable movie. The outbreak proceeds with a slow, methodical precision (compounded by human errors) that makes it much more realistic than Dustin Hoffman playing chicken with atomic bombers any day of the week. And a lot more horrifying to boot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful sci-fi thriller with brains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie I was still in my early teens. Already having an interest in the sciences and the movies, "Andromeda Strain" really caught my attention. A recent viewing -this time as an adult in his early thirties- showed that the movie hadn't lost much of its riveting quality. It's not a low-brow action movie, but an intelligent sci-fi thriller about a micro-biological crisis (initiated by an extra-terrestrial(!) virus brought to earth by a space probe), made long before "Outbreak" and the like. Fine acting and the thorough re-creation of the scientific procedures described in Michael Crichton's novel -on which the movie is based- make this a first choice for viewers with an interest in sci-fi with more than a slight touch of reality. Hints at U. S. plans for biological warfare near the end also make this a political thriller of sorts! Only drawback: The colors appear a bit pale nowadays, as is the case with many 70's films, but since most of the scenes are set in a sterile, monotonous laboratory environment, this doesn't spoil one's viewing experience. Watch out for the eerie opening sequence set in a small desert town where everyone was killed by the "Alien" virus, except for an old drunkard and a baby!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With so many liberties being taken when writing screenplays based on novels, you often end up with a movie that is totally different from the book. Maybe some people like that, and since few people read books anymore anyways, rarely does anyone notice it. That is why I think this film is excellent. There were some small parts of the book that were left out, but from start to finish this film does the best job following the novel that I've ever seen from Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad to see all the positive comments for the original version of this story. I haven't read the book, but I remember what a phenomenon the movie was to kids of my age in 1971 (I was 11). This movie gets played to death on cable here, but I always end up watching parts of it, even though I have it on DVD.What strikes me about the comments though is that nearly everyone describes it as dated, as if in 1971 people should have known to use touch screens and the like. This is the first instance that I know of which used science-fact technology instead of science-fiction projection to tell the story, and as such that's what made it so chilling. It's the grounding in things like typewriter-based computers that made it seem so real.In fact the production design is the true star of this movie, as the story slowly leads us into the sterile, space-station-like world of the underground laboratory. We're taken on a tour of the Wildfire facility, and each step is explained methodically and in detail in terms that the audience could relate to and yet still feel like it was a newly expanding universe.Such movies not only seemed entirely plausible in 1971, but also managed to condition us ordinary folks into the space-age notions that anything was possible, in both positive and negative terms. It was a time when we had just landed on the moon, when computers were the size of rooms, and the economy hadn't yet crashed, but there was still great fear of the unknown. What if those moon rocks they brought back carried a virus that could wipe out all living things on Earth? That question was what prompted Crichton to write the original novel, I would suspect.There's no doubt that Andromeda Strain owes a great deal to 2001, and it recycles that movie's slowness and fascination with sterile technology in a more mainstream style. I enjoy how Robert Wise looks for ways to open up his movies, and I rarely mind the "old-man" sensibility he brings to so many of his later films. The fact that the principles in this are so unglamorous is a very smart and completely appropriate solution. It makes it all the more realistic, in that Robert Wise sort of simulated reality. He really deserves a lot of credit for the sheer variety of films he directed. I think he was a national treasure.In retrospect it's great that this film holds up so well, and is a tribute to Wise's carefully modulated sense of humor, taste and style. Just trying to watch a few seconds of the remake demonstrates how subtlety and nuance and smart old people can trump pretty hacks at any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning : Causes Widespread Panic and Hysteria in Viewers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>NO SPOILERS.OK, I saw the movie about 35 years ago. All I can say, is that from 0-20 years old, this movie scared the crap out of me MORE THAN ANY OTHER MOVIE. It literally gave me nightmares and made it hard to sleep at night - for weeks !!! I was about 12 years old. The book opens with a disclaimer (roughly) : These events actually happened in 1969 and the government has suppressed the facts in order to prevent widespread panic and hysteria !! Well, the movie leads to widespread panic and hysteria in the viewing audience !! Its hard to dismiss it as not being FACT !! Crichton has done more to make earth safe from returning space probes, than any man in human history. This was his first effort, after graduating with a Medical Degree from Harvard. This story was so good, it ended his promising career as a doctor, opening up an even more promising career as a science fiction writer !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The DEFINITIVE Sci-Fi Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is clearly Michael Crichton's finest work. The visionary, forward-thinking of Crichton, is remarkable- as evidenced in this film. Robert Wise' direction is superbly innovative, for its' time even. In addition, Douglas Trumbull's special effects warrants very special recognition, simply because his work was done entirely without the aid of advanced computer graphics(did not exist, in 1971). This is also the very first time I have ever seen computer touch-screen graphics demonstrated! I find this film 100% accurate- in terms of plot, story, technology and characters. The underlying theme of science fiction, meeting science fact- paints a very plausible occurrence in our foreseeable future(and NO- not a single animal was harmed during filming!)This film was a result of bright minds, teamwork, and the dedicated acting of all actors involved- especially James Olson, and Kate Reid. I have always admired Arthur Hill's performances on television, back in the bygone days, when television was really worth watching.I consider this film one of the few remaining, "G-rated" drama/thrillers, and highly recommended in every science-fiction fans' DVD collection, along with, "2001-A Space Odyssey," "Star Wars," "Soylent Green," and "Alien".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, a brief synopsis of the story, for those who may not have read the dozens of other reviews or the blurb when first looking the film up: satellite comes back to Earth and lands in small southwest town killing everyone but two. "Why did this happen, why did they live, and what do we do next?" are the big questions facing a team of top scientists from all over America in a super secret underground government lab. So with that said....I could never call "The Andromeda Strain" an exciting movie, but I could sure call it a good movie; a VERY good movie. It plods along at a slow and steady pace. It does have a couple of exciting scenes, but this movie is not an edge of your seat thriller by any means. It makes you think and the technological devices are enthralling. I'm no science guy and really never have been, but just the lab alone had me in awe when I first saw this as a 12 year old kid.This film has no heart pounding action, no love story, no eye popping special effects, it simply has a good story and some fine acting. This is a top notch cast of terrific actors who never were BIG stars, but the solid performances they have always been known for come through loud and clear in this film. It has some slow boring moments, but they get buried beneath the wonderful story telling and acting.It's not the swash-buckling sci-fi of "Star Wars" (yes, a great movie) but it's a simple movie that makes one think and it's pretty relevant today, just like in 1971 when it was released.At least, that's what I think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was and still is a great film. It predates the aids epidemic and is relevant even today in lieu of what is happening in Africa. The music score for this film is nerve wracking and excellent. Rarely does the score fit a film so well as in this one. The only other film I can think of where music score fits hand in glove like this one is Planet of The Apes, another great sci-fi classic. The opening sequence is mysterious, and all of the things the scientists must do to increasingly "purify" themselves as they move down levels is interesting. The experiments that are performed in order to identify the contagion are realistic. The ending is exciting even by today's standards, but don't expect huge explosions and great cgi effects. This film is older and relies more on plot than on cheesy special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine slow moving sci-fi drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's an echo of 2001 and a foreshadowing of The Parallax View in this paranoiac sci-fi drama. The movie delights in presenting the tools of science and questions the direction and authority of those elected or selected to preserve us. The pacing strikes modern audiences as slow - it is - but that's the film's greatest success: suspensefully unfolding at a snail's pace. Some of the dialog is stilted and some points are far too belabored (the scene where Dr. Mark Hall, James Olson, is instructed on the use of his key is a tedious overplaying of the moment). The cast do what they can with dialog that sounded a little trite and predictable in its day and sadly is the main thing that mars an otherwise hypnotic journey into the dangers of modern governments and modern science. At the film's core, however, is a lesson that bears repeating, lest we forget.</fullReview>

Ever been in a room with four really bright people, all of whom know they're right and the other three are wrong? This movie was very realistic in the that way.You don't think they seemed very bright? Hmmm, you must be Albert-bloody-Einstein.And yes, Kate Reid's character let pride her endanger the project and the whole world. Like she's the only person who did something stupid because of pride.

The stars, portraying scientists, are all very credible. And gasp, can you believe that the one female scientist is not a Victoria's Secret model? What was Robert Wise thinking of? Oh, that's right, he was thinking of making an intelligent film. What a novel idea.The hunt for the "bug" totally engrossed me and I found the unfolding of the mystery wonderfully done. The slow realization of the true scope and virility of the biological menace was riveting."Andromeda Strain" stands mid-way between the "giant reptile/insect/dinosaur devours/crushes/devastates New York/London/Tokyo" sci-fi flicks of the 1950's and the trillion dollar epics of the 1990's where eye candy replaces any cerebral activity.Rating: 10 of 10.

		<shortDescription>A Rare Excellent Crichton Adaptation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Andromeda Strain was Michael Crichton's first novel, and the first of his novels to be filmed. In both respects it was successful. Director Robert Wise (The Sound of Music, West Side Story, The Sand Pebbles, Star Trek: The Motion Picture) created a film that is as quiet, clean, and sterile as the research facility in which most of the movie takes place. The visuals and computers are dated, but the sets are sparse and polished (literally, because much of the set is stainless steel) and artistically they hold up well. The film has a brooding, detached mood throughout.The most remarkable part of the movie, in my opinion, is Gil Melle's electronic soundtrack. I find it fascinating that Robert Wise, who directed two of the most successful and critically acclaimed musicals of all time, would set the movie to an atonal avant-garde electronic score, the likes of which has rarely appeared in any movie since then, mainstream or otherwise.I think The Andromeda Strain captures Crichton at his best, and I recommend it.Other Crichton movies that are worth a look, in addition to Jurassic Park, are Westworld, The (First) Great Train Robbery, and the wry sleeper Looker. Most of his later efforts are schlock.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>These "old" science fiction movies always have a certain special tension and atmosphere like "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Capricorn One". Something I sometimes miss in todays movies.Sure the pace is slow, especially the beginning but that's what helps to build up the tension. It certainly makes the race against time ending even more suspenseful.The style of the movie can be called unique. Especially the camera work and editing. It's very experimental, almost Brain De Palma like and I like it a lot. It makes the movie's style special and unique and it adds to the atmosphere.The story is good and is told in such a way that it actually becomes to some extend believable. With the exception of some clichéd moments and the ending. The movie begins slow and mysterious and builds up the tension extremely well, while the ending itself is quite spectacular and fast. This also makes the movie special and worth remembering. Some of the scene's you will never forget. The virus itself (the adromeda strain) is pretty scary and disturbing, mainly because you don't know what it is or what it does and how it can be stopped.There are also some nice character played by not so well known actors. What's great about the characters is that they all feel very human and not perfect. I like the fact that they don't all like each other and don't always agree.A classic science fiction/thriller that deserves to be better known.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nelson Gidding's model screen adaptation of Michael Crichton's first, and arguably best, novel tells a complex medical "detective story" with clarity and dramatic impact. The excellent cast consists of non-stars Arthur Hill, James Olson, David Wayne and Kate Reid; their relative anonymity and lack of glamour lend the proceedings a sense of realism. Briskly directed by veteran Robert Wise, with kudos to Douglas Trumbull and his VFX team for making the Andromeda organism a truly menacing antagonist. With bio-terrorism a threat now more than ever, this one packs a punch.Pay no attention to A&amp;E's recent remake, starring various pretty TV stars and exec-produced by Ridley and Tony Scott. It offers nothing new (except a clichéd scoop-hungry reporter) and its design, effects and direction are hugely inferior to the original.</fullReview>

It is easy to say the film looks dated, that is inevitable with the passage of time and should not be a point of criticism. The casting is also done with intelligence, the use of good solid actors instead of going for the biggest names/prettiest faces of the time is a courageous choice and one I seldom see done nowdays for a major budget film like this. I also feel the pacing of the story is realistic and good, and it dosen't sell out with a cheap and unbelievable ending either.

After the crash all the residents of Piedmont are killed with the exception of a baby and an old gentleman booze hound. Mankind is on the verge of being destroyed by a leaked alien virus, so a crack team of scientists are gathered in the hope of containing and understanding the virus before the world gets devoid of human life!.Taken from the novel by Michael Crichton, this film is a wonderful lesson in tension building as we follow the scientists thru a carefully structured sc-fi plot that will eventually become a race against time. What makes The Andromeda Strain stand out against other genre pieces is it's astute and believable approach to the subject, we are {in the main} in the presence of proper scientists, no super hero tricks are forthcoming from these people, they are sensible honest intelligent people, using their combined knowledge to hopefully save the planet. A masterstroke from the makers is that they used largely unknown actors for the film, this gives the story added believability, a very useful way of drawing the audience into the drama unfolding. The direction from Robert Wise is very clued in, the set design for the underground research facility is top notch, and the actors all give stoic and intelligent performances, so why do i only go 8/10 for this wonderful piece then ?.Well after the films first two parts were simply excellent, i find that the final act reverts to type, and somehow it seems misplaced after what the viewer has just been thru. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine sequence of events that fuels the dramatic slant, but it's a bit too glossy in light of the preceding structure. Still, The Andromeda Strain is an incredibly smart, mature, and knowing film that is standing the test of time for being great sc-fi cinema.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN as a child and being terrified by it mainly down to the opening scenes of a USAF unit going into a deserted village to retrieve a crashed satellite and finding .... You'll have to watch the movie to find out what . But after re-seeing the movie again as an adult I can still say the opening sequence is heart stopping in its tension simply down to the fact that the audience is allowed to use its imagination as to what has happened to the villagers and the recovery team . This is one of the most effective openings I have ever seen in a science fiction movieUnfortunately it's impossible for the production to keep up the tension though I will give credit for everyone involved in trying . It's just that for reasons of plot the story then revolves around a small team of uber scientists sitting in an underground lab researching something they've found from outer space and finding a way of making sure it doesn't wipe out life on Earth . The main problem is that the story then starts getting bogged down in scientific fact which makes it very difficult for the audience , then to appease the audience the last ten minutes involve a literal race against time which wouldn't look out of place in a James Bond movie . I guess a mainstream audience member who disliked the massive amount of techno-babble on display perked up at the exciting countdown at the end while a microbiologist student who understood the technical dialogue wished the movie had ended on a more intelligent note There are one or two other slight problems . I did find Dr Ruth Leavitt , written and played as some beatnik intellectual very irritating . But I guess if THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was remade today we'd see Hilary Duff or Lindsay Lohan as a nobel prize winning scientist so let's not complain about Kate Reid's performance too much . Unless I missed something isn't there a plot hole involving a crashed Phantom jet ? What caused it to crash ? Surely it couldn't have been exposed to the alien visitor unlike say the helicopter that brought back the satellite But I shouldn't nit pick too much since THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is a very effective sci-fi chiller though a more modern audience might be put off by a large amount of talky scenes and an absence of special effects</fullReview>

A team of five scientists ? the leader Dr. Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill), Dr. Charles Dutton (David Wayne), Dr. Mark Hall (James Olson), Dr. Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid) and Dr. Kirkie ? are summoned and gathered together in the top secret Wildfire facility. Fighting against time, they try to understand the reason why the old man and the baby survived and research an antidote to Andromeda, the ultimate biological weapon."The Andromeda Strain" was a successful, believable and scary sci-fi in the beginning of the 70's, in the top of the cold war and the American imperialism in Latin American and Vietnam. The suspenseful story is very well directed and acted, using split screens that were common in the 70's. The technology of robotic and mecatronics shown in the research facility is ahead of time. In 1951, Robert Wise made one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen, "The Day the Earth Stood Still", with a message of peace. Twenty years later, he gives another example of the importance of peace on Earth. If the viewer pays attention in the end of the movie to the discussion of the scientists about what might be done in a biological crisis, he or she will see the last word of the computer after analyzing the data: "STOP".

		<shortDescription>Superior Effort in a Difficult Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science fiction is a difficult genre in which to write. Horror is actually easier, as Stephen King has observed, because the writer does not have to actually EXPLAIN what is happening unless (s)he wants to, whereas science fiction practically demands detailed explanations for everything. This makes it not only a difficult form to write in, but it compounds the difficulty when one tries to adapt it to film.Robert Wise, a very eclectic director whose talents ranged from musicals (WEST SIDE STORY and THE SOUND OF MUSIC) to horror (THE HAUNTING) to the classic science fiction film THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and this little gem from 1971, was perhaps the perfect choice to direct the screen version of Michael Crichton's successful novel. Using character actors instead of big stars, he makes the unknown organism from outer space the star of the show and sets it in a futuristic compound designed by the government for the purposes of studying germ warfare.The picture begins with two military types cautiously visiting a tiny town in New Mexico where a satellite landed, causing the death of the entire population with the exception of one six-month-old baby and a sixty-seven-year-old man who drinks Sterno, of all things. There's the usual "national security" babble and phone calls to the joint chiefs (the President is mentioned but never seen), and a crack team of scientists is assembled: Dr Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill), Dr Mark Hall (James Olson), Dr Charles Dutton (David Wayne), and Dr Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid), the only woman on the team and an epileptic whose favorite pastime (aside from smoking) is being a smartass.I am no scientist, so I can't vouch for the merits of any of the science presented here, but it sounds as though they at least tried for verisimilitude. At any rate, the genre by nature tends to stretch credibility, particularly as here when we are dealing with an organism that may not conform to established earth norms of how matter behaves.It sounds about as authentic as any film I have ever seen, and the dialogue is crisp, intelligent, and often funny.I nearly took off a point for overlength, but that really would not be fair: the first hour or so is spent not only setting up the premise, but putting the team through a rigorous course of sterilizing treatments to make them as germ-free as possible before dealing with the alien organism. Whether you buy it or not, this is one of the most fascinating parts of the movie.Casting character actors instead of names not only allowed for the budget to be spent on what was obviously an expensive set, but it grounds the film in reality. Wayne and Reid are especially good; Ruth Leavitt is one of the funniest characters in a serious movie that I have ever seen: no matter how tired she is, she's always got a wisecrack handy.The plot is too labyrinthine to go into in any further detail, but I enjoyed every minute of this picture when I first saw it as a boy of eight and it still remains one of my favorites in a difficult and demanding genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted to like this film. I've heard it mentioned for decades, and I thought I would enjoy it, but I was bored out of my mind. Literally nothing happens. There are scenes upon scenes of people looking into microscopes and screening petri dishes of various substances. The cast is solid, and I don't even have much of a problem with the (dated) script, because you can see how it was possibly ahead of its time in terms of the casting of black and female actors in positions of authority. I read a lot of the reviews here before writing this one and clearly I am in the minority. I am not going to say that other people don't know what they are talking about, because I suppose a certain kind of hardcore sci-fi fiction reader would love this movie. The script hews very close to the book--which I also read and was bored by--and portions of the dialogue sound like they were lifted verbatim from Crichton's pages. It isn't a terrible movie, but I found it pretty dull. I felt there were a lot of opportunities for more heightened suspense. I am definitely a fan of dated 1970s sci-fi, the worse the better, with "Logan's Run" being a particularly guilty pleasure, and "The Demon Seed" a close second. I found this movie too cerebral to be interesting, too intelligent to be silly and not nearly cheesy enough to be campy fun. The biggest issue I have with it is that I don't feel it is suspenseful. There is one entire twenty minute section where the scientists proceed through a progressively more sterile decontamination process as they descend into a subterranean lab, and you literally watch them get decontaminated and x-rayed and bathed for twenty minutes Twenty. If you are heavily fascinated by scientific accuracy or the history of computers you will probably enjoy it. You will have to use your best judgment as to whether or not to spend two+ hours on this film.</fullReview>

It concerns a virus outbreak in the town of Piedmont that leaves virtually all its inhabitants dead with the exceptions of a man named Jackson (George Mitchell) and an infant baby. It's up to four scientists-Dr. Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill), Dr. Charles Dutton (David Wayne), Dr. Mark Hall (James Olson), and Dr. Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid) to try to find a cause and probable cure. One of them also works with associate Karen Anson (Paula Kelly) in taking care of Jackson and the infant. I'll stop there and mention how intriguing it was hearing many of the scientific info while they were occasionally getting emotional when the strains of being kept in such claustrophobic quarters wore on. And the final running sequence was such a nail-biter! Kudos to Nelson Gidding for adapting Michael Crichton's novel in fine screen form. Also to Gil Melle for the electronic score. And director Robert Wise shows here how he can adapt to modern movie techniques when he shows more than one scene at a time in certain instances like when we see various dead bodies in the desert. Or when a few experimental animals are breathing their last. So on that note, I highly recommend The Andromeda Strain. P.S. Since I like to cite people who were born in places I lived in, I have to note that Michael Crichton was a native, like me, of Chicago, Ill. and that Paula Kelly was born in Jacksonville, Fla., which I lived in from 1987-2003.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie might have some dated equipment in it, but it actually is one of very few movies that followed almost perfectly along with one of Michael Crichton's books. I have read and actually own every one of his books, this book was one of the first I read (when I was 15). When I finally saw the movie, I was really impressed. Most of the movies based on his books were very successful, and I think it has to do with the fact that the successful movies followed closely the story lines of his actual books. Congo (the movie) did not, and I note that some reviewers did not care for it. I would recommend The Adromeda Strain to anyone that likes to watch 'hard' science-fiction movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As cold and desolate as deep space is, it's still a tempting destination - both literally and symbolically. I was 7 or 8 when I first saw this and it nearly wiped out my dream to be an astronaut. If the frozen, airless, radioactive vastness didn't get you, then minuscule, voracious, soulless microbes would. No thanks, I'll try motorcycle daredevil instead. But, no, it's not that easy. It's not enough that I choose not to hurl myself into that unforgiving, treacherous blackness. Alas, we've got our smarter-than-you military bringing back to Earth the treacherous green monsters. It's for our own good, they want us to believe. So, don't question the project, and get with the program. Like all the efficient and competent scientists buzzing around the ultra-tech Wildfire research facility, we are expected to dutifully play our role in the hive. The eerie coolness, the stark seamless sets, and the insidious behavior of the "alien" nearly exterminated my tender incubating fantasies of space. It was made only two years after we had landed on the moon, so Neil Armstrong was as popular as Babe Ruth or George Washington. But, this movie had me wondering just what were we really doing out there. Forget that there would probably never be a McDonalds on Mars, I was made to ask if there really was anything in this extreme venture for me. You know: Is it all worth it? Friends of mine have seen this movie and it left them, well, cold. It, however, leaves me cool. Marshall McLuhan said that film is a cool medium, and this one is definitely one of the coolest.</fullReview>

The Wildfire lab is a clean lab designed to study biological warfare.It is an amazing story, I didn't want to miss a minute of it, it's a suspenseful thriller and it brings yourself to question what you believe. What if this story actually happens, what if a massive disease come from outer space and starts killing everyone. What do we do. To quote the last few lines of this movie? Dr. Stone: However, with this new knowledge, there is no guarantee that another so-called "biological crisis" won't occur again.Senator from Vermont: Hmm. What do we do about that? Dr. Jeremy Stone: Precisely Senator. What do we do?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing find on a movie back shelf</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a science-fiction book by Michael Crighton, this movie shows the potential threat that biological weapons pose. The book was written in the late 1960's and turned into a movie soon after, however the themes are still relevant to the modern world. I was amazed at the technology used and the imagination of the author of this book which was way ahead of its time. The film crew (in particular the special effects team) would have had to work hard and creatively in order to achieve the fantastic results they did. It goes to show that technology is not always best ? the way in which buildings and diagrams were filmed using projectors and scaled-down models made for more believable effects than modern computers could probably have done. I will admit that some people may feel that the story lags a little in places, as the movie is definitely Science Fiction and would not appeal to everyone with its highly detailed account and industry lingo. However I was kept intrigued throughout; curious and fascinated by scientific and medical procedures which must have required lengthy research, as well as a 'who dunnit' quality where I kept trying to solve the mystery from all the clues which I had been given. I also highly enjoyed the dialogue between various characters and their attitudes. To bring a sense of irony and sarcastic wit into this serious situation lightened the mood in essential parts and made the characters more approachable to the general public in my eyes.The final action sequence where everyone is saved in a nick of time bordered on cheesy however. I appreciate the need to increase the suspense before releasing it completely, but the way in which the hero was kept from his mission was unbelievable to the point of irritating and I almost fast forwarded the movie to the end because it was very obvious that he would overcome his obstacles yet these delays were not impressive. The characters were cast very well, using good actors but no large Hollywood names. This made it easier to slip into this fictional world and entertain the possibility that perhaps the situation could manifest itself in reality. My favourite part was the final scene where the scientist is speaking with a senator, giving him news that the virus has been stopped. He then says how without new knowledge there is no guarantee that a "biological crisis" won't occur again. The senator asks "what do we do about that?" The professor replies simply "precisely". It makes the audience stop and think, and hopefully even question what the government gets up to in the name of National Security. This movie is a cleverly written eye-opener and I am surprised that it has been relegated to the back shelf where very few people will ever find it.</fullReview>

The story, for 1971, was very plausible. It was about this time that Astronauts were first allowed to skip the 30-day quarantine after being in space. It was thought that they could bring back some space germ that would wipe out mankind. Indeed, that is the premise of the film, except that the space germ is delivered by meteorite instead. The sets that were constructed were very expensive for the time because of a strong emphasis on realism. Look for good performances from the cast. I rented the film recently and I believe it's just as good today as it was in 1971. Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of this, pop some popcorn and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am sooooooo sorry that,at the age of 10 in 1971, I was not able to be aware of this movie in the theater. I enjoy reading critiques of this movie and think it deserves a website all its own. However, why so much character "bashing" of Dr. Ruth Leavitt's character? In the book, Dr. Leavitt was male. This was brilliant casting!!!! Kate Reid was the perfect choice !! Ms. Reid reminds me instantly of my college chemistry professor who would have acted (and have the same mannerisms) as Dr. Ruth Leavitt had she been in Dr. Leavitt's shoes. If they had cast some glam girl in the role, men,in 1971, would NEVER have take the time to hear anything "Dr. Leavitt" said in the movie.I've worked in a scientific field wherin people REALLY acted like the characters' roles in this movie, so I've followed, lock-step, the thought processes these characters demonstrate. I am totally enthralled by this movie. I have purchased the video and keep it available to watch as often as I can. Maybe it's because I can see how the Wildfire/Project Scoop scenario can actually play-out in the clandestine world of the federal government, and understand how a group of think-tankers (and government officials)could keep the whole event under wraps. I would really enjoy getting e-mail from other true Andromeda Strain fans as I'm nuts about this movie! I just WISH I could have been older in 1971 to see this movie in the theater and hear the opinions/discussions about the movie from peers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Childhood favorite remains inspirational</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this film for the first time late one night with my father and younger brother. I was five years old, I already knew I was going to be a scientist, and I was *riveted* to the show. The next day I *demanded* that my mother take me to the library to check out the book. Despite having seen the movie, I read the novel with as much excitement and anticipation as I watched the film. I questioned every adult I knew who had any sort of science or medical background about the ideas I found in the story.For someone who considers self-awareness, intelligence, and rational thought the defining and redeeming qualities of humanity, and the scientific method, from chipping stone tools to putting a man on the moon, the single greatest achievement of humanity thus far, it has always appeared to me that the arts have been overwhelmingly negative in their portrayal of science. The mad scientist and the evils of scientific progress, the superiority and 'humaneness' of emotionalism and impulsiveness over rational thought and diligence, all are staples of Western culture.The Andromeda Strain is different; it is realistic in that good and evil are identified with people and their motivations. However it is used, science is powerful: as a tool for learning, understanding, and interacting with nature. Wildfire, the facility where a cure for Andromeda is sought, we learn, was actually built for darker purposes. Despite that, it serves to help the team of scientists understand a radically different form of life, a form of life with a unique origin. The characters of the scientists, also, are real people; brilliant in their areas of knowledge, yet bearing characters flaws. In the end, despite arrogance, irresponsibility, quarrelsomeness, it is their passion to learn, to understand, to solve a significant and meaningful problem, which overcomes their flaws and focuses their talents.I remember this movie fondly, and watched it any time it came on TV (before the era of video tape). I still have an often-read paperback copy of the novel. I recently viewed the movie on video, and highly recommend it. There are a few isolated sections which are dated, but they don't harm the film. Since the film wasn't attempting to be "futuristic", I actually enjoy seeing the "advanced" technology of the time, and contrasting that with current technology. The special effects are still well-done. The scientific realism is due mainly to Chrichton; however, Wise deserves credit for keeping faithful to the novel. He doesn't add layers of glittery pseudo-technology and techno-babble.If you want to inspire a young scientist or engineer, or simply offer some counterbalance to all the science-is-evil sentiment that saturates both information and entertainment media, read the novel, then watch the movie. Show them that challenge and excitement can be found in constructive, collaborative, and intellectual activities. I am doing that now with each of my children; when they have all read the novel, we're going to have an "Andromeda Strain" party and watch the movie together. We'll discuss what parts were realistic, the social questions at issue when the movie was made (biological warfare, the space program, the beginnings of genetic engineering), and what science it actually about. I hope it will be as inspirational to them as it was for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Chrichton's scientific thriller worked well with Director Wise's love of things scientific (just look at what he did to Star Trek I), however in this case it works perfectly. After almost 30 years this film's sterile atmosphere still intrigues me. It is a scientific Sherlock Holme's mystery that infects itself with the human element of pride, arrogance, and stuborn ideas. That is what works well in this movie, the simple fact that the characters are human. They do not get along. They bicker, rant, and rave at times. Many find fault with this, but it is this human element that I found appealing (all except for Kate Reid's character...she was a man in the book). If you like techno-thrillers, with the emphasis on techno, then you will love this movie. Everything from discussing the organization of the cell division within an electron microscope to talking about amino acids.</fullReview>

DOne in 1971, before Watergate, it still showed the unthinkable- that we really couldn't trust our government.Also interesting, it got a "G" rating. Despite several nude scenes (including a topless dead woman) and numerous deaths, it got a G rating from the MPAA. Heck, you can't even see nudity in R movies anymore.The movie does drag in places and has long sections of exposition. Still, it shows a lot of Michael Crichton's craftsmanship, a science fiction writer who actually tried to understand the science.Also amusing are the amazing government supercomputers that have less power than your desktop you are reading this on... but that's okay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was born in 1971, so by rights this should seem pretty dated to me. It doesn't! Instead I found it totally intriguing and believable.This is in many ways a detective film. We start with a "murder" scene, and the four scientists proceed to analyse the evidence (two survivors and some contaminated debris) to hone in on the culprit. The big difference here is that the murderer is less than 200 microns across.I'm pretty tired of CGI animation, so I liked the realism achieved here using real scientific equipment, especially the robotic arms borrowed from a nuclear lab. I can understand some people might be put off by the jargon and cold, clinical atmosphere of the film. I think it's in a similar category to "Primer" - being that it is all about the science, and not so much about the fiction.Another great film from the 70s that is every bit as enjoyable today. I wish more science fiction films were as focused on getting the science part right... it makes for a more credible and engaging story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Grampa there are men with guns outside our house"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Hollywood there are men who have a habit of directing movies so brilliantly, they can scare the hell out of an unsuspecting audience. This 1971 film actually began in the fertile mind of a young medical student named Michael Crichton, while attending college. What director Robert Wise (The Day the Earth stood Still) did was to update it to the biological age and added his own brand of excitement. The result of his film was to have several Federal agencies investigate to learn what other biological terrors the military was trying to acquire. Furthermore, those of us residing in the state where 'Project Scoop' was said to have landed and later recovered, unsuccessfully tried to locate the actual town of Piedmont. Lastly, several agencies went on the air to reassure all citizens of the fact, this film about a celestial alien germ invading Earth, was all conjecture. That then is the effect a superior director can have on a very gullible audience. Truth is, the film is a superior work of art, based on what would happen if. The cast assembled is a magnificent group, beginning with convincing Arthur Hill as Dr. Jeremy Stone, David Wayne as believable Dr. Charles Dutton, the serious professor, and Kate Reid as jovial Ruth Leavitt who's rebellious style and dry humor make the film enjoyable. Then of course there's James Olson who plays unflappable and inquisitive Dr. Mark Hall with such aplomb, he morphs easily into a superb, but an unlikely hero. Once the menacing alien which is called "The Andromeda Strain" is removed from 'the scoop' and contained in the Wildfire Facility, every thing is under control. Unfortunately, the mutating bug is accidentally released and that's when everyone runs for cover as Andromeda will instantly kill all breathing creatures. If you're lucky enough to view this movie, remember the watch words at the beginning. "Warning, everything you are watching will soon be released to the press." Great Film. ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching that virus-type life form on electronic microscope rapidly mutating itself into a more complex version is one of the eeriest things I ever remember from a movie. This movie is exemplary in its approach to science fiction, a narrative with an imaginative script, skillful acting, and positive direction.The very first scene is reminiscent of a Twilight Zone style mystery; the population of a small town named Piedmont, Utah are wiped out, that is, all but two. Investigators, wearing protective gear that resembles astronaut pressure suits enter the town, looking at the tragedy, and the search for answers begins. One thing they soon learn is that a lethal plague has been unleashed, and their battle against the menace is also a race against the clock.The advanced scientific research center sequences make for delicious science fiction story-telling. The facility has not been completed, setting up a marvelously suspenseful closing scene. The acting by all parties is superior, the urgency of the situation is conveyed well. The film's strategy of revealing facts only as the characters learn them is riveting, involving the viewer in what is being learned. That's why the scene mentioned earlier is so effective: the scientists doing the research are shocked; and you are too.One of the great sci-fi movies of the early '70's. No light sabre fights, no phaser battles, no zombies. However, these "aliens" are just as scary as any of them as it depicts these events as if they could actually happen. Note: Beware of a recent horrible remake of this classic; make sure you have the 1971 version. And it is that original version that is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful sci-fi thriller, but dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give the original version of THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN my top rating, an 8, even though it often looks and feels like a 1950s Hollywood sci-fi flick. The reason is the constantly building tension and sense of impending doom as a lethal, mutating virus begins to devastate everything in its path. I also must credit director Robert Wise's refusal to turn the story into a bloated extravaganza (something he unfortunately would do a few years later with the first STAR TREK movie, as did the recent A&amp;E remake of THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN). Even though the film is long, it does not feel it at all. A big part of the credit must go to the cast, including veterans Arthur Hill, David Wayne and Kate Reid -- all forgotten names today, sadly -- as scientists trying to figure out how to stop the virus, which appears to have come from outer space. A great deal of the movie takes place within the closed confines of a secret underground lab where our intrepid scientists toil side-by-side for answers. There is one spooky sequence in a small town full of newly-minted corpses and the obligatory cutaways to a four-star general and the Army; otherwise, we stay close to the main characters, including James Olsen as a medical doctor (standing in for author Crichton) and Paula Kelly as his nurse. Everyone keeps busy peering through their electron microscopes and hitting colored buttons on a computer console that looks like it might have come from an early STAR TREK episode. No PCs or touch screens back in 1971, folks. For those under-30 who decide to watch the film for the first time, be advised: the scientists constantly shout in each other's faces, which I suppose could be realistic but seems funny. And please forgive the somewhat James Bond-ish finale. As silly as it may look today, it is still better than the finale of the recent remake.</fullReview>

The subject line and of this comment is just that. The actual agency that tries not only to study the mystery of space but analyze the biological hazards to intelligent life on Earth.The Andromeda Strain is very entertaining and provides a plot that has an appropriate climax point. I think the mode of interaction that the movie provides of the government and secrecy is not appropriate as the subject line denotes. We have at least this much transparency in government to tell viewers where to look for realism. The film makers could have been even more inventing with how the bio-hazard team exists. I would have like to see more development of the characters persona and depth. I think this could have given a better summarization and depth to the conclusion for a lasting memory of the film and its screen segments.Overall a good thriller and exciting look at fiction with the subject of non-fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening scene of this 1971 sci-fi film reveals how its creators have brilliantly updated the classic 1950s sci-films to the modern day era. In the old version, think the Blob, or Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the classic all-American town becomes the target of some other-worldly visitor. Because it's the 1950s, it's conceivable that the town can be isolated from the rest of the world and its residents have to fight this aliens or virus on their own. In Andromeda Stain, the opening scene has the police being alerted to a horrible incident discovered in the classic all American town. In the next scene, jet fighters are dispatched to investigate, they fly over the town and everyone is dead. So Andromeda takes off where the old movies would have ended. You just couldn't make any more movies set in isolated American towns in the 1970s so the directors didn't try, but instead used it as their starting off point. We soon find out that yes, an other worldly virus of some kind has visited the town killing all but two people. Here's the interesting twist, rather than being afraid of being contaminated, the movie spends a long time showing how the scientists sent to study the virus in the top secret facility have to be completely sanitized before they study it. The rest of the movie brilliant juxtaposes incredibly claustrophobic scenes inside this super duper top secret facility with expansive horizon views taken from aircraft. Although some reviewers have commented on how silly the special effects are I found they held up remarkably well considering the film is 35 years old. A definite watch for any sci-fi film fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have the book and the movie and I still read the book on occasion and still watch the movie as well. To this day they scare the S**T out of me because IT COULD HAPPEN! With all the diseases and viruses running rampant today, not to mention genetic tampering, a scenario like this is very possible, if not probable. The book has a lot more detail than the movie but that is the way it usually goes. As for putting a female into the role that in the book is portrayed as a male is probably nothing more than studio politics. I liked her very much and it was nice to see a female character that isn't a blonde, blue-eyed, big-breasted idiot! Read the book and watch the movie, just don't do it alone or at night! :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taught, Riveting Adaptation of the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book is, I think, one of Michael Crichton's most interesting and this film is arguably the best and most faithful adaptation of a Crichton novel. It's a fascinating and insightful science-fiction story with a rather unique, heart-pounding conclusion to the problem. For its part, this movie brings the story to film in an excellent and mostly very faithful manner. Aside from some minor details, the film contains all the book's major themes and issues, and even follows the book down to many of the very lines which the characters speak. While such complete faithfulness is clearly not necessary to adapt a book to film, or always even desirable, in this case it works out very well and emphasises how close to the book the film really is. It's particularly good because the book creates a somewhat singular pace and tension as it focuses on the isolated scientists in the lab centre trying to determine what is going on, and the film really brings this feeling to the screen.The style of filming and acting is methodical and clinical yet, rather than make this seem slow or boring, it makes the movie all the more tense and fascinating. It's not flashy but simple and clean and it succeeds wonderfully at bringing the viewer right into the tense and confusing situation facing the characters.</fullReview>

As such, it does a good job of showing a dead-serious lab that is built for a dead-serious event, and the type of people who would populate it (relatively dull ones, but competent.) Its flat style is intended entirely to *not* give the viewers 'peaks and valleys', but pull them into the world created -- a world of tension, not panic (until the end.)My only (minor) grouse is the flashbacks to the "Senate hearings", which kind of telegraph the ending...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, Yes, But This Was a "First...."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to watch "The Andromeda Strain" now, 29 years after it was made, and chuckle over its clichés: men in isolation suits, searching for a deadly biological agent; a futuristic, antiseptic underground laboratory, concealed beneath a cornfield in a remote part of the United States; people running through curving corridors, wearing primary-colored jumpsuits; brisk, semi-militaristic dialogue.It's been done so many times, it's easy to forget that "The Andromeda Strain" did it first.At the age of eleven, I saw this film during its initial theatrical release, and it still holds a special place in my heart. Recently, I rented it to watch with a lady friend who had never seen it, and I confess, as I sat with her in my darkened living room and tried to watch it through her eyes, it looked pretty dated and cheezy. Then she fell asleep, and I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the show.Don't rent "The Andromeda Strain" expecting to see anything new. Almost everything in it has now been overdone to the point of absurdity. But those of us who got to see it when it was first released in 1971 were lucky indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing sci-fi mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN is a sci-fi movie with a difference: there are no light sabres here, no outer space travel, instead this is a thinking man's thriller. That's no surprise given that the source material came from a Michael Crichton novel; viewers will note plenty of similarities between this and the likes of WESTWORLD, for instance.In any case, this is a thoughtful, slow-paced sci-fi mystery in which a team of experts try to work out the nature of a killer virus that may have come from space. Of course, the tension soon ramps up when it becomes apparent that they're working against the clock. Almost the entire film takes place in a remote installation and the claustrophobic setting becomes a character in itself.I have to admit that this wasn't one of my favourite movies; some of the middle section seems a little stodgy with not much happening to further the plot. Still, it definitely picks up for the race-against-the-clock climax, and it's not often these days that you see something genuinely fresh and original in the sci-fi genre, so I can see why it holds the status of a minor classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight, gripping, ultra-suspenseful Classic... Blu-ray: Stunning (considering the age) A:9 V:10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe me, not that I'm anybody special, but I don't give out '9's very often. I just now finished watching the new Blu-ray and it is frigg'n AWESOME!My Dad took me to see this at the theatre when I was about 12 and I remember VERY vividly that I laid awake all that night, absolutely TERRIFIED that some nasty virus was assuredly going to kill us all. I don't remember just how long I was traumatized by this film, but it was a while. Heh, my poor Dad; there was no way that he would have known the impact that this film would have had on his extremely imaginative and impressionable little p\/ssy of a son.Since then I have seen the film a couple of times, but it has been quite some time since the last time I watched this, but let me tell you, even as an adult now some 40 years later, I can attest to the fact that this is one of THE most effective Science Fiction Thrillers of it's type. Now of course, I can much more fully admire the wonderfully serious and precise way it was put together. I think that this film has probably evoked the most respect for Robert Wise from me so far, even though he has directed MANY excellent films. The structure, pacing, direction, bloody EVERYTHING was perfect. I think that this is probably one of THE very best examples of how when done properly, a film can create the maximum amount of tension, suspense, and an oppressive mood, BUT... without having to resort to graphic violence or anything obvious. The way Wise ratcheted up the unease and tension was nothing less than masterful. And even so... I must admit that at least for me, there was maybe ONE or TWO moments in the film that actually called up feelings of genuine Horror, even though nothing was even close to being overdone or explicit in any way. I WILL say though, without going into too much detail so as to be a Spoiler or anything, but there IS a scene with a monkey that is most disquieting. I DON'T think that they would allow such a scene to be filmed like that now (remember, then they did not have computers to simulate things like they do now) I love animals, but I'm not a PETA activist or anything, and let me tell you that that one scene was really intense. And that is pretty much the bottom line of this film. Robert Wise used EVERY method available, in the most artful way, to elicit the most powerful effect on the audience. But again, WITHOUT resorting to low-denominator crassness. TRUE quality and talented film making at it's very best.After seeing so many films, many from around that time period, I feel that this one stands out above most of the other supposed Sci Fi Classics around that time, building a palpable sense of dread and realism. I think it was the sense of realism that made it work so well; and usually I am one of the LAST people to extol 'Realism'. Usually I am scornfully denouncing it in movies, and particularly the people who can't get into a film unless it is totally 'Real' or 'Believable' to them. Usually I spit venom in the direction of their Mothers, Grandmothers, and various other female family members as I smugly look down scornfully on what, I feel in my superiority, is their less than pitiful imaginations.However...In THIS film, Wise very shrewdly ramped up the 'Realism' in order to draw us firmly into the situation as it was happening, and it damn well held you there in it's Death Grip until it was done with you. Needless to say, in this case, I will quite humbly make an exception.As you can likely tell by now, I hold this film in the HIGHEST regard. Although I am usually quite put off by an overly 'Realistic' style when it comes to film making, especially when such 'Realism' eschews any imagination or suspension of disbelief or stretching yourself a little because it has to be OH SO 'Believable', I was fully held in the spell of this near-Documentary approach to a Science Fiction Thriller. And, of course the introduction at the beginning of the movie sets the tone beautifully.I would say that IF you are the kind of person who appreciates the simplicity of just DAMN good film making, and doesn't need a ton of special effects (although the ones incorporated here were quite ahead of their time and VERY effective) or if you don't require a boatload of sadism and gore, then you should very much enjoy this excellent and powerful Classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect film experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard of and read the work of Michael Crichton by chance in my early teens, and found him to be one of the most engaging writers I'd come across. That position still holds; his novels are beautifully paced and expertly crafted, with character driven narratives and well constructed dialogue. As a result, I was sceptical as to how well this would come across in film. I'd seen Jurassic Park before I'd read it and found it very entertaining, though reading the novel highlighted how much of the original story had been 're-made for Hollywood'. Thankfully, The Andromeda Strain does not suffer from the obligatory 'magic touch' of Hollywood.It is paced excellently, steadily building tension whilst thoroughly and accurately exploring how science might discover and potentially exploit extraterrestrial life. The characters are realistic, both in appearance and behaviour, each with their own unavoidable faults that add significantly to the story. As a result, there is an unnerving undertone of man's authority, the right of humanity to conquer the unknown, best described by Dr. Stone - "we will understand it and destroy it". By the end, you will not root for mankind.Suffice to say, this is one of the best films I've ever seen, easily the best science fiction film. Thoroughly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Science fact, not science fiction..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Working with the likes of Orson Welles and Val Lewton served Robert Wise in good stead: he moved effortlessly from one genre to another, leaving a series of classics in his wake. From the start, he was an outstanding director: CURSE OF THE CAT PEOPLE was hailed by critics at the time of its release as a movie well worth seeing. THE BODY SNATCHER, with Boris Karloff at his absolute best, just happens to be one of the most beautifully crafted fright films ever made. Wise's 1963 version of Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE, brought to the big screen as THE HAUNTING, is the CITIZEN KANE of haunted house movies. Wise was also responsible for a number of SF masterpieces, not the least of which was THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (whose Klaatu may in fact have been the inspiration for the Spock character in STAR TREK). THE MONOLITH MONSTERS, one of the better early entries in the classic SF films sweepstakes, had an interesting take on the notion of "invasion." There were no horny aliens out to kidnap Earth women. The approach was much more "science-fictional." When THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN hit town in 1971, one of the things that I found intriguing was the ad campaign, which featured the line quoted above. Like most everything else he did, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was Wise (and writer Michael Crichton) at his thoughtful best. The movie has topnotch fx, top calibre performances, and one of the most frightening "monsters" in the history of Science Fiction films. The almost documentary-like approach is effective and manages by dint of understatement to convey a mounting tension that becomes nigh unbearable by film's end. The bus trip home the day I saw THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was a quiet one: I was lost in thought, pondering the possibilities presented by Wise and Crichton. To this day, it's a fascinating film.</fullReview>

However, the film does a fair job of displaying the human side of the scientists, none of whom are that appealing, and it looks scientifically accurate.The set of the underground bio-lab is a worthwhile example of late 1960's / early 1970's vision of an ultra-modern secret government facility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ok, I admit that I was never great at math and science, but with a 140 IQ, I'd like to consider myself fairly intelligent, therefore, when I offer up my opinion on the sheer brilliance of "The Andromeda Strain," I feel that I am unequivocally justified. Although this cinematic triumph appears dated by today's standards, the premise and execution of the tenets of the film are, for all intents and purpose, timeless. The plot is extremely well developed and the scenes flow almost flawlessly into a nearly perfect scientific masterpiece. This film is so well executed and documented, and clearly well ahead of its time, that, albeit the dramatic prose, it could almost stand alone as a scientific documentary. Andromeda's allusion to computer algorithms, medical studies, and even subtle nuances, such as the sound of public address systems in the background, adds to its attractiveness, and gives the audience a true appreciation of the film's talented production and direction team. "The Andromeda Strain" is a rare situation whereby the film may actually be as enthralling as the book. If you have a child mature enough to watch this movie, I highly recommend that you let them. For all parents out there who are hopeful their children will express an interest in biomedical research, this film is essential viewing! However, please be forewarned there are some disturbing scenes involving animal cruelty that should be approached with extreme caution. Notwithstanding minor flaws that almost all films possess, this is an awesome gem! See it !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Tries Too Hard To Overwhelm The Viewer With Technology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of "The Andromeda Strain" is hardly unique. A deadly organism (this one from outer space, which has been brought back to earth by a crashed satellite) is loose and threatening a world-wide plague, and a team of scientists is brought together to try to figure out the solution. There are a lot of movies that follow the same basic story outline. Most of those movies tend to place most of the emphasis on the organism and its effects - on the "plague" caused by it, if you will. This movie might explain why those other movies place so much emphasis on the organism and its effects.Basically, my feeling as I was watching this was that the writers chose to place far too much emphasis on the technology involved in the fight against the organism. So we spend most of our time inside this futuristic facility called "Wildfire" that's full of fancy (for the day) computers and medical technology and lasers and awfully impressive looking suits. I had the impression throughout that the movie was trying to dazzle me with the technology it was depicting rather than with the story it was portraying. I don't argue that there was some suspense, particularly near the end as the organism was let loose and the facility automatically set itself to a self-destruct status, but that then led to the very cliché "countdown" as the only one who can stop the self- destruct has to do it while the computer voice is saying "three minutes and thirty seconds to self-destruct," etc. In the background there's a still relevant portrayal of the debate between science and politics (should the president listen to the advice of the scientists or not?) The cast for the most part works pretty well together and there is a decent enough mystery about the old man and the baby and why they survived the initial infection when the rest of their small town in New Mexico was killed when the satellite brought the organism to town.But the technology part of this was overdone, to the point at which it detracted from the story. Again, my feeling was that the viewer was being directed not to the fight against the organism but to the wonders of the technology being portrayed. That was a weakness. The story could have been better developed and better portrayed, and it could have been far more exciting and suspenseful. (5/10)</fullReview>

Four top scientists are assembled to unravel the mystery of a deadly substance that has fallen to earth inside a satellite. An entire town, where it was found, is wiped out save for a crying baby and a wino. The survivors and the satellite are taken to a state of the art biological research facility to figure out what the substance is, how it works, and why it killed the townspeople and just as importantly, why it didn't kill the two survivors. Arthur Hill is perfect as the Nobel Laureate Dr. Stone. David Wayne, Kate Reid and James Olson are all quite good as his team. This film covers the entire range of the scientific realm from technology, to politics, to Murphy's law, to scientists egos. Of course the technology in the film is dated (1971), but the interaction between the team members is entertaining and Murphy's Law rears it's head at every turn. The supporting cast is particularly good, and Robert Wise's direction is on the money. Read the book and watch the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wise film to let others know</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andromeda strain, based loosely on an experimental satellite, which crashed to earth in Nevada. Though hardly as deadly as the movie version it did give some insight as to whether we really are alone in this universe. A small town called Piedmont new Mexico was victim to a crashed satellite for which a local doctor decided to examine for its contents. In that moment, the entire town died albeit for two survivors from an unknown germ, which attached itself to the interior scoop device. Now within the time to call in the Hazmet suits, a professor who designed a secret lab called wildfire, brought in three more specialists in fields of microbiology, physics, and medicine. Using these new recruits, they devise a way to try and stop the germ from killing anyone else. However, as with all unknowns the germ was a creature made in the universe, made with nothing more than the simplest of cells to pro create. But doing so, meant death to those who were exposed to it like Piedmont. I thought this was a great film, to see an actual set constructed entirely for the movie with five floors to show cleanliness higher than the next. Or to see how decontamination is done in stages. Micheal Crighton who wrote the book brought a horrifying example of how or why the governments use satellites to find such samples from space, without fully realizing the consequences to follow. Stone,(Arthur Hill) is head of wildfire, while Hall (James Olsen) is the odd man out in case of a detonation warning to wipe out wildfire for reasons of germ escape. In the middle is Ruth (Kate Reid) who I thought was an excellent addition to adding slight comedy to the terror of biological hazards such as this. But last was Dutton (David Wayne) who in my opinion fit the role of a physics doctor to a 'T'. All in all, this was a brilliant film about the dangers of space, and why we should leave things alone as it is. Although no man or woman can foresee the dangers coming to us, hence the idea of a satellite to monitor that for which we cannot see. Highly recommended to all ages above fourteen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...or: How I Learned To Start Worrying and Love Dystopian Science-Fiction of the 1970s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A returning space probe crashes to Earth in modern-day America, leaving the population of a small town mysteriously wiped out. As the military prevaricate around how to act, it's up to a group of scientists, sequestered covertly to an underground bunker, to figure out the cause and avert a potential disaster.The Andromeda Strain was the first filmed adaptation of a work by author Michael Crichton, later the creator of ER and author and/or screenwriter behind mainstream mega-hits of variable quality from Jurassic Park and Westworld to Congo and, ahem, Twister, and while he may have sullied his name somewhat with his more ludicrous later stories, this early work from his hit 1969 novel benefits enormously from his years as a medical student, and the believable, procedural detail that he brings to bear.This is not to say that we don't get a fair helping of the "stuff" of science-fiction. There's plenty of futuristic (for 1971) hardware, a form of alien life (although unlike any seen in cinema before) and even a few lasers near the climax. But the meat of movie lies elsewhere, principally with the drama going on between our band of lab-coat technicians who are, uniquely for that most short-changed breed, real people. Complex, difficult, tired, argumentative, largely unattractive, and totally believable as they struggle to deal with the situation they have found themselves dumped in. Particularly wonderful is the sharp- tongued, dour-faced, chain-smoking researcher essayed by Kate Reid, who brings a much needed but entirely natural sardonic wit to the otherwise dry proceedings.Also effective, and again reflecting the changing attitudes of its time, is the largely negative impression the movie gives of the politicians and military commanders on its periphery, who are either incompetent or untrustworthy to some degree. It's a common stance to a modern audience, but must have been pretty coruscating at the time and reflects a sense of malaise that feels very much appropriate to its era and yet still rings true today.Marshalling the project is director Robert Wise, who has often been looked down upon somewhat as something of a journeyman, a studio man... or to put it harshly, as some would, a hack. Generally a director for hire, who rarely, if ever, autered personal projects, I suspect he'd have no problem with that description of him, but that should not lead us to underestimate his rare skill as a filmmaker. In a remarkably varied career that began in the 1930s as film editor on, amongst others, Citizen Cane no less, he has directed several stone cold classics, from The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951, and the only science-fiction to rise above the pulp b-movie nonsense of its day), West Side Story, The Haunting (1963, and still one of the most effectively chilling ghost stories ever filmed), and The Sound Of Music. Yes! Hate it all you like, the third most successful movie of all time. He was quite some hack then.Nearly forty years into his career by this point, Wise brings a freshness and daring to the project. The visual look is bleak, almost documentary like. The research centre that the film spends most of its running time inside looks and feels wholly believable in spite of a fairly modest budget. He recruited FX guru Douglas Trumball, who had worked not long before on 2001, and together they ensured a rigorous authenticity in the design of the technology involved, such as the communication screens, which actually worked for real, rather than being post-production optical effects as would have been the norm for the day.There are some remarkable visual flourishes. In particular the use of split screens (back in vogue recently with its (over)use in the series "24"), which, as well as adding to the documentary look, are deployed, quite unexpectedly, in dream sequences which are at once both stark and abstract and infinitely more authentic feeling than a thousand misty dissolves that had previously been the visual shorthand for almost as long as cinema itself. In a few seemingly effortless, but intellectually rigorous moves, Robert Wise showed just how effectively he could make a film absolutely modern in look and feel (at a time when a young, hungry breed of independent spirited filmmakers were turning the old Hollywood studio system on its head) , yet completely without drawing attention to itself.It's not a perfect movie to be sure. The obsessive procedures used during the "descent" into the complex drag on rather too long, and the finale indulges itself the venerable cliché of a countdown race that was rather clearly signposted from the off. But despite these minor flaws, The Andromeda Strain delivers in bleak, taught tension with a satisfyingly paranoid atmosphere and effectively essays a disturbing vision of an all too plausible disaster scenario.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Andromeda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a really great film, well conceived, well directed and well acted. The story is also very exciting, in an admittedly subdued manner, quite scary, and is food for thought(especially for people who moan about taxes!). I would definitely recommend it as a film to see, although it does seem, as other posters have mentioned, to have suffered terrible injustice in the conversion to DVD. I want, however, to add a comment to the person who submitted the review that I read previously; they hoped that the film wouldn't have a "remake", but didn't point out that this film is actually a "remake" (very loosely, I must emphasise) of a BBC television series of the mid 1960's. The director does pay homage to the British predecessor on several occasions, not least during the closing titles, but the point should still be made, as the original was filmed years earlier and on a misers budget. This film captures the sense of creeping doom, political ineptitude and human terror that the original version could only convey to a much more limited audience, and it must be said, is a general improvement on the already inspired original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the cable TV remake first, then wash the bad taste out of your mouth with this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one movie genre that ages the worst, it's science fiction. Technology has advanced so far and so fast that settings which once seemed advanced, now appear primitive. Circumstances that once boggled the imagination, now seem commonplace. Challenges that were once staggering, now come off as corny. It takes a really good science fiction movie to hold up over time. The Andromeda Strain is THAT good.Based on the novel by Michael Crichton, this film tells the story of a military satellite that returns to Earth with a deadly organism from outer space and the team of scientists called up to stop it from destroying all humanity. Dr. Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill) is the man in charge of the team and the one who spearheaded the U.S. government's preparation for alien contamination. He's joined at the secret Wildfire lab by Dr. Charles Dutton (David Wayne), Dr. Mark Hall (James Olson) and Dr. Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid). They have to find out what killed the entire town of Piedmont, New Mexico and what they find is a deadly life form unlike anything ever seen. But to defeat the Andromeda Strain, they must also grapple with blind chance and their own human weaknesses.This is a tense and suspenseful tale that blends together scientific mystery and social commentary in an emotional pressure cooker. It understands what all great suspense stories understand, that you can't just keep cranking the tension up to a higher and higher level because you either wear out the audience or you go too far and end up an unintentional comedy. Instead of just increasing the heat, the story sets off little sparks and allows them to simmer until they all come together at the end in a big conflagration.Visually, The Andromeda Strain does look a bit dated. There's really no way around the fact that the real 1971 technology on display is primitive by today's standards and the fictional high tech cooked up for the movie looks even worse. It doesn't detract much from the story because it's not about the technology, but about the people surrounded by all the machinery.Director Robert Wise does a very nice job grounding the story in as much personal and practical reality as he can. There are moments when he uses a split screen to let the audience see what the characters are seeing and what they are thinking, which is quite effective, and a scene where a monkey is exposed to Andromeda is as unsettling as anything produced by modern movie magic. Wise also successfully walks a fine line suggesting that what we're watching is a true story or at least based on one, without compromising the dramatic integrity of the film.The Andromeda Strain is also a great example of writing and acting working hand-in-hand to spin an entertaining yarn. The four main characters serve more as archetypes than supposedly real people. Dr. Stone is the voice and presence of The Establishment and is always about following the plan and doing things by the book. Dr. Leavitt is the cantankerous counterculture that feels hemmed in by people like Stone and envious of people like Dr. Hall, who represents the bold humanist that still pushes against the boundaries of society. Dr. Dutton is a weary misanthrope , speaking to the part of us that gets jaded and bored with ordinary existence until that existence is genuinely threatened. The drama of this film doesn't come from the external threat of the alien organism. It comes from the forceful and occasionally comic interplay of these broadly drawn and sharply portrayed characters.If you'd like to watch a sci-fi flick that cares more about thinking than explosions or computer generated images, I think you'd enjoy The Andromeda Strain. However, I'd strongly recommend you watch this movie if you've already seen the cable TV mini-series remake. In this case, watching the original AFTER the remake is the way to go. Viewing the movie first will massively emphasize how much dumber, convoluted, boring and immature the mini-series is. Watching the overdone mini-series first, on the other hand, will only increase the enjoyment of seeing the story done right.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Spoiler/plot- 1971, Andromeda Strain, A little known satellite returns from deep space and lands near a populated town. Everyone in the town dies strangely in minutes. A secret underground research base and it's super secret scientist crew must find out what killed the town and how to stop more killing.*Special Stars- Arthur Hill, David Wayne, James Olson, Kate Reid, Paula Kelly. Robert Wise directed.*Theme- The evil government is always trying to hide matters from it's people.*Based on- Michael Crichton's book.*Trivia/location/goofs- The film was shot more documentary style than narrative and achieved a successful film with the viewer. Was a big Universal Studio produced film of it's time. Opening film's credit is designed to deceive the film viewer into thinking this film is a Govt. documentary about a real subject. Split screen editing of the time period used by Universal Studios first. Wildfire Lab was the most elaborately made set interior for it's time, cost $300,000.00 and was 70 ft by 30 ft in a sound stage hole sub floor. The monkey's death was simulated when a monkey cage was on oxygen and opened to a set full of carbon dioxide, monkey passes out and off camera he is immediately revived with medical crew staff.*Emotion- A film with real dynamic tension. This film is a rich and luxurious film with great acting and well directed. The subject matter is suspense fully handled and well paced to provide the viewer with an entertaining and memorable emotional ride. This film is one of the best covering science fiction matters. Plays well on our fears of space exploration and government black projects on the world's public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Deliberation of Epidemiology</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the center of The Andromeda Strain is a really tremendous idea couched in a bittersweet reality. The idea is not about science but about entertainment: Once upon a time (as recently as 1971) you could make a movie that showed people reckoning with their own intelligence to solve a problem, and that alone was sufficiently engaging that explosions, violence, chases and 2-dimensional villains were not allowed to intrude as the cop-outs they are. The bittersweet reality is: that moment is now gone, receding into the past... to make way for what has been called "The Dumbest Generation" who don't like to think very much.How incredible that audiences were offered a sometimes superficially dull movie, under the firm understanding that in reality there's nothing as exciting as the human mind, and the process of reasoning through a problem (well, ...if you've developed your mind). Delightfully, no one is turning the exploration of science into a excuse to invoke a religious bogeyman (Contact). One qualm is the lack of explanation for what purpose or end such a virulent virus can have when its kills its hosts so rapidly, with its existential potential halted shortly after.Money has been spent. Most of the sets are at the very least, pretty interesting. Wise and Crichton are definitely aware of Kubrick and Clarke's superior work in 2001. The movie is guilty of just two cop-outs: the horrid, miserable, combative hag/misanthrope Ruth is provided as a scapegoat, and the computer countdown to self-destruct is not a good enough idea for a movie this deliberate. The movie features the least interesting deployment of split screen I've ever seen (Wise is not a terribly imaginative guy), and the camera work is nothing special. The decision to shoot this in a conventional aspect ratio is unfathomable. I suspect this would be a much better known and loved movie with a wide screen process. The sets, technology and ideas are just begging for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Michael Crichton Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise directed this engrossing thriller based on a novel from Michael Crichton, about a team of four scientists(played by James Olsen, Arthur Hill, David Wayne, and Kate Reid) who try to isolate an extraterrestrial virus brought back to Earth by a satellite that crashed in Piedmont New Mexico, killing most of the residents, except an old(alcoholic) man, and a baby. The team try to find out the connection between such two entirely different people, in hopes it will lead them to a cure.Interesting and well-acted film is smart and effectively directed, with many nice touches, and a stark atmosphere in the decimated town, contrasted nicely with the clinical setting in the protective underground laboratory where they study the alien virus, which threatens the world if unleashed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great example of hard sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Andromeda Strain is a rare example of pure, hard science fiction. By that I mean a film that is all about ideas and concepts, as opposed to action and adventure. And it's all the better for it. The screenplay is very similar indeed to the source novel, written by Michael Crichton. Much credit for this has to go to the versatile Robert Wise who directed it. Wise produced a wide variety of films in various genres including film-noir, horror and musicals. Here he shows a pretty clear understanding of science fiction. There is an over-all under-played feel to the whole film. The characters are under-stated and believable, while the action never strays into the far-fetched even when the events depicted are incredible.The story is about a killer extraterrestrial organism that infects a small town when a space probe crash lands nearby. A group of scientists are called together to find out how to stop it from spreading further.Interestingly, the film fuses science fiction with a strain of paranoia that was very commonplace in early 70's America. This strand came from a general cynicism with government in that period. In this case, once again the powers that be are not seen to be acting in the people's interest. This combination of political pessimism with hard sci-fi is a very effective one and one of the reasons for the film's success. Aside from these themes, The Andromeda Strain also incorporates another facet of early 70's American film-making and that is a tendency to experiment. Notably, we have very interesting utilisation of split-screen which gives the film a visually pleasing aspect. In addition, the set design is very nice, with the underground installation very effectively presented. So, in effect, this is a pretty impressive combination of sober science fiction, paranoid thriller and experimental cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Consider it a benchmark...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>for all Science Fiction films. My father took me to see this film when I was 13. I came away from the theater with two impressions. Firstly, how kind of the theater owners to provide seats for very large people (they were actually love seats for couples, I guess,) and secondly, WHAT A FREAKIN' AWESOME MOVIE!!! Like the first couple of seasons of CSI, it presumed that its audience actually paid attention to and retained the information disseminated in HS science class. If not, the film was sure to spark curiosity and a desire to learn more. That was my case. I'm not a scientist or engineer or anything as highly technical as all that, but this film made me interested enough to pay attention to cause and effect in everything around me, physically and philosophically. And that has improved my skills as an artisan and teacher. I recently watched it for the second time in my life and was pleasantly surprised to see a progressively multicultural, mixed gender cast. At the time of its release that did not faze me, having grown up in the neighborhood immediately surrounding Columbia University (Southwest Harlem) in the '60s; but having been awash in the mostly androcentric /caucacentric films spewing out of "H'wood" for at least the past 2 decades, I was slightly jarred by the difference, and dismayed at my surprise.But enough about its effect on me. Andromeda Strain relies not upon flash-bang or histrionics to keep its viewers in their seats, but on quiet, intelligent suspense. The premise (a satellite returns to earth carrying something that instantly kills all life forms in the vicinity and must be immediately contained, studied and if necessary, destroyed) is possible, and the protagonists (scientists and military personnel) are not uber-beautiful, heroic demigods, but real people such as we may know in our actual day to day lives. They are all played by very fine actors, not stars too bright to look at directly, and I especially appreciated the role played by the late Ms Reid- that of a sceptical wisecracking microbiologist with a bent for "insubordination". The characterizations here are not distinctly black and white; in fact, there is no concrete "enemy" but an organism which, as David Wayne's character mentions, may or may not have intended the resultant effect- much like the first European visitors to the New World, carrying diseases, like measles, to whom the indigenous populations had no immunities. Robert Wise and Nelson Gidding have accomplished what seems to be an impossible task for the majority of directors and screenwriters- bringing an original story(by M. Crichton) to the screen without bowdlerizing it, or amputating information perhaps tangential but ultimately necessary to the whole picture. Boris Leven, William Tuntke and Ruby Levitt created an atmosphere on par with "2001..." , my other fave "vintage" SciFi film. I do recommend this film to anyone who doesn't mind being prodded to think at the same time as being entertained.Yes, I realize that this is a 40+ year old film, but while the technology may be rather outdated, the actors' characterizations are not. Technology does change. People haven't.PS Any girl/woman who has cut herself shaving would want one of those Xenon defoliator thingy(s). Sure beats the crap out of the torture device with the coils.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cast of Unknowns???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I see a lot of reviewers here claim this movie has no well-known actors in it. I beg to differ. David Wayne is quite well known! He was a VERY WELL KNOWN actor of stage, screen and TV. True, he was more of a supporting character actor than a leading man, but he was a BIG character actor despite his rather short stature. He is magnificent in the film "Adams Rib" with Tracy and Hepburn! He made several other important films too such as "The Portrait of Jenny" "How to Marry a Millionaire" and "The Tender Trap". More importantly he WON TWO Tony Awards for his work on Broadway. As a matter of fact, he won the very first Tony for Best Supporting Actor in a Musical (for Finain's Rainbow) in 1947 and later in 1954 he won the Tony for Best Actor (for Teahouse of the August Moon) --in the role later played on film by Marlon Brando. He also played the original Ensign Pulver in "Mr Roberts" on Broadway. He did lots of TV work before making this film as well, including playing The Mad Hatter on the Batman series. He could do both comedy and drama equally well plus he could sing and dance. He was hardly unknown. In fact, he was the reason I watched this film. I turned on the TV, which I usually keep set to TCM, but I was about to switch over to a news channel when I heard Wayne's voice and decided to watch the film just because he was in it. Now I admit the film was quite good for many, many reasons besides Wayne. It was suspenseful, intelligently written, and it had a good cast all round. I would have enjoyed the movie even without Wayne, but I doubt I would have watched it in the first place if Wayne's role in it had not caught my attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And one of the best movies regardless of the genre. Though the movie is a bit different of the book, there are no mistakes in it. Everything happens in time, everything has a cause and a consequence. Both the movie and the book makes me think that all the events in it could happen. Or had happened. Unlike many other sci-fis this one is more science than fiction. And it even has some funny scenes. I have seen it many times yet and I'm still enjoying every minute. I know complete dialogs by head. I remember nearly the whole movie. :) I haven't seen the 2008 version yet but I read some reviews and I think the remake doesn't come near the original one.

		<fullReview>With 'The Andromeda Strain (1971),' the versatile Robert Wise ('The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)') returns to science-fiction, and it's one of the purest sci-fis films I've seen to date, presumably following in the footsteps of '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' three years earlier (special effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull worked on both films). When a military satellite falls to Earth, it triggers a mysterious biological outbreak that wipes out the population of a small Arizona town. The nation's top scientists suspect a pathogenic organism of extraterrestrial origin, and initiate a pre-planned defence strategy designed to counter such a scenario.There's not all that much drama in this film ? at least, not drama of the conventional sort. Survivors of the outbreak are taken to a sterile government facility, guarded by the most rigorous quarantine procedures, and the scientific team begins to study, analyse, experiment. Can the organism be isolated? How is it transmitted between hosts? How does the organism grow, divide, and mutate? As a zoologist of sorts, I found even the most technical details utterly fascinating. I suppose it nourished the scientist in me ? oddly enough, not many science-fiction films have ever actually done that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's spreading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not read the novel upon which this is based, nor any other Crichton. This is the third Wise picture I've seen, and ranges in the middle... not as good as The Day The Earth Stood Still, but better than Star Trek: The Motion Picture. Something that stands out about this one is the experimental visuals seen a couple of places in it. Apart from a tough-to-ignore sound or two that they use on several occasions, the audio is quite good. In the twenty years that passed between that well-known Day of cessation of movement of the Earth, not much has developed in the director's subtlety as far as presenting the main point of the film to the audience. The political opinions are rather obvious. The acting is impressive, in spite of the lack of recognizable names or faces. There is some tension in this, particularly near the end. The pacing can seem odd, with the movie spending time on unexciting sequences that do nothing to further the plot, after the main conflict has been somewhat established. The effects are well-done, and are integrated so successfully that you don't notice them. The production value is high, nothing looks plain, and the design is nice. The atmosphere is achieved well. This has a non-linear time-line, and in general requires attention paid to it. If you're into intelligent mystery/sci-fi, I'd say it's worth it. There isn't a lot of language, nor is it strong, next to no(literally two cases) sexuality/nudity, nor any violence. Thematic material and certain sights are potentially disturbing. I recommend this to any fan of the genres, the people and/or the concept. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Released the same year (1971) as the sci-fi classic THX-1138, Andromeda Strain directed by Robert Wise, based on the late Michael Crichton (who died recently this past year, 2008) is a serious "what-if" extra-terrestial biological event movie based on the science of the time along with the late 60s early 70s special photographic effects - split screens (used in a rather unique, not often duplicated fashion) along with a simple but effective plot devices that are rarely overdone. The beginning B-rated movie acting and performances eventually make way for a 2001: A Space Odyssey tour-de-force examination of the technology - likely fantasmic for the time - and then a classic thrill ride climax along with a scientific climax and resolution rarely obtained in movies nowadays. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The science behind "The Andromeda Strain" may be a big crock of hooey, but the people who made it do a good job of at least making it seem credible, which goes a long way toward making the film much more effective as a sci-fi thriller than others of its type.Robert Wise was a good, solid director. He had a distinctly mainstream sensibility as a filmmaker, but his mainstream films were always especially assured and intelligent. He does a great job keeping this talky sci-fi film moving, and it's really creepy, especially in this age when the media is just waiting to pounce on the THE BIG ONE, the deadly virus that's going to emerge and wipe out humanity. The ending to "The Andromeda Strain" is a bit easy -- the virus just evolves to become harmless and floats away in a big cloud -- and comes as a bit of a let down after all of the work the film does to create just an atmosphere of tense dread up to that point. But the rest of the movie is good enough that the limp ending doesn't make the rest of the film feel like a waste of time."The Andromeda Strain" was nominated for two Oscars, one for Best Art Direction (long-time Wise collaborator Boris Leven and William Tuntke) and Best Film Editing (Stuart Gilmore and John W. Holmes), both of which were strongly deserved.Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Procedural sci-fi</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Within the logic confines of the Cold War and the eternal quest for the upper hand in annihilation, space becomes a frontier for seeking the next new biological weapon. When a US satellite crash-lands in a remote town of Piedmont in New Mexico a sudden outbreak of a cosmic threat causes almost the entire town to die in mid-step. The terrifying reality of an uncontrollable epidemic initiates a clandestine Wildfire project, where the finest scientific minds are whisked away to a secure underground facility with state of the art technology and a self-detonating nuclear device set to explode to prevent any potential outbreak. The project itself was formed by a group of prominent scientists led by Dr. Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill) specifically for this eventuality: to counterattack any extraterrestial form of life, that could cause a deadly epidemic. Together with fellow scientists Charles Dutton (David Wayne), Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid) and Mark Hall (James Olson) they descend into the facility, where they attempt to isolate the new life form and diagnose the two survivors of Piedmont: an crackpot drunkard and a helpless infant.Transcending into Robert Wise's feature is a prolonged pay-off, mostly focused on the procedural side of such a scenario, slowly building the story and only about midway do we finally get down to actually finding out what the titular Andromeda strain is, which in turn leads to an intense and riveting finale. Meanwhile however we snail downward the facility with five separate levels - each with scenes of progressive sterilisation. The journey to the heart of the facility, where the nitty gritty essence of the research starts, is essentially tedious, albeit serving its purpose of setting up the final act and acknowledging the relapsed tension that such an occurrence would create. Although the fate of the world being at hand, the road to salvation is slow, meticulous and affords no space for a misstep. Despite the slow unwinding there is also little in the way of character development, possibly only Kate Reid's cantankerous Ruth offering a stronger imprint on proceedings, which are otherwise dominated by the science and the crawling Armageddon.Midway the lethargic pacing stalled my interest, but once the story unfolds all the pieces fall into place delivering a high-tempo ending within this otherwise sedentary movie. Coupled with arguably the most exact scientific jargon in sci-fi features history and a overall believable background (despite some ridiculous mumbo-jumbo by one of the scientists about the possibility of microorganisms being sentient) delivers a sombre piece that can bore most, but will engage those who offer the movie their mind and body.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this film and have seen it several times. However, I also realize that it's not the sort of film that many, if not most, would not particularly enjoy. Why? Well, the film is very slow-paced, crammed with scientific jargon and has nothing but supporting actors--no big stars. It's obvious that this Michael Crichton story is not marketed to the same mass audience as his "Jurassic Park".The film begins in a tiny desert town. A space probe launched by the US has crashed there and inexplicably the townspeople all appear to be dead. A crack team of scientific experts are then mobilized in a high-tech and super-top secret base to find out what caused these deaths and how to stop it from potentially destroying everyone on Earth."The Andromeda Strain" features actors who are very familiar but whose names you won't readily recognize. This is because the stars are people who usually were supporting actors in movies and mostly TV during this era. Arthur Hill, James Olsen and David Wayne are these very recognizable but generally unheralded actors. This was good because it heightened the realism of the film, however I think the practical reason for this is because Crichton was not yet famous and the studios really didn't want to commit huge money to the film. Plus, a lot was already spent on special effects and equipment for the movie. Regardless, it worked well and the movie was fascinating. Just don't be put off by the occasionally glacial pace and the slightly silly ending involving lasers and nuclear detonations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scientific Thriller At Its Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SYNOPSIS: The US Military goes looking for germ warfare in outer space and gets more than they bargained for.CONCEPT IN RELATION TO THE VIEWER: Scientists can really screw up the world, and in the end, are often the only ones that can save it.PROS AND CONS: I stumbled across this Widescreen LaserDisc copy on ebay and snatched it up as soon as I could. I had been looking for it a for a long time, having only seen the film once when I was in my teens. It had made a lasting impression on me back then and I wanted to see if it still held up 30 years later.I wasn't disappointed. This is a really excellent film. I have always been a big, big fan of Robert Wise, and this film is an excellent example of why he is such a good director. This film was born out of the paranoia of the late 1960s and early 70s when the idea of scientifically induced genocide was becoming as much a fear as nuclear annihilation. I previously reviewed another film in this genre that came out about the same time called "The Satan Bug". This film is by far the better of the two, with much better scientific detective work and pacing.The viewer has to pay close attention to the script and the acting to really understand what is going on in the film. The plot keeps you guessing on several levels until the end of the film, which is pretty climatic. As an added bonus, if you click the graphic of the title to the film, you can view the Trailer for the film that I have uploaded to YouTube. In the trailer, Robert Wise indicates that the real star of the film is the set of the Wildfire scientific laboratory where most of the films takes place. He isn't kidding either. Even though this film is over 35 years old, it does not look dated by scientific standards. I found it amusing that at the end of the trailer, it indicates that 'No one will be seated during the last 10 minutes of the film'.....as if that would give something away or be distracting. It wouldn't, but it is an interesting piece of hype that surrounded the film when it was first released.I really can't think of too many cons in this film. The acting, cinematography, script, set design, sound, are all impressive. The only quirk in the film that I found a bit annoying was Jackson's seeming incomprehension of what the "Nuclear Key" that he was assigned to wear was to be used for. For some reason he keeps thinking that it is his responsibility to blow up the Wildfire station if something goes wrong. He is constantly reminded by his peers, that he is the only one that can shut off the self destruct.I am surprised that Hollywood has not tried to make a remake of this film, but I doubt they could do it justice or really improve on this 1971 version. There was a made for television remake of the film in 2008, but I didn't see it, nor would I really care to. Some films are just meant to stand on their own and be classics. This is one of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a military satellite crashes near a remote desert town, investigators find that the town is still intact but that the bodies of the townsfolk are lying lifeless in the streets. Further investigations makes them believe that a virus from outer space has been brought down to Earth. Tests show it to be very virulent and so as secret tests are done to find an antidote, plans are being made to nuke the town before it can spread worldwide. Wise yet again shows his adeptness with different genres, here adapting the Michael Crichton novel. The film is full of the usual sci/fi paraonoia about humanity meddling with science, but its done very well and although its slow, its still quite riveting viewing. The cast of virtual unknowns helps the films immensely as does the electronic score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holds up beautifully</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie holds up quite nicely after 35 years. Rather than setting it 20 years in the future and predicting what life will be like (which gets you Lost in Space), it's set in its own time and pushes the edge of the science of its day. This approach makes for a film that looks 'period' rather than dated. The decision to cast somewhat dumpy, middle-aged actors also help to keep it fresh. There are no hip clothes or hair-dos to make you think late-hippie or early-disco. Any of the actors would look perfectly normal in 2005. Especially in the world of science. Like the sets in 2001, the Wildfire lab is superb - clean, clean, clean. I wanted to move in. It is more than a little disturbing that they asphyxiated, then resuscitated, a monkey under the supervision of the SPCA. Their definition of cruelty is similar to George Bush's policy on torturing detainees - it's okay as long as there's no organ failure or death. Of course, it's also disturbing that they use a Xenon lamp to eradicate the chest hair from the one semi-hot guy, but they were saving the planet, so I guess that one has to prioritize.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It goes strongly, with brilliant and memorable moments, then the final scenes just spoil it a lot for me. I haven't read the book so I don't know if (spoilers) the book also has got a "happy ending" or not. Or was it just another vile tinsel town producer worried about his money and inserting that annoying boosterism (so typical of Hollywood in general!): Run, Dodge, Run, Left, Right, Go, Duck, You Got It...Sickening! Other than this the built-up of the story, the direction, the tempo is absolutely remarkable. Great attention to detail for a viewer not fanatically interested in science or detail work in general. It compares very favorably against the juggernaut "2001: A Space Odyssey". Seriously, it has got a very coherent plot, fantastic scenography (ok, the same man who did it for Kubrick!), great suspense, it is quite plausible and realistic. Of course, there were annoyances too: especially the biologist woman with a nasty attitude.</fullReview>

The sounds are awesome and the Kate Reid character is unapolegetically butch with is pretty cool for 1971. From a historical context it's fun to look at how far we've come.

		<shortDescription>Classic Creepy Space-Virus Eco-Disaster Government Conspiracy Sci-Fi Intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A US satellite crashes back to Earth apparently containing a lethal space virus which kills everyone in the small New Mexico town of Piedmont except a drunk and a baby. A team of scientific experts is hastily scrambled to a top-secret underground base called Wildfire to analyse the alien material and try to prevent a catastrophic global epidemic ...Based on a fine book by Michael Crichton (his fifth, written at the ripe old age of twenty-seven), this is a taut, no-nonsense depiction of a biological disaster recovery operation, full of intrigue, suspense and grownup science. It's not entirely original; the premise is similar to The Quatermass Xperiment and the action reminiscent of The Satan Bug, but it has a great trick up its sleeve - one of the most amazing sci-fi secret science bases ever filmed. The Wildfire sets by Boris Leven are simply stunning - miles of antiseptically clean corridors, flashy screens and gizmos, super-duper robotic-arm remote-controlled labs and funky green-screen computer readouts. I love all that stuff (see also Forbidden Planet or Hollow Man). Critics may say it's all cold geek science and technology, and that's fair comment - you may prefer Marlene Dietrich's legs as a pivotal plot-point to the fact that a self-replicating crystal with no amino-acid content can only grow within a narrow pH range - but the movie never drags and the biowarfare themes are potent and thought-provoking. The four leads are great; minor supporting actors who are highly convincing as the grumpy, excitable, thorough-minded scientists when movie-stars wouldn't be. They are one of many elements that add to the film's unsettling authenticity, such as the shot of a Rhesus Macaque succumbing to the virus which makes me queasy (it was knocked out with carbon dioxide). Wise directs with intensity and style (there are some great split-screen stills and clever visual effects by Douglas Trumbull and Jamie Shourt), but also many subtle touches, like the quiet moment where Reid misses one readout in a series of tests indicating the virus' growth has been nullified. I'm never quite sure how I rate Wise as a filmmaker - he made huge hits (The Sound Of Music), some real dreck (Star!, Audrey Rose) but also some great movies (I Want To Live!, The Haunting, Star Trek: The Motion Picture). I suspect his talents were not that of the auteur, but rather somebody who could gather and nurture talent around him on a set, which is interesting given that no producer is credited on this very expensive picture. A classic seventies eco-disaster flick, which shows up later efforts like The Cassandra Crossing and Outbreak - fun though they may be - as terminally dumb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's really a very good film and also a very unique one. The focus is on the science of the "Andromeda Strain" and less on the melodrama of the characters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the movie for the first time in a very long time on DVD. OK, when I was little, in the 70's and early 80's when they use to show it on TV. I am more impressed with it now -- unedited and interrupted by commercials (which tends to create distractions) and lessen the impact) than when I saw it originally. It's really a very good film and also a very unique one. The focus is on the science of the "Andromeda Strain" and less on the melodrama of the characters. Although you do have some interesting quirkiness like the female scientist (did she look annoyed to be their or what?). The director said that he deliberately didn't want to use established actors such as Gregory Peck, which would have taken away from the impact of the central point of the movie. This movie is more about ideas than about the charisma of a central character, which was refreshing considering that most Hollywood movies tend to get caught up into the cult-of-personalty of the actors and put them before everything else. If science topics bore you, better skip it though; this film is all about science! There are a few action scenes especially towards the end, but nothing like the endless chases, fighting, or shootouts that you would expect to see in many or most movies nowadays.This film does conveys a sense of real threat though that would have been compromised if given the typical Hollywood treatment with John Wayne or Clint Eastwood jumping in to save the day. It's really a thinking man's/woman's kind of film. I'm guessing a lot of people will get bored silly by the many technical aspects of the Andromeda "bug," but I found it captivating. The Andromeda Strain was very mysterious in its origin; it was not really resolved which led to a "boy did we get lucky" uncertain ending. That left the door open for future possibilities and sent a real chill up the viewers spine.There are some time-period quirks like the references to a draft cards, love-ins, cynicism about the government (OK, that's even more popular even now), and a dead topless hippie chick (really strange seeing that suddenly - why did they leave that out of the version I saw on TV?). The movie was made before the advent of AIDS and Ebola, which put it ahead of its time in terms of the subject matter that it covers: biological epidemics. I'm not aware of any other movies proceedings this one that covered that type of issue the way that this film does. That's why I found it such a breath of fresh air, and you'll probably never see another movie directed like it again, unless it comes from an independent filmmaker. I wish there were more films like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crichton's first big book-to-movie deal, still one of his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the first of the "modern" science-fiction/thriller movies that tries for a realistic background. The script is reasonably faithful to the novel, and about as good. I gave Andromeda Strain 9 of a possible 10 partly because the novel and movie adopt the dramatic conceit of being the "record of a major scientific crisis" and yet the details are just a little off, all through the film. It would have been just as easy to make the details a bit more plausible, especially since Crichton seems to have done his homework while writing the novel. Of course, I see the reasons for some of that - Crichton's consistent pessimism about human nature and his insights into the fallibility of science require computer components that screw up at the worst possible time, plastics that are curiously appetizing to extraterrestrial micro-organisms, and screwed-up governmental policies on who to trust with life-and-death decisions. In that sense, this was a Crichton film that wasn't directed by Crichton - Robert Wise was admirably faithful to the novel, perhaps more so than Crichton has been in his own adaptations of his novels. Even the changes to the character "Peter Leavitt" from novel to film were very adroitly done.This isn't a feel-good movie, and certainly not a date flick unless both of you are microbiology majors, yet it makes my "100 best movies" list.Why? Because Wise keeps the taut pace up throughout the film - the sense of urgency in what is happening, the dark mood which is very appropriate to the subject.And Crichton makes a great point - while many people joke about astrobiology being a "science without a subject," "Andromeda Strain" is a reasonable portrayal of how things might have worked out if there were microorganisms in space which cause disease to Earthly life forms and to which humans have no immunity or natural protection.We know that microorganisms accidentally launched into orbit on satellites have survived for several years - in orbit, in vacuum, and exposed to raw sunlight. Scientists have not ruled out that life may have drifted down to Earth from space rather than evolving here. There is evidence that meteoroids have been found with bacteria or signs of previous microbial life inside them, a point raised at greater length in Crichton's novel than in the screenplay.That being the case, Andromeda Strain is hard-core science-fiction and a taut thriller - solid entertainment. It's also solid, nourishing food for thought. I have to credit this movie for my decision to major in microbiology in college (my first major choice, anyway). Along with Isaac Asimov, Michael Crichton did much to awaken a sense of excitement in my eighth-grade mind about the possibilities of science. It's a real pity that, when Conn and Hal Igguldsen were compiling the list of "Books that Every Boy Should Read" in their "Dangerous Book for Boys," they neglected the work of Michael Crichton - and this story in particular. We need more people looking at thorny scientific and social issues in the ways that Michael Crichton can provoke them to do when he's at the top of his form (i.e., not writing pointless, turgid stuff like "Westworld").This movie is a great way of leading people of all ages and political outlooks to refreshing intellectual water and getting them to drink deeply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated But Gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Wise's adaptation of the Michael Crichton technological potboiler certainly reflects the technological and special effect limitations of the early 1970s, but the datedness of the production doesn't take away from its carefully-built mood of unease. Technology unwittingly unleashes a monster upon mankind-- and we actually went seeking such a monster; the horror hits when we can't control it, and the terror sets in as the clock ticks on and no one can (seemingly) find a way to neutralize it. The odd coincidences that prevent quicker resolution of the threat (the paper shred in the bell on the TeleType machine, Ruth Leavitt's convenient petit mal trance while testing the microbe) do seem a bit artificial, but these nagging problems pale in the face of the exquisite tension building during the film. The calculated coolness of the production heightens the mood, I think.The cast does great work, especially the weary voice of reason of David Wayne and the fierce, Thelma Ritter-like comic relief supplied by Kate Reid ("I never liked red lights. They remind me of my years in the bordello."). Paula Kelly, in a smallish role as nurse/patient care technician, also scores points as a human presence among all the technology. And give the movie its props for being prescient (years before AIDS and Ebola would remind us of how powerless we ultimately are against nature)! I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Exemplar Of A Crichton Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many consider Michael Crichton's "The Andromeda Strain" to be the quintessential example of his work. It contains the scientific detail of the time. The technology is cutting edge. The science is current theory. The medicine is beyond the textbooks and barely in the journals. As a physician and researcher, Crichton knows how to put the "science" in "science fiction." This is a "thinkers" sci-fi. Leagues above films with latex antagonists chasing a bleached blond chorus. Michael Crichton creates a new world out of the reality just barely over our horizon and asks the questions society seems to overlook in its pursuit of advancement.Are we ready to find new life? What will it be like? Are we ready? Are our priorities sound? Will our prior history overshadow the new choices? In "The Andromeda Strain," the scientific community and government must assess these and many other questions quickly. New life is on Earth. Things are not going as planned.The film is fairly close the book, which is excellent. If you like the movie, you will still love the book. As you watch the movie, note the technology. Everything depicted existed from the diagnostic machines developed for the space program to the skin removal lamps for sterilization. Three decades later, the film is still relevant and shows limited dated items.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with this film is simple. It takes a serious sci-fi story which is carefully crafted to be believable, and turns it into over-dramatic schlock.Michael Crichton, when writing the book, took special care to allow us to see all the technology through the eyes of his characters. Through his careful education of his characters and the reader, he makes the reader feel as though it's all true. It all could have happened, or is happening... It makes the reader feel that the sense of mystery that the characters are feeling.All that is gone from the film.What you get is a cheap "2001 A Space Odyssey" knockoff with "space age" (as popular in 1971) design, unlikely and unlikeable characters and laughably edgy, improbable dialogue. It's not really a terrible movie so much as it's a disposable movie of its time. I read the book in the 70's and loved it, saw the film in the 80's and was very disappointed by it.I strongly suggest reading the book. Or, if you must see this film, read the book first, so that you can get maximum enjoyment out of the book without knowing how it ends...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on a Michael Crichton novel, and directed by Robert Wise, "The Andromeda Strain" opens in the town of Piedmont, New Mexico, where locals have been killed by an extraterrestrial pathogen. The film's creepy opening scenes watch as members of the US government investigate Piedmont's corpse-strewn streets, their hazmat suits and telescopic lenses suggestive of overwhelming danger and invisible menace.Nothing else in "The Andromeda Strain" approaches the unnerving brilliance of its first act. Instead the film follows a group of scientists into an underground research facility. Here they attempt to identify, categorise and neutralise the alien virus. Unfortunately, like Wise's "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" (1979), such scenes eventually get bogged down by lingering, Stanley Kubrick inspired shots of gear, computers and high-tech machinery. All superficial techno-details - Kubrick, in contrast, always blended metaphysics with the prosaic ? Wise's aesthetic eventually sabotages what was once a promising premise.Wise directed "The Day the Earth Stood Still" in 1951, a scifi classic which reflected then contemporary fears of nuclear annihilation. A product of a different era, "The Andromeda Strain" (1971) plays like one of the decade's many anti-establishment, conspiracy thrillers. Paranoia becomes a survival mechanism, Nixon-era government officials conspire to drop bombs, and it is ultimately a secret military mission which delivers death on America's doorstep; whilst civilians nonchalantly go about their business, microscopic monsters scheme.7.5/10 ? Worth one viewing. See "Contagion", "Day of the Dead", "Carriers", "The Crazies", "Rabid", "The Happening" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" (1978).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to go as far as saying the movie is unique in every way. Where detail loses to generalization - this movie digs deep in the small details. Where the enemy of a "regular" sic-fi movie is a horror flick alien - here it is the horror of helplessness against an organism just some microns in size. Being slow-paced, showing attention to detail and carefully serving audience the more or less csi-like approach to science, minus the action and theatrics, makes this movie some kind of anomaly as if scientists were themselves to chose what *they* would like to see as an action movie, rather than being dictated what some people view science as ... and that could just as well be traced to old Frankenstein movies where "science" is a collection of random gadgets and stereotypical special effects. This is the kind of originality that sets Andromeda Strain apart, with a unique atmosphere and a very original approach to putting the viewer if not in the hot seat, then at the very least in a tense situation. I give it 6 points none the less, because I can see how this kind of movie will never have great appeal with the general audience.</fullReview>

Watching it now (in 2013) puts a whole new spin on it. Firstly, the story is captivating. Mutating outer-worldly killer thing gone wild - but not really. The story and plot are predicable and there were some "riskay" butt scenes - but what really got my attention was the technology aspect - the computer system, the stylus and touch screen, all of that. Add the look at a bunch of 70's cars in the town and it was sort of like watching an old movie. Wait! It is an old movie!

		<fullReview>Based on Michael Crichton's breakout 1969 bestseller, the quasi-documentary film details the efforts of four scientists in a secret biological laboratory, tasked with investigating and stopping a microorganism that has been brought to Earth with the reentry of a satellite. Robert Wise, whose directing career was as eclectic as it was successful (he helmed The Sound of Music and the original The Day the Earth Stood Still), tells the story of four different and sometimes unpleasant individuals who must find the characteristics and the vulnerabilities of an organism that evolved in space. They need to find out "what makes the damnedable thing live." Human foibles and freakish equipment failures are dealt with in an antiseptic format?the drama of the scientists' work, and their dislike and distrust of each other, provide more suspense than if Wise packed the film with exploding spaceships and green slime creatures (although watching the organism shift from green to purple and back when it grows is pretty unnerving!).Crichton's characters are realistic people who add to the tense documentarian feel. The film is laced with long periods of antiseptic baths, peering through microscopes, and mechanical arms moving caged rats and monkeys from one lab to another. Yet, the suspense builds to a Hitchcockian level because we know all know these characters, believable and intellectual, but filled with character flaws and little bigotries that almost cause a global disaster, are like us.There's Stone, the leader, a brilliant scientist who writes a proposal to President Johnson stating that the Lunar Receiving Laboratory for the Apollo missions may not be enough to stop a truly dangerous microorganism; Dutton, a microbiologist who can't wait to retire, fearing science itself is the greatest threat to humanity; Leavitt, a biochemist, angry and distrusting of others because she has had to scrabble her way up in a male-dominated scientific food chain, unwilling to reveal a physical frailty (that will bring the world to the brink); Hall, the medical doctor, a stereotypically arrogant high-priced surgeon who unwillingly accepts the job of being the "odd-man" out, the person selected by his natural attributes to decide if, in the event of a breakout of an organism, the Wildfire laboratory's nuclear self-destruct mechanism should be allowed to detonate.Wise correctly allows the characters to clash, to disagree at first and angrily attack each other as they grow fatigued. They aren't superheroes, but real flesh-and-blood people who for whatever reasons accepted Stone's invitation?in the film's backstory?to aid the nation in the event of a "fire." When Stone and Hall are dropped into an Arizona village that has been decimated by the organism, they act like men who have never seen dozens and dozens of corpses in one place before. Their grim jitteriness is transmitted right through their environmental suits. When Leavitt has had enough of the chemical and photoelectric baths designed to "clean one of the dirtiest things on the planet?the human body?without killing it" and is handed a suppository to flush out her lower gastrointestinal tract, she explodes at Stone, waving the pill in his face and threatening him with it. It's a funny moment in the film, and utterly believable.Regardless of a few special effects slickeries and inconsistencies, Robert Wise crafted the almost-perfect and true "science fiction" movie. It scares the daylights out of anyone who has the patience to recognize the implications of what might happen if an organism is loosed on the planet, for which there is no cure, all without a single dashing hero, cute robot, or bouncing bosom.Don't miss it!</fullReview>

The sex change works, but the foursome are sometimes dry viewing.

The acting was good and the soundtrack adequate. There are a lot of stupid things in the movie as well. Try to ignore the pseudo-scientific babble that goes on continuously on the speakers while people are in Wildfire, for example.The story is rather simple: a virus kills all people in a small US town and a team is dispatched to isolate, characterize and find ways to deal with the virus. Since the virus is of alien origin, the focus is mainly on the science rather than on the "whodonit". Since it is a Hollywood film, the science is depicted in a laughable manner.Still, the movie makes you ask yourself questions that are good to be asked. There are people that theorize that the virus was actually made on Earth for bio warfare. They never explain what Scoop is, and it is better left unexplained. Also in the end the salvation comes in the form of pure luck. "What do we do next time?" is the last question in the movie. Quite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Book vs. Movie (yes, worth checking out)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>alright, I was born in '81. This movie was a year or so after Watergate (73?). In other words, *way* before my time. So that's why I feel it's fair to post a review - I enjoyed this movie way more than most '70's movies. Keep in mind - the emotions, the feel, the sensibilities of the 70ies were there. The one female lead is called "hon" in one situation; and falls comatose later.. Anyways: I hate Crichton, usually. Very trite. No, please understand me. *Read* "Andromeda Strain". (trust me, unless you read exclusively read Chaucer or 12th century lit for fun, you won't regret it). Then see the movie. The book is so much more rich and detailed and logical - there is no final "deus ex machina". Well, there's *something*, but read it - if you like reading, it'll take you about 3 hours and you'll instantly relate it to themes today that you think about every day. And that's definitely worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hey film students, try looking at the bright side of this movie: it wasn't The Planet of the Apes.The Andromeda Strain was a great novel and film and Michael Crichton (RIP) will be remembered for his ability to combine the scientific method with unbound imagination.This movie is a great scientific detective story with a menacing Cold War theme: the destruction of all mankind. The lab methodology was very realistic and reminded me of my Microbiology 101 final in December of 1965 when I had two week to discover five unknown bacteria in the test tube. But I digress.The good news is that the teaching of science is back in vogue, thank you Barack Obama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure it's dated, but except for the extraordinary 2001: A Space Odyssey, what science-fiction movie from that era isn't? Actually, I think it's worn quite well. Its datedness also gives it some humor that probably wasn't originally intended. I'm referring to the scene in which the earnest-looking military officer and government agent go to Dr. Stone's house and interrupt a party. Dr. Stone's wife, outfitted with her 1960s hairdo and pink cocktail dress, and so looking very much like Jacqueline Kennedy, says Dr. Stone is busy, to which the agent replies (paraphrased) "Would you please get him, ma'am?" and the military goon adds, "Otherwise we'll have to go get him, ma'am." She runs to her husband and says, "Jeremy, there are some men at the door and I think they have guns." Now this scene, which was once dramatic, has become a hilarious send-up of 1960s American film. An excellent video choice for a rainy evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without a doubt an interesting tale, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For sure, the Andromeda Strain has an interesting premise! The inhabitants of a village in the middle of nowhere all die where they stand, but for a newborn and an oldster. The suspect? An alien microscopic life form carried to earth by a returning satellite. Thus a group of scientists is put together, more or less under duress, to investigate events. First at ground zero and later in an underground secret lab somewhere in a desert in Nevada. But after this promising start the movie makers forgot something. Shouldn't they put a timer on the whole thing? Granted they do that, but very late into the movie and even at that point they forget to inform group of investigators until even later because they scientists are incommunicado with the rest of the world. So the drama that is for the grab is lost and what conflicts arise never lead to anything serious that you would expect when disparate people have to work under pressure to save the world from extinction. This missed opportunity is born out by little mistakes, such as the fact that the men all are clean shaven even after days of hard work. In fact the whole movie looks crispy and clean. There is even drama fully cooked and ready when some members start to suspect that the alien life form might have something to do with biological warfare. But that moment of tension sizzle out to nothing. Another conflict arises when the scientists advocate to nuke the village, but the politicians hesitate. But it is hardly an issue that impacts the plot. While it should have as it leads up to a twist in the movie. The movie focuses on the scientific investigation using instruments that look hopelessly dated nowadays. A sizable part of the movie has the team go through a sixteen hour decontamination procedure involving a slow descend through five levels of the underground lab that ought to impress the viewers. And I would agree such painstaking thoroughness is impressive and a pain to watch to. And we then see them do the meticulously scientific research for another big part of the movie, which is again an awesome testimonial to the scientific method, but at times feels as exciting as watching paint dry. Blinking computer screens with unintelligible numbers don't do it for me. It is boring.The b rate actors are unable to add to the tension arch which doesn't mean they do a bad job, but they are just not able to amend for the lack of drama like a Henry Fonda can. He can make any dull line of conversation seem interesting but the actors that are billed here aren't up to it. At times the actors looked nailed to the ground, standing up erect and delivering their lines in an almost monotone voice. So now I really saw what wooden acting looks like. All in all the movie is still watchable while you are doing something else as well. For once this might be a movie that actually might do a lot better when remade. I suspect the novel by Crichton is still good material. Just add some more dialog and drama. All ready to go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who rated this movie "G"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With disturbing scenes of death, neglected baby, mistreated animals and gratuitous nudity, how on earth did this movie get a "G" rating? Twenty minutes into the movie, a attractive young woman is shown lying on her bed with bare breasts, supposedly being dead from the newly introduced virus. Later in the movie, rats and rhesus monkeys were obviously being gassed for the scenes where they are supposed to be exposed to virus. These gassing scenes are very disturbing indeed as the animals are not acting and are exhibiting signs of suffering, spasms and ultimately lack of consciousness. I hope that they were not needlessly killed for a fictitious movie and were possibly exposed to high levels of CO2 temporarily. But with all these scenes, this movie should have at least been rated no less than PG-13. The subject matter in this movie is in no way intended for general audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>there's something out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so diseases are a common theme in movies, most recently with Steven Soderbergh's "Contagion". Nonetheless, "The Andromeda Strain", based on a Michael Crichton novel, is definitely one to see. It's partly really interesting because of the underground laboratory, and the different levels, all fairly reminiscent of "2001: A Space Odyssey". I should say that a lot of the scientific lingo is way beyond me; there are more than a few discussions that only the ultimate nerds and geeks would ever understand.One might compare and contrast this movie with "Jurassic Park". It makes for a good analogy. While the threat in the latter is made of giant beings crushing everything in their paths, the threat here is something microscopic but deadlier than anyone could imagine. The sort of thing that you wouldn't notice until it's too late.What's especially good about "The Andromeda Strain" is that it sticks to the scientific aspect and eschews high action and gruesome scenes. Like I said, the scientific stuff might be confusing for someone who isn't into that stuff, but this is a really good movie, released in a year that gave us some of the best movies ever ("Willard", "McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller", "Shaft", "The Last Picture Show" and "A Clockwork Orange"). Starring Arthur Hill, James Olson, Kate Reid and David Wayne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculously slow but mysterious, neat, and unintentionally amusing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Andromeda Strain, takes us back to a time when sci-fi was more stiff than rigor mortis, back to the days of Star Trek. This film is perhaps a bit too dated but it is not without merit. Like 2001, the story is not driven by plot or character but more about ideas, except this one contains a hundred times more dialogue. Although people in the Andromeda Strain talk a lot but, they don't actually have much to say. Sometimes it feels like the Andromeda Strain is more of a science lesson, than an A to Z story. Considering that it comes from the mind of Michael Crichton, perhaps this is not surprising. It moves at the rate of a snail, but the reason Andromed Strain is watchable, is because director Robert Wise chooses to craft it like a jigsaw puzzle, adding one piece at a time, and it's never too predictable or formulaic. If you have patience, that should be enough to keep you engaged, waiting to see what comes next.A space probe has crash landed in a small desert hamlet. When a crew is sent out to inspect they find that the place is dead as a door nail. Not only is everyone lifeless but their blood has solidified and turned to powder. The probe is taken to quarantine in an underground facility where it will be inspected. There may be microscopic life attached on board that could pose a threat to humanity.By now I can recognize one of Crichton's trade marks. His introductions are very long. Take for instance Jurassic Park, much of the first third was a tour of the grounds. Also consider Westworld. The story spends too much time on exposition as our protagonists settle into their environment. For the Androma Strin, it is not just the introduction, but everything is stretched out. Some filmmakers like to be noble when adapting a novel. They feel it is wrong to cut too much out.I don't know if it was intentional, but the film is just as much amusing as it is mysterious. The acting is so unrealistic that sometimes Andromeda Strain resembles one of those numerous 1950's five minute commercials that talks about rocket science. The sets looks like they were built in an hour. They need a little more dressing up. The Andromeda Strain is not the kind of sci-fi film that would be financially successful if released today. I think it will appeal to only a limited number of people, but I recommend it to those who prefer mystery over adrenaline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that time has not been kind to</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an oldie that have become a bit of a classic. I remember watching this film when I was a kid and thought it was fairly okay then. I do not remember exactly which year it was that I watched it. I was definitely too young to have watched it when it came out in 1971.However, this is a film that time has not been very kind to. The underground lab might have been considered high tech at the time but now it looks extremely outdated with its ancient keyboards, low-res bulky CRTs and tele-printers. The special effects, what little there are, mostly consists of some colored blurring of the image.The story itself is not too bad although there is the usual anti-military finger pointers in it that was so common at the time. One scene I remember from when watching this movie as a kid was the scene where the female doctor freezes due to her epilepsy when the red flashing text indicating the non-growth that they were looking for came up on the screen. Thus she misses this vital information. I so disliked that scene at the time and I disliked it now as well. They are looking to prevent a possible human-exterminating epidemic and she goes around having secrets like that? Actually I didn't like her and her constantly bad attitude at all.Another thing that I thought was quite ridiculous and which is unfortunately a key plot element was this business with the key to turn of the nuclear detonation. For starters it is dubious that there would not be at least a second person as backup. What would have happened if that particular scientist would have been the first victim of any outbreak? However, having a system where you have to locate a terminal that is quite some distance away but at the same time the lab automatically shuts itself down thus preventing you to go anywhere, including reaching said terminal, is just stupid and unbelievable.It is still a fairly decent suspense movie but I cannot bring myself to give it more than 5 stars out of 10. I do consider picking up the book though since I have actually not read it. It feels like a perfect story for a book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One the book's few weaknesses was a lack of stimulating characters and unfortunately that transitions into the film as well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "The Andromeda Strain," I was consistently getting the impression that its director, Robert Wise really did not want to make the movie. This is not to say that he was dismissive about science-fiction, else he could not have made the original "The Day the Earth Stood Still" as magnificently as he did. Nevertheless, I think it is fair to speculate that he wasn't all that keen about directing the film adaptation of the late Michael Crichton's near-perfect novel about an extra-terrestrial virus that threatens to wipe out the planet.As in Mr. Crichton's novel, the story begins with an American satellite falling back to earth, landing near a desert town. A few minutes later, the town and all but two of its residents are dead. Only minutes whip by before a group of scientists, headed by Arthur Hill, are whisked to a secret underground laboratory to try and decipher the origins of the virus, codenamed Andromeda, and how they may kill it.The novel was white-hot with tension, spooky, and best of all, unnerving since it presented a possibility that there might be somewhere in the universe, a disease that could produce another disastrous epidemic. At the same time, it did not overproduce itself, and as a result, seemed genuinely plausible as well as terrifying. However, Mr. Wise's film only seems to scratch at the surface, like a child tearing apart a Christmas present when he already knows that what he got was a pair of beige socks. He, and screenwriter Nelson Gidding don't seem all that perplexed by the story they are telling.Pacing in "The Andromeda Strain" is monotonous. The first hour, in particular, seems much longer than it is. When the scientists are prepping themselves for work in the underground facility, they go through series of decontamination that eat up a good portion of running time. Frankly, watching them undress and be doused with powders over and over again, for minute upon minute, is not that exciting. Especially not in the way it has been directed, with almost every shot wide and long, like a security camera set on the floor. The second hour does pick up a little bit with the experiments on the disease, but so little of the novel's terror is captured. Even when we do see the virus, convincingly done with special effects, it does not seem any more creepy than a science experiment. It almost feels like it's under control, not rampant and threatening to wipe out the human race.One the book's few weaknesses was a lack of stimulating characters and unfortunately that transitions into the film as well. Not one character is fleshed-out or worth caring for, or, for that matter, particularly well-acted. The only promise for an interesting dynamic is between James Olson and Paula Kelly. It hints at a possible romance, but does not threaten to become slushy. That is before the movie just locks their relationship, before development, and never advances beyond that point. By the end of the movie, I was wondering just what all the fuss was about.Speaking of the end, I have wondered if the final ten minutes of "The Andromeda Strain" were directed by somebody other than Robert Wise, for it is here that it picks up. All of the redundancy and limp pacing is wiped away in a magnificent scene that is just as suspenseful as anything Hitchcock ever directed. It goes on and on and it is absolutely gripping and it was here that I started to feel the dread that I had been expecting, and hoping to find in the film.Unfortunately, we have to sit through two hours of exposition before the big payoff at the end, and the exposition is relatively not-thrilling. Sadly, the 1971 film is not much better or worse than the much-more-loose television miniseries adaptation done thirty-seven years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flashy, grand production, with uneven buildup to riveting end</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies that might otherwise be destined for greatness weaken under the weight of overproduction, and such is all too much the case for Robert Wise's "Andromeda Strain," a well-crafted but often lethargic documentary-style drama about a fictional American germ warfare accident."Andromeda Strain" leverages the inherent mistrust of "the government" characteristic of the late-60's, early 70's Vietnam era with the exposition of Michael Crichton's story about a secret government project to research and possibly cultivate germ-based weapons in a phenomenally believable, yet sci-fi slick, secret lab in the Nevada desert named "Wildfire," teasing the viewer's imagination to inquire whether the lab is part of the perpetually mysterious "Area 51.""Strain" begins as a precision documentary-style flashback of the events following the return of a mysterious space satellite to Earth, and sudden, horrific death of an entire New Mexico town thereafter. It then migrates unevenly to a sometimes tedious field trip of medical forensics as a group of top scientists are unceremoniously "drafted" into service at "Wildfire" to research and neutralize the newfound germ.But the undercurrent of intrigue in the unholy alliance between medicine and the military is stemmed by the overarching focus on the underground "Wildfire" lab. After early, eerie prologue in the New Mexico desert lays the groundwork for a complex story of secret military operations, "Strain" changes. The Wildfire sets, which cost millions to build, necessarily command most of the remaining screen time. The astonishingly authentic sets, right down to glove-box rooms, scanning electron microscopes, and computer-managed cameras are executed so well that one might be tempted to ask if Wildfire actually exists out there in the Nevada desert. But the preoccupation with the rules, sanitation, and protocols of Wildfire turn the movie from its documentary roots to one in which Wildfire itself becomes the central character, eclipsing the generally fine performances of its human castmates and serving as the central antagonist at the film's climax.To be sure, Robert Wise has crafted a technically masterful piece, and his devotion to grand photography and epic shot composition is evident in the treatment of Wildfire's circular corridors, stark coloring, and implicit immensity. Yet that same devotion, combined with perhaps a bit too much medical reality, makes the film lag at times, and only those fine human performances carry the nearly music-free production to the point that we still care enough at the end to stick around for one of filmdom's most riveting end scenes. And that end sequence is worth the wait all by itself.Make no mistake; this is a grandly produced and more than watchable combination of still-contemporary governmental cynicism and science fiction thriller. If you don't mind wading through a few dry spots during the film's 130 minutes, "Strain" is a winner; but with the complex elements of intrigue and governmental/moral self-contemplation underlying its story restrained by the scientific, one can't help but imagine it could have been much, much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Giant Leap For Mankind!? Ha!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yeah. OK. I know that The Andromeda Strain (TAS, for short) was only a Sci-Fi movie (or was it more than just that?) - But, with that said, wasn't it just like the American government and their devoted Science/Military team, back in 1970, to send a satellite out into space with the sole purpose of bringing back to Earth an organism (hopefully) deadly enough to use in germ warfare against all of their enemies (especially the Russians)? Like, isn't that just the most awful-minded objective imaginable? And all of those naive, trusting American citizens who solemnly believe that their government really stands for truth, justice and liberty... Ha! What a deluded, laughable joke! Based on Michael Crichton's 1969 novel of the same name, TAS was, without a doubt, one very-Very-VERY (!!) s-l-o-w moving picture. At 130 minutes my interest in caring about whether the Wildfire Team found a way to contain the spread of the deadly virus brought back to Earth, or not, waned to the point where, after the first 45 minutes, I couldn't give a sweet-damn what the heck happened. In fact, I was so bored that I secretly began hoping that all hell would break loose with the "Andromeda" virus. But, damn it, nothing of the sort ever happened.One of the biggest disappointments about this "all-talk/no-action" Sci-Fi/Thriller was that way too much of its budget went into the construction of its science-lab sets. I found that not enough attention was paid to the creation of a really unique-looking micro-organism. All that this thing looked like to me (when magnified by 1500x) was just a run-of-the-mill piece of toxic-green crud.Anyways - I found TAS to be yet another one of those "countdown-to-disaster" movies that, unfortunately, took itself way-way too seriously for its own good. And, that, in turn, left its audience with a potentially promising story that was so cut-n-dry as to be completely void of any genuine thrills &amp; chills.*Trivia note* - Andromeda is the name given to the nearby galaxy that's just beyond Earth's solar system. It also means "to think of man" in Greek.</fullReview>

Everybody there suddenly dies--except for a small baby and an old man. Some top scientists are called in to investigate--Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill), Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid), Charles Dutton (David Wayne) and Mark Hall (James Olson). They discover a deadly bacteria that may be growing and wipe out civilization--but how did the child and old man live?Crichton's book was pretty difficult to read but was interesting. This movie tries to be faithful to the book and it succeeds--but that's the problem. The book could easily have been tightened but they didn't do that. What was interesting to read just simply does not translate well to the screen. The pace is very slow and the movie runs 130 minutes! To make matters worse the scientists are given no real characterizations. They're walking clichés--nothing more. Even the book gave them more dimensions. Also a lot of the technology here is laughably dated--but I can't fault the movie for when it came out. All that aside it is well directed by Robert Wise--there's some nice use of multiple screens occasionally. Also the actors are very good in their roles despite having nothing to work with. Olson and Reid come off best. But the whole thing is just too slow! Moving things along a little faster could only have helped. For the acting and direction I give this a 7.</fullReview>

Kline's perceptive cinematography give the illusion this is heady stuff indeed, but, with Robert Wise directing (at his most flaccid), the end results are hardly an improvement over the cheapjack sci-fi's from the previous two decades. Wise is so fearful of not being taken seriously here that he eliminates nearly all personality from the film, causing his actors to come off as two-dimensional props. The scary undercurrent of the plot--of populations being destroyed by an unseen enemy--provides tension for the first two-thirds of the picture, but it's too clinical, too inert to be labeled a thriller. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rare case where a classic does NOT live up to its rep!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Besides presenting a film which does not live up to its legendary reputation as a nail-biting human drama, the DVD for THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN provides many clues to the reasons for its short-comings. The feature itself is very uneven. Though it's not the first--and certainly not the last--flick to start out gang-busters, and slow to a lethargic crawl by its midpoint (while the science team is still being "sterilized" in their Wildfire Lab), it's really disappointing to see this happen in a movie that's cracked up to be so great. For its day, I would rate the special effects as "9" out of 10, but I can score the acting and the dialog no higher than "5's", while the overall-plot gets a "4," with "pacing" and "suspense" meriting lowly ranks of "2" out of 10.That makes my final score of "6" out of 10 for the entire film perhaps overly generous. The stunning admission by the mercenary story originator Michael Crichton (who also confesses he entered--and subsequently left--medical school solely with an eye toward the money to be made as a writer, compared to being a doctor) that he could NOT "visualize" his stories as he composed them indicates someone with an affinity for concepts, but not for their impact on people (so the fact he did not become your doctor probably is not a bad thing). No doubt this is why the movie version of ANDROMEDA STRAIN totally sacrifices any development of real-seeming human characters (Dr. Ruth Leavitt's epileptic fit?--give me a break; her pathology here makes the tacky effects besetting the title character in Alfred Hitchcock's MARNIE seem totally plausible by comparison) in its obsession with endless progressions of decontamination and "fail-safe" self-destruct buttons.Speaking of FAIL-SAFE, that 1964 nuclear war suspenser is a somewhat similar thriller of THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN's era that is far more gripping than STRAIN because it has better direction (from Sidney Lumet) and a much better cast, including Henry Fonda and Walter Matthau. Wise's THE SOUND OF MUSIC is one of the most-loved family films of all times, and if you look at one of his earlier sci-fi efforts (1951's THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL), you can see that it tops STRAIN because of its superior human interest angles (flirtation between alien Klaatu and the mom; an endangered child; etc. compared to STRAIN's jarring moments of scientists being dragged away from their families with hardly a second thought), as it brings in that family touch from MUSIC which STRAIN never does. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is as much loved for the interplay between Richard Dreyfuss and Melinda Dillon (as well as the strong empathy it evokes for Dillon, regarding her missing child) as for its special effects and aliens. STRAIN comes across as the product of a teenage mind, lacking the life experience to flesh it out with REAL human characters. There's absolutely no reason why a great sci-fi movie (such as ALIEN) shouldn't have all three legs of the stool (great story, great effects, and unforgettable characters). The coldness or inhumanity of STRAIN comes through in the half-hour "making-of" on the DVD (THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN: MAKING THE FILM), with the crew crowing about the devices (such as the electronic optical printer) they invented just for STRAIN, whereas Wise indicates he had no problem gassing the lab chimps past the point of consciousness with carbon monoxide (who knows what their deficits were after they were "revived" off-camera?). STRAIN lacks heart; both the feature and the extras on this DVD prove it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wanted very much to like this movie. Especially since I had loved the Crichton novel--I think it was Crichton's most vivid and engrossing novel until "Jurassic Park". And the movie tried hard to stick to the scientific realism of the novel which helped make the novel so engrossing.But in the final analysis, I didn't like the movie all that much. Partly it has to do with the mediocre acting. Except for Kate Reid, the actors playing the other scientists seemed to be reading their lines as if they had never seen them before. Their voices often emphasized the wrong parts of sentences in a kind of sing-song, as if they didn't even know the significance of what they were saying. The script made the characters (except for Dr. Leavitt) appear one-dimensional, rather than real people with interests, strengths, and flaws. So the actors probably had no idea what sorts of people they were supposed to be portraying. For example, in the novel, it's mentioned that Dr. Burton (renamed Dutton in the movie) has always been a bit accident-prone, which adds to the suspense when he is in contact with the disease organisms--will he accidentally release them? That fact isn't explained in the movie.Partly it also has to do with the script's overall disappointing lack of suspense. In the novel, there are a number of scenes that make you increasingly scared that the disease might be spreading. For example, you learn early on that the President decided not to nuke the town of Piedmont after all, meaning the disease could spread from there. In the movie, you learn it much later and so you never got any sense of urgency to the investigation of the microbes. The final scenes (which I don't want to spoil) are supposed to be suspenseful and gripping, but you can easily guess how it's all going to come out.Overall rating: B-. That's because I wanted so much to like it. Otherwise I would have given it a C+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who's in favor of Germ Warfare Treaties?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a mid-summer cinematic "popsicle," THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN was cool and refreshing. It has simple and convincing theory to swim around in: extra-terrestrials may not look like humans or even carbon-based cuddlies or creepies as well as experimentation means try, try, try, and re-try again! However, science is not the only thing going in this sci-fi classic: we found its brooding worries about Government Germ Warfare scenarios and political shenanigans to be all-too close to some political scandals of the latter twentieth century. This film, directed by Robert Wise, sheds some light on a subject that the present administration in the White House wants to keep dark and "under a bushel." Do we need international and cross-cultural Germ Warfare Treaties? The Bush administration in Washington suggests no (too much red tape that didn't stop Saddam Hussein's mad-science during Bush, Sr.'s era) while this movie and level-headed Americans demand a yes! There ARE more things in heaven and outer space than are dreamed about in our cut-and-dried world of macro-biology and establishment science. THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN draws a line in the sand where the Hollywood science fiction's "happy endings" still may or may not pack a punch or wallop a wake-up call: unforeseen or dreaded and foreseen weapons of a biological or chemical nature can be produced and delivered but not "washed away" once they've devastated the ecology and drained people and wildlife of their fragile existences. President and Mrs. Bush, sit down with Jenna and Barbara in the White House Theater and watch this un-typical Hollywood horror flick. Then talk to them and other 19-year-olds about the actual likely threats that the Defense Budget needs to be throwing money at on their behalf like there's no tomorrow. Well worth a rental fee at your neighborhood store in its classic section! 10 out of 10. Watch it and then write to Washington, DC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has not stood the test of time well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TAS does a descending ballet through the levels of Wildfire similar to the one we go on in Kubrick's 2001 during the Blue Danube...a journey designed to dazzle us with technical advancement and movie-making wizardry. Unfortunately, it has not stood the test of time. The annoying computer/human interfaces, the generated graphics, the construction and spaceship look of Wildfire, the technically advanced research facilities...none of them inspire awe the way the trip to Clavius still does in 2001. The "Big Brother/Nuclear Disaster" plot line is a little old these days. So is the conspiratorial background of Scoop and Wildfire being generated out of a desire to exploit space exploration and the associated research for the production of biog-weapons. Other than that, the movie is an engaging thriller and does draw you in. As biotechnology sci-fi horror goes, it's pretty accurate, not the disaster of other infectious agent threatening global disaster films like "Outbreak".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Read the book". That's the most common expression you hear from people who have just seen a movie based on a book they've read. Movies are rarely true to the book, and those that are, are generally short of quality. That's the case with Andromeda Strain. Great book. And the movie is very close to it. But books and movies are two different things. In this case, the book excels, and the movie is ok. For science fiction fans, it's pretty good. If you're not a SF fan, you'll hate it.Some of the shortcomings of the movie have to do with the lack of information. The book, although relatively short, is very good at describing some of the more technical details to us non-MD's and non-biochemists. But the movie just skips right on through and leaves you basically clueless. Maybe a narration would have helped?A secret government project, codenamed "Scoop", has been sending a small satellite into the earth's upper atmosphere to retrieve samples of what floats there. The government probably does have a second agenda concerning this project, but I don't want to spoil it for you. The satellite brings back a mysterious tiny bacteria-like lifeform and lands in a small southwest desert town, killing almost all citizens almost instantly. A pre-determined team of four scientists (including a cardiovascular surgeon) is assembled and shipped off to a top-secret southern Nevada government installation to figure out what it's all about.The book and movie are both quite technical and may bore some people. I found the entire subject matter quite fascinating, and highly recommend the book (Michael Crichton) first. Then if you enjoy it, watch the movie. If you see the movie first, you may be discouraged from reading the book. That's why I recommend the book first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This dull and dated sci-fi thriller, heavy on ponderous detail but light on action, is certainly not recommendable to those with short attention spans. What little special effects there are are limited to computer models on screens, and, even if they were cutting edge at the time, seem unbelievably primitive now.The basic premise, a space virus that wipes out and US town and the attempts by the country's best scientists to identify and quarantine the virus, is intriguing. But the script over-explains every painstaking scientific investigation to a point where it becomes like watching a boring lecture.Spoiler Alert.And after all this, the scientists are completely irrelevant to the solution! The virus itself mutates to a harmless form without any action from the scientists. An amazingly Un-Hollywood anticlimax.Worth watching if you are interested in 70s sci-fi.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatly entertaining flick--if you are a chess playing, sunflower seed chewing, dork.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Excuse me if I sound like an unsophisticated peasant, but I'd like to know who's keeping the Wildfire that immaculate. That's something I've always wondered when watching these futuristic flicks with vast, sparkling clean, labs; hangars, corridors, without ever seeing anyone doing the chore. As a firm believer in Entropy--everything degrades--my little brain cells tell me someone has to pass a mop sometimes here and there if they want to keep things looking like that. But I never see anyone; so, if you want me to believe your flick is realistic give me something of that. I'm not asking much; just give me a glimpse of, say, the proverbial East European old lady in all four scrubbing a floor, while lamenting in bad English the day she ever left her hamlet on the Danube; or the little plump latino, wet rag in hand, eagerly giving the works to a wall while happily whistling salsa or something. That'll do it for me. (BTW, I once wrote a story about the ETs abducting people to make them do the cleaning in their UFOs).But that's the smallest thing in which TAS is unrealistic. I'm an ignorant in Microbiology but I know a few things. First, that the design of Wildfire is a waste of money. Truth is, that is a masterpiece in redundancy &amp; inefficiency. If I was a visiting senator the first thing I'd say to the designing engineer is: "Sir, have you ever heard the word Compact? Have you ever been in a submarine, a bunker? All this empty, unused, space, which had to be excavated in rock; which needs keeping, ventilation, sterilization, what is for?". I also know that a virus may not only remain latent for years in human cells but that it may conceal itself too there, so it won't be detected by any microscope; and that an innocuous virus may react with another to synthesize another one more lethal than the first two. That it may mutate also when threatened. Not to mention that a scientist can lie when interrogated by a computer, as Leavitt did. What we see in TAS is quite impressive but a good chunk of it is mumbo jumbo, pseudo science, mixed with bona fide scientific fact. Ex. of the first, the sterilization process (the only way to accomplish that would have been to boil the four); of the second, the way Andromeda is detected &amp; isolated (loved the micro-sieves.).Many SF flicks of the 60s, 70s, are disjointed because some filmmakers tried to cover all bases and show, explain, everything, instead of leaving most to the viewer's imagination, perhaps under the spell of scientific advancements of the era. TAS presents a flagrant case of that: at the end the $90-million Wildfire proves useless, AFA the bug is concerned, as Nature takes care of it. On top of that, the complex, stratified, sterilization process could have well been made useless beforehand, when the two survivors were taken to the chopper without any prophylactic precaution. The concept of the five levels is also inefficient, as the flick itself shows how easily they may all be overcome. But the worst, useless, contraption is the A-bomb as overall safeguard. The absurdity of it is shown in the film itself: when a leak does occurs, the affected module is promptly sealed off and people inside just have to prepare for the worse. If that works, where's the need for blowing up the whole Wildfire; isn't better to isolate all people in their modules rather than incinerate them?.But don't think because of this that this is a bad movie. Quite the contrary, I found it to be quite entertaining--and that's what counts, after all. I never thought that a flick filled with unlikable characters who spent most of the time staring at computer screens, typing on consoles, pushing buttons or quarreling with each other could be that entertaining. But caution: you got to have in you a bit of the proverbial chess playing, Discovery Channel watching, sunflower-seed chewing, geek to enjoy it. If not, forget it.The pace is sustained for the 191 min. length; the transition from the action filled first part, the exteriors, to the claustrophobic sterilized Wildfire premises impeccably achieved. The tension and suspense well built until the last 10 min., where the action takes a bombastic turn, to pander to the popcorn-filled brain. The cinematography, appropriate without been spectacular. The split screen scenes may get your attention the first time, but later you'll likely come to consider them corny &amp; superfluous. Good acting overall by known faces but unknown names-but why Reid was made to carry the burden of unpleasantness, bad mood &amp; disease anyway? Hill, a familiar face in many 60s, 70s series, always the worried but reliable...well, father, cop, medical doctor, Senator, President. Only seeing him in the movie means there'll be a happy, if disquieting, end. Not much of a soundtrack, I don't know why, and the editing seeming to have been done by Andromeda itself, with many scenes popping out of nowhere--just check the crashing jet pilot or the piece of paper stuck in the printer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>** HERE BE SPOILERS **A military satellite crashes into the small village of Piedmont. Almost all inhabitants seemed to have been killed instantly. A team of prominent scientists is assembled and both the team and the satellite is brought to a secret underground laboratory. The team undergoes rigorous sterilization and start to examine the satellite. They must be very careful, because there was something in the satellite that actually instantaneously turned blood into dust. Long hours and small quarters take their toll on the team. They find that a small virus probably is the cause of deaths, but they have no way to treat it or destroy it. It seems perfect and above all, it is not indigenous to earth. Now there is a race against time to find a cure before all of humanity is endangered.An interesting story with great effort put into the set. The secret laboratory is very detail rich and seems pretty extensive, although nowadays it seems pretty outdated. Unfortunately, not all the same amount of effort seem to have gone into the story. I think there are some flaws concerning the virus (for example, it seems to mutate randomly in the same way), and the virus is kind of central to the story. So, any flaw there taints the entire story. In addition the characters personal prestige and small quarrels are just irritating. The cast is good, not very known to me, but do no masterwork. Interesting idea behind the story though.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Andromeda Strain'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Andromeda Strain' is an adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel about four scientists, all of whom are assigned to study a mysterious alien virus and stop it from spreading.There is a great story to be told here, but the film seems to be more concerned with astonishing us with technology rather than telling it. Throughout the film, the audience is subjected to close-ups of machines and computers, and this quickly becomes redundant. So does the film, as it drags in excruciatingly slow motion. The screenplay hardly ever cuts deep into its characters. As a result, most of the characters never rise above the level of caricature. Only Kate Reid, as one of the scientists, manages to inject some humor into an otherwise lifeless sci-fi. But despite all of its flaws, the film never feels the need to insert any romantic mush or alien cliches, so we have to give it some credit.Rating: 5/10 or (2 stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather sombre and plodding sci-fi: interesting but not very entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a satellite falls to earth, the military goes to recover it from just outside a small desert town. Reaching the town though, all the squad finds are dead bodies ? whom the two soldiers suddenly join. When a flyover reveals the whole town is dead, the government activates a secret response team of doctors and scientists to go to an underground lab and work to identify, isolate and defeat the virus. With time running out, the team work to try and find the virus while also trying to work out what about the only two survivors of the town caused them to survive while all others died almost instantly.Having read the book that this film was based on many years ago I decided to give the film a second watch, years after seeing it for the first time. I had memories of it being rather slow and my memory served me right this time because, despite a good start and a tense finish, this film is rather talky and slow. Modern audiences will find it a little dull (the similar Outbreak had to throw in helicopter chases just to make an unseen virus interesting and exciting) but it is not without value. While it is not as tense or exciting as the subject matter should be, it is still worth seeing; the talky side of things is interesting and mixed up with some nice government-conspiracy issues that serve to make the story more interesting, but many viewers will find the sombre even dry tone to suck the entertainment value out of the film. Although the film tries to make the ending as exciting as possible and it is exciting when it is happening, it is rather fake and doesn't really convince in terms of the actual threat it posed to the world within the film. It is still worth seeing but it could easily have lost about 20 minutes from the middle section as well as tightening up other sections to make for a much tenser, exciting vehicle that doesn't overanalyse the problem but keeps it fast-moving instead of talking itself to death. In fairness it is still OK and the clean set designs must have seemed cutting edge at the time but now they seem impractical and outdated in the way that older 'futuristic' films often can. The cast don't help too much and only add to the serious, flat delivery in their attempts at scientific delivery. Hill is pretty good as the head of the team and Wayne has a bit of attitude at least but generally the rest are only so-so: happily none of them are as annoying a character as Reid plays ? she had me wishing that the virus would at least flood any room she was in.Overall this is an OK film but it is much too sombre to be really enjoyable.The start is very good and sets up a mood of fear and urgency that the rest of the film just lets drop away. The middle section is far too long and a touch dull and only a rather forced ending gets any sort of tension back into the film. All told, this should have been much better given the subject matter but, for all its flaws, it is watchable once ? but to be honest I'd rather reread the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a Robert Wise fan, but this wasn't his finest moment. This film has so much a movie of the week look to it that it's scary. All those zoom shots, the cheezy looking set constantly being redressed in various shades of color. The question that never got answered was this: Was the Government looking for microbic life in outerspace, or did it plant some kind of Earthborne life and allow it to mutate into something else? Imagine sending a scoup into orbit and hoping it will find a living form of matter 2 microns (2 million's of a meter)? Also the science is all wrong. The characters talk about intelligent life the size of a microbe. What a joke! It takes ten trillion neural connections in the human brain to make us intelligent, how do you suppose a microbe can manage that? Lastly, the dialog is punctuated by silence. A music score was needed for the pacing which is erratic. I knew Doug Trumbull (the last time I saw him was at a conference held at Windows on the World at the Trade Center a year before 9/11). He was still wet behind the ears and lost money on his special effects bid. Corners were cut and they show. This movie doesn't hold up as well as Forbidden Planet, made years before. The acting is wooden, the direction ill-conceived. It's a 130 minute waste of time and talent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here we go again, with another of Crichton's whiny attempts to terrify us with the scary technology we're building that he doesn't think we're ready for. It's a pity that such a twaddlish premise drives him so, because his movies were some good, didactic SF apart from this recurrent theme.Many correspondents have complained about the slow pace, but in its day this was pretty necessary in order to get all the groovy hi-tech points across. Large chunks of the film were essentially documentary - and looked it. Although it all seems rather silly and boring now, at the time it was riveting stuff, honest, and not a bit slow.The story is good, hard-science SF - until we run into Crichton's hang-up. A communication breakdown that almost exterminates the planet occurs because, we are told, a lickle piece of paper stopped a bell from dinging. See? See? That naughty technology will murder us all in our beds! Sure enough, those cold, unthinking machines proceed to screw things up all over the place, damn near blowing everyone up, and inflicting nasty burns on the sympathetic, brave, earnest medic who is so clearly Crichton's surrogate, and who just happens to be the saviour of mankind.And of course it later turns out - though rather coyly presented - that the whole experiment-gone-wrong was the result of yet more scientific meddling.At the time of this film and 'Terminal Man', Crichton was still putting some sort of plausible reasoning behind his dislike of technology. By the time he reached 'Westworld' he seems to have decided that plausibility was redundant, and the machines just start killing people because they're feeling grumpy or something.Oh, well. An interesting film, and we're all still here - even Crichton.</fullReview>

Director Wise uses a solid docu-drama style of direction that I like, very similar to Preminger's style in "Rosebud." Low on the epic dramatics and strong on the FICTIONAL factual story-telling. Wise also vastly improves on Crichton's (an over-rated, over-paid, Ivy league, creative non-talent who EONS AGO gave new meaning to the term: in-love-with-himself) mediocre novel. Like I wrote earlier, I really enjoyed most of this film until ... the last third.Whether the last act falls apart because of the source material, or not, I'm not able to answer. If it was the novel they should have written an alternate exciting clever conclusion, but to have to sit through another hero who has seconds left to save mankind from a nuclear explosion (this started back w/ Connery as James Bond in the last minutes of "Goldfinger") is more than any intelligent self-respecting audience should be expected to endure. It could be a reflection of the Cold War times ... I don't know. Then as if to further insult and alienate viewers the now-unbelievable-drama continues and is implausibly resolved by an Andromeda Strain cloud moving over the Pacific where the salinity of the ocean will ... never mind the ending in "The Day of the Triffids" was more dramatic AND PLAUSIBLE!</fullReview>

Maybe this is just because we have become used to the increased pacing of more recent movies, e.g. "Outbreak", with a similar plot. Worth a see for the intelligence of the story, but not a keeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery Science Theater 3000 Worthy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm shocked. Shocked that a movie I thought I would love (as a Sci-Fi die-hard) invoked so much in intentional laughter.Understand: I loved 2001: A Space Odessy. The original Planet of the Apes is a classic. I found THX worthy. Even Silent Running has some redeeming qualities. I do not need to be constantly entertained by special effects to enjoy Sci-Fi.However, "Andromeda Strain" was crap from start to finish. A terribly contrived and predictable plot, which could have been told in a single Twilight Zone episode, instead was stretched out to 2 hours so that we could see the wondrous technological gadgets of the Wildfire facility. By the third floor, I was screaming at the screen, "Please, put me out of my misery! I get it ... The place is secure! It's a pain to get to the bottom floor. Mr. Crichton you are so very clever. GET ON WITH THE STORY NOW, PLEASE!" I found this reminiscent of the directors cut of the original Start Trek motion picture, where we are subjected to 10 minutes of enterprise flybys, just to make sure the audience REALLY gets how cool it is.The acting was, at times, absolutely groan inducing, particularly any scene involving the politicians back in Washington.Topped with the maraschino cherry of the cliché "but what-if it happens again!" ending, and you have stereotypical sci-fi schlock.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure where to start. On one hand the story is great, but on the other the film is lackluster in just about every way. After reading some of the reviews on IMDb.com, I was led to believe that there was a major twist at the end of this film. Well, there was a twist but one that I didn't understand. Call it stupidity or call it lack of knowledge but then again I don't think anyone can truly understand it without a degree in science. I guess this is my own flaw but I'd like to blame it on the film. The performances are just dreadful, and that is an understatement. In my personal opinion, I can write better dialog and provide better performances than what the filmmaker and the cast did. I have no real professional training in film and just grab a camera and start shooting. I think thats what these people did, because it seems so unorganized. Not just the story but the acting and story and everything. I'd give it two stars because it has a decent story, or what story I can make of it. Another star because of the effects for the time period. (Pre-Star Wars, Post 2001). The forth star because it symbolizes why the American new wave kicked these kinds of movies butts back in the day. One other important thing to note is that, the images that are presented on the screen are not pretty to look at. It has some of the worst photography that I have ever seen. (Trust me I have seen a lot). The director of photography chose to use a split lens technique that causes a close-up and a long shot to be in focus at the same time. Its not a big deal if one uses it once or twice for emphasis on a certain subject but they continued to use it over and over and over and over again. It came to a point where it took away from the picture. They gave emphasis on a person talking and a computer monitor, what the hell is that suppose to do for the audience. I have no idea but what ever it is too late to ponder over. This movie just plain sucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching This Is Like A Chore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read an interview with George Lucas when he was making "Star Wars" and he complained there were no adventure films at that time for young audiences. Well, I never did like "Star Wars ", being a couple years too old, but I do remember suffering through "The Andromeda Strain" with my friends when I was 12 and praying for Godzilla to show up.1971 was the era when almost all movies were designed to appeal to thirty two year olds, or people who thought they were.I imagined the only people who really thought "The Andromeda Strain" was exciting were molecular biology students on a break from writing a term paper on polyphasic chain reactions.This movie concerns a bunch of people in an underground lab doing experiments with computers to find the source of some kind of strange infectious organism that might be from outer space. It's one of those films that you have to pay real close attention to all the dialogue. I'm not sure if I did or not, but I think that first sentence in this paragraph sums it up pretty good. I didn't listen enough to find out what significance "andromeda" had, though. I was waiting for the talking apes.After the first hour it gets really boring. I mean, really really boring. There's lots of talk about amino acids and stuff. When we walked out of the theater complaining, one of my friends berated the rest of us for being stupid and unscientific. We ignored him.After this movie, almost all science fiction films included spaceships and monsters. We like that better, cause most of us aren't molecular biology students.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very difficult to sit through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I will applaud director Robert Wise (Star Trek The Motion Picture, Transformers The Movie) for presenting a realistic portrait of what could happen if an alien viral strain threatened earth. The countermeasures that the government would take in response also seem authentic. Second, the look of the film seems appropriate for the subject matter. It appears considerable expense was taken in this regard. Also the cast of unknowns do their best with less than charismatic characters. However, having said all that, as a film, I found The Andromeda Strain very laborious to view. There seemed to be too many periods of monotony and tedium. I am really on the fence on whether to recommend this film or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is your only spoiler warning...Here is two similar elements together, giving us a film that is exactly what it sets out to be: a morality play.Wise's thinking is no different than Crichton's sophomoric novel. The film also stems from the 50s shallow morals that Wise championed with 'Day the Earth Stood Still'.Crichton too hasn't evolved from this train of thought. 'Jurassic Park' is the best adaptation because it takes the slickest, crowd-pleasing elements of Crichton's work and glosses them.What separates these old movies from their modern counterparts is the old concept of "show don't tell". If too much telling is done and not enough showing, then the film loses its sense of purpose.The sets remind me of 'Total Recall', showing severe signs of aging. You can call this "sophisticated" science fiction, but it still suffers in the elements of science. It is interesting, but like a booth at a fair that is quickly forgotten. When it loses steam, it changes direction to mask the hole.The only scary idea is that the government plans biowar scenarios on its own people.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>IF YOU LIKE BEING BORED &amp; WATCHING STUPID PEOPLE, YOU'LL LOVE THIS MOVIE!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING SPOILERS CONTAINED IN HERE! The most amazing thing about this movie is the music soundtrack by Gil Melle. I am really surprised this hasn't been put on cd. The plot is horribly boring: city full of dead folks. Gee what could it be? Since the title of the movie is THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN (!), the entire "mystery" as to the cause of deaths and the containment of the contaminated area is pointless. The plot drags and drags, littering us with medical jargon, walking down hallways, torturing defenseless animals (for real, which I found most offensive), blabbing, blabbing, blabbing, and acting stupid. The ending is absolutely terrible to watch. The place is about to blow up and a guy must insert his key in a special key slot to stop it. He gets a flesh wound on the cheek by a laser. Okay, it probably hurts, but stop being a drama queen, buddy! For some reason he has problems seeing and walking and moving. I actually wanted him to die for being such a slow-moving idiot. But no, he puts the key in the slot, sits there for awhile staring at the key (Wow! Great scene Mr. Director! We'll call this "the staring at the key scene"), then with 8 seconds left before everybody is about to die, he finally decides to turn the key. What he was waiting for, I don't know. I was surprised to find out this movie was made in 1971. It looks more like the 1980's. So for special effects and set design, the movie gets my respect. Basically, everything in the movie is interesting, but the actual movie itself just sucks. So if a cd of the music ever comes out, buy the cd and skip the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its what Resident evil should have been like!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 20mins watching this film was like awesome, it was like a perfect resident evil film, it funny if you watch it there's lots that could have been taken out of it to make resident evil such as the computer wont let them get to the bomb, there's a virus, there's a underground lab, etc etc.Ill try and keep spoilers out of it.I felt that the film could have had 15-20mins cut off it as I found sometimes i fast forward scenes as it seen to go on and on mainly all the decontamination bits.If its OK TV watch it. But i wouldn't buy it. you can tell other films where inspired from it i.e. resident evil, dark star,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film twice. It is one of the dullest pictures ever made. It moves at a snail's pace. It grinds laboriously to an unfortunate conclusion. How someone can find it riveting and fast-moving is totally beyond my comprehension. I will agree that the performers are good and they seem totally committed to the project. In particular, Arthur Miller almost makes me care about the situation. But ultimately the sterile set, the lack of music, and the unrelieved slow pace makes this film an incredible bore for me. My time is better spent elsewhere; youre will be too, I'm sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How is this even remotely good???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that we have taken the time out of our lives to come and slate this "film" says something about how truly awful it must be. This is my first comment of any "film" on IMDb, its a shame it has to be under such sad circumstances. Three out of the four people i watched this with fell asleep! Enough said! And we're film studies students and soon to be graduates! This Film Is Pants! Now I'm just filling up space with a few words and phrases to describe how I/we feel about the "film": boring, poor, waste of time, over-rated, pretentious, poorly acted, badly directed, scripted by a 6 year old, a general cinematic error! We're not being spiteful, just fail to understand why this film is the topic of such praise and note-worthy of study - if not for its unconventional narrative.</fullReview>
