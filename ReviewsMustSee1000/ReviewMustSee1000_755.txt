		<fullReview>I saw Scarecrow when it originally came out in 1973. Like so many movies of that era (late 60's - early 70's) it didn't have the requisite "happy ending" that Hollywood force feeds us today. Instead, we're presented with the desolate lives of two drifters searching for redemption at their respective destinations of Pittsburgh and Detroit. Hackman and Pacino are at their best here, providing the same type of brilliant acting and on-screen presence that Voight and Hoffman gave us in Midnight Cowboy (1969). In fact I've always thought these two movies would make for a great "compare and contrast" assignment in a Theatre Arts class.Hackman has been quoted as saying that this was his favorite role. No argument here, it's my favorite too. Thanks Gene. You too Al.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>2 pawns who are making up for their past are living the present like they may have no future. Hackman and Pacino are amazing. Some of the 1 shot scenes last for 2-3 minutes. The magic created on screen by these two actors are mind blowing. The opening and closing scenes are so "different" it can be classed as poetic in a way. This is not your regular Hollywood movie, although it has 2 of the greatest actors in American movie history. Check this film out! 1973 never looked so real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an overlooked masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This excellent movie has been overlooked for too long. Its a great film on every level. It is entertaining as well as deeply profound. Schatzberg's directing is outstanding, Hackman and Pacino deliver acting on a level rarely found in any films, and the script is funny, while retaining a quiet note of tension and melancholy throughout. Its an exceptional film, largely overlooked by American audiences in the years since its release (despite winning the grand prize at Cannes, as well as the acting prize for Hackman and Pacino).Don't overlook this film. Rent it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This overlooked film features Gene Hackman's best performance as an introverted ex-con. Al Pacino gives one of his best performances. Director Jerry Schatzberg and cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond capture both the squalor and the grandeur of the American landscape. Garry Michael White's screenplay is filled with richly nuanced characters, religious symbolism and a deep sense of humanity. One of the best of the 70's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unusual character study/road movie that could only be made in the 70s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarecrow is a low-key film that succeeds on all its ambitions, but not because it tries to aim low. That the tone at times doesn't feel as emotionally incredible or intense as some other films Gene Hackman and Al Pacino got their star-making turns in the 70s (French Connection, Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico) doesn't mean it's unsuccessful either. Jerry Schatzberg and his writer are out to capture a kind of outsider view of men trying to find their places in society, almost like how Michael Cimino would do (to a more genre-oriented extent) with Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. It's not a movie a lot of people would go out of their way to see, even with the star power involved. It's about two guys who've been released from confinement from the world around them, Max from six years in jail (Hackman), Francis from five years out at sea in the Navy (Pacino), and how the two meet up unintentionally while hitchhiking, unlikely pair up, and Hackman gets Pacino to go in with him on opening up a car wash in Pittsburgh.Why Pittsburgh? Just one of the peculiarities of Max, mayhap? More-so a thing of pride. There's characteristics to Max and Francis that make them compelling for the honesty in what they are: Max is a tough guy, tending to get drunk, get in fights, sex it up with women (who knew Hackman had such, um, animal magnetism), and Francis (also named Lion by Max) is a clown, a little boy who somehow made the mistake of having a kid with a woman before he left the Navy, and has a present ready to give to the kid in Detroit- an androgynous lamp- despite not knowing entirely what to expect. It's an odd couple movie, but also one that has a more affecting view into a world of men on the fringe of society. These guys don't have big plans, and wouldn't want any anyway. It's refreshing to see that, and how it pans into the nature of them and their environment: the small towns, the local dives, the bad drunks, and, when things go bad after a big brawl during a drunken hoopla, the subtle horrors of prison for the both of them. Did I mention train-hopping? A film like this, despite having on its side gorgeous cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond (who, along with Badlands and, in its own way Mean Streets, captures a vision of Americana that is pure and unique to its time and place), needs strong acting. Who better than Hackman and Pacino? They're playing big personalities, with Hackman doing great as always in a somewhat typical part of a guy who's aggressive and pig-headed but does have a hear. And Pacino doing a rare comedic turn as he gives some of his funniest (genuine, not unintentional scene-stealing) moments, like his 'diversion' gone wrong in the clothing store, or his classic "teach me how to handle a drunk" bit at the bar. Sometimes its too much, but it leads to a bittersweet side to the story that turns even more bitter by the time Schatzberg reaches the emotional climax in Detroit. What's been alternately crude and crazy, sometimes in ways that remind one a little of Altman, turns towards what is a small but great tragedy for these characters. And doing the script one better, the actors are able to get subtle, crushing, telling moments in scenes that others wouldn't be able to grasp with a ten-foot pole.It's also a fun movie, with a feel that you could only get in one of the truly great years in all movies (look at the year this came out, and realize how many films of its ilk were released, be they independent-like from Scorsese or Altman or Ashby or even Romero, or even Friedkin's Exorcist). Scarecrow is of its time, but it doesn't mean it can't be greatly liked in the present; it's even a near classic of genre subversion, doing a service to drama and comedy by not paying lip-service to either form, but enriching what comes naturally out of life, which is both sometimes, harrowingly, at once. 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should be remembered!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film many years ago. It has that early 1970's charm and feel that we almost never see anymore. Hackman (Max) an ex-con on the rebound and Pacino (Lionel) a drifting ex-sailor meet randomly while hitchhiking. They spark an unlikely friendship and venture on a road trip. Max plans on owning his own carwash and chooses Lionel for his partner in business. This is a story of two losers with modest dreams. They may not be the winners of society, but they will definitely win your heart. Max is a mean and tough creep while Lionel is a lovable rogue. The ending is shockingly sad and all too real. With effective symbolic panning of the fountain's cherubs and the haunting background score make for an unforgettable experience. Pacino and Hackman deliver remarkable performances. This is more of a guy film in that I don't think it's any woman's cup of tea. But if you want to catch a glimpse of great natural acting and a taste of 70's melodrama, Scarecrow is worth every minute.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Road Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a forgotten classic from the 1970s and a film which few will find on the list of great films made by Al Pacino and Gene Hackman, although it is close to both actors' best work. As with most road films there is very little plot but what plot there is concerns two drifters (Pacino and Hackman), who meet while trying to hitchhike and, after quickly bonding, decide to become partners in a car wash.They are both very different characters with Hackman dominating as Max, an irritable tough guy, and Pacino, for once underplaying, in the lesser role of Lionel. Although Hackman can play hard-nut characters in his sleep, the role of Max offers him more range than he often gets. This comes mainly through the quirky aspects of his character, such as his obsession with having to wear several layers of clothing, and also in the more tender and comical scenes.Despite a running time of nearly two hours the film never drags, unlike many road movies, and this is largely due to the performances, especially that of Hackman. There is also another excellent sinister turn from Richard Lynch, a token 1970s villain, who befriends Lionel (Pacino) after he and Max (Hackman) have been sent to prison. If there is one aspect which lets the film down it's the ending. "Scarecrow" is one of those films in which very little happens and thus it is tagged with an unnecessarily dramatic ending, which is pure Hollywood schmaltz. It would have benefited far more if the film-makers had simply ended the film where it began, rather than struggling with the choice of an overly happy or sad conclusion (I won't tell you which).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The highlights of this movie are the expected standout performances by a young Al Pacino and a young, well younger, Gene Hackman. Their range of facial expressions and absoulutely convincing characterizations are a joy to behold. Also since Hollywood usually deals in glamour, it's a nice change to see characters with more modest aspirations. A very good road movie, a genre I usually don't gravitate to, 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Essentially, the film reveals is that people use different ways and personas to protect themselves from being hurt. Max is obviously confrontational and aggressive. Francis is a clown. Each disarms those around them so that they don't get too close. You can look at a scarecrow in many ways, but the purpose is the same.... to keep the crows away. Max uses fear, Francis uses jokes. At the end of the movie, Francis' scarecrow doesn't work anymore when strong feelings break through surface. The dialog and acting in this film are first rate. Two of my favorite actors in break-out roles. Hackman as a sensitive guy... Pacino as a comedian... who would have thought?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two strangers meet on a lonely road and form a tentative, but lasting friendship.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max and Lionel, two ordinary guys, meet by chance on a lonely country road while hitchhiking and strike up a friendship. Max (Gene Hackman) is a hot-tempered ex-con who dreams of owning his own business, a car wash. Lionel (Al Pacino) is a seaman who abandoned his pregnant girlfriend some years prior but who, despite this character flaw, is so mild-mannered and sweet you really just want to give him a big hug.Hackman is great as the hard-edged Max, yet despite his gruff exterior you know there is a man of deep feeling and caring underneath. Pacino never fails to disappoint in whatever he does and he doesn't in this tour-de-force performance. Famous for playing loud, larger than life character's with extreme zeal -- Colonel Frank Slade from SCENT OF A WOMAN and Tony Montana from SCARFACE for instance -- here his performance is like a whisper -- quietly calm yet powerfully effective.A nice surprise in the cast is Richard Lynch (in his screen debut) as Riley, the man who befriends Lionel while he and Max are briefly incarcerated for a bar fight. Lynch is only in the movie for approximately 20 minutes, but what a 20 minutes! His ability to convey the sleazy yet somehow likable Riley let's the audience know that this is a talent to watch for in the coming years. With such great method acting from all three actors, it's no wonder this movie won the prestigious Golden Palm Award at the 1973 Cannes Film Festival!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the point of this film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarecrow features Al Pacino and Gene Hackman as Lion and Max, two strangers that meet on the road and develop a friendship as they travel throughout the country. Max dreams of opening a car wash in Pittsburgh and Lion plans on meeting his child for the first time in Detroit.I would recommend 'Scarecrow' to all viewers who are interested, as I am, in knowing better Al's earlier filmography, or his filmography in general, because it is different than most of his movies.Lion is a comical, yet sentimental and shy character. In his essence, he resembles Sonny Wortzik, in 'Dog Day Afternoon' when it comes to his good intentions, pure heart and complex nature. Al seems to have gotten the comedy and sensitivity part right, and at times his performance is really touching, as the scene when he's playing with the children by the fountain. My problem with Lion is that, unlike Sonny Wortzik, for instance, he seems unrealistic - he's way too childish and innocent for a man his age, and seems to lack any sexual interest. Max, played by Gene, seems kind of caricatured in the beginning, but eventually becomes more believable, and the friendship he develops with Lion is beautiful in some parts of the film.The problem is this friendship starts out of nowhere, with Lion agreeing to be in Max's car washing business even though they only knew each other for a few hours. And the film continues with inexplicable scenes of them together, that are way too long, and yet, leave the impression that the friendship could've been better explored. Not to mention how painful it is to see Al in such vulnerable positions as almost being raped by a cell mate. The end is an unbelievable anti-climax, that makes you wonder if there really was a thought given to the meaning of this film, or to the continuity of the plot. Of course, not all plots have happy endings, and it shouldn't be expected from 'Scarecrow', but the story seems to have been interrupted, rather then ended. If anything this movie should be watched for Al's and Gene's endearing performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Hackman and Al Pacino play two drifters(Max &amp; Francis) who befriend each other, and decide to form a business partnership in Pittsburgh, where they hope to open a car wash. Film details their adventures along the way.Both actors are very good as usual, and being filmed on real road locations helps, but film, which feels very inspired by the far superior "Midnight Cowboy" never amounts to much, feels like an extended sketch study stretched to feature length. Hackman(Max) is a hot-tempered brawler, which gets them in frequent trouble, while Pacino(Francis) is a simple man who just wants to see his son again, but fate has other ideas. The ending is disappointing because it just stops, without any real emotional resolution. Nice try, but misses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb, deeply poignant film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scarecrow is a film about human longing, change, and growth. Gene Hackman plays Max, a cynical ex-con who just wants to get to Pittsburgh, and start a car wash business. While walking along the side of the road, hoping to hitch a ride to his destination, Max happens upon Francis (played with deft emotional poignancy by Al Pacino). Francis is also hitch-hiking, trying to get back to Detroit, to re-unite with the spouse that he abandoned when she got pregnant. This movie moves along at a leisurely pace, as Max and Francis gradually become friends, despite their very different personalities. The two men become embroiled in several misadventures along their journey, even getting put in a prison farm for a month. The prison stint sorely tests Max and Francis' friendship. But, both men discover that the loyalty they develop to each other, transcends the chaos that threatens to tear these two pals apart.Scarecrow was made back when movies with intense character studies, were much more common than they are now. And this film is among the best made in the 70s, regarding the complexity of the main characters. Gene Hackman is superb as the world-weary, cantankerous Max. Al Pacino gives one of the best performances of his career, as the cheerful, yet achingly vulnerable Francis. If you like films that have plenty of substance, intriguing characters, and splendid acting, then you owe it to yourself to see Scarecrow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gotta love Long John...but you don't gotta love this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's nothing more frustrating than a failed drama. At least failed comedy or failed sci-fi can be laughed at. A failure like "Scarecrow" has to be endured, grimly.What makes this movie all the more frustrating is that it features two of the greatest American actors - Hackman and Pacino - at the peak of their powers. But it squanders them on stereotyped and predictable characters. Max (Hackman) is always belligerent but fiercely loyal to his friend Lion, while Lion (Pacino) is always a clown but equally loyal to Max. In scene after scene, Hackman antagonizes people in bars and diners while Lion looks on in mute horror. Sometimes, Lion tries to diffuse the tension by acting like a goofball. Unfortunately, most of his comedy routines are painfully unfunny. I wonder if that was intentional...anyway, the movie soon feels like it's looping back on itself as this familiar tableau is replayed again and again.Just to heighten the sense that every scene is the same, Max endlessly talks about his dream to own a car wash. The canny viewer can, of course, easily figure out what will become of Max's dream long before the climax. This is a 70s movie, after all, and hopelessness was the order of the day.I feel guilty bombing "Scarecrow" because it is so well-intentioned, and there are moments when the rapport between Hackman and Pacino works beautifully. But the storyline is too episodic and rambling (despite being repetitive!), and the Max-Lion friendship is solidified too quickly to be convincing. The plot twists are strangely predictable, too; even the Act 2 "falling out" between Max and Lion feels scripted and clichéd. It's a nice try, but I don't even think it's worth seeing for Hackman and Pacino - they've both done better work that's more worthy of your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Perplexing Schatzberg Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerry Schatzberg made two interesting movies early in his film career, this and 1971's "The Panic in Needle Park." And, while both are well made, with very good acting, both seem pointless by the time they hit the end credits.I guess following the characters is the point in both films. But, their journeys seem to lead nowhere, and I guess that's the problem for me. I wonder what the point of all of it is. In "Panic," (spoiler alert) the two drug addicts we follow end up in the same place they started. In "Scarecrow," (spoiler alert) one of the two characters doesn't make it at all.Here, the film benefits from the excellent cinematography from Vilmos Zsigmond, in one of his earlier films. Al Pacino and Gene Hackman are very good in their respective roles. And, the film is well made. But, when the film just kind of ends as it does, you wonder what the point of it was.It's especially interesting concerning Schatzberg, since he went from these iconoclastic films to something like "The Seduction of Joe Tynan," a straight-down-the-middle romantic comedy drama. What's most notable about "Panic" and "Scarecrow" is that they are prime examples of how gutsy 1970's cinema could be.***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The poignant chronicle of two lost souls trying to survive in the jungle of life ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No pun intended but 1973 was a 'good year' for road-movies, "Paper Moon" in comedy and "The Last Detail" in drama, both featured characters crossing a crisis-stricken America, learning to know each other in the process and to embrace the future with brighter hopes. All things come in three with "Scarecrow", Golden Palm winner at Cannes Festival. No child and no sailor, but rather an ex-sailor with a child-like personality: this is Al Pacino as Francis Lionel Delbucci aka 'Lion', and no rookie who's going to jail, no streetwise bad-ass, but a robust and short-tempered ex-convict: this is Gene Hackman as Max Millian, forming with Lion one of the most unlikely and endearing pairing of the New Hollywood period. After the gripping documentary-like "The Panic in Needle Park", Jerry Schwartzberg signs another piece of art about two misfit characters, indulging in more poetical and philosophical statements about life, from two vagabonds who meet in a two-lane road penetrating deserted hills, the fitting setting for two men at the crossroads of their lives. Max wants to go to Pittsburgh where he sent all the money he earned during his jail time, his plan is to open a car wash. And 'Lion' left his girl Annie (Penelope Allen) while she was pregnant. He was so scared he never knew if it was a boy or a girl and never made amend of his irresponsible act except by sending money for five years. Carrying a little lamp in gift-box, he wants to see his child and Annie to forgive him, before starting a new life. The gift-box is the reminder of actions that might contain the roots of his juvenile and optimistic attitude, trying to make people laugh as a way to hide a tormenting guilt. We're inclined to believe this because Max, the one who paid his debt to society, has nothing to blame himself on anymore, and exudes self-confidence and moral strength.The contrast between Lion and Max is the soul of the movie and the cement of their relationship, almost a 'friendship at first sight' but the real decisive step was when Lion gave his last match to Max, a gesture that made Max develop a genuine fondness and instinctive trust of Lion: he proposes a partnership in the car wash business and Lion's acceptance doesn't say much because he strikes as a character who never says 'no'. As the movie goes on, we know more about his philosophy of life, maybe sometimes in a too explicit way. Lion believes that making people laugh is the best antidote against hostility and aggressiveness, in a nutshell, "scarecrows make crow laugh". Al Pacino conveys the illusion of an optimistic nature that hardly hides a desperate desire to be loved and accepted. 'Lion' incorporates within the same character the cowardly lion of "The Wizard of Oz" because he can't face the hideous side of life and the scarecrow with a heart, a big and generous heart. Al Pacino delivers one of his finest performances, even more impressive because it was made right after a total opposite role, as the charismatic and menacing Michael Corleone, indeed, this 'Lion' is no 'Lionheart'.Gene Hackman said it was his favorite performance and I can see why. he plays a strong man, a no-nonsense guy who takes no crap from anyone, who's never reluctant to fight if someone disrespects him, and sticks to his plan of car wash no matter what happens. And unlike Lion aka the scarecrow, he has the brains; he's got intelligence and street smarts. He completes Lion's naivety and lack of realism, while Lion, in his way, injects his joyful and cheerful nature in Max. Yet it would be too convenient to take their complementarity for granted. Yes they complete each other but one has more to learn about life. There's no doubt that the picaresque journey the two characters would take, will teach them a few lessons or two but Max only has to loosen up a bit, and to use a sense of humor while Lion, is the one who'll learn the hard way the limits of his theory about scarecrows, after one crucial visit to Max' sister in Denver that would end in another conviction to jail.Lion is the victim of a rape attempt from an inmate named Riley (Richard Lynch), in a scene even more disturbing because Lion is such an adorable character, he'll try to use humor as a defense, totally blinded by his own naivety, but Riley breaks Lion's shield as if it was made of paper. Max eventually avenges his friend, but after the jail episode, nothing would be the same. There is one crucial moment where Max avoids fighting by starting a striptease, and it's obvious that he pulled some of Lion's character in his attitude. Yet, it's a bittersweet moment, because at the same time, Lion stares at him with melancholy. This look on Pacino's face has been debated countless times, my belief is that he understood how limited he was in this rude life. His happy-go-lucky philosophy only had sense if he could handle tougher situations, a guy like Max can afford to make people laugh because he impresses too. Lion understands that a scarecrow still has to scare crows, otherwise, they eat the seeds. Roger Ebert compared the film to "Easy Rider" and "Midnight Cowboy" with two men joining their efforts for a a better future, I myself found a deeper and more poignant connection with Fellini's "La Strada" especially through its tragic undertones. I was so upset by the film's conclusion that I hesitated to see it twice. But it's truly an absorbing and penetrating film about two misunderstood souls, one strong enough to deal with life, and another one who ? well, I can only hope, sincerely hope, for an off-screen happy ending.</fullReview>

The movie has not been available either I have been trying for year's to get hold of a copy. Eventually I found a copy on Amazon though it had to be shipped from the US, I also had to buy a multi region DVD player - however it was well worth it.I watched the movie last night and it was as powerful as ever.

		<shortDescription>Two idiot drifters with little in common.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Hackman is Max, an incredibly angry and thin-skinned drifter with a penchant for fighting. Inexplicably, Lion (Al Pacino) insists on partnering up with him and they drift through life together for a while. They take odd jobs, hitch rides and seem to have little in the way of connections. The film follows them as they go from city to city and throughout all this you wonder why the nice, mild-mannered Lion has anything to do with the nasty and impossible to like Max. As for Max, while he says he saving money so that the pair can open up a car wash, he constantly is sabotaging himself and his big plans."Scarecrow" is the sort of picture you'd never see today. It's an aimless, drifting sort of slice of life with none of the formula or style you'd find in a Hollywood or even Indie release. In some ways, it's reminiscent of some of the French New Wave films. In other words, folks exist but there isn't any sort of a goal or direction in their lives. For me, this wasn't a particularly satisfying or enjoyable experience, though Pacino's performance was enjoyable and interesting at times. Hackman, however, was a one-not performance...angry and not much else.By the way, there is a rather brutal attempted rape scene late in the film. Folks who have been through experiences like this might want to avoid the picture as it won't be easy viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Road to Wigan Pier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fittingly for a film awash in "Wizard of Oz" motifs, Jerry Schatzberg's "Scarecrow" opens on a yellow brick road. Max Millan's (Gene Hackman) on one side, Lionel "Lion" Delbuchi's (Al Pacino) on the other, but the gift of a "last match" sparks a friendship which draws both men together.Schatzberg then quickly sketches the personalities of both men. Max is an angry hothead who has just been released from prison and who harbours dreams of starting a business. Lion, in contrast, is a coward who resorts to comedic self depreciation in order to avoid conflict. Both men have severe avoidance complexes, resorting to cowardice or violence, action or inaction, as a means of combating a hostile post-War America. Like Jack Nicholson's "The King of Marvin Gardens" (1972), "Scarecrow" (1973) ultimately watches as two outcasts grapple with delusions, aspirations and an American Dream which exists only to betray."Scarecrow" takes the format of a road-movie, Lionel and Max embarking on a little cross country adventure. Their ultimate destination? Small-town Pittsburgh, where the duo hope to start a car-wash business. Along the way they stop off at Max's sister's home in Denver, and then visit Lionel's ex-lover in Detroit. Both visits point to wasted lives steeped in sadness and regret. Lionel and Max's contradictory personalities may act as a magnet which pulls each towards a "sensible" middle ground, but there are no happy endings here. Lionel ends up in a mental hospital and Max remains a vagabond, a climax which perhaps too similarly echoes that of "Midnight Cowboy" (1969). Last shot? Max hammering a shoe full of dirty cash on a counter, still hopeful, but no closer to his dreams. Gorgeously shot by master cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmound.8/10 ? Minor classic. Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mournful but absorbing Seventies buddy-road film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having already made two New Hollywood classics?'Puzzle of a Downfall Child' (1970) and 'The Panic in Needle Park' (1971)?Jerry Schatzberg delivered again with 'Scarecrow', a compelling road-buddy movie starring Gene Hackman as Max Millan and Al Pacino as Francis Lionel "Lion" Delbuchi. Millan and Delbuchi, both misfits, meet on a lonely California road while hitchhiking and subsequently become friends, would-be business partners, and traveling companions. Recently released from a six-year stretch in San Quentin, the paranoid and pugnacious Max plans to travel to Pittsburgh and open a car wash with earnings saved from prison labor. The mild-mannered Lion, an ex-sailor, counters the world's hostility by playing the fool and is dubbed "Scarecrow" by Max. While Max's ambitions are more or less pragmatic, Lion's motivations are essentially emotional; he has no other plans than to travel to Detroit to give his young child (whom he has never seen) a birthday present?and possibly reconcile with the wife he deserted five years before. After various adventures, including an idyllic interlude with Max's sister and a lady friend and a nightmarish stint in a Nevada work farm, Max and Lion make it to Detroit but Lion is rebuffed by his former wife and told (falsely) that the child she was pregnant with when he left died at birth. Unhinged by the news, Lion subsequently grabs a little boy off the street and proceeds to take him into a massive public fountain (actually Scott Fountain on Belle Isle in Detroit) for purposes that are not at all clear. In the ensuing chaos, Max rescues the boy but Lion falls into a catatonic state from which he will likely never recover. In the end, Max (the allegorical figure for Mind) has no choice but to leave the vegetative Lion (the allegorical figure for Heart) on a gurney in a Detroit psychiatric hospital and to continue on to Pittsburgh by himself. Thus, the film ends in male martyrdom and emotional sclerosis, suggesting that commitment to family is often impossible to sustain and, once abandoned, cannot be resuscitated. This is blamed on women: creatures who are unforgiving, mean, and treacherous; they destroy male homo-social idylls, forcing men to go it alone. Vilmos Zsigmond's gorgeous cinematography and the excellent performances rendered by two of the greatest actors of the modern era cannot obscure what is essentially a celebration of male self-pity. It won the Golden Palm at Cannes and other foreign awards but was a resounding commercial failure?simply too depressing for American tastes. VHS (1992); DVD (2005).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the great undiscovered 70's classics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this inadvertently, while causally looking up a few director's work on IMDb. I never heard of the movie, and saw both Pacino AND Hackman in the same vehicle. I figured that alone prob made it worth checking it out. Little did I realize that this would turn out to be one of the great 70's classics, per that golden "directors era", when you could get away with a 10 minute scene with virtually no camera movement. This movie is very similar to "Easy Rider", with a dash of "Of Mice and Men", leavened with "Midnight Cowboy". A buddy pic, but a hard-core realistic one. Very raw, very real, very emotional. Much of the movie was shot with local townspeople as extras in local diners, dives, and such, and it has the same verisimilitude as "Easy Rider" in their local restaurant scenes. There are no grand statements here. It is not pretty. It's at times as crude as a bums' rush. But, that being the intent, it says SO much more than the "great" movies with pretensions. In saying little, and being blatantly simple and honest, it says so much more, volumes more.Pacino is his usual great emotive self, slightly more restrained here. Hackman is even better which is obviously saying something. Hackman mentioned this as his fav role. I can see why. Such a beautifully developed character, rich with understatement and meaning. Both actors easily could have been nominated here(Oscars). I would second Jerry Schatzberg's direction as well, as grainy and real as anything Scorsese has ever done.Please do yourself a favor and watch/cherish this forgotten classic sometime...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did I not know about this one?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love films like this that aren't always the most acclaimed. Being a big Pacino fan I saw this title pop up on my Tivo. I had no idea what to expect and I was blown away by its power.The film starts out slow, as expected, because its a story about to traveling drifters. If it wasn't for Pacino and Hackman, I probably would have lost interest. What grabs you are the long uncut takes with both actors, showing you just how wonderful they are. Hackman is the tough guy who has just gotten out of prison. He has his money saved and wants to open a car wash in Pittsburgh. Pacino is the joker who has been at sea and wants to make his way back to Detroit to visit his child who he has never seen or even knows the sex of. They make their way through the country and the irony of the title of the film rears its head.The ending is in fact heartbreaking. Pacino gets assaulted in prison and doesn't exactly have good news about his child when he gets to Detroit. Hackman learns to lay off his aggressive attitude, taking cues from Pacino's character. Giving away the entire ending would ruin it, so I won't.The film is a great study from two great actors in the human experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wizard of Oz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching this movie, I detected, what I believed to be, references to the Wizard of Oz. The obvious analogues, of course, would be the scarecrow aspect as well as the fact that Max referred to Lionel as Lion (as in the cowardly lion.) Viewing Lionel as the cowardly lion fits with his whole aversion to violence, preferring instead to resort to humor to diffuse tense situations. Also, his random silly behavior would fit with the whole "if I only had a brain" riff by the Scarecrow in Oz. I also saw how their journey together could be viewed as analogous to the yellow brick road bit. Also, its possible to view the car wash business in Pittsburgh (or whatever Lionel expected from going to Detroit) as the rough equivalent to finding the Wizard of Oz, only to discover that the wizard is a fake, i.e. the car wash or Lionels's reunion with his son are just empty dreams finally dispelled by Lionel's catatonic state, which could be construed to be representative of Dorothy's return to the real world from her dream.If my theory is true, then I still can't figure out exactly what might represent other aspects of WOZ, such as the Tin Man, Gilda the Good Witch, or even the Wicked Witch for that matter, though Annie, with her lies ultimately spurring Lionel's illness, could be a very tenuous sketch of the Wicked Witch. Also, I suppose Max could be viewed as representative of the Tin Man ("if I only had a heart") due to his violent and aloof nature (i.e. he's heartless). The connection is rather attenuated, however, the above mentioned aspects seem too interrelated to be just mere coincidence. Did anybody else see such a connection, and, if so, are there other overlapping themes/characters that I'm missing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exemplary performances by Hackman and Pacino</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring AL PACINO and GENE HACKMAN, these are very different kinds of roles for both of them. I rate these performances as good as any other by either star. Plus they work fantastically well with one another. Why haven't we seen more Hackman/Pacino pairings?They play down-and-outters, nearly on the level of bums... but they have a goal: To start a business with some money saved up by Hackman's roughneck character. The Ultimate Loner, he only accepts the good-natured Pacino as a partner because... well, you should see it for yourself. I'll just say that they meet on opposite sides of a country road while trying to hitch-hike. The surly Hackman views the flaky Pacino as competition for a ride and silently rejects him. After all his hyper-active attempts at friendliness are rebuffed, Pacino makes one simple gracious gesture that wins over Hackman.The title has to do with an attitude, an approach towards life. Pacino states that a Scarecrow is successful in its life's mission, not by using fear and intimidation against the crows, but because it is humorous, and the crow's respond graciously for the good laugh by leaving alone his crop of corn.And our two main characters represent these two opposing approaches to life. It's amazing to see them transform and morph into one another, to adopt the other's philosophy. The pessimist begins to soften up, and the optimist loses his most precious dream. Pacino even LOOKS like a Scarecrow by the last Act of the film.Pacino's final scene is heart-wrenching. The closing images of Hackman in a bus station are perfect. He has to scrounge up a couple more bucks for a ticket but comes up short. While the impatient teller tries to shuffle him aside to help other people in line, Hackman digs out the last few beans... I won't give away the details, but his victorious expression in the end is priceless.I think this is one of the most overlooked/under-rated films of the 70's. But I include it as one of my favorite films of the 70's on its own merits (not just to somehow "correct" an oversight of the rest of the fans). It possesses a greater depth of psychology/allegory/symbolism than most people give it credit for. Beware any edited-for-tv version. The language is salty but essential. Also, the wide-screen cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond (aspect ratio of 2.35 : 1) might suffer in pan-and-scan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the more perplexing acting vehicles of the early 1970s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the high-powered names in the credits--and Warner Bros. at the picture's helm--this is one odd package: gritty but meek, somnambulist instead of artistic. Two drifters (Gene Hackman and Al Pacino) become friends on the road, dreaming up a scheme to go into the car-wash business together. Director Jerry Schatzberg allows his lead actors to roam and collect their characters on the fly; the muddy photography and patchy sound definitely gives one a sense of wayward dislocation, but none of this does much to strengthen the narrative, which is a little drowsy. Good acting nearly puts it over, although nothing can redeem the cheap sentimentality inherent in the film's final reel. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two for the Road</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Touching better-sweet and finally tragic film about two drifters hooking up and going through life in the early 1970's America to start up a car wash in Pittsburg that one of them Max Millan, Gene Hackman, has been saving up for his whole adult life. The other half of the duo merchant marine Francis Lionel "Lion" Delbuchi, Al Pacino, is far more modest in what he want's from life: To see his 5 year old son or daughter, he doesn't know the child's gender, who was born while he was away at sea. The two meet up and become good friends hitching for a ride and stay together throughout the whole movie until Lion suffers a complete nervous breakdown and is left in a hopelessly comatose and hospital in a vegetated state.While on the road the two ends up in a prison farm after Max slugged a policeman during a bar fight that Lion took part in. It's at the prison farm that the boyish like and sensitive Lion is brutally attacked and possibly raped by closet queen Riley, Richard Lynch. Riley who after spending a year deprived of any carnal outlets just couldn't hold it on any more and and catching Lion alone and unguarded attacked and ravaged the poor guy; Thus leaving him a bloody mess and having Max, later by beating the cr*p out of Riley, take revenge for his friend.***SPOILERS*** It's finally when both Max &amp; Lion reached Detroit where Lion's wife and child lived Lion's wife Annie, Penelope Allen, getting a call from him to see about their child he's told that first it was a boy and that the boy died at childbirth and even worse wasn't, in Lion being a practicing Catholic, even baptized! This left Lion in a state of shock and ridden with guilt! But as we saw that Annie really lied to Lion, the boy was actually alive and well,to punish him for leaving her. Actor Al Pacino's reaction to Annie's lie was almost exactly like the one he had in the upcoming "Godfather II" movie when he finds out that his child was purposely aborted by his wife Kay that had him, as Mafia Boss Michael Corleone, beat her black and blue! The sadistic Annie, who was married to the Joey "The Banana King" Gleason, got her wish in destroying Lion's life by having him slowly crack up with the false news that she gave him that sent him straight to the hospital psycho ward in a vegetated sate that, as the doctor told his good and concerned friend Max, he'll remain in for the rest of his natural life!P.S A heart broken Max now all by himself buys a bus ticket-With money hidden in his shoe- to his home town of Pittsburg to open up his car-wash business but without his good friend and traveling buddy Lion who was to be his partner in this business venture now a distant memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Max(Hackman) has been released from the jail after 5 years. In the beautifully shot title sequence, he meets up with Lionel(Pacino) and he decides to recruit Pacino as his partner for the car wash he plans on opening. However, before the wash can be opened there are certain familial obligations for both which have to be taken care off. The scripting is rock solid with Hackman and Pacino playing distinct and memorable characters. Hackman is always-ready-to-brawl-cynical strongman whereas Pacino is optimistic and wants to make people laugh. The movie is the story of the travels and travails. Hackman gets the better role and executes in a flawless manner. For the major part of the movie he completely overshadows Pacino who starts coming into his own by the end of it. A must watch for the fans of the two great actors and lovers of superb drama. 4 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarecrows are beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't know what "Scarecrow" was about when I watched it last week. I hadn't even heard of it. If I knew it was about two drifters on the road, I probably wouldn't have given it a try. This is a movie about people you wouldn't even look at when passing by. I got caught quickly into the story, and the surprise was a pleasant one. Some may argue that Scarecrow is sentimental or "unrealistic", but that's not my first impression, and I think that's mainly due to the actors, who are too good to let the movie slip into cliché. Al Pacino's character is utterly charming and there are some heartbreaking moments, which is proof of Pacino's wonderful acting. Creating a character that viewers end up really caring about isn't easy. The same can be said about Gene Hackman, whose talent makes his character develop and become more sympathetic as the story unfolds. My main objection is to the ending, which I found outrageous. I mean, the movie looks unfinished, but I guess one has to expect this kind of "artistry" from many of the 70's movies. Actors like Al Pacino and Gene Hackman don't come across too often, and "Scarecrow" is a brilliant showcase, sadly under-rated. If you want to see two great actors on top of their game, watch this beautiful story with a message.</fullReview>

I loved the movie for the chemistry between the 2 leads Hackman and Pacino, and also for the gritty realism of the characters in this great road movie. I thought it was an absorbing and at times humorous study of the relationship that developed between them on their journey through Denver, Detroit on way to Pittsburgh(?). I recall that despite being a tough guy Scarecrow (Hackman) really felt the cold and wore several layers of clothing to keep warm?

		<shortDescription>Pacino and Hackman are drifters in bittersweet road movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scarecrow" (1973) features great cinematography from Vilmos Zsigmond. It's the story of an unlikely pair of drifters who get together, each with dreams. It reminded me of "Thunderbolt and Lightfoot" (1974), but this is not a crime story. In my view, Hackman handles his part extremely well while Pacino has some problems with his role. He's uncomfortable at times and not always convincing, as if he weren't in full sympathy with the part. The story is more in the form of an episodic road story than anything else. The episodes are well-edited. One sequence eventuates in Hackman doing a striptease, and this had me laughing out loud. Excellent. The characters are novel, interesting and sympathetic. They make the movie a piece of Americana. The themes of dreams unfulfilled, growing up, growing and complementarity of people, are not that engrossing. The relationship between the two men is handled reasonably well and begins to come together, but in the final analysis I felt it didn't gel the way it should have to have really been masterful. The ending is just all right but is a bit of a disappointment too. The film seems to have greater ambitions than it realized. It really couldn't without a better story and script. But it gave it a good try. It sort of goes back to movies about rodeo people like "Junior Bonner" and "The Lusty Men".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes life like it's led by this class of people in USA, very well told in images and dialogues and benefiting from the excellent acting of those two movie giants called Gene Hackman and Al Pacino on the main roles. Two half-tramps meet occasionally on a road where they were both hitch-hiking and between them a strange friendship develops itself along good and bad moments. The oldest is just out of jail and fancies opening a car washing shop in Pittsburgh for which he wants the youngest one to become his partner. On their way to Pittsburgh several lively things happen to them in a very realistic way. There is place in this story for comedy an laughter as for drama and tragedy. It shows also that sentiments and feelings can be present in every human soul despite the apparent toughness of their behaviour and the misery of their lives. The youngest of these too is also traveling to see his child whose mother he left some years before while she was pregnant, despite the fact that he doesn't even know if it's a boy or a girl.

		<fullReview>I first saw this film on its release in 1973, just after I became a Pacino fan following his riveting performance in "The Godfather." Went to see "Scarecrow" twice in a matter of days and was hooked for evermore on it. It proved he couldn't be typecast (a bit like Dustin Hoffman following "The Graduate" with "Midnight Cowboy"). Over the years I saw "Scarecrow" several more times, bought a copy on video and only last week finally got a DVD copy on ebay. Got to say it's still one of my favourite films ever and I see around 175 films (on video or DVD or at the cinema) a year. The acting all round is exceptional and Gene Hackman has hardly ever been better (he has cited "Scarecrow" as his favourite work). It is as much his film as Pacino's. "Scarecrow" is a fast moving, totally engaging piece of work superbly directed by Jerry Schatzberg ("Panic in Needle Park"). It is a film I can watch at any time and never get bored with. Excellent photography too. I just hope that one day Pacino and Hackman will make another film together - for me they are the 2 best actors in modern cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why can I not even find a copy of this film anywhere? It seems to me Scarecrow has been criminally underrated and overlooked. Two of the best actors of their time both on excellent form in an unique and quirky story line sounds like a winning formula and it is so why has this one slipped in virtual obscurity? Makes no sense to me, nah'm sayin'?8/10 - in comparison to other Pacino films from that time - better than Dog Day Afternoon and Serpico.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had heard about this movie for a long time but for some reason always missed seeing it. The other night it was on one of the premium channels. I watched it and enjoyed it but it started at the beginning with the credits in wide-screen and when the credits were over it changed to the "pan and scan" mode and throughout the movie I felt that I was missing half the movie which made it irksome to watch. Both performances by Hackman and Pacino were flawless however. Maybe someday I will watch it in the correct aspect ratio and enjoy it the way it was meant to be seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting doesn't get better than Pacino and Hackman.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most overlooked films in the history of cinema is 1973's "Scarecrow" starring a newly discovered Al Pacino, and Gene Hackman (which he calls his favorite piece of work).The story is about two men, Francis-Lionel and Max. They befriend each other while trying to hitchhike on a dusty and windy road. The plot is so simple and genuine. Max wants to go to the mid-west and start a carwash. You start to care so much for the ambition the both of them carry.You are taken on a wonderful trip through two of the most talented actors this world will ever see. There is one scene in a department store (which i won't give away) that is so priceless you'll want to rewind it and watch it again and again.Unamazed to me, "Scarecrow" won Best Picture at the Cannes Film Festival and to this day I haven't scene two actors so natural in their characters. Pacino's performance in the ending scenes (especially at the big fountain) is breathtaking.This film is above giving it a rating. It is a classic, and you can't put a rating on a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hackman and Pacino have never been better, as two hitchhikers that meet, and develop a close symbiotic relationship. A very human story, packed full of emotion. Plus, Vilmos Zsigmond's gritty photography is pure beauty to behold. Directed by Jerry Schatzberg, a former fashion photographer, who also directed Pacino in another lost gem, "Panic in Needle Park". People I urge you. Please go rent these classics. These are true movies. They don't make em' like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pacino and Hackman's great performances can't overcome the episodic, jarring script. The film's droll tone is punctuated by intense dramatic scenes which seem out of place. Though episodic structure is central to most road movies, the best ones have momentum, but Scarecrow just drags along. Finally, the resolution isn't at all satisfying -- and I don't mean in the "feel good/test audience" sense; it's just not satisfying dramatically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Scarecrow, a film, most haven't even heard off, which is quite baffling considering it is one of the best films of the 70s. Gene Hackaman and Al Pacino give their greatest performances, as two drifters who meet on the road, and quickly develop a friendship and a dream together - to open up a car wash in Pittsburg.The road to Pittsburg, with these two is often funny and tragic in the same breath. The direction from the underrated J.S, is patient and smooth, as is the photography, the script, is so effortless and authentic, coupled with the performances, it's the closer to a documentary than a film. If you want to see something true and beautiful, see Scarecrow, one of my favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film I wanted to see when it came out, and thanks to Netflix I have, 36 years later. A film so prescient - reaching back into history to deliver far more than cinema does today. The 70's were not a complete movie cesspool and Hackman is one of the reasons.I can only describe it in bits and pieces.... The relation between Hackman and Pacino is reminiscent of Hackman and Pagoda in Tenenbaums, and a reminder than Hackman played broad comedy well. Czech films like Closely Watched Trains come to mind for comparison. But also Paris Texas, and Samuel Beckett's plays.... The constant tension of a world which has no meaning at its very bottom tells mainly on Pacino. A befuddled comic brutalized mentally and physically; finally spent, sedated, and strapped to a gurney. And the eccentric tics.... Hackman's broken lighter, multilayer wardrobe, afternoon naps and cigar stumps. Pacino's grubby gift box, telephone shtick and pirate monologues. This film is a giant collage built out of random scraps of color....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unsung Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>According to Pacino (in his 1980s Playboy interview) this film got squeezed out in some kind of studio powerplay. That happens, but usually time undoes the damage and real classics - and this is one - take their rightful place in film's pantheon. Why this hasn't happened in this case is beyond understanding: for once, Pacino evades the Italo-gangster typecasting and shows true brilliance; Hackman takes the Buck Barrow character from Bonnie and Clyde and turns it into something akin to Shakespeare's Falstaff. The writing is brilliant, the comedy brilliant, and the tragedy sprinkled in with unheard of sensitivity. Congress should create an award for unfairly ignored films and put this one at the top of the list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though Scarecrow has a lot to recommend it (great acting by Hackman, and an interesting cast of little-known or non-professional actors), it also has a couple of flaws that, for me, made watching the film more and more of a trial the longer it went on.The narrative follows a fairly predictable arc that is slowed by some repetition. The script tends towards the saccharine. The characters become less believable the longer they hang around.Most of all, however, Scarecrow is marred by Pacino's overripe, over-the-top performance. As Pacino becomes more and more histrionic his character becomes less and less sympathetic. At the end I didn't like the guy at all and couldn't wait for the inevitable hammer blow. Director Schatzberg should have reigned Pacino in. Less is often more.</fullReview>

One of Hackman's best performances(after BONNIE &amp; CLYDE, FRENCH CONNECTION, I NEVER SANG FOR MY FATHER) and he plays a tough lout with a big mouth and a bad temper who's been imprisoned. Pacino plays a little shnook with the heart of a lion and very sensitive and damaged. They make a great combo and there's a lively supporting cast as they move cross country. One of the few films that actually moved cross country.An 8 out of 10. Best performance = Al Pacino.

		<shortDescription>Two great performances heighten rather mediocre material</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Scarecrow" is the kind of film that would only be made in the 70s. Its a mature and low-key adult drama produced by a major studio featuring big name stars. The reason why I treasure this time period so much is that in the post-MTV youth-centric market, this kind of picture is a complete rarity. However, its far from perfect. The film is praised by some for its realism, and while thats certainly noteworthy, the screenwriters seem to confuse realistic with uneventful. There's too many parts where nothing really happens, and by the time the characters explain the philosophy of the title, you begin to wonder if there's really any point to this film.Fortunately, despite the mediocre material, the film is worth watching because of the two great lead performances. Al Pacino and Gene Hackman are both noted as being two of the finest actors ever, and having them both share the screen together is amazing. They play off each other very well, with Pacino's character being a lovable loser and Hackman a egotistical yet complex drifter. They manage to make the rather dull script more powerful than it would've been with lesser actors in the leads. They're terrific, and the only real reason to watch "Scarecrow". But what a reason it is. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Scarecrows are beautiful"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of both Gene Hackman and Al Pacino, lately I've been searching out their earliest works I've yet to see, which of course lead me to Scarecrow. The acting here is what really pushes the film to perfect. Hackman is Max, a hard ass ex-con who slowly softens up a bit after meeting Pacino's character, Lion, a sailor. Each of them a drifter now, they meet in a great opening bit where they're hitchhiking; Lion makes a fool of himself on the side of the road, but it is his offering of his last match to Max that secures the friendship. From there they drift about, taking care of one another, eventually ending up in jail for a brief period after a bar fight goes wild. In jail, their friendship is tested, but Max proves he really does care about Lion, and their bond. It is through all this Lion shows Max how "the scarecrows are beautiful", how they keep "the crows laughing". However, it's a sad tale, and within all the comedy, the often times very engaging drama, there's a very deep story about two wounded men who've somehow found each other on the road of life. They're both scarecrows, in a sense: Lion uses his humour to 'scare people off', while Max uses his real scare tactics and physicality to keep people away. The last twenty minutes of the film is absolutely heartbreaking; it's the most sincere, beautiful performance I've seen by Al Pacino, personally. The character of Lion really comes out at the end, and I applaud the writing for shielding the details of his personal life until near the finale- it's a roller-coaster watching Pacino go through all the awful emotions Lion feels after the 'reveal'. And it's also frustrating; though Lion isn't perfect, and we find out how his actions have affected his family, the lie his wife tells him does immense damage to his psyche, and possibly ends him, emotionally, for the remainder of his life.Amazingly powerful movie. I expected it to be a real treat acting-wise, but I had no idea this was going to be such a moving, intense experience. There are little bits and pieces in the film that fall together here and there, and I love stories like that; even the very end, when Max is pounding his boot at the ticket counter, we finally understand exactly why he only ever slept with his boots under his pillow. Hackman and Pacino should forever be proud of the jobs they both did here. In fact, the whole team came together, clicking in the right places, from script to direction, and I wish there were more soulful films like these in this day and age. Without a doubt at all, 10 out of 10 stars. One of the best of the 1970s in American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional film with two superb performances.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1970s are often cited as a decade of evolution for American cinema, and I can't say that I disagree. Evolving from the world of classic cinema, the '70s were a time of growth in character and uniqueness of storytelling. We became exposed to stories that we wouldn't have seen in decades before, with characters filled with grit and moral ambiguity. Stories became as much about developing their characters as they did about driving the narratives, with a wave of powerful and dynamic young actors like Dustin Hoffman and Jack Nicholson making their names. Of course there are plenty of exceptions to this, but Scarecrow is one of the finest examples of '70s American cinema.Two of the cream of that crop of young actors were Al Pacino and Gene Hackman, and here they portray two drifters named Max and Lion who drift into one another at the beginning of the film. Together they take a journey towards Pittsburgh, where Max has saved up some money in order to open a car wash, which he invites Lion to do with him. Scarecrow came out in 1973, the same year as The Last Detail, and both films follow a similar structure of using a long journey to explore it's characters. It's not about the point A to point B journey but is instead about taking us on an emotional, thematic journey with these characters. It also bears a resemblance to the great Midnight Cowboy, in the way that these two distinctly different characters come into each other's lives and they both transform the other in ways they wouldn't have expected.Hackman's Max is a stubborn and aggressive man, stuck in his ways and unable to enjoy the freedom his life allows. He's always one step away from a violent outrage and constantly finds himself getting into confrontations during their time together. Pacino's Lion, on the other hand, is a free spirit with a child-like sense of joy. He is always playing games, dancing around, making faces and trying to make everyone else laugh. When faced with malice from an outside force, Max will revolt with a violent attack but Lion finds himself constantly trying to make jokes and ease the tension away. Their journey together sends them toward the other's sensibility and it's this turn that provides the most interesting aspect of Scarecrow. Lion is eventually faced with the real horrors of the world and realizes that his infantile approach to life can leave him vulnerable to the despicable nature of some people, whereas Max comes to understand that sometimes you should just relax and not constantly live with one hand in a fist.Guiding the whole journey, of course, are the performances from Hackman and Pacino. These are two of my absolute favorite actors, so it means a lot when I say that these are high among their finest performances. Hackman has said that this was his favorite performance of his career, but the financial failure of the film discouraged him from taking on more independently minded stories such as this and he spent the rest of his career in more commercially safe films. He still managed to deliver quality work for his whole career, but it's a shame that he became so reluctant to do anymore films like this because he is on fire here. All of that stubborn aggression of Max is burnt into Hackman's bulky frame and he creates an intimidating, fascinating character. Watching him slowly start to open up in the later stages of the film was a beautiful turn.Pacino in the '70s overall was arguably the finest decade for any actor in the history of film and this is one of the strongest examples as to why that was. It's an incredibly unique character for him, trading in the brooding anarchists that he was known for and instead playing someone so filled with wonder and child-like bliss. He is at his most charismatic and playful here and it's a true testament not only to his skill as an actor, but especially to his diversity. The fact that his work here came in the same year as his explosive performance in Serpico, sandwiched by his timeless portrayal of Michael Corleone in the first two Godfather films, is astonishing to ruminate on. These are two tremendous performances highlighting a film with a surprisingly emotional impact.</fullReview>

Many scenes of this character especially " Fountain Scene " when Al was so charming and stunning , a great scene in which Lion's (Al Pacino) mental illness comes out . Pacino has shown a lot of his powerful talents after the call of " Lion " with his ex-wife when she told him ' your son is dead ' . From this scene on we can discover what Al can deliver by his unique performance . Its really touching .

		<fullReview>But it saddens me to say that over the years, I have seen much better films that starred the above Hollywood veteran actors. If you think about it, Midnight Cowboy directed by John Schlesinger and starred Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman was a much superior film to watch. My all time favorite film being The Saint of Fort Washington (1993) which starred my favorite actors Danny Glover and Matt Dillon. We also have Brokeback Mountain starring the late Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.Then we have more action oriented films, the Richard Donner Lethal Weapon trilogy with the pair of actors Danny Glover and Mel Gibson. We also have the superb thriller The Machanic which starred veteran actor Charles Bronson and Jan Michael Vincent.We have comedy films, such as the ones which starred Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder. These were Stir Crazy, See No Evil Hear No Evil, The Silver Streak, Another you.All these above film explore the relationship that develops between two men. In this film we have a recently released ex-con Max(Hackman) who meets an immature ex-sailor Lionel(Pacino). They strike up a friendship. Max confides to Lionel his dream of starting up a successful car wash business. Lionel agrees to help him, but explains that he has some personal problems to take care of before they can start-up the business Max had proposed.The rest of the film deals with unexpected and unforeseen events which occur. Will Max fulfill his dreams? See the film to find out what happens.Verdict: I have watched so many films over the years, both Hollywood and foreign language that I am very well versed. To me this film feels that it lacks the depth to other films of similar plot and genre. The film is well photographed, the actors are professional and the direction is efficiently handled. Note that this is the only Jerry Schatzberg I have ever seen.More Jerry Schazberg films to see: Misunderstood (1984), No Small Affair (1984), Street Smart (1987), Blood Money a.k.a Clinton And Nadine(1988).Gene Hackman Films: The French Connection 1971, French Connection 2 1975, Superman 1978, Superman 2 1980, Superman 4 1987, Narrow Margin 1990, Unforgiven 1992, Crimson Tide 1995, Extreme Measures 1996, Under Suspicion 2000.Al Pacino Films: Dog Day Afternoon 1975, Cruising 1980(Freidkin Masterpiece and a cult film to boot), Scarface 1983, Sea Of Love 1989, Scent Of A Woman 1992(I Highly recommend to you this beautiful film), Carlito's Way 1993, Heat 1995, Donnie Brascoe 1997, Insomnia 2002(a very underrated Chris Nolan film, highly recommended).Add these to your DVD/BLURAY collection and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I conclude those facts with this movie :1) it's clearly a 70s movie as it tells a moving, human story about losers, freethinkers, non conformists, ordinary people. It tells something about some fundamental values like friendship. Now, this kind of movie has just disappeared from American production as they are just about heroes blasting enemies and reconstructed biopic of famous « people ». 2) Pacino is a fabulous actor as he just exudes humanity. So, it's just a pity he did so many movies about characters with too little humanity (gangsters, cops, major, celebrity) because when he played ordinary people, you can see he's compassionate, funny and fragile ! 3) I think Gene Hackman belongs, like Adrian Brody, to the club of the exceptional but underrated artists : Here, he's excellent playing a grumpy but courageous and loyal friend. 4) At last, this movie points exactly where i am now : i remember watching « Dark Water » writing it was like my battle against a leaking studio, then « une vie meilleure » writing it was like my shared moments with the kid of my friend, now with this « Scarecrow », like « Just like a woman » or like « Hideous Kinky », it's about the fullness of living empty. Like all those characters, the daily life has become just so complicated that it would be a dream to ran away with nothing and take a day after a day with the dream to start from zero again...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I only recently got a chance to see Scarecrow, a film I knew very little about and I was intrigued with the casting of Gene Hackman and Al Pacino. There is a Wizard of Oz motif about this film, hence the title of the film Scarecrow.This is essentially a road film with two damaged characters that encounter each other on the road whilst they seek a destination but not sure how to get there.Hackman (Max) is an ex-convict with a short temper who wants to go to Pittsburgh and open a car wash. Pacino (Lionel) an ex-sailor who abandoned his pregnant girlfriend to go the high seas but did send money back regularly for his child whom he has never met. He also is rather childlike himself, naive and trusting. Whilst Max uses his temper and physical presence to keep people at his distance and if the occasion demands it, to get his way, Lion uses humour and slapstick.For a 1970s road film you might expect this to be grim and grey but it has gorgeous cinematography by Vilmos Zsigmond, in many senses that lighting makes the film rather ahead of its time with its vibrant yellow and brown hues.Max and Lion strike an unlikely friendship Max wants Lionel for his partner in business and along the way Max mellows somewhat.Both actors play fully formed characters with Pacino getting the chance to shine with the more playful side of Lion. You do get to care about these people, they have lived rough lives but they are not bad, nasty people but just trying to make their way in the world and have modest dreams and ambitions and you really hope they go on to do well.It is a series of vignettes as they encounter other characters and ladies who they make out with although it seems Hackman is the ladies man in this film and not Pacino. There is a stint in jail where Lion's vulnerabilities are exposed but the film although keeps good pace rather starts to lose steam towards the end until Lion contacts his ex- girlfriend and she gives him a metaphorical punch in the gut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You MUST see Scarecrow if you are a fan of Pacino's or Hackman's. Don't read one second more, go out &amp; rent it NOW. If you are undecided...Where to begin. Cinematography: takes you right into the center of the story and every scene. Music: backs up and deepens the action. Must pay attention to: all the extras - the faces are incredible. It's as if you are seeing people from all times/any times, Dust Bowl types, Americans on the lam, losers, down and outers, wannabes. Plot: some will say this is the weakest element, and it is if you want a strong narrative with a climax and resolution - a literary approach. But if you let yourself believe in the director and actors and the whole experience, the plot works beautifully, because it supports what the movie is all about: two men who come to love and trust each other. Acting: astounding, intimate, uncomfortable, heart-wrenching, funny, poignant, vivid, memorable, aching, disturbing. The characters played by Hackman and Pacino, Max and Lion, are complicated, inarticulate men totally down on their luck. They may never be up on it. We get to see them from the inside out, feel their despair, rage, dyspeptic, desperate hope; see them implode, explode, reload and go on. As their relationship changes every minute, underneath the surface squabbles and discontents a strong foundation is laid. The emotional experience is subtle, believable, realistic. Two scenes among many are standouts - dinner with Max's old friends, and the strip dance in the bar - watch the interplay of expressions on the faces of Max and Lion and the bar crawlers as you listen to the music.This movie is what art is all about: going into another world and living it from the inside. I feel bigger and better for having seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Al Pacino in a comedy? Yes, he and Gene Hackman meet and hit it off in what feels like a road movie, because they go from place to place together. The first hour or so I couldn't stop laughing at Pacino's behavior and Gene's peculiarities. How many layers was Gene wearing? Seven, I think.Ann Wedgeworth from "Three's Company" and "Evening Shade" has a memorable supporting role and, if you blink, you'll miss Eileen Brennan in a small but revealing bit part. Pacino and Hackman land in jail and have a few encounters.But, then Pacino finally calls his ex of whom he abandoned years ago with her pregnant. She tells him a terrible lie, which drives him over the edge. I read here that this movie didn't do so well with moviegoers at the time. It may be because the ending is so unexpected and totally different in tone from the rest of the picture.If you dismiss this from one viewing, I would venture to say you're missing the point. I want to see it again, because now I know "Scarecrow" for what it is. I've never been a big fan of Pacino or those 70s movies that broke from the 50s and early 60s fantasy world, but aside from Pacino in "Dick Tracy", this may be my favorite Pacino performance."Scarecrow." Don't let the name fool you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wistful road movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whats great with "Scarecrow" is that it has both moments of comedy,tragedy and serenity.Its all spread throughout the movie carefully.Gene Hackman provides the fun with his tough guy persona which often looks comical.Al Pacino also provides some funny scenes,specially the one where he runs around the shop to create diversion so Hackman can steal.The movie can be split in two parts.The first is when Max and Lionel meet and strike up a partnership,sticking together through thick and thin.Its the part which is the more enjoyable of the two and gives you a good feeling.The second is the tragic one,when the two get arrested and are placed in jail with the villain of the film,Jack Riley(played well by Richard Lynch).What the kindly naive Lion doesn't see,but Max does at once,is that Jack is out to get himself a prag.Therefore Lion falls victim to the beast,after being fooled that Jack will make him director for his talent show. Max is quick to avenge the brutal treatment that his buddy gets after a drunken night with Jack the Queer.The "rape" scene is the most difficult to watch and it marks this film as heavy on the eyes.However,after Jack gets what he deserves from Max,things get better and there is a reassessment that everything will get better from now on.Sadly,that doesn't prove to last.Lion's downfall comes shortly after the release from prison and its a heartbreaking moment.Al Pacino really shines in those scenes and I believe no actor could have been as good in this part.Max does everything to help his ailing friend and he doesn't lose courage.The interesting,and a bit frustrating,thing with this film is that it ends unfinished,leaving us in a maze.We don't get to find out if Max managed to raise enough money to pay for Lionel's treatment,we don't get the final reassessment.But that also makes the film better.And it leaves the possibility for a sequel,which is something I would like to see happen more than anything.Yet,I have a feeling that it never will.This film,although not a box office hit,won a Golden Palm.That shows that although "Scarecrow" is a great film,it never had a chance to gather an audience for itself,possibly because of its gripping,realistic and bleak nature.Such movies have always been a rarity in American cinema.That all makes this a remarkable and rewarding film,something that any true cinema aficionado should see. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting - How this movie fits between "The Godfather" and "Serpico".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While `The Godfather' was not Al's first movie (it's his third), it's certainly the one that gave everyone their first look and feel of his talent. Then he made `Scarecrow'. At the start, we see him as a young drifter who immediately shares with Gene his attitude of humor as the way to take on life. I thought: Hey, he's giving himself a break from the very structured character he played in `The Godfather' and is going to have some fun in this movie. Well, as this movie goes on, we see that humor fading away, forced from him by some bad interactions with others. 'Course, about this same time, Gene finally grabs the humor bug that Al's character has been trying to get him to catch, so he's having fun now, right? So, did Al get a break from playing the serious character? No, so what's he do next? - He makes `Serpico'. What a downer. I'm not knocking that great movie, just saying that his character plays an extremely serious cop forced into awful situations. It's just that I was hoping, as `Scarecrow' started out, that I was watching the kind of movie that actor's enjoy making simply so they can have fun (they're entitled, aren't they?), but nope, the seriousness is all there. Still, it's interesting the order these three fall into, within a year of each other. If you're like most people (me included), you missed this one when it first came out. Watch it now. It's well worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scarecrow is American director Jerry Schatzberg's film about two adorable misfits.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some American directors have always been admired more outside the borders of USA. They include genuine 'auteurs' such as Martin Scorsese, David Lynch, Tim Burton, Spike Lee, Stanley Kubrick, Samuel Fuller, Paul Schrader and Jerry Schatzberg. All these people have made their mark in Europe too especially in France, the birthplace of cinema where their films are admired by both old and young alike. Jerry Schatzberg achieved considerable artistic success at Cannes in 1973 when Scarecrow won 'Grand Prix' jointly with 'The Hireling' directed by Alan Bridges. His film 'Scarecrow' can be classified as a road movie about two buddies whose contrasting personality traits transform them into adorable losers. It is an American film with a large amount of European cinema aesthetics. The unique thing about 'Scarecrow' is that it remains very faithful in its presentation of troubled times in which it is set. It is set in 1970s, a period of hopelessness for American people as due to the aftermath of recession, economic stagnation made the lives of ordinary Americans difficult. It is in such desolate times that two drifters Max and Francis strike up a very odd friendship. These roles are played with utmost perfection by Gene Hackman and Al Pacino. Lastly, Scarecrow will continue to influence a whole new generation of movie watchers as it is the first American film which dared to show that even tough guys are capable of cracking due to adverse situations in life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average Film Saved by the Greatness of the Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Max, an ex-con drifter with a penchant for brawling is amused by Lion, a homeless ex-sailor, and they partner up as they head east together to open a car wash in Pittsburgh.The film works because it has star power: Al Pacino and Gene Hackman. Had others been in it, we might have not been so lucky and the film could has faded into obscurity.The story about the film's title is interesting (about whether scarecrows make crows scared or laugh). I think it raises a good point -- birds would have to be really, really stupid to mistake a scarecrow for a man.I appreciate the product placement for the banquet beer -- the original Coors -- despite it appearing the cans they drink from are quite empty. The Kentucky Fried Chicken seems real, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Timing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently sat down to watch two great movies, both by Francis Ford Coppola--The Godfather, Part II and The Conversation. They were dazzling films with little in common except, maybe, for the gloomy paranoia they shared. Both Harry Caul and Michael Corleone are deeply tragic characters, their nature damaged by their nurturing. Gene Hackman and Al Pacino made their characters heart-wrenchingly real, and I recommend both movies for these two actors' performances alone.I do not do the same for Jerry Schatzberg's Scarecrow, with Hackman and Pacino.I've wanted to see this movie since I was in high school. The thought of these two powerhouse actors in a "road" film riveted my attention the first time I saw an advertisement for the movie. But, with prudish parents, and not being old enough to see an R-rated movie, Scarecrow just slipped away from my consciousness, and it wasn't until a few years ago that, when we subscribed to Netflix, I thought it was time to see this tour de force actors' movie.I didn't even see it then. It wasn't until recently that I checked out Scarecrow from the local library. Finally, after almost 37 years, I sat down to watch Scarecrow and . . .It wasn't The Godfather or The Conversation but a murky, uneven, and tedious art film, with two great actors just actin' up a hurricane of deeply profound acting.Whoo-ee, look at them boys up there on the screen actin'! Have ya ever seen the like? It took me two weeks to watch Scarecrow all the way through, it was that much work and that little pleasure. The movie was on video tape so I ran it all the way to the end to see how much of this actin' was left and shoot, but there tweren't 47 minutes still to go. I could do that.Now, if you're asking, "Idiot, if it was that bad, why not just take the damn thing back to the library?" And the idiot replies, "Once it's started it's my obligation to finish it!" So here it is, a day after I finished Scarecrow. I still respect and enjoy the work of Gene Hackman and Al Pacino. Yet, I can say without hesitation or reservation that Scarecrow is a dreadfully dull film that wasn't worth the wait.I can now check it off my "bucket list" of movies I need to go back to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am surprised Francis wasn't abducted by aliens or had a herd of gnus run all over him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great opening shot, visually speaking, when Hackman appears from behind the hill. What follows is utter silence for several minutes, reminding the viewer that although this is an American movie, it is more European in its attitude. Then Pacino starts impersonating a gorilla, and at that point I was very close to pressing the "stop" button. Later on I realized why they did this (and other buffoonery they glued onto his character): Pacino had to be made into an over-the-top happy person (well, OK, not THAT happy) in order for the writer to make him fall. Fall down. Way, way, way down, all in the name of "the human condition" or whatever it is that "Scarecrow" was supposed to be about. Suffering, both mental and physical, as the only way to create (a) drama - for some writers and film-makers that's the only way they know, which I find somewhat pathetic.Typical of its era, yet another 70s "grit" drama, focusing on various joes shmoes and their empty, irrelevant lives. Much like similarly well-cast, well-filmed movies of that era, such as "Straight Time", "Five Easy Pieces", "The Last Detail", (to name but a few that were quite solid), "Scarecrow" is an "actor's dream", a film-critic's "wet dream", but also frequently the viewer's nightmare. I bet this was a flop at the box-office.Fortunately, neither Bergman nor some overrated French con-artist (with a penchant for Marxist propaganda) directed this, hence there is a decent cast, and while the goings-on may get occasionally too slow and even depressing, SC is a watchable drama, though with the predictable downer ending in which Pacino gets the crap end of the stick, which was to be expected.After all, when a "buddy drama" starts off with a happy character, that happy-go-lucky guy is the one of the two that is in grave danger of either: 1) ending up dead, 2) being severely beaten at some point (check), 3) locked up innocent (check), and/or 4) ending up a catatonic like Jack Nicholson in "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" (check). (Oh alright, Jack was lobotomized, let's not split hairs, it's the same damn ending.) The writer went all-out to destroy Francis (Pacino) in every way he could, simply so that the movie would have that critically-acclaimed tragic touch that gets movie-festival juries all bubbly with joy, rushing to hand out awards in the name of "art" (which HAS to do with suffering, nearly always, for some daft reason, which is why sci-fis and comedies cannot win anything usually).Personally, I think they went overboard, something akin to overkill. I was half-expecting an elephant to step on Pacino's face while he was lying motionless on that hospital bed. Or a bird to fly in, crap on his face, and infect him with a rare bird disease. Just for good measure. Just so the very last one of us knows that Francis has been royally screwed by fate.So if you're into deliberately slow-paced dramas (though nothing nearly as slug-slow as a typical overrated Bergman turd), and you've always wanted to see someone try to rape Al Pacino, after which he gets his face smashed in like a pancake, this movie's right up your alley. Personally, I thought it was OK, nothing more, and without Hackman to hold it all together, this would have been a mediocre movie. Pacino is usually excellent, but this role wasn't written that well, and his character wasn't all that interesting, so there was little he could do to make himself stick out ? except of course when he went bonkers at the fountain, got a seizure, and then went catatonic just so the writer could have his glorious moment of tragedy. Amateur (the writer, not Pacino).Sure, it's fairly intelligent, but is it particularly entertaining?Btw, the movie wanted realism, in fact realism was its raison-d'etre (use French words and phrases in reviews, that somehow makes your arguments stronger and more convincing), and yet when Francis gets his head smashed, quite brutally, very extremely, I expected him to be disfigured for life, or at least to undergo some kind of massive reconstructive plastic surgery. However, there was none of that. Apparently, if you beat someone's face in, disfigure it, break every bone in the head, you still get to recover fairly well within weeks. So much for the gritty reality.Who could possibly blame Francis for leaving his former wife? Did you all take a close look at that woman? Damn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>kind of made me feel like killing myself tho...........only problem i could maybe see people having with it is accusing it of anti-homosexual bigotry. This is not true. I guess it would be one way of inturprating what went on but the movie wasnt anti-gay it was anti-coersive sex/rape.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is almost as bad as the Blair Witch project. I'd rather watch Killjoy over this rechid waste of film. This would be a massive blemish on both hackman's and pacino's careers if anybody had actually heard of it. i am the only person I know who's ever seen this piece of trash.</fullReview>
