		<shortDescription>Guest and Levy orchestrate a nice tribute to the 1960s folk groups.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have a duo, a trio, and a group of 9. These three fictitious 'folk' groups from the 60s reunite for a concert in this mockumentary. What makes it so interesting is (1) I was a young adult in the 60s and vividly remember the folk group wave and (2) Guest, Levy and the others do their own singing and playing of songs they wrote for the movie. I think its IMDb ratings which cluster around 7 and 8 are about right. Not everyone will like 'A Mighty Wind' (song from final concert), it has improvised humor and many of the same actors from 'Best in Show'. But for fans of the humor of Guest and Levy it is a very nice little movie. The DVD has interesting extras, and the commentary track by Guest and Levy discuss how, for example, Levy had to take lessons to get is guitar skills back, and how O'Hara learned to play the autoharp for this role.The movie is 92 minutes long, which includes the 7 minutes of end credits. Of the 85 minutes of actual movie, the first 60 sets up the characters and groups, shows them in rehearsals, covers several back stories, then the final 25 minutes are the concert itself, actually performed before a live audience. There were a few truly outstanding folk groups in the 1960s, but there also were a whole bunch of mediocre ones. The three groups featured in this movie are as good as many of the 1960s groups that actually made a living entertaining. And, as at least one critic said, that's part of the problem with 'A Mighty Wind' - the groups are good enough, and the final concert is real enough, that much of the impact of the humor went away during the last act. The lampooning was gone, replaced by a legitimate set of performances.Still, I found it thoroughly enjoyable, and my favorite of the 'Guest/Levy' movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another CG Movie to Add to My Favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I laughed and thought it was pretty good. Then I saw it again. And again. And again. I bought it and watched it even more times.I don't think the movie is "pretty good" anymore. It's made a permanent home in my Christopher Guest collection as one of the movies I go around quoting. I own the DVD, the soundtrack and even the songbook.All of the cast members are hilarious as usual. I love The Folksmen trio of Harry Shearer, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest. A little reminiscent of Spinal Tap goes folk. The New Main Street Singers have such a dark side it's funny to see their on-stage presence as such chipper people. And Mitch and Mickey are the wacky split up sweethearts of yesteryear.I love this movie and look forward to the next release of this great comedic team!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Guest's movies, like his performances, are generally subtle and always low-key. They are not for people who need laugh tracks to follow the humor and most of his work is so contextually-based that some knowledge of the subject he's dissecting is a definite asset. Guest, who was a performer in the very early SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE, is, in many respects, the Anti-Belushi of modern American comedy.Nevertheless, he shares with Belushi - and many of their contemporaries, who came from one or another branch of the Second City organization - a certain fondness for off-the-wall elements in his work; Guest's tend to be slipped in, quietly, while Belushi's popped out of exploding cakes.A MIGHTY WIND is a spot-on satire of the American Folk Music movement of the early and mid-1960s. The narrative conceit is a memorial concert for a recently deceased impressario, organized by his son, which reunites three folk groups from the 60s.The real elements of the film are the send-ups of a variety of tropes of the era, musical styles, personalities, and quite an array of music-business cliches. Remarkably, however, the songs are genuinely entertaining in themselves; both the writing and the performances. They're satirical, but so subtlely performed that it's easy to loose the thread of the lyrics and wind up mindlessly nodding heads and grooving along, which pretty neatly captures the popular music experience for the last several generations. Satire within satire.The musical performances are excellent, recreating, almost frighteningly, the taste and texture of folk music of the era. And, bringing several real 60s folk acts to mind.The acting is typical of Guest movies, such as SPINAL TAP and BEST IN SHOW; very quiet, restrained, low-key, with, apparently, a lot of dialogue improvised. The performers are mostly drawn from the same group Guest has used in the past: Eugene Levy (who co-wrote the script with Guest) and Catherine O'Hara, Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, Ed Begley, Jr., and Guest, himself.Comparisons with Guest's most popular picture, THIS IS SPINAL TAP are both interesting and tricky. Interesting because both movies were written and directed by the same man, and shared most of the same casts. Tricky, because while some seem to compare AMW unfavorably with TIST, a looking at these films, together, they have a lot in common. So much so, in fact, that it's reasonable to consider them a pair; very similar takes on two, distinct musical genres of a similar era. The writing, acting, tone, pacing of these two movies is very similar. The jokes are similar. The points of view are similar. The focus on both performers, and the behind-the-scenes people is similar. The real difference is the music.This, in turn, tends to suggest that those who react very differently to these two films may be reacting more to the music, directly, and to the ambiance of the world around the particular musical genre more than anything else.Guest's movies don't have many laugh-out-loud moments. Most of the humor is more the "big-smile", sometimes, the chuckle, kind. But, Ed Begley, Jr. has perhaps his best comic scene, ever, when he does a take as a Swedish-American public television producer dropping Yiddish into his conversation; one word per sentence. It's a totally dead-pan and very quiet performance which, like so much of Christopher Guest's humor, you will either get or not get. If you do, you may fall off your chair.Eugene Levy, who co-wrote the script, with Guest, is also very good, having finally invented a second character after having spent something more than 30 years (since his Second City TV days) doing variations of one.Who might enjoy A MIGHTY WIND? Anyone who remembers the era and the music, and anyone who enjoys show business insider takes. It's a more difficult call for those born later. And, if you have trouble keeping Janis Joplin and Joanie Mitchell distinct in your mind, you probably won't follow most of what's going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't have to be mean to be funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some felt that this was too close to reality to be considered a parody, but I thought it was beautifully done - made fun of the cloying smugness of some "folkies", but mixed it with genuine pathos. I have a feeling Eugene Levy may have lost a couple of friends to bad acid trips - his portrayal was hilarious, but not cruel. Christopher Guest continues to amaze me with his light touch; most comedies put people in bad situations and make them squirm their way through; instead Guest takes apparently mediocre characters and puts them in situations that stretch their personalities. Contains the single funniest comment I've ever heard about model trains.Suggested double feature: This is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, or Bob Roberts</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Christopher Guest comedy that goes for something deeper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS LIE AHEADA Mighty Wind is a film that I loved, and it disappoints me that there were so many critics and filmgoers who were disappointed with it. It seems that quite a few people think that comedies, especially the ones of the mockumentary sort (as this one is), can't go farther then simple mocking. It puzzles me that so many were in agreement that a film about a bittersweet reunion can't be good comedy. I think some moviegoers need quit worrying about smuggling that bag of Milk Duds into the theater and remember to bring an open mind. There may be funnier, more farcical situations (which have been the basis of many, many lesser films), but a bittersweet reunion can inspire comedic moments as well as be the basis for a great film, which A Mighty Wind is.Christopher Guest, who has championed the film making style that is mockumentary with his role in the classic This Is Spinal Tap, and by directing the hilarious Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show, directs as well as co-writes the story with Eugene Levy (the actual lines are all improvised by the actors).The film plays as a documentary about the organization of a memorial concert featuring folk groups from the 60's who were managed by the late Irving Steinbloom. The groups featured in the concert are the cheesy "neuftet" The New Main Street Singers, the classic folk trio The Folksmen, and the former sweethearts of the folk music world Mitch and Mickey.The best performance in the film is that of Catherine O'Hara as Mickey Crabbe. She boldly doesn't go for all the laughs, and creates a complete, full, interesting character. Note the interview scenes where she reminisces about her past as one half of the folk "phenomenon" that was Mitch and Mickey. When she talks about their relationship you can see and hear that this is a woman who loved Mitch and Mickey, but not Mitch. Levy is also superb as Mitch Cohen, clearly still in love with Mickey but also clearly insane. He creates an almost over the top comedic performance that makes great use of his infamous eyebrows. He is in a constant state of uncomfortable quirkiness, except when he is singing with Mickey, and he remembers what their relationship used to be, and how it felt to be loved. Note the scene where the two practice one of their hits, "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow," and don't know what to do when its time for them to lovingly kiss each other, which was their claim to fame when they were making TV appearances back in the 60's. Without saying a word, they agree that it would be inappropriate and continue to the end of the song. O'Hara's reaction to that moment is perfect. Then note the scene when they perform the song at the concert and, each for different reasons, they decide to do the kiss. When I first saw that moment and the characters' reaction to it, I got goosebumps. I realized that for the first time in any of Guest's mockumentaries, I actually cared for the characters, and I loved it. It's great that instead of going down that road taken by so many other films, where the former lovers find that they have loved each-other all along and have sex to affirm this to the audience, A Mighty Wind gives something far more interesting.Although the Mitch &amp; Mickey relationship is the heart of the film, it should not be forgotten that this an ensemble movie. There are terrific comedic performances all around, including those of Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and Guest as the members of The Folksmen, John Michael Higgins and Jane Lynch as the color worshiping Terry and Laurie Bohner, Jennifer Coolidge as the can't-quite-place-her-accent Amber Cole, Fred Willard as the outrageously sad Mike LaFontaine and Ed Begley Jr. the yiddish talking Swede Lars Olfen.It may not have gotten as many laughs as This Is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, or Best in Show, but A Mighty Wind bravely goes where those films didn't. It achieves touching, real emotion. It is one of the best films of 2003.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another in a long list of films that have been recommended to me, `A Mighty Wind' was probably one of the funniest films I've seen this century. The mockumentary style of `This is Spinal Tap' has always been a favorite of mine, and this film, about the reunion of three folk groups after the death of the owner of their former record label is absolutely hilarious. Christopher Guest's usual cast is involved, though Eugene Levy and Harry Shearer stood out for me personally. (Although every time Shearer's character spoke I couldn't get the image of Principal Skinner from `The Simpsons' out of my head.)Anyone with either an absurdist or dry sense of humor will find this movie funny. Speaking for myself, I rarely laugh out loud when watching films by myself at home and I was in tears from having fits of laughter throughout most of the film. The writing is above brilliant, and the acting and timing are dead on. I haven't seen the other two `recent' films that proceeded this one, `Best in Show' and `Waiting for Guffman', but after seeing `A Mighty Wind' I will definitely check them out in the very near future.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I would love to see this town in the autumn..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how well executed this movie is. It seems realisic and yet so..."movie!" Christopher Guest (who did a fine "guest" on Saturday Night Live in a game show skit..."Chocolate Babies?") did some great work on this and all of the characters are classic. Eugene Levy may be the best in this. His performance of Mitch, or rather the shell of what Mitch once was is hilarious. The best scene is, in my opinion, the scene in which Mickey's wife shows Mitch his model trains and model town. Levy's comments about seeing the town in the autumn ("I would have made tiny leaves...") are the funniest lines in the film. The Folksmen show off funny interaction scenes (yep, those are the guys from Spinal Tap) and The New Mainstreet Singers are definitely the commercial b*st*rds of this film. W.I.N.C.-a religion based on color. That's classic. I would recommend getting the DVD for the great deleted scenes, including a press conference in which Mitch talks about Canadian hip-hop, where kids rap about cleanliness. I love this film. Despite it's rating, a great family movie. The sexual references are minor. There's just two scenes. One: A brief talk about a sex emporium and Two: References to starring in dirty movies. Get past these and mom, dad and the kids can have a good time. Just punch a hole in the record first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An excellent entertainment, though very different from this ensemble's other pseudo-documentary efforts (Spinal Tap, Best in Show).Incredibly creative. I'm a fan of folk music and this film really nails the eclectic backgrounds of folk musicians, right down to the distinctive vocalizations, multi-line harmonies and excessive enthusiasm. I was so impressed that all the parodied songs were written and performed (well) by the actors and I now covet the sound track. Get ready for a lot of subtle humor and story lines and enjoy the send-up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Rorschach film: brilliantly poignant and wry for some, tepid for others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS**A Rorschach film: this is a brilliantly wry slice-of-modern-absurdity for some and merely a tepid comedy with quotable one-liners for others.To be honest, this is the sort of movie I would have found mildly boring ten years ago when I was in college. The absurdity of the characters' naive self-absorption is too low-key to evoke more than a smile; the subject matter (folksinging) is not exactly a contemporary choice for parody material; and many times the humor veers too aimlessly from clever satire (the anal retentive reunion producer) to the simply odd (the Witches Into Natural Colors) to flat efforts at "zany" surprises (the surprise denouement of one of the Folksmen).However, in the ten years since college, I've learned that most people who pursue their dreams are just a little bit sad, and I've come to appreciate just how many disappointments a would-be artist or writer -- or anyone else with dreams -- has to swallow to keep even a few of his or her dreams alive in the world.I've met a lot people just like the characters in this film. The brilliant characterizations by Levy, O'Hara, Guest, Shearer, McKean, Begley, and the rest of the cast are witty, knowing captures of such people. O'Hara is particularly adroit playing a middle-aged woman who has come to accept that her brief moment of fame and of passionate romance concluded more than half her lifetime ago -- hers is the most affecting performance in the film. Levy could've gotten away with nothing more than a comic cliché of a burn-out from the 1960s but instead manages to evoke a certain poignancy without falling into schmaltz. The chemistry between both these two actors and their characters brings a tear to the eye once or twice without seeming jarring or contrived.A few times, the story is a tad too wistful about the past and takes too much delight in making the past look good by depicting the present as meaningless gloss in comparison -- sometimes the actors/writers seem to be indulging in middle-aged nostalgia for their own youth instead of telling a story about a folksinging reunion.Still, I'm impressed (as I usually am with these actors/writers) at the way the movie combines off the wall comic bits with subtle emotional nuances in a style unique to this type of parody/commentary on human life.You'll either adore this movie or find it merely mildly diverting, but those of us who adore it will probably want to give it a 9 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, But Not Guest's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The third and last installment of Christopher Guest's "mockumentaries," this one centers around three folk-singing groups from the 1960s re-uniting for a concert many years later.As someone who well remembers most of the folk singers from the '50s and '60s, and was familiar with Guest's other movies, I was anxious to see this. It was okay, but to be honest, I expected more, at least more laughs and a little better pacing. This was just a bit too slow and not as funny as his other films, especially "Best In Show."There is some great music in here, to be sure, and not lip-synced, either, but most of that isn't heard until the last 30 minutes. Most of the same actors are in this film as in the previous two "mockumentaries," and I always appreciate the comedic talents of Catherine O'Hara and the rest of the crew.The humor is unique, dry....very dry, and I appreciated it a bit more on the second viewing. The only annoying person, to me, was Eugene Levy's character "Mickey," a spaced-out loser whose act wears thin the more you see of him.It's not a bad film; just not up to Guest's '"Best Of Show."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blowin' in the wind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Guest is a generous actor/director in that he doesn't hog the camera for himself. He lets his actors do their thing without much interfering; he fades into the background, practically.This pseudo-documentary about the folk music craze of the late 50s and early 60s in this country is accurate. It is a hilarious take on those performers that were part of the era. Mr. Guest has a great insight in presenting the different characters and brings them together with an accurate eye for detail. Eugene Levy and Catherine OHara are teamed up again as Mitch and Mickey, a famous duo from those days who were the biggest act in folk music of the time. Eugene Levy appears to be catatonic as Mitch, who agrees to take part in the Town Hall ceremony honoring his mentor. Catherine O'Hara is excellent in her part as Mickey, the loyal partner.The documentary form seems to work well, as it serves the point for the reunion of all these performers coming together one more time, even though the world has forgotten them.There are disappointments in that no one has a central role, but the misuse of Parker Posey in the film is regrettable. I guess there was no space to showcase any actor over another. Mr. Guest keeps getting better with every new film and it seems a very great idea to concentrate on this very talented cast for future occasions where they can all interact, as it has been the case, in the previous occasions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought I was the only one who saw the joke here!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the '60s and '70s, I was a MAJOR folk music fan, and a (very bad) would-be performer; I still have my old Yamaha guitar tucked away in a closet. For years now I've been a second shift engineer at the local PBS TV station... I'm the guy who runs the videotape while the SANE people around here are at home.EVERY time we run a Pledge (or, as I refer to it, "The Big Beg"), it seems that they come up with ANOTHER nostalgic music reunion program... Doo Wop folks, Rockers, Surfin' music groups, and lately, Folkies.The folk reunions have been, IMHO, sort of sad. The spirit is willing, but the flesh isn't quite up to recapturing the old glory days.Judy Collins tries to sing the songs she did when she was 19, and her voice just can't come within a half tone of the high notes she used to hit.Barry McGuire was an angry, fiery young poet, but now he just goes through the motions with dated stuff like EVE OF DESTRUCTION. It's hard to take him too seriously.Even my favorites, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary, have seen better days. Peter Yarrow looks like he should be running a pawn shop somewhere, Paul Stookey resembles a college professor who's just counting the days until retirement, and unfortunately Mary Travers hasn't aged very well at all... I remember her as a woman who used to OOZE a sultry, steamy sensuality, but nowadays, on high definition TV, she bears a very unfortunate resemblance to a bulldog!Just the same tho, I have to admit that Peter, Paul &amp; Mary's musical talent HAS lasted over the years.When I discovered A MIGHTY WIND I thought I was going to die laughing with absolute joy... SOMEBODY besides ME saw these tries to capture the past in a bottle as a lost cause!!!Ed Begley is MAGNIFICENT as Lars Olfen, the "PBN" executive producer; he has the Yuppie pseudointellectual pompousness of PBS paper shuffling executives down PERFECTLY!!! I KNOW Lars Olfen VERY well; I happily work the second shift just to AVOID these rancidly arrogant characters, who thankfully LEAVE the station every day at 5 PM!!!The New Main Street Singers are a mix of THE NEW CHRISTY MINSTRELS and the squeaky clean, Stepford Wife - like automatons of the old UP WITH PEOPLE cast... but with a delicious touch of gameyness that we ALL knew was just below the surface, added by the past exploits of Bohners.The Folksmen are a hybrid of the old Chad Mitchell Trio (which, incidentally, was a foursome until they dumped Henry John Deutchendorf, later better known as John Denver!), and the Limelighters.The PBS reunions sort of tacitly ask the question "Whatever happened to...", and A MIGHTY WIND answers it... EXPLICITLY.LIFE is what happened to them. They became part of reality, just like the rest of us.I have to admit that the musical performances in the film are EXCELLENT; for a lot of people who weren't really part of the '60s commercialized folk music scene, they do a VERY creditable job with the material. They could have been folkies for real!The only joker in the deck tho; the musical material, if you listen very closely to the lyrics, is ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!! Almost ALL of it, especially the song I NEVER DID NO WANDERIN', is a brilliant parody of the stuff we listened to and loved back in the '60's.For anyone who knew the glory days of Bleeker Street in New York, or Old Town in Chicago, this is a film that will be an absolute joy. It shows both the GOOD parts of those days, and also shows up the silliness of some of the idealism in what we believed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About the Soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only adjective I can come up with to describe the soundtrack of this movie is "infectious". I can't stop listening to it. While most of the songs are corny and campy (as they should be since the movie is a spoof) they are ultimately wonderfully listen-able. But there are songs that are top notch folk material as well. Songs like "One More Time" and "When You're Next to Me" will stand tall against any great folk song that has ever been written.Songs like "Potato's in the Paddy Wagon", "Blood on the Coal" and "Old Joe's Place" are just plain fun to listen to and will get you tapping your foot. You won't be able to help it, trust me. If I ever wanted to see a sequel to a movie and to a soundtrack, this is definitely the one.I would venture to say, that even if you are not a fan of folk music, you will absolutely love this soundtrack. Throw in some insanely funny tracks like "Loco Man" and a cover of the Rolling Stones "Start Me Up" and you have a near masterpiece here.If you ever need something that will get you laughing and smiling as well as snapping your fingers then buy this CD. You will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ok, I just saw the movie earlier today, and I have to say that I came out of the theater disappointed.Now, just to get this out in the open, I'm a huge fan of Spinal Tap. I think that it was nothing short of brilliance, possibly the funniest movie ever made and one of my favorite movies made in the final quarter of the 20th century. More recent works of Christopher Guest, however, have been a bit of a let-down compared to that first comet. I found Waiting for Guffman to be stale, uninspired and just rather un-funny. However, I enjoyed Best in Show considerably, I found some of the characters to be hilarious (such as Fred Willard's, Christopher Guest's and Parker Posey's) and thought it was a huge step made towards making the same sort of genius accomplished in Spinal Tap. So, perhaps A Mighty Wind was built up a bit too much in my mind.So here's my probably oversimplified review of the movie:The good: The six or seven funny parts in the movie (I won't elaborate, don't want to spoil it for others).The Bad: Pretty much everything else.Why: Well, most of the movie just wasn't comedy. A lot of it was actually quite serious and dramatic, seeming out of place for a movie advertised as a comedy. Either that, or A Mighty Wind is actually a drama with-out-of-place over-the-top comedic bits. Of course, there are some comedic bits which fall flat, basically being much too silly (for lack of a better word). What Christopher Guest needs to realize is that the improvised format which he has made, really (in my opinion, of course) lends itself to more subtle humor than for completely over the top comedy. That is what makes Spinal Tap and, to a lesser extent, Best in Show great. The best scenes in Spinal Tap were just the explanations of the band's past, songs, quirks and messages. The best parts of Waiting for Guffman were invariably Christopher Guest and the Parker Posey/Michael Hitchcook duo just talking about their dogs, and showing us, comparatively subtly, how they over-dramatize the importance of dogs.Going on to a more practical complaint: I thought that there just were too many characters. Not that you can't keep track of them all, it's just that with all those characters, you can only devote so many scenes to each one. This means that some of the more interesting and funny characters (the Folksmen) don't get quite as many scenes as you would want or expect. If Christopher Guest makes another movie, I sincerely hope that he reduces the size of the cast, so we can focus on a small group of colorful characters, rather than a very large group of mostly dull ones, sprinkled here and there with funny ones.Another complaint: Very unbalanced, as I mentioned before. Some characters are very comedic (The leaders of the Main Street Singers) and others are really quite dramatic (Mitch and Mickey), making it an unhealthy mend, with uneasy contrasts from scene to scene. It's almost as if Guest told Levy (yes, I know he wrote half of it) and O'Hara that it was a drama while he told John Michael Higgins and Jane Lynch that it was an absurd comedy.Well, I hope that you, if you actually read this far (congratulations, if you actually read all of it!) gained something from reading this review. Good evening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>watchable misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two substantial problems with this film, neither making it unwatchable, although I confess they did make me feel uncomfortable. The first is that director Guest cannot capture any of the various "documentary" camera styles widely known with the necessary degree of accuracy; this isn't cinema verite, nor do we get successful sequences of talking heads. Even the concert scenes fail to emulate concert documentaries. Visually, then, we are always reminded that we are not watching a documentary but a mockumentary - we can't really allow ourselves the 'willing suspension of disbelief' such a satire requires from us. This problem is exasperated by some of the actors' performances who are trying way too hard to be funny, rather than play straight and let the ridiculous situations call out laughter.The second problem is more troubling; the music is too good! Most of these songs are not "mock folk music," they ARE '60s style folk songs. Take even the title track: "A Mighty Wind" as a title is amusing in that it evokes flatulence; but by the time you get to such lyrics "a mighty wind of freedom/ blowing for you and me" you wonder where the joke is? That is after all exactly what many folkies thought was going on in the '60s, which makes the song dynamically expressive of that era.Comparisons with "This is Spinal Tap" are of course unavoidable. The songs of "Spinal Tap" came to within a hair's breadth of real heavy metal, but push comes to shove, most real heavy metal songs escape their own pretentiousness by 'rocking out,' they are, bottom line, just variant forms of traditional rock songs; Spinal Tap, to make their point and remain funny, kept their pretentiousness meter pushed to 11.Another issue in comparison indicates where "Mighty Wind" goes wrong. Both heavy metal and folk music had substantial sub-cultures develop around them. But when "Spinal Tap" was released the heavy metal sub-culture was alive and thriving, about to receive new blood with bands in NYC ad LA. The folk music subculture was dead by 1977; a lot of folkies did end up in business or academia and moved quietly into the suburbs (those refusing this route gathered 'round the Grateful Dead, a phenomenon requiring a whole other movie to explore). Consequently, a "where are they now" satire about folk singers ultimately requires a satire on 'midddle America,' and of course that's really too broad a subject for a film that wants so much to highlight the music involved.In short then, "A Mighty Wind" fails to explore humorously the historical dissonance between where folk musicians came from and where they ended up - a dissonance captured powerfully (with much unintentional irony) in the study of Jerry Garcia's friendship with David Grisman, "Grateful Dawg." It's a dissonance strong enough to have fueled the addiction that killed Garcia; it is a dissonance that still quietly influences our current politics and cultural reference points. And while director Guest clearly tries to stab insightfully into the the heart of this dissonance, he doesn't even scratch the surface; that the Folksmen are last seen playing in the foyer of a casino maybe ironic, but since they are, in the last analysis professional musicians trying to earn a living, the irony is all about the casino, not the musicians. Their talent, and the entertainment value of their songs, remain untouched; it is simply not the '60s anymore.Entertaining, but more for the music than the comedy, which is faint praise indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The naches that I'm feeling right now...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from giddy-up, I'm a HUGE SCTV fan, as well as the guys from Spinal Tap, and this movie is right at the top of my DVD library list. I'm also a Simpson suckah, and dig Harry Shearer and his contribution to the show.But who knew that I'd become a bona-fide Ed Begley Jr. fan at this stage in my life? I mean, his tiny role in Spinal Tap had me shooting milk out of my nose in hysteria, but his 'Lars Olfen' shtick --A Swede with the heart of a Jew-- was one of the funniest aspects of AMW. As Lars talks about a past musical history, he delivers one of the funniest lines I've ever heard in ANY movie (pay attention--his wit can sneak up on you!). Looking at Begley's career, it's easy to surmise an under-appreciation of his talent, as well as the occasional mis-direction of his energies (I mean, come on, this guy's been acting since 1969! Sheesh!).The music in this movie seems SO genuine that sometimes I would forget that this was heavy-duty satire; from the awesome "Never Did No Wanderin'" to the sweet and innocent "Kiss at the End of the Rainbow", these songs could easily stand alone as pieces of musical and lyrical masterpieces. But when you add the lampooning element, it becomes downright fun-on-a-bun!! As most folks know, Guest/Levy very often work with a ghost script and give the characters a wide berth to improvise. There are times when that aspect of the film shines through, and then there are the finely detailed musical performances in which, yes, everyone acting like a musician IS actually playing their instrument and/or singing, and performing 'live'. These two contrasting things: improvisation and rote-memory dedication play on each other beautifully.To put a fine point on it, this movie will appeal *obviously* to folk music fans (with a sense of humor), to Guest/Levy fans, and to those of us that enjoy a slightly skewed sense of purpose to get the heck away from mainstream movie mania and move closer to the edge of real movie making.This is good shtuff: you'll find yourself laughing out loud, and then humming the tunes later... I give it a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Knocked over by this Mighty Wind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've enjoyed Chris Guest's work for some time now, but this is the first movie that he has made that got such an emotional reaction out of me.In this film, we watch a story of lost love with Mitch and Mickey, an odd love with Laurie and Terry Bohner and their cult-like group of peppy musicians, and old friends (Alan Barrows, Jerry Palter, and Mark Shubb) reuniting for different reasons. This all winds together wonderfully with a public television concert in New York City, each band performing a few songs (except Mitch and Mickey, who only perform one heart-tearing song).Going in, I knew that Michael McKean, Guest, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Harry Shearer, etc. were all multi-talented from watching them for years now. But I was floored by the complete 180 that they all took. Most of the cast wrote all of the songs in this movie...musical arrangements, lyrics, etc. and everyone performed them live, no lip synching. What we're left with is a terrifically crafted film about love, music, and friendship.A wonderful film by Guest and company.10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More gentle than Christopher Guest's other mockumentaries, "A Mighty Wind" lacks the obvious satire and parody of "Best in Show" and "Waiting for Guffman." This is not a criticism. If the actors in this film weren't already well-known from other movies, in particular the above-mentioned mockos, one might be totally suckered into thinking that this was a real account of real folk musicians. Fred Willard's hysterical "once-was" character and the rather dim-witted publicity assistant aside, these characters are believable and endearing. I would go so far as to say that Eugene Levy's acting in this film is real, serious, heart-tugging acting, rather than the goofy buck-toothed oddball he usually plays.And of course there is the music. If you were impressed by the lads from Spinal Tap and their musical prowess, check out this incredible ensemble of actors who throw themselves headlong into the folk genre with amazing aplomb. You don't like folk? Don't worry about it. This'll get you every time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dry, Subtle, Ad-Libbed Comedy With a Big Heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Guest and company tackle the super-cheesy folk music scene of the '60s in their own unmistakable way. While its status among Guest's other pictures could be debated, I don't think there's any question it's his most complete effort. Tremendously funny at points, it also tells a straight, coherent story and ties in a stunning successful emotional hook. The laughs aren't quite as loud or as rapid-fire as they were in Spinal Tap; however, the tone also isn't nearly as flippant, which is a major reason why it's able to settle down and deliver something truly sweet at the climax. Of course, the original music is once again outstanding, with lyrics that are more subtly funny and not nearly as brazen, and is spectacularly performed by the cast of ad-lib legends. It's an ensemble piece in every definition of the word, with the mockumentary style of the first sixty minutes providing more than enough background to emotionally invest its audience for the grand finale in Town Hall. Effectively funny and heartwarming in even doses, A Mighty Wind is a great continuation of the troupe's legacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mighty Wind: Works Astoundingly Well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Comedy in film is one thing which I tend to worry about more than many other factors. Perhaps it is due to the fact that I cannot precisely point out what I want from a comedy film that I feel uneasy watching them, afraid they will disappoint these hidden standards. With that in mind, and with an urge to laugh, I turned to the well trusted Christopher Guest.A musical mockumentary, A Mighty Wind covers the organisation of a tribute concert to recently deceased folk music magnate Irving Steinbloom, to be performed by three of the acts he helped launch in the course of his career: The New Main Street Singers; The Folksmen; Mitch &amp; Mickey.Both A Mighty Wind and Best in Show, prior to my recent viewings thereof, lingered vaguely in the back of my mind from my first viewings several years ago. I can recall being, back then, thoroughly amused by the films but simultaneously gripped by a sense that so much was passing me by. It is only now that I realise quite how right I was, the layered approach to Guest's comedy ever more evident with the increased wisdom of years. Co-writing with Eugene Levy, and reputedly allowing for a great deal of improvisation, Guest creates a hybrid of comedic styles that keeps you laughing from start to stop. Perhaps it is in the nature of these humorous situations that the film finds its effect. There are no grand set pieces, no tigers in bathrooms. There are only people, behaving in an entirely human manner. Steinbloom's son, determined to give his father the perfect tribute, fusses over every detail of the concert, worrying that perhaps the chosen flowers may prove dangerous to exposed eyeballs. It is the realism of these characters, these situations, and these words that is so achingly funny. We all know people like this, people who would agree with the younger Steinbloom in his assessment of topiary hazards. Guest and co require no fantastical and otherworldly sequences of events to illicit our laughs; they need only reality and the true-to-life characteristics of the people around us. Real life is funnier than anything fantasy can dream up, and the mockumentary format makes A Mighty Wind feel as though this is reality at its most unadulterated. The laughs come fast, hard, and with an emphatic truth that makes them more amusing than just about anything else. This, I think, is the appeal of Guest's directorial work (or at least what I've seen of it), and it is what makes him one of the best comedic filmmakers today. Needless to say his regular cast works astoundingly well together, his reasons for re-using the same actors repeatedly easy to understand. What is truly exceptional about A Mighty Wind, ranking it above the frankly funnier Best in Show and more scathingly reflective For Your Consideration, is its humanity. I dare say nobody who watches this film will ever be able to forget the interminable sweetness of Mitch &amp; Mickey, easily among the greatest screen couples of all time. An utterly compelling and at times quite saddening romantic subplot underscores the film with such a poetic drama that one cannot help but be moved as well as amused. And their song... Oh their song... Words cannot describe.With the wonderful humour of Guest's comedies, A Mighty Wind stands head and shoulders above almost all competition. Its humour lies in the reality of its situations, and the normality of its characters. Equipped with a disarmingly charming romance that will test the most hardened of hearts, it also boasts a fantastic soundtrack to compliment this fantastic comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually a Comedy that has a Charm of its Own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A MIGHTY WIND is not a simple sequel to the earlier comedy spoof THIS IS SPINAL TAP. There was nothing in that film that was really moving (the death of the drummers in the band became an occupational hazard after awhile). Instead, A MIGHTY WIND is a bittersweet film about the passing of a briefly appreciated musical trend, but more important the tragedy of two of that trends celebrities in the failure of their marriage. For the marriage of Mitch and Mickey (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara) becomes the centerpiece of our attention by the last third of the film.The up-beat small town Americana personified in the music of the three groups is not totally dead. One can hear people strumming 1960s kitch even today. But it was supposed to be a tonic to the rock and roll and protest songs of the 50s to the 70s. It just did not have the staying power of those songs. One of the ironies of the film is that Michael McKeon's group is spoofing "The Weavers", but that group (led by Pete Seeger) transcended this kind of music and ended up leading the vanguard of the anti-war protests of the 1960s. When McKeon is approached about a song concerning an incident in the Spanish Civil War that his two partners are not afraid to sing he looks rather put out - he just doesn't think it's their type of music.The key to this film's difference from SPINAL TAP is that the numbers are actually just this side of good. One can hear all of them without being turned off by them seeming so naive. This is particularly true of Mitch and Mickey's number regarding the kiss at the end of the rainbow. It actually is moving as sung by them, and (in it's first performance) they did a kiss. It becomes their signature song. But the love that led to their marriage (a love on Levy's part that got him badly beaten defending O'Hara when she was insulted) does not last. Levy's Mitch has a mental problem, and the two divorced. But O'Hara's Mickey always was concerned about him - even after she had a successful second marriage. When he briefly vanishes just before they go on (he went out for some air and to get her a flower) she becomes hysterical thinking he may have gotten hurt. They do the kiss again for the live audience, but it is obvious that they really wanted to. But once they do they revert because they don't want to give each other the wrong signal.That business gives a heart to the film totally missing from SPINAL TAP. This does not mean the comedy is not funny - it is on target. The interviews that reveal too much about the people being interviewed. The behavior of the dead impresario's older son who is concerned about whether flower arrangements at Town Hall may lead people to fatally injure themselves tripping over the dangling flowers, or that they will be confused by stage decorations mingling painted banjos that look like they are three dimensional next to real street lamps. The head of Town Hall showing the acoustics by singing "Ave Maria" badly. The belief of two of the singers in some reality involving color and levels of sound. The television network honcho (Ed Begley Jr.) who is Swedish, boasts of some obscure song he wrote that was big on Stockholm song charts years ago, and uses Yiddish words as a kind of proof of his being a producer. It is a wonderful movie, and superior (I feel) for that degree of sadness it reveal in the lives of two star-crossed lovers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The weakest in Guest's series of mockumentaries, but still enjoyable. The casting is predictably clever, but it seems that the improvisation wasn't working that well this time around; there are several scenes that contain nothing even vaguely humorous about them. I like Guest's subtle style, but perhaps AMW's humour is too subtle for its own good. If you're going to go after country music, especially the more commercial crap, then you ought to go for the jugular. No "Police Academy"-type nonsense, of course, but a little more energy would have done the movie good.Surprisingly, the folk music version of Spinal Tap, the Folksmen, were among the least funny in the movie! More interesting was Higgins playing the colour-worshipper, and the annoyed theater manager.I was disappointed that Guest even tried to inject some soppy sentimentality into the Mickey/Mitch story; perhaps a sign of Guest's aging? Empty schmaltz should be left to shoddy TV sitcoms like "Friends", it has absolutely no place in intelligent parody/satire. Levy's character seemed wacky enough to create a plethora of silly situations and dialogue, but this potential was left largely unused.AMW is, however, the type of comedy that gets better on additional viewing. Guest's follow-up about Hollywood is better. Perhaps country music wasn't such a good idea...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guest's funniest yet, and surprisingly moving in places</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An 8 is very good, I'm stingy with 9 and 10, which I've awarded maybe twice.Christopher Guest has established a signature device in the three films Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, and A Mighty Wind. He has his characters espousing ridiculous beliefs, philosophies, and observations with deadpan innocent earnestness; or sharing anecdotes from their lives that would make us cringe if we were actually face to face with them, but which they imagine to be moving or illuminating. The whole point is that we are most definitely laughing at them, not with them.I think Guest has done his best yet with this favorite motif in A Mighty Wind. I'm very hard to please with comedy, and I think the vast majority of them fail. I laughed out loud any number of times here.A surprising added element is a mildly serious and rather moving backstory involving the legendary (fictional) folk duo, Mitch and Mickey. This dramatic thread only enriches the film and in no way detracts from the comedy. It's very well handled; Guest brings this element into the movie in just the right measure. It is not contrived, false, and jarring as is true for so many comedies nowadays that also try to move us at some point.This brings me to the most pleasing surprise of this film, and surprised I was, almost dumbfounded, and that would be the performance of Eugene Levy as Mitch. Please know I am not a gusher, I'm not somebody who is constantly writing in these reviews how "amazing!" everybody and their brother was in some movie. But honest-to-God, I found myself wondering, did Levy's part here get any notice from the Academy? Seriously, I can hardly believe I'm writing this, but I've seen actors get nominated for supporting roles in drama whose acting turns were not as impressive as Eugene Levy playing Mitch Cohen in A Mighty Wind. I kept waiting for him to screw up, to turn into a comedian playing a silly part, to ham it up I suppose you could say, and it never happened. His character was unique, original, subtle, and surprisingly complex for what little information we were given, and he never diverted from it, he never broke the spell. Kudos to Eugene Levy of all people for a really fine acting turn.On the lighter side...and last comment...Fred Willard, outstanding. This is almost certainly politically incorrect, but I can think of no other comedian who is as advanced in age as he is who is precisely as funny in a movie, and elsewhere, as any younger actor around. His turn here as the schlocky, cheesy talent agent is one of the best things I've ever seen him do. I defy any younger comedian to best Willard at what he's turned in for A Mighty Wind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eugene Levy as "Mitch" of Mitch and Mickey, is nothing short of brilliant in the character he has created. Actually, less created than inhabited. Though clearly teetering on the edge of sanity, he manages to keep a tenuous grip on reality. His eyes, his voice, his hands--every inch of Eugene is invested in the character. Even after having seen this film several times, and enjoying it each and every time, I always get the feeling that one never knows what Mitch is going to say or do next, and it's because Mitch doesn't know either.It has been said that comedy is tragedy that happens to someone else. In this case, Mitch's tragedy is our comedy. I can't help both laughing and feeling sorry for the character. Eugene Levy's Mitch is a creation of pure genius.</fullReview>

I was disappointed that Parker Posey didn't have much to do in this film, as her performances are usually a highlight as well. The music is terrific, and made even more so knowing that everyone involved actually sang and played their own instruments. Easily the best comedy out so far this year!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like other "mockumentaries" done by Christopher Guest and company, this movie creates a world around some "has been" folk singers who come together for a special event. Each of the performers and groups are high-lighted and we get to know a little bit about them and their history and how they got where they are. What these films by Guest are able to do is to create characters you want to hug, or sometimes hit, but ultimately love. As a musician who grew up in the early years of folk music, I feel as if I know all of these characters in one way or another. The triumphs at the end for all of them are actually pretty emotional and uplifting.Mick and Mickey are amazing characters as are the other acts. Parker Posey and Jane Lynch steal the show for me though. But maybe that's because I love them both to death! And the music? Stands up to any great music from the era and actually even goes beyond. This is great stuff and a tremendous movie for anyone who loves good music and a fun, if not bizarre ending. Savor this one folks.

		<fullReview>An easy-going and pleasant comedy. Folk music isn't so much the target of Guest/Levy's satire as the documentary form (I felt The Last Waltz well and truly lampooned here). I also like the discreet way in which the passing of time from the folk heyday is marked. Sex is a licit topic of open discussion for many of the protagonists, though it seems odd or clunky to modern characters' sensibility. There's also a wonderful written set piece in which the term "nowtro" replaces retro (don't ask, just watch).That said, I felt that the film was probably a bit underwritten, relying on the technical aptitude of the cast (which is assured). Either the manner in which characters behave towards one another is based on their histories - in which case there's not quite enough backstory - or the idea is to create vignettes of artistic caprice based soley in the present, in which case it felt undercooked.Nonetheless, and in no small measure to a beautifully composed and performed digetic soundtrack, the film is celebratory. An easily overlooked wholesomeness to 60s American music history is well-honoured. 5/10</fullReview>

Their instrumentals were ragged, they didn't sing that well, Why am I telling you this? For the simple reason that "A Mighty Wind" spoofs these goofuses perfectly, poetically, practically every way they can be.

You'll get the music, the mannerisms, all the jokes.If you don't like folk music but you like Christopher Guest movies, this one may not be for you. "A Mighty Wind" is a SUBTLE comedy, not laugh-out-loud crazy like "Best in Show", or even "Spinal Tap". I knew nothing about dog shows, but "Best in Show" was so nuts that you could love it despite that. I don't think the same is true with "A Mighty Wind". In order to love it, you have to "get it".As somebody who listens to and plays folk music on a regular basis, I loved every minute of it.

		<fullReview>"A Mighty Wind" (2003): IF you loved "This is Spinal Tap", "Waiting for Guffman", and/or "Best in Show" (which I DO, especially Guffman), you'll also love this one - about "the" reunion of the best of the (worst of the self-deluded, cliché) folk groups of the early 1960's. (They are based on the "New Christy Minstrels", the "Kingston Trio", and "Ian &amp; Sylvia".) As usual, Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy have assembled THE finest group of THE driest comedians of ALL time, and allowed them to brilliantly improvise their characters. Each actor had to LEARN to play an instrument for their role, and were given "perimeters" for their character...then set loose to create most of the dialog right on the spot. They also wrote the "folk" music you'll see and hear. Of course it's perfectly terrible, which means it's ACCURATE to the period. Guest's theme IS Self-delusion. All of his characters and groups, no matter what the setting in his films, truly believe they are talented, know what they're doing and saying yet see no irony or contradictions, and press on in the faith that others see them as they see themselves. It's a lovely, sad, hilarious, pathetic, mind-boggling, brilliant experience. As usual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps the best of Guest's 'mockumentaries' since 'Spinal Tap'. The performances are on the right side of the ridiculous, managing to maintain the incredibly difficult balance between outrageous and believable. But what always makes these movies stand out is the unadulterated affection that the actors have for their characters and the material. Though parodies, there's never an ounce of cruelty or condescension involved, but real warmth and tenderness.Many of the characterizations, whether written or created through improv, are surprisingly nuanced, containing genuine depth and subtlety, and it's easy to forget just how talented these actors are beyond the easy laughs and funny voices. Levy and O'Hara are brilliant, delivering performances that are award worthy, and Coolidge creates her most bizarre and laugh-out-loud funny character to date.The real fun, as ever, is in the details - The old TV shows, the album covers, the self-conscious names of one-hit-wonder bands, the sideways glances and impeccable timing. The fact that Guest has still not won a major award is simply further evidence of the disdain that most critics have for comedy when it comes to handing out the gongs.

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable satire of the Folk Music Boom of the 60's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you didn't live through the times or spent the time researching what the folk music boom of the early 1960's was all about, you probably won't enjoy this movie all that much except for the rather broad humor. But if you knew the groups (ok, who remembers Ian and Sylvia?), knew the music, knew a little of the background (no, John Denver was not part of a foursome called the Chad Mitchell Trio - although he might have done some backup occasionally - he actually replaced Chad Mitchell when Chad left and it became The Mitchell Trio and went nowhere), and are well enough adjusted to enjoy satire, than this movie should amuse you.As was pointed out in some of the other reviews, this is also actually quite sad. Not only are the story lines almost pathetic, but the denouements are just as sad. The Folksmen are back together but are just a novelty act playing on the 'floor' (not as a headliner) of some obscure casino in the Catskills. Mickey is playing again but as a front for her husband's displays at trade shows (and the pipe and drape catches the tedium of that venue exactly. Who cares who she is in a place like that!) And the plastic New Main Street Singers? They will be in an equally insipid TV show sure to last at least 5 episodes before suffering the same fate as the Fred Willard character (W'as happenin!)Sure the music is 'uplifting', but just listen to the lyrics ? "A Mighty Wind", blowin' freedom, blowin' equality, blowing you and me. Ooooo?kay."Never Did No Wanderin" - The exact antithesis of what folk music was all about! Probably the best satire of the bunch! Ramblin Jack Elliot would ave loved that one! "Ea A oe's"? That is just too hilarious for words. And "A Barnyard Symphony"? Peter, Paul, and Mary at their audience interacting best. Actually as beautiful as "A Kiss at the End of A Rainbow" was, it was probably the weakest for the spirit of the movie. I was hard pressed to find much if any satire in it. Maybe they wanted an academy nomination to help sell the film. Too bad, as it detracted from the incredible satire going on.Thank goodness, they left in the bit about the Spanish Civil War!!! Without that, the whole cause d'etre of folk music would have been lost. It was all about anti-capitalism/anti-1950's and then anti-war protest to begin with (If I Had A Hammer, Where Have All the Flowers Gone, Blowin in the Wind!), and when the boomers co-opted it and blended it with rock, it became just a general protest against their parents, middle-age, middle America, middle blandness, all of which Mickey has so fervently embraced and which the boomers also have. That is the really sad commentary.Although, the New Age/Wiccan/color/49th harmonic nonsense with the Bohners was excellent. Talk about singing about something you have absolutely no clue about. The Bohner's wouldn't get real Folk Music if it hit them with a hammer. I will agree that Parker Posey was wasted, but I'm not sure what she could have brought. Her character was way too bouncy for having lived the life on the streets she claimed. Maybe some behind the scene clashes with the Bohners would have made it a little more authentic. Her father's vision versus their vision. (new members having to live in their uniform until 'ready' was funny, though).I knew a P,P,&amp; M groupie just after that time (this person was backstage with them several times), and we attended folkie concerts (among others), and I found out through a common source, that this person hated the movie. Having lived through and been a peripheral part of that time, I found this movie much more accessible than This Is Spinal Tap because I was more into the folk scene than the 70's hard rock.Yes, the characterizations were quite close to reality with warts and all, and if you can deal with that comfort, you should enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another quirky gem from Guest &amp; Co.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now, in the wake of "Waiting For Guffman" and "Best in Show", Guest has assembled what is one of the most talented and fascinating repertory company of improvisational actors in existence. Working from story ideas of his own, he allows the actors to concoct virtually all of their own dialogue and shape the psychological direction of their characters. Here, the world of 60's folk music is sent up when a fictional pioneer of the genre dies, inspiring a tribute concert. Three of the deceased producer's acts reunite after having faded into almost total obscurity. Presented in documentary style while offering pricelessly offbeat tidbits of "vintage" clips, "rare" photos and detours focusing on the various personalities attached to the event, the film's subtle humor - blended with heart - makes for a reasonably unique viewing experience. (There have, however, been rip-offs of this approach including "Drop Dead Gorgeous" and "The Big Tease".) Guest, McKean and Shearer portray a folk trio whose career derailed when they tried to go electric. Higgins and Lynch are the pillars of a nine-person group who's original members are all now scattered save Dooley who still shows up, if only to sit with his unplayed guitar in the back! Levy and O'Hara are a former duo who lost their careers when their love for each other waned. Organized by anally-retentive Balaban, the risky venture seems at all times like it may never come off as planned, especially when Levy shows up with the obvious effects of a lifetime of drug use. Aside from these leads, the film is peppered with bizarre, hilarious appearances by a large roster of other actors, nearly all of whom have worked for Guest in his previous similar films. Especially effective are Willard, as a self-important blowhard, Hitchcock, as a geeky, officious venue manager and Coolidge, as a phony, shallow public relations worker. Adding to the fun is a platter of original songs performed by the cast, remarkably using their own voices and playing their own instruments. These numbers are catchy, even to a viewer who doesn't have a particularly strong interest in folk music. It's the kind of movie that can be watched multiple times in order to catch the tiny details which Guest excels at including in his films. Though there aren't always belly laughs around every corner, it's an endearing work with charm and foot-tapping music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The most inspiring facet of Christopher Guest's latest mockumentary opus is the fact that it utilizes the SAME formula as it's predecessors (Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show) and manages to still work brilliantly without a hint of mold.A Mighty Wind is as funny as it is sweet. Guest's staple players (Eugene Levy, Bob Balaban, Catherine O'Hara, Michael McKeon, Parker Posie, etc.) are finely tuned crafts-folk who have three- dimensionalized characters others could only create cartoonish caricatures of...and Mr. Guest has full confidence in his rogue's gallery of comedy.Perhaps the most awe inspiring element is that of the three Guest tales, A Mighty Wind reaches a sublime plane of heart, soul, and poignancy that most films in general fail to reach...and I attribute this to the fact that Guest genuinely loves his subject matter. His keen satire and sweet wit never poke fun out of malice or baseness...but of genuine respect. This movie's life force of love emanates from it's core...that revolving around the universal language of music. A brilliant comedy, and a touching parable. A true rarity that no doubt will become a minor classic.</fullReview>

The humour perhaps not as immediately apparent as the aforementioned classic but still ever-present in another understated beauty by Christopher Guest. Also in comparison to its predecessor, A Mighty Wind contains songs worthy of the genre of which it chooses to spoof and no doubt you will find yourself tapping your feet along to the fictional tunes before the movie is through. Good character and relationship building make this an endearing, warm, 'chuckle-along' kind of a movie rather than a side-splitting, laugh-a-minute comedy. Easy viewing that will put a smile on your face... give it a go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humorous and Adorable Mocumentary Looking Back to the Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A LITTLE SPOILERS INCLUDEDNostalgia towards the good ol' days (the 70s and the 80s, particularly) has been apparently one of major trends in the relatively small budgeted American cinema in the early 21st century (e.g., "American Splendor" and Wes Anderson films). A Mighty Wind, a mocumentary about, and sincerely dedicated homage to, the American folksongs is another showcase that is humorously and adorably done.A son of a record label owner produces a reunion concert at Town Hall, where three legendary groups from the label will perform. They are a trio, a big group, and a male-female duo. The elaborated details gradually build the emotional intensity towards the show. The apex comes at the moment the duo starts performing: Being unable to stay in the backstage, the other two groups join the duo on the stage, and the resurrection of the duo's legendary kiss occurs. The resolution is a little cliched, but it smoothly leads the viewers back to their everyday lives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific film -- a must see!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't write a lot of comments, but I feel very strongly about A Mighty Wind. It has terrific casting, a great script, and music that evokes nostalgia for the folk song years while at the same time gently (well, sometimes not quite so gently) mocking the products and productions of that era. The style and ending (flash forward 6 months) were very reminiscent of Christopher Guest's other work, especially Waiting for Guffman, and he needs to be careful that he doesn't end up unintentionally parodying himself. But the humor, writing, and yes, the singing, completely won me over. A Mightly Wind is a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Catherine the Great, Fred the Annoying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the best thing about The Mighty Wind -- Catherine O'Hara. In the role of Mickey, O'Hara puts in a fine, nuanced dramatic performance. Except, perhaps, for the funny song she sings at the trade show at the end, Catherine O'Hara chooses to play Mickey straight. By playing the character without laughs as sincere, sweet, kind, and sentimental in all the right ways, she becomes this interesting opposite of comic relief. The Might Wind does its best -- it's entertaining, I'd give it a 7 -- but I think perhaps folk singers just don't provide as good of fodder for comedy as do heavy metal rockers (Spinal Tap) and fanatical dog owners (Best in Show).Fred Willard was as unbearably annoying as ever. Christopher Guest -- if you're out there -- please do not put Fred in any more of your movies. The annoying characters he plays are not funny; they are just . . . annoying!Oh, and lastly, about the music . . . except for Parker Posey who can't sing (but, hey, you can't have it all -- she's still a great Indie actress), those spectacular Second City and Groundling improvisationists have shown in this movie that they're all decent musicians as well. And the songs written for "Mitch and Mickey" by Michael McKean and his wife Annette O'Toole (the actress who plays the mom on Smallville) are so pretty! I was (albeit somewhat guiltily) humming them long after the movie ended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Folktastic Musical Mockumentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt this is both the best comedy AND the best musical I've seen this year.The spoof rockumentary format is not original, and the big climax is to be expected of a Christopher Guest film. The reward lies in the detail - the subtleties of the dialogue, the intricacies of the characters, and the spot-on pacing.The music is top notch throughout - excellent '60's Americo-folk with beautiful harmonies and arrangements that stick in your mind, with wonderfully pointed references to a greater ouvre of work. In this area, the talent is second only to Neil Innes' Rutles. The characters are numerous, and surprisingly well-defined, given the very short space of time each one was allocated, although the brilliant acting of Eugene Levy, Harry Shearer and Guest himself means that every single line delivered helped to develop the personalities.My only criticism is that the film is too short (a lot of good stuff got cut out - see the DVD). Maybe one day we'll see a DC/SE running two hours plus, and with all the musical numbers reinstated in their definitive versions, padding it out into a full-blown musical.This film deserves to be a classic, but will probably assume the mantle of 'largely unknown cult movie' which is a shame - it hasn't even got a release in the UK yet, and if I hadn't been in the US when it was showing, I would never have heard of it.And, like Mitch Cohen, I would've been poorer for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was another wonderful movie from Christopher Guest and crew. After Best In Show, I didn't think he could top it, and then came A Mighty Wind.Each of the bands are so different and yet they come together beautifully. The folk music in the movie (all original material) was so true to the era and to the style, it was unbelievable.The humor was there in all the right places. They didn't try to go off-the-wall the first minute. They eased you into the characters, and gradually got wackier as you got to know them better. And because many of the cast members worked with each other in Waiting for Guffman and Best In Show, to see the chemistry seem so real, knowing that it's often totally different from what they've done before, is incredible.The extras were also fantastic. They had the entire concert performance, uninterrupted, as well as a bonus song that was edited out of the concert and many other deleted scenes and songs.This movie has beaten out Clue for my favorite movie and I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One step closer to maturity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Guest takes a step closer to maturity here, and the result is a satisfying (if imperfect) film. What's immediately noticeable here is that there are very long stretches (well, relatively long ones, considering the constraints of the form) where there are no laughs whatsoever. I don't mean that the gags fail (although they do, occasionally); I mean that there are segments where no laughs are even intended. Guest experimented (unsuccessfully) with this approach in Best in Show, with Parker Posey's and Michael Hitchcock's characters going from humorous grotesques to pathetic ones in the span of a minute or two. Others have rightly pointed out that the film's focal point is the relationship of former folk duo Mitch and Mickey, who have been both professionally and emotionally estranged for thirty years. For all the out-of-context trickery of the film's trailers, Eugene Levy does NOT play Mitch as a buffoon; he's a burnout, yes, and one with social and psychological problems, but he's never really played for laughs, to Levy's great credit. As Mickey, Catherine O'Hara may have found the role of her career. In her previous roles for Guest, O'Hara has shown herself to be perhaps the finest female caricaturist working today. In 'A Mighty Wind,' she takes this talent a step further--her half-smile/half-frown, her furrowed brow, her forced chirpiness all combine to create a painfully real person this time, and one more complicated than Mitch. Mickey might be a more complex creation because she is LESS complex on the surface. Though she never exactly says it, one gets the impression she always regarded Mitch as the talented one, the dreamer; and because she didn't take it as seriously as he did, she was able to move on in a way he never could. This is what makes their reunion so terribly sad--they feel sorry for each other (always a difficult thing to witness), and yet the memories of what they once had make them feel sorry for themselves, too. A lot of this is inferred, and the film leaves most of their relationship, both then and now, to the imagination. This approach mostly works. Critics have compared this film to Altman's 'Nashville,' and it's a comparison that stands up. (It's hard to believe it's accidental, too, considering the live-performance framework the narrative is set into.) Like the earlier film, 'A Mighty Wind's' best-defined characters are developed through understatement and ambiguity rather than gross caricature. It's this approach that makes the film so radically different from the pure, over-the-top satire of 'Waiting for Guffman.'If 'A Mighty Wind' is flawed (and it is), it is because its most grotesque comic moments, funny though they can be, no longer feel true in the new paradigm Guest has established. 'Waiting for Guffman' worked perfectly because of its satiric purity--the characters had real depth, yes, but they all seemed to have begun as joke personae which were then built inward. The problem with 'A Mighty Wind' is that Mitch and Mickey are full-blooded dramatic creations, not really jokes at all, and so when an exaggerated comic grotesque suddenly appears, it can seem shallow and immature by comparison. (The final cheap joke involving Harry Shearer's character is a good example.) There are also probably just too many characters squeezed into its 92 minutes--to be fair, it's hard to give depth to caricatures when they're spread so thin.Still, what problems there are cannot really detract from what the film does have. 'A Mighty Wind' is never boring--there's always something moving, or funny, or exciting, or just toe-tapping going on. The performances are of the quality we've come to expect from Guest films, with veterans Bob Balaban, Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, Michael Hitchcock, and Jane Lynch standing out among the supporting cast this time. (And Mickey and Mitch's beautiful song over the end credits, "When You're Next to Me," written by Levy, is worth the price of a rental in itself.) Perhaps next time Guest will continue to refine what he's looking for, and finally bring his cinematic experiment to full flower. 8.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's be honest, the first four months of this year have left a great deal to be desired at the movies. The best movies in theaters (i.e. "Chicago", "The Two Towers") were released last year and the biggest box office hits have been, at the very least, painful to watch. (If I never hear Joan Plowright sing a mortifying tribute to slavery again, it'll be too soon) Therefore, it's rather easy to be blown away by the sheer fun that is "A Mighty Wind"For the uninitiated, Christopher Guest and his regular cast of inspired loons set their sights on an obscure sub-culture and create on-the-mark mockumentaries. With "Waiting for Guffman" it was the world of community theater. With "Best of Show", the professional dog show circuit. And "A Mighty Wind" focuses on the folk music boom of the late sixties and early seventies.The jokes are a little more gentle this time around, and that's appropriate given the subject matter. Regardless of how much you like or dislike folk music, it's hard to be too venomous to a group of people preaching peace. However, the jokes are sharp and insightful as are all of the performances.One of the things that I've loved about the Christopher Guest movies is the multi-dimensional characterizations. It's one thing to laugh at someone, but it's another to really feel for the person at the same time and that's precisely what happens in this film. There are genuine moments of pathos that lead the audience to really cheer for these characters.I won't go on, just to say that it's a delightful movie. In the canon of Christopher Guest films, I would put it just below "Guffman" and ahead of "Show". However, all three are treasures.</fullReview>

It took me back to my high school and college days without the usual pains of nostalgia. The humor of the film was adult enough and cerebral enough to keep me in the here and now (and laughing) and the music was good enough to take me back.

		<shortDescription>Guffman Arrives, Guest Departs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Guest has already earned two places in my film hall of fame, one each as innovator. He has invented a workable `mockumentary' genre that is intelligent, wry, self-referential and gently destructive. He has also innovated in a certain kind of content: music that is so earnestly pure to form it satirizes that form by its mere existence. `Spinal Tap' had difficulty finding an audience because many audiences couldn't tell the difference between the `mock' band and real ones.So in his next two projects, Guest synthesized these two new comic ideas in a clever way, by emphasizing the machinations before the show. These two projects are famous for their improvisational freedom; hundreds of hours were shot. Actors had great range in digging into Guest's new territory. Because some of those actors are very clever, we had some absolutely brilliant moments. Many of those included Guest himself. The show itself was just context.Now here, we have gone back to Spinal Tap days. The show occupies much of the film, and is played so straight that even I (who am the right age for this nonsense) cried at the kiss. Its a delicious guilt but one we are not willing to value without the context of what goes before. Here is where he lets us down. There are three `performance' stories and four `management' stories (the TeeVee producer, show's producer, manager and public relations pair). The latter four are mere filler and are treated that way.Its the performance of the performers where the payoff is supposed to be, but we go off in three different directions. Cowriter Levy goes off to create his own little sweet world, independent of the rest of the film and the central notion of the project. Its pretty well done, so weakens the enterprise. Guest's ownership is limited to the Folksmen and is exquisitely wry until a cheap sex change gag at the end. The remaining third likely had lots of clever bits, these `New Main Street Singers.' But what we get here are some half-gags and the shadows of others.Parker Posey is in this wasted lot. I would have sat through 3 1/2 hours of the rest to have allowed room for her bit, whatever it was. After seeing what she did in `House of Yes,' I consider her the captain of this sort of nested irony. But she is reduced to a background here: dual red sailing ponytails and a speech about being on the street that doesn't have time to go anywhere.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mighty bore...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think if you took director Christopher Guest's films, cut them all up into individual scenes and randomly edited them all together, you probably wouldn't be able to tell the difference. All of his films -- WAITING FOR GUFFMAN, BEST IN SHOW and A MIGHTY WIND -- all feature the same actors, wearing the same obviously fake wigs and mustaches, droning on in the same unbearably banal monotones. It's all amateur night and improvisation. Guest seems to think it is an art form to make films that look empty and shallow.Guest, with the very talented Rob Reiner as the director, helped launch the movie genre of the "mockumentary" with their nearly brilliant THIS IS SPINAL TAP. Each followup solo effort, with Guest taking over the director's duties, has been mind-numbingly dreary. What made TAP so wonderful was that it seemed like a real documentary. It was all so cleverly made that you had to think a second or two every time the dialogue or the plot twists suddenly got loopy. It was wonderfully subversive, yet the humor was gently sardonic. The film respected the character's idiosyncrasies, even as it revealed their insipidness. You laughed at the characters, but felt sudden great empathy for them at unexpected moments.Plus, TAP was about something. It skewered the pretensions of celebrity and media, as well as the filmmaking process itself. Guest's solo efforts are like using an elephant gun to kill flies. He targets community theater, dog shows and, in the case of A MIGHTY WIND, folksingers. Oh wow, isn't he brave! His ensemble casts of otherwise talented actors, play interchangeable dull-witted twits from one movie to the next movie, helping Guest show an inexplicable contempt for people who quite honestly don't seem to be deserving of being ridiculed.His films are one-note, one-joke premises, which may have been amusing as a ten-minute "Saturday Night Live" skit, but are interminable bores at an hour and a half.Worse, they aren't even well made. Example: the only good song in A MIGHTY WIND is the sweet and delicate Oscar-nominated "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow." When Guest presents the song in the film, he cuts away from it's performance to scenes of people listening to it and raving about how good it is. The only chance for the film to have a genuine moment, a scene where two former lovers have a reunion and sing a beautiful love ballad, is trampled on by incompetent editing.There are moments in his films, thanks mostly to the efforts of the actors, where they flirt with revealing the honesty and sincerity behind the jokes. But Guest steadfastly fights to keep his films trivial, vapid and pointless. A MIGHTY WIND would be a disappointment, but how can you be disappointed when you have been conditioned to expect nothing in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious: folk music meets Spinal Tap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Folk music gets given the Spinal Tap treatment, and it's hilarious. Not surprising, as A Mighty Wind was written and directed by Christopher Guest, who along with Michael Mckean, Harry Shearer and Rob Reiner, gave us the mind-blowingly brilliant This is Spinal Tap.Great parody of folk music, though the movie is not at all malicious in its parodying. The music is actually quite charming, despite its inherent naivety and idealism. Great performances from a great cast: in addition to Guest, McKean and Shearer, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Bob Balaban, Jane Lynch, Parker Posey, Fred Willard and Ed Begley Jr. Stand-out performance goes to Eugene Levy - every expression and word of his is hilarious.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Mighty Wind (2003): Dir: Christopher Guest / Cast: Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Bob Balaban, Fred Willard, Michael McKean: Fascinating comic documentary about folk music. Title suggests an emerging of something that once was and will be again. After a folk music promoter dies his son Jonathan decides to reunite talent he represented for a benefit concert. Among those artists are the Folksmen who reunite after thirty years. The Street Singers are very passionate about their involvement. Finally there is Mitch and Mickey who sing "A Kiss At the End of the Rainbow." This opens an interesting subplot regarding Mitch's split with Mickey and the nervous breakdown that followed. Their signature song always concluded with a kiss. Great setup with often amusing interviews with participants. Directed by Christopher Guest who previously made Waiting for Guffman. Scene stealing performances by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as Mitch and Mickey whose scenes provide the best humour. Bob Balaban plays Jonathan who frantically struggles to arrange this event. Fred Willard is always funny and here he makes an appearance and laughs at his own jokes. Then we have Michael McKean jamming away with the Folksman alongside Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer. Wonderful portrayal of folk music and a time that will breeze through one more time. Score: 10 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Affectionate "mockumentary" paying tribute to the folk-music scene of the Sixties.Eugene Levy is positively mesmerizing as the sensitive, haltingly speaking Mitch Cohen, a singer/guitarist who once had an act with autoharp-embracing Mickey Crabbe, played by Catherine O'Hara at her best, earth-mother self.Also wonderful are Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and director Christopher Guest as the trio Mark, Jerry, and Alan. Their musical numbers are pitch-perfectly representative of a certain folksy style of the time and the banter among them is a delight.We also meet John Michael Higgins as the leader of a clean-cut, bubbly group that is highly representative of the era. A little too much time is given to his musings about his new-age religion but this is a minor point. Running funny counterpoint to all the musicians' antics is a poker-faced Bob Balaban as Jonathan Steinbloom, the obsessive host of a reunion concert at New York's iconic Town Hall.Levy and O'Hara form the sweet heartbeat of this film and every scene they share is a delight.There are many jokes in this film, with such objects of gentle derision as public broadcasting, mental-health issues, and even transsexuality.I loved this joyous, nostalgic experience with an exceptionally talented ensemble of actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, But Endearing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen any of Christopher Guest's films prior to this film A Mighty Wind, but I've heard many good things about them. They seem to be mean-spirited, but often hilarious. After watching A Mighty Wind, I concluded that this film is less funny than I thought it would be (it still is funny), but how it wasn't mean and it treated it's subject with some respect. But as this is still a mockumentary, it still pokes fun at everything. There is also some good folk music to go along and there is actually good tunes worth listening to.Christopher Guest's film is about how after a longtime music producer passes away, three folk groups from the 1960's reunite to perform a concert to memorialize the man who got these bands famous.The acting is pretty good and it seems like the cast made their characters more personal, which added depth to the story. Christopher Guest does a good job as a member of the Folksmen as well as Michael McKean and Harry Shearer. Catherine O'Hara does a solid job as Mickey but Eugene Levy truly shines as Mitch and he reminds me of the aging rock star who is always high or on drugs. Finally, Fred Willard is hilarious as the manager of the Main Street singers especially when he goes out spurting his catchphrases.Overall, A Mighty Wind is a solid mockumentary that is mostly funny, but surprisingly heart-warming. It has many good tunes to listen to as this film celebrates the life of folk music. The film seems a little odd at times, but that is because it has a strange sense of humor. But as this film likes to point out, the answer is always blowin' in the wind. I rate this movie 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Christopher Guest music "mockumentary" strikes again within the folk music genre. He, along with Michael McKean and Harry Shearer and company have written and played their own songs that are quite close to the cheesy originals they were based upon. Funny that many will downgrade such a creation as it was supposed to be the music that was the base of the humor. Where performance can be funny (see "This Is Spinal Tap") the folk performances are a bit silly to start. If the music isn't legitimate, then the character based humor doesn't work and the characters are truly gems here. I may be the only one who found Eugene Levys' "Mitch" to be absolutely brilliant where others said he wasn't their cup of tea.... must not of hung around pretentious wanna be poet musicians! The PBS show is also brilliant with its silly drama that also is true to back stage dilemmas, a missing musician, other band set lists and caring about seeing another band perform. I have watched this movie a dozen times, but admit it may not be as delightful for everyone. The writing was so spot on that "when you put it that way, it's almost poetry. Almost."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An almost perfect portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I am of an age to have lived through much of the folk music era that this movie brilliantly spoofs. That said, it is a spot-on portrayal of the music, the performers, and the attitudes of the time. There was great attention to details, even including the look of mock album covers for the various acts and the vehicle that transports one of the acts from Vermont to NYC. It is filled with humor, as is the case with almost all of Christopher Guest and company's films. The cast is terrific from top to bottom, including many of the smaller parts such as Ed Begley, Jr.'s, role as a TV producer. Something that truly impressed me is the fact that all of the songs, and many of the musical arrangements, were written by the cast members. While most of them don't actually play, they do sing - and pretty well. I'm not sure that younger viewers appreciated just how good this movie captured an era. They may have related more to the earlier collaboration of the some of the principal actors in "This is Spinal Tap" because it was about a heavy metal band. All in all, this is maybe Christopher Guest's best movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>another winner from Christopher Guest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have to say, for me, that nothing will ever Christopher Guest's brilliant "Waiting for Guffman," but "A Mighty Wind" from 2003 is a fantastic mockumentary. I found it superior to "Best in Show."This time it's a faux documentary on the reunion of '60s folk singers at Town Hall as a tribute to a late concert producer, Irving Steinbloom, arranged by his son (Bob Balaban). The performers include Mitch &amp; Mickey, The Folksmen, and The New Main Street Singers. The cast is made up of many of Christopher Guest's repertory company: Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy, Fred Willard, Michael Hitchcock, Parker Posey, Paul Dooley, and Paul Benedict; also Ed Begley Jr., Jane Lynch, Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and John Michael Higgins.There are some hilarious moments, but the best thing about this film is how Guest and other composers and lyricists have captured the music, mind-blowingly authentic, as are the groups. Everyone is terrific. Some standouts are: Ed Begley as Lars Olfen, using a Yiddish phrase or word several times a sentence; Catherine O'Hara as the Mickey of Mitch &amp; Mickey, and her nearly brain-dead partner (Levy); and Jane Lynch and John Michael Higgins, an out-there couple who worship color. Balaban underplays and makes his role as the organizing son of the late, great Steinbloom totally believable and documentary-like.If you haven't seen this, check it out, and remember (from the song "Old Joe's Place") Well?..there's a puppy in the parlor, And skillet on the stove, And a smelly old blanket, With a Navajo wove, There's a chicken on the table, But you got to say grace, There's always something cooking at, Old Joe's Place.And at Christopher Guest's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The music is captivating, the acting ingenious with the fictional documentary format usually presented is such powerful and insightful ways that highlight an underlying emotional theme, and the amazing scene ending performance that revolves around the possibility of a kiss. The weakness or possible blemish of this movie that detracts from a classic status is the uneasy tone of this movie that waivers between realism as perhaps best depicted in a movie such as UNREAL: THE OFFICIAL HANDBOOK OF STARTING OVER (2004) or the much more consistent and funny parody presented in SOAPDISH (1991). There are brief scenes, attempts that like live, comedy club acts, there are scenes that are really touching, dramatic, and mildly funny and then there are over-the-top, overly acted attempts at comedy that seem to fall flat. Overall, this is an entertaining, bold effort that carries the evening, but it is not without its unnecessary blemishes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guest's funny folksy romp is hit and miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another lovely romp for the "Christopher Guest players," this time each are in some form of a folk music act. Immediately you notice the singing and instrumentation that each of the actors bring with them, which is an added bonus for this cast. My favorite character was Fred Willard's insane manager-character, Mike LaFontaine, who was a failed-TV personality and remembers his past in a totally different way than what happened. Also to mention are Jane Lynch (Glee) and John Michael Higgins' characters of Laurie and Terry Bohner, respectively, whose insane back-stories involve abuse ("...but it was mostly musical in nature"), adult films, and a newfound occult religion based on the worshiping of color.Despite hilarious moments, the movie really goes up and down between drama and comedy too often, mostly looking at deep relationships between the members of each and their decisions. At times, it works, but mostly I found myself asking, "why do I care about these guys?," and end up just waiting for a new scene. Eugene Levy's back-story especially was funny at times and then just got sad and sappy. The songs got a little repetitive after awhile, too, but groups like "The Folksmen" were a nice treat with their insane stories of Spanish Wars woven into musical epics...all to be ushered offstage for the next group to go on.I think if this were done differently, maybe focus on only one or two of the groups, in the same way "This is Spinal Tap" was. It drags at times, but the full performance aspect of the movie brings points back to its overall score with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improvising Never Looked So Real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What "Best in Show" and "Waiting for Guffman" contrasts from other ensemble comedies is that the directors give the stars the liberty to improvise their lines and let them express their interpretations of the situations they face in their respected scenes. Very few directors have the bravery to perform such a task, but director/performer Christopher Guest manages to do that and succeeds. This gives these top comic stars the opportunity to just let their comedic juices flow naturally."A Mighty Wind" differs from the other two aforementioned is that instead of being focusing on an ensemble cast, it predominately concentrates on two characters, folk singers Mitch (Eugene Levy) and Mickey (Catherine O'Hara). The storyline is pretty easy to follow. A group of folk singers from the 1960's get together again for a concert credited by their creator Irving Steinbloom. The main attraction are Mitch and Mickey, who were once a singing but it ended in an ugly break-up. Mickey moved on to marry the legendary Leonard Crabbe (Jim Piddock), while Mitch unfortunately hit rock bottom.Overall the cast of talented performers naturally throw themselves into their roles. Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, Spinal Tap alums Harry Shearer, Michael McKean and Guest himself are all effective in their performances. But it was Levy and O'Hara that stole our hearts and it was a shame they were rejected winning Oscars because they went over the limit in providing comedy and giving a lifelong lesson that settling their differences won't be solved by having an affair. There's no gregarious sex scene or any cheesy serenading from a bedroom window or something like that. Nothing forced comes out of these characters as they express their passion through subtle methods like body language and facial emotions. This is a romantic comedy with such amazing chemistry it'll melt your heart like a hot knife through butter. But one could argue that Eugene and Catherine have known each other when they first broke into entertainment over 35 years ago when they were alums on the popular Canadian sketch comedy "SCTV". The real flaw in this movie that with so many stars in such little time, so many of the stars have very little to do, that their roles are underused. The scene where Mitch and Mickey kiss may not appeal to many, but I really thought it was one of the more pivotal scenes in the movie. It was so touching and may even put you in tears. Of course for the music lovers of all genres, the singing was very entertaining. This talent pool can do it all and all so poignantly. The humor is not over-the-top zany like in other Guest films. Instead we have a romantic comedy/musical about two poor souls trying to work their problems out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This Is Spinal Tap's Christopher Guest, director of Best in Show, directs and write, with help from Eugene Levy, this folk music "mockumentary", or satire comedy. Basically when folk icon Irving Steinbloom (Stuart Luce) dies, he left behind a legacy, and as a celebration his son Jonathan (Bob Balaban) has put on a memorial concert featuring many of his favourite musicians. These include duo Mitch Cohen (Levy) and Mickey Crabbe (Catherine O'Hara), trio The Folksmen, and The New Main Street Singers. The film shows some of these groups careers before the one night only in New York City's Town Hall. Also starring, in alphabetical order, Ed Begley Jr. as Lars Olfen, Jennifer Coolidge as Amber Cole, Paul Dooley as George Menschell, Guest as Alan Barrows, John Michael Higgins as Terry Bohner, Michael Hitchcock as Lawrence E. Turpin, Don Lake as Elliott Steinbloom, Jane Lynch as Laurie Bohner, Spinal Tap's Michael McKean as Jerry Palter, The Nutty Professor's Larry Miller as Wally Fenton, Christopher Moynihan as Sean Halloran, Parker Posey as Sissy Knox, Spinal Tap's Harry Shearer as Mark Shubb, Deborah Theaker as Naomi Steinbloom and Fred Willard as Mike LaFontaine. This may not be as much fun as This Is Spinal Tap, but you can certainly enjoy the music, especially from Levy and O'Hara, and there are one or two amusing moments. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow". Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Guest does it again, and this time his victim is the genre of folk music. Known for such films as "Spinal Tap", "Waiting for Guffman," and 'Best in Show," Guest delivers a hilarious 'mockumentary' hit with "A Mighty Wind."After the death of an influential folk manager, Mr Steinbloom, his children decide to bring together three folk groups to commemorate his life with a tribute concert. The three groups are diverse and personify differences which exist in folk music. Whether its the cheesy-gloss of The New Main Street Singers, the bluegrass trio of The Folksmen, or the romantic duo of Mitch and Mickey, each group represents an aspect of Folk Music and their relationships and tiny rivalries towards one another is well played.However, the most impressive aspect of this movie isn't so much the comedy, but the music. I was shocked to find out that the actors themselves wrote, performed and recorded these songs. Most might have humorous lyrics, but the songs are musically dynamic and genuinely impressive.The genius of Guest &amp; Co. is their combination of subtle humor. The foundation of the Mr. and Mrs. Bohner (Jane Lynch, John Michael Higgins) relationship, the psychosis of Mitch (Eugene Levy), and the Mitzvah rant of Lars Olfsen (Ed Begley Jr.) are just some examples of the tiny comedic details that Guest provides.The most enjoyable aspect of this film is that it's fun to watch and I can visually see that the actors have a fun time making these movies. It truly comes across the screen.The only set back to this movie is that it's rather slow moving and certainly attracts a certain type of humor (less slapstick and more situational subtly). However, this is a hilarious film and I would rank it just a notch below "Best in Show." Christopher Guest strikes again.7 out of 10!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The comedy is a bit too sincere, but the songs will make you cheer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Guest is one of the most versatile filmmakers working today; when he and Eugene Levy work on a script, the end result is usually something special. And continuing with a collaboration that began with "Waiting for Guffman," we now have "A Mighty Wind"...a mockumentary about a folk-music revival that is simply too sincere for its own good. That's not to say it isn't funny in spurts--Levy's 1960s folk-music casualty, Ed Begley Jr.'s random bursts of Yiddish, and Fred Willard's hilariously lame band manager--but it ultimately comes up short in the comedy department, to the point where you're left wondering if Guest just wanted to make a fake documentary about the folk revival out of respect. Indeed, Guest's reliable troupe of comedic players (including Levy, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgins, Michael McKean, Jane Lynch, and Harry Shearer, among others) are in top form, but their lines seldom produce the hearty laughs we've come to expect, and the characters are too hastily introduced (the film is limited by its 90-minute run time; Guest's work would actually be better translated to a fake-reality TV series). This, however, is forgivable, since all of them sing well enough to produce an incredibly rousing (and applause-worthy) finale, where all the musicians participate in a public-television tribute to honor their recently-deceased former manager. While no "Spinal Tap," "A Mighty Wind" has its worthwhile moments (it's just a shame there aren't more of them).</fullReview>

Though at some points it does seem a bit of a drag.Excellent acting by Eugene. I loved the drawl he put on as a sign of his after-rehab "loser" situation. And actually I felt really sad for the character he portrayed.The movie is a good watch especially if you are a country music fan, and a bigger must have is the soundtrack. I am desperately looking for it now!! The best song is no doubt the "kiss at the end of the rainbow" and the genius of it is the kiss Mitch plants on Mickey at the end of the song....

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Strong Breeze</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched all four of the "mockumentaries" from Christopher Guest and friends, and I always come away with a great admiration for the multiple talents of the cast. It's remarkable that a group of people could all write, act, compose, and sing (and for Guest, direct) and do each of those things better than most people who specialize in just one. That talent creates some very funny moments and a movie that's well worth watching, but there are also some scenes that fall very flat and remind you why nobody else attempts this kind of comedy.The movie is at its best early on, when it creates some outlandish personal histories for all the characters, complete with home movies, album covers, and TV footage. A lot of care obviously went into creating the right look and feel of a documentary filled with reminiscences. The humor is indirect, delivered with a straight face by characters who are too serious, too self-absorbed, or too crazy to realize how ridiculous they are. The music is wonderful. The signature songs for the three folk groups are all very believable. You might find yourself humming some of the songs long after the movie is over.When it works, it works very well. There are some very funny lines in this movie. Documentaries, though, aren't really plotted; they're a series of scenes that may or may not lead to anything dramatic. So if something doesn't work in a mockumentary, it's a very conspicuous failure because it's not funny and it doesn't advance a story. Ironically, it's the best natural comedian in the cast, Eugene Levy, who has the highest failure rate in the film. His Mitch character is highly traumatized and lacks the swelled sense of self-importance that makes satire seem like justice. Watching him stare blankly, or, surrounded by pill bottles, struggle to articulate a simple thought, goes beyond what I'm able to laugh at.If you haven't seen This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman, see those first. Only if you like those two should you watch A Mighty Wind and Best in Show.</fullReview>

It' so much fun &amp; has lots of levels.Harry shearer is a natural - the Folksmen are an alternate spinal tap, " The New Main Street Singers " are John Denvers old group - the new Christy Minstrels &amp; Mitch &amp; MIckey are a repeat of the singing couple from "Best in Show". There are some great cameos - the attention to detail of the Parker Posey playing the mandolin to bemused schoolchildren was sensational. The extra scenes from the DVD are great sing along material.Why- oh-why didn't they all tour in Australia?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, this is Christopher Guest's best work to date. It's got everything: subtle humour ("the record would teeter crazily") outright slapstick (Bob Balaban getting smacked on the head), tension, and such tenderness between the Mitch and Mickey characters. Not to mention great music! Every actor is constantly aware of the character they are portraying and it's wonderful to see how each one develops in their relationship with the others.I would encourage anyone to give this movie a try, and let the heartwarming begin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not just memorable because of Fred Willard's Schtick, but because all the other performances are brilliant, from Posey to Levy. The songs are good too, funny and oddly catchy, just like Spinal Tap's. Bringing together the makers of that classic, this instead is about the folk music scene, how a old bands are getting together for a special tribute gig. Will it be a success? Will Mitch and Micky kiss? Will Mike La Fontaine get a ten minute spot? Watch to see Wha' happens.O'Hara and Levy play as Mitch and Micky, a folk couple who were once sweethearts, but fell apart. Now Mitch is an odd recluse, and Micky has married a model train fanatic. The highlight of their show was a kiss during one song. The New Main Street Singers are a group revamped from the Golden age, and the Folksmen are 3 men- Guest, Mckean, Shearer who are looking to reclaim their fame. Through into the mix La Fontaine, owner and founder of High Class management, and many other insane characters, and we have another very funny film. Best moments include- all of Willard's scenes, proving he is one of the funniest men alive, and the 'i would love to see this town in the Autumn' scene and the ' best acoustics in the world' scene. Much underrated, and pretty much unknown, if your a fan of 'strange' comedy, watch this.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You would have thought that after 4 movies, Christopher Guest and his band of merry men and women would have tired of the improv performances which are featured in This Is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, Best In Show, and A Mighty Wind. They apparently have not. Another solid effort from the comedic minds of Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy, A Mighty Wind is perhaps the most demanding movie of it's talent, as all of the players have to not only immerse themselves in the silly characters but all also have to sing and play the banjo. The movie is in the famous (or infamous, depending on how you want to look at it) form of the "mock-umentary, where there is a first person aspect, as the viewer looks at the characters through one camera. All of the characters are brought together for a tribute concert to a folk music producer who had just passed away. The three musical acts, the sunshiny Main Street Singers, the barbershop threesome The Folksman, and the ex-lovers Mitch and Mickey, come together from various backgrounds, which are all recounted in usual humorous fashion. The comedy is good, but the folk acts are even better, which is the true value of this movie, as all of the folk players are actors. The only questionable part of the movie is that while all of the comedy is reaching a peak, the Mitch (Levy) and Mickey (Catherine O'Hara) subplot of ex-lovers coming back together for one last performance pulls at the heartstrings while they sing the Oscar nominated song "A Kiss At the End of the Rainbow." It's not a bad thing, just one not usually found in what is an otherwise silly movie. Perhaps that's a testament to how well Guest can get his actors to be as human as possible, and that is what the audience is responding too. Not as consistently funny as Best In Show, there is no movie stealing performance like Fred Willard's mindless announcer in A Mighty Wind, it is still very funny, and even a little touching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't as brilliant as "Best In Show", Christopher Guest's previous film with the same group of players, but it's worth seeing for the trademark dry humor and songs that aren't that bad. Okay, they're not that good either, except for the Oscar-nominated "A Kiss At The End Of The Rainbow"--which is catchy enough to chart-- written by Annette O'Toole (who unfortunately doesn't appear in the film) and Michael McKean (who fortunately does, as one of the clueless Folksmen) and is featured in the film's high point at a reunion concert. Jane Lynch is hilarious as an ex-adult film star turned Anita Bryant-clone whose bizarro self-actualization raises eyebrows from fellow 'New Mainstreet Singers'. Eugene Levy is sweet stoner folkie Mitch on a permanent trip of pure love and awe, while Catherine O'Hara plays his former flame &amp; bandmate Mickey as wonderfully centered and unpretentious. I hope Mary Travers &amp; other women of folk music such as O'Hara's real-life sister Mary Margaret who inspired this role took it as a compliment. Kind of drags in places via blowhard characters played by Balaban &amp; Willard but the out-of-leftfield ending is too funny!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I dearly love this film. Funny and touching (not a common combination), brilliant performances (to me, the improvised dialog appears more 'real'), fun and poignant music (the first soundtrack album I've purchased since "South Park"), I love it all. I especially liked the work of Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy as Mitch and Mickey. The subtle, quiet way they show the awkwardness dealing with the feelings they still have, the palpable sadness and longing as those feelings come to the surface during their closing duet, is just perfect (You can tell they've been working together off and on for over two decades now). (BTDT. I was once half of a "perfect couple" that came apart. For twenty years, we felt that overwhelming awkwardness every time we failed to avoid running into each other. Our story has a much happier ending, however. We're reunited for good for six years now, and will be marrying next fall. We're going to sing "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow" at the ceremony.) Let go of your expectations and go with the flow of the movie. I think you'll love it, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and admirable, but less likeable than *Best in Show*.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been back and forth on this one. I think that like so many other viewers, I was first a victim of my expectations: I wanted *Best in Show* again, and didn't get it, and thought, "Well, OK." I respected the film, but I wasn't eager to watch it again.Reading these comments has broadened my perspective, as has rewatching the film. I can't compare it to *Spinal Tap*, which I haven't seen, but maybe this one's like *Best in Show* -- maybe you have to watch it once to get the lay of the land and then again to appreciate its subtlety. It's definitely, as one reviewer said, "a more mature offering" -- and once you drop the expectation of laugh-out-loud humor, you find a much richer film.There's lots of subtle humor here, though some of the improv scenes probably should have been reworked. Catherine O'Hara is touching throughout as a singer who's passed the high-water mark of her artistry, whose art never recovered from her problems with Mitch, and her accent keeps the performance in its comic key. Jane Lynch, Parker Posey, and Michael McKean are a joy. It's compellingly bizarre to watch Ed Begley navigate all that Yiddish. Fred Willard is once again playing Fred Willard, but he does that very well, and people who like that sort of thing will find that the sort of thing they like. As usual, all the comedic work is honed by brilliant film editing. I do think Eugene Levy's performance is a little much, more theatrical than those of the other players -- he reminds me that we're in a film. (And where was Jennifer Coolidge, the apple of my eye?)The true strength of the film is its music, and in Michael McKean's fantastic arrangements -- it's nostalgic, energetic, optimistic, and pure, a recreation of a time and a Gestalt that may or may not have ever existed. This is a story of misfits who create a world in which they'll have a place, Steinblum being the guy who sustained that world and whose death reunites them.In short, I *admire* this film and those who made it; what's less certain is whether I *like* it. It's definitely worth seeing, though, at least for the music and several performances and as a creative experiment. Keep your eye on these folks; they're doing good things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Mighty Wind goes where none of the other previous Christopher Guest "mockumentaries" have gone before, in that it treats some of its subjects with grace and tenderness. Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy in particular are doing fantastic ensemble acting. So much of the poignancy that exists between their characters is played out without dialogue, using body language and their eyes instead. For these two, there's nothing they can really say to each other at this point about what has happened between them. So they say it in their obvious awkwardness when they're not singing, and in their obvious warmth when they are singing. In the commentary on the DVD, you can hear Guest tell how Parker Posey and Jane Lynch were crying when the scene with their reunion was shot. This is beautiful stuff, and powerful. So if you're looking JUST for belly laughs, go elsewhere. But if you want the laughs and something more to chew on, this is a great film.A few other highlights: The music is surprisingly good, and I am impressed at the talent that this ensemble has as instrumentalists, singers, and songwriters, as well as actors and comedians. Parker Posey is always magnetic. And Jane Lynch steals just about every scene she is in (especially the one about WINC). And Fred Willard is out of control as usual. Guest and his troupe are really hitting their stride in Mighty Wind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not Spinal Tap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Mighty Wind is a wonderful movie that is marred by one thing - the expectation of its audience. I can see how it happened. It's another Guest/Levy film carried in a documentary format. McKean, Shearer and Guest are musically reunited as The Folksmen, so you'd be forgiven for expecting something akin to Spinal Tap. If you want to watch Spinal Tap, go watch it. Expect to see it in A Mighty Wind, and you're going to be disappointed. This is not Spinal Tap. It's a more mature and emotional offering that ultimately, is so much more fulfilling.A Mighty Wind can be disarmingly familiar. It features the same ensemble casts from Waiting For Guffman and Best In Show. Subtle humour reigns supreme, although there are some genuine belly laughs in there too ( Mitch's album covers are a particular delight ). Someone appropriately, the heart of the movie is a story of unfulfilled love and the directions people are prepared to move after losing a soulmate.One of the best things that the improvisational style seems to produce is a certain amount of interpretation. Some jokes go much deeper than you originally give them credit for. Guest's trust in his players pays huge dividends. Improvisational comedy is a huge risk unless your actors really know their characters. In this case, they really do.The music is handled masterfully throughout. During the setup, its treated with the sort of disdain accorded to a novelty single. The real shock is that by the movie's conclusion, these same targets for parody become as valid as anything you've ever heard. The final two songs at the folk reunion bring tears to my eyes every time, but in that good way, y'know.There are some problems with the movie. Some of the jokes seem a little improbable ( the post-concert followup seeming the least credible ) - as if they were tagged on when to accommodate those expecting another Tap. Thing is, this is a different movie and step forward for the Levy and Guest writing partnership. Step forward with them, and you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wha' Hoppen'?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(I'm not deleting my earlier comments, but please see the update at the end to see how my opinion of this film has improved.)I watched Rob Reiner's terrific THIS IS SPINAL TAP (for the first time in several years) not long before watching A MIGHTY WIND for the first time. This may have been a mistake, since it simply emphasizes all the ways in which this film falls far short of TAP.First, and most basically, it's just not very funny, even with a subject as inherently funny as 60s "folk" music.Secondly, unlike TAP, it doesn't actually play like a documentary. Reiner's brilliant move with TAP was to shoot and edit it so that it looked just like a real documentary; this is the only one of Guest's pseudo-documentaries I've seen, but I don't think he knows how to do that, or perhaps he doesn't have the discipline to deny himself the cinematic vocabulary of the story film.The characters are unrealistically quirky. Even when they're funny (which, again, isn't often enough), they are obviously actors playing characters. The humor is too broad: the stuff about the color religion is one of the film's funnier jokes, but it comes at the expense of believability. Some scenes (e.g., the motel room conversation between Levy and Balaban) are not filmed in one shot with a hand-held camera, but from different shots cut together. Probably the worst example of conventional film-making is a shot of Levy staring at something, followed by a Significant Zoom Shot of what he's staring at. Now, excuse me, Lord Haden-Guest, but isn't this supposed to be a documentary? Do you really think that shot would make any sense in a documentary?!In fact, about the only really good thing in this film is the "Folksmen" performance, because it's not overbroad or bizarre; it plays just like a folk trio reunion on a PBS special (and includes--at the very end--the biggest laugh I got out of the whole movie). The comedy comes from the intrinsic silliness of the whole enterprise. And isn't that the whole point?It's not that Guest isn't a talented guy. I just think perhaps he should abandon the fake documentary route and move toward other styles of film-making.After THIS IS SPINAL TAP came out, some people apparently thought it was a real documentary about a real band. I doubt anyone will ever make the same mistake with A MIGHTY WIND.(Update: See my review of Guest's *Waiting for Guffman*: http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0118111/usercomments-155 )OK, a further update: I now really like this movie. I mean, I really, really like it. I've rated it 8/10, which is "very good" on my scale.Everything I said about his lordship's inability to recreate a documentary still stands. Either he doesn't understand how documentaries work, or he doesn't have the discipline to deny himself the cinematic vocabulary of the story film. But, once you get past that, his films are actually very funny. I've watched WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and BEST IN SHOW, and they don't work as "mockumentaries" either. But they do work as story films which steal some of the cinematic vocabulary of documentaries. And this one may well be the best of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Youth Culture in General!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any youth culture, looked back upon after its passions have been tempered by irony, seems quaint and even foolish by comparison, especially by those who never lived through it. One day a satire of the current youth culture will be written, and it will be met with the same mixture of disbelief and chagrin. The then youth culture will be thinking: How Stupid! Not realizing that they are them, only different by the passing of time. Was the big "folk scare" of the 1950s and 60s absurd? You bet. But no more so than kids today paying money to have their bodies besmirched with ugly tatoos and piercings, while listening to music no more profound than the Kingston Trio was back then. Youth culture is not about making sense, and that point must be remembered in this mockery.The irony is that not ALL the youth of the 1950s and 60s fell for the same superficial folk nonsense that was sweeping their generation by the likes of the Kingston Trio, the New Christy Minstrels, or Ian &amp; Sylvia. Some discovered "real" folk music, paying the price of being laughed at by the "in" crowd for their heresy. They, like Bob Dylan, Dave Von Ronk, and the Baez sisters Mimi and Joan, were listening to old recordings of Woody Guthrie, The Carter Family, Lightning Hopkins, Jean Ritchie, and Washboard Sam. If they picked up a mandolin they were more inspired by Bill Monroe, and if a banjo, by Uncle Dave Maken. They were not into "putting on a show," but respecting the legitimate traditions of the past.Where this film fails it is in terms of not shedding light on that "other" side of the story. The side it ridicules, however, is about popular youth culture in general. In other words, all those idiots who thought they were so smart and hip because they were going along with the crowd, pretending to be different just like all their friends. Different in terms of the superficial and obvious, just like they do today. But strumming an autoharp, a mandolin or banjo, as though it were another kind of guitar, while singing the lyrics to old folk songs badly, merely impoverished the traditions they misrepresented, no different than now, when they think they are being profound by listening to meaningless noise.So pat yourself on the back for being clever enough to see through the absurdities of this story, and don't stop laughing when the tables turn, and the story is about you and "your" generation. Because the day will come when it is. Compare it with your other favorites, "Waiting For Guffman" or "Best In Show," and impress your friends with knowing the difference. Buy a pizza and throw a party. But when the laughter stops and you find yourself looking back, then you will be in that crowd along with Mitch &amp; Mickey, all burned out and regretting the conceits of your youth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't think this one is as good as the other Guest films, but it's not as bad as some have made it out to be. The subject matter was excellent and original, it was amusing to finally see folk music being satirized. It was entertaining throughout and there were some pretty funny parts. Not as funny as Spinal Tap, Best in Show, and Guffman though. I loved the Mitch and Micky storyline, that was very sweet and touching. And some of the music was suprisingly quite decent given the fact that it was supposed to be satirical. Watching some of the deleted scenes on DVD I had to wonder why some were left out of the final cut as they were hilarious and would of made the film funnier. I think some poor decisions were made on the editing side. Overall I would recommend this film and give it a 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, "Best In Show" was the funniest movie of 2000, hands down. That's hard to top, and this film is more on par with "Waiting for Guffman," the one that started it all. Some people may be disappointed that Levy's character goes off on a dramatic tangent, but I think it gives this film a nice depth. O'Hara's bittersweet perfomance is quite a change of pace from her previous "Show" character as well. And the music! The songs that aren't hilarious are actually quite good at face value. When I saw this in the theater, I knew I had to have the soundtrack. (I got it!) Mitch and Mickey's songs are sweet and sincere. The New Christy Minstrels song stylings are fabulously tacky. And The Folksmen, well, they're just intriguingly bizarre. Deborah Theaker, who played a minor role as Gerry and Cookie Fleck's friend in "Best in Show" steals a few scenes as the deceased honoree's weepy daughter. Fred Willard shines as a total dork. One warning: You may be disappointed that Coolidge and Posey don't get enough screen time, but they could be in the whole movie and still leave me wanting more. Other people in the audience were clapping along enthusiastically at the finale of this picture. And as with the other films, Guest &amp; Co. are able to lampoon these people and get you to genuinely like and respect them at the same time. Well done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did finally watch this movie and I have to say that I did enjoy it. However, it was not near as good in my opinion as "Waiting for Guffman" or "Best In Show." Wind follows the same skeleton as those two movies in that there is a cast of characters and they are introduced as if they are being interviewed in front of a camera and tell the audience about themselves. But, Wind does not seem near as humorous and I think it is because maybe it really lacks some of the outlandish character like the play director in Guffman and the gay couples in Show. The character developement is just fine, but there is not one that seems to really grab you and make you remember.While this is fine, it does seem to follow the same pattern and the movies seem to get more and more similar to one another. I did like Wind, but I am not sure if Guest releases another movie that follows the same formula if I will think the same. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, but missing something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose it is unfair to review a movie merely by comparing it to other movies, but this movie's unflagging adherence to formula makes it impossible not to. First things first: on its own, this movie is great. The characters are funny, the improvisational acting is great, and there were some memorable characters. I chuckled consistently throughout the movie, although I never guffawed. My one-word summary of A Mighty Wind: pleasant.Let us now compare it to its recent forefather, a movie with an almost identical cast, plot, and style: Best in Show. All elements are the same in both of these movies except one, and that is the element of competition. Mighty Wind was merely a reunion. Sure there was some of the competitive spirit going on at the end, but there was not the fight-to-the-finish feel that made Best in Show so funny. Even Waiting for Guffman had the "we're competing with ourselves" feel to it, and the mystery surrounding the ellusive Guffman character. Mighty Wind lacked competition, it lacked mystery. It felt like "Best in Show Lite." Sort of like going to a family reunion.I also must say that while I applaud the creativity of Eugene Levy in creating his character, the movie dragged most of the time he was present. Except for his final concert performance and his giving her of the rose. That was some great stuff.Despite my complaints, I did quite like this movie. Fred Willard was perfect, Catherine O'Hara was amazing, and the crossdressing - that was priceless. Overall, I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think it's officially time to put an end to the "mockumentary" genre. I liked "This Is Spinal Tap" as much as the next guy, but unless you're a die-hard folk music fan (do any exist?), you should probably just rent the next comedy down the rack, as "A Mighty Wind" has too much space in between laughs, not enough significantly funny parts, and just not enough jokes to qualify as a decent movie. A lot of it is even boring, with certain characters droning on forever without much of it being funny, and some random sex jokes tossed in there (transsexuals, porn references, motel sex) that felt forced and were obviously just there to fill in time, as "folk music" itself didn't supply enough jokes to fill an entire motion picture.Does "A Mighty Wind" have its moments? Not really (save for the "Chess" bit), and while followers of Guest might enjoy this, it's undeniably boring and padded out. Mediocre compared to Guest's other films.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As other reviewers have noted, this is more of the same coming from Christopher Guest (BTW, those who think that Guest should switch to something different obviously haven't seen the godawful "Almost Heroes"). If you saw and liked "This Is Spinal Tap", "Waiting For Guffman" and/or "Best In Show", you're gonna like this one as well, otherwise skip it. The cast is, well, the usual suspects - clueless Fred Willard, genial Michael McKean, nerdy Eugene Levy, emotionless Bob Balaban, plus Catherine O'Hara, Guest, Michael Hitchkock and the rest of the gang, with the welcome addition of genre veteran Harry Shearer. There are are some nice touches - Guest, McKean and Shearer play their folk trio as some sort of parallel universe Spinal Tap. And i never thought i'd use the words "Eugene Levy" and "unrecognizable" in the same sentence, and yet he is in this movie, both visually and audibly. There is not as much satiric value as in the other ones, as Guest seems to be a bit too fond of his characters to properly ridicule them (in fact, i myself have grown to like them so much, i almost wished there wouldn't been the inevitable "six months later" epilogue, showing them at their most pathetic). Still, there are a lot of laughs - Willard's moronic "ideas", Shearer constantly stating the obvious, Levy and O'Hara in their mutual denial, Ed Begley's Yiddish-punctuated speech are among the highlights. In short, a worthy one, if not spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the absolute first movie where I WAS THE ONLY PERSON IN THE THEATER! I am not exaggerating; I really was the only person watching the movie. I have been to movies before with only two or three more people, but I have never watched had a whole movie theater to myself. The movie was shown Friday at 5:15 PM. A couple walked in for like 5 minutes to make out or something in the corner. I heard smacking for a couple minutes, and then they left.The movie itself might as well been a sequel to Best in Show, also directed by Christopher Guest. It has exactly the same cast. I personally liked Best in Show better, maybe because it was about something I would be more interested in real life, dogs. This movie is a mockumentary about folk music. The cast was funny as always. The actor that really wowed me was Eugene Levy. I used to really hate him in roles he played in all those 80's movies, but lately his characters are funny and likeable. He plays a burned out hippie that has been institutionalized in the past. He talks like he is trying to formulate thoughts in mid-sentence. It is like he is talking before he knows what he is going to say.Something I just found out today, Harry Shearer played Mark Shubb a band member of the Folksmen in this movie. He is also the voice of the characters Mr. Burns, Smithers, Flanders, and Reverend Love Joy in the Simpsons. 7/10 I would rather see Best in Show again, but this was still funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Structured Improv Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Mighty Wind" (2003) is the fourth film in a series collaborations by Christopher Guest and his associates. While the four films share a process of inprovised scenes in a documentary structure, it is not correct to use the label of "mockumentary" for this latest film because it really does not mock the characters or subject matter. Instead, it might more accurately be described as a new genre all together that presents an affectionate satire within a documentary format. Perhaps the best description is a moot documentary. Similar to the literary format found in a historical novel, "A Mighty Wind" tells the story of characters that never really lived and events that never really happened but framed in the context of musical styles and times that did exist in the 1960s. The writers and actors have achieved a remarkable illusion of reality by giving the audience detailed personal and group background stories that make the all-too-human idiosyncracies of the characters so believable. The best comedy of these Christopher Guest films has a univeral appeal that does not necessarily depend on a shared point of view, a shared social or political philosophy, or any specialized knowledge on the part of the audience. The viewer need not know the world of heavy metal rock to laugh at the characters in "This is SpinalTap" (1984). Nor does one need to know a lot about community theater or dog show competition to appreciate the comedy of "Waiting for Guffman" (1996) or "Best in Show" (2000). But if the viewer does have special knowledge in these topics, or lived in those times, perhaps they appreciate the film on a deeper level than those who do not share that life experience. I understand how some younger viewers of this film who have never been previously exposed to the folk music style of the 1960s would not understand how funny some of the inside jokes seem to older viewers in their 50s now who were young when folk music was big. To paraphrase a line from Harry Shearer as one of "The Folksmen," when some of us who are older now lived in those times, we weren't "retro" then, we were "nowtro." But the characters are so strong and their foibles so easy to recognize that the film can be appreciated on its own terms by a viewer of any age. The original songs in this film are also not really satire. Some are so beautifully written and performed that I have no doubt they would have been folk music hits had they been released in that era. I hope some become "new" folk music "classics" thanks to the live concert tours and the DVD release of this film. When Ken Burns produced "The Civil War" series for PBS more than a decade ago, his theme music was "Ashokan Farewell." While the fiddle sound of that composition was perfectly authentic for the musical sound of the Civil War era, the song was actually written in 1982 by Jay Ungar. In a similar way, the original music of "A Mighty Wind" perfectly matches the idealism and energy of early 1960s folk music. In the title song "A Mighty Wind" one can imagine echoes of both "This Land is Your Land" and "Blowin in the Wind." One can also see similarities in the real Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary and the fictional Alan Barrows (Christopher Guest) of The Folksmen. The costumes and sound of The New Main Street Singers in the film remind some of the sound or look of The New Christy Minstrels. This superb film is a great comedy that can be appreciated on even deeper levels with the wonderful bonus materials in the DVD. Even the deleted scenes are hilarious and some deleted songs are very strong. But as funny as it is, this film is not just a comedy. The "reunion" of Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as "Mitch and Mickey" is a terrific emotional yet gently comedic centerpiece for the story of the three bands and all the acting performances are textured and nuanced. Chrisopher Guest and his ensemble of actors, writers, and composers should be very proud of this gem. They have considerably brighted up an otherwise stressful year of conflict and their inventive gift of humor is a major positive highlight for 2003 and beyond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite "Spinal Tap" Unplugged - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many IMDb reviewers, from the terse to the erudite, have weighed in for and against A Mighty Wind. A lot of short reviews complain that the movie is slow and boring, even though the reviewer 'likes folk music.' I suspect these are younger viewers who were expecting to see 'Son of Spinal Tap.' They miss the point. They don't understand what older viewers don't need to be told: This film is not really about music. It is about time and changes, about the loss of youth and beginning to look back instead of forward. In 'A Mighty Wind' an older, mellower Christopher Guest is reflecting on middle age, the irrationality of fate and the fickleness of fortune, and folk music is the mirror---not even really folk music, but rather the folk music 'revival' of the 1960s, when the Baby Boomers were coming of age and everything was fresh, exciting and full of hope. Music, it seemed, could empower you to achieve anything. The self-importance of the time can be summed up by Arlo Guthrie's remark on 'Alice's Restaurant': 'If you wanna end war and stuff, you gotta sing loud!'It's no accident that the folk music patron whose death inspires the reunion concert is named Irving Steinbloom. Guest is paying homage to the importance of Jews such as Moses Asch in the preservation of American folk music. Eastern European Jews came to America from a vigorous and totally grass-roots culture. Their world could not survive the multiple assaults of the 20th century: Emigration, modernization, Soviet socialism, Nazism (and the Nazis' enthusiastic collaborators), assimilation and the state of Israel. The American descendents of these Jews have had an intense interest in the preservation and transmission of this culture, and this extended to the culture of their new home, which is also being worn down by the modern world.Other reviewers also complain that the music in 'A Mighty Wind' is not good. It's not SUPPOSED to be good. A lot of bad folk-style music was made in the folk music 'revival' that was accepted uncritically by audiences who were eager for anything from their favorite artists. What is amazing is how accurately that musical style is captured in new songs whose lyrics and melodies are clever parodies of the folk style. These songs sound like real songs, the actors playing them are really playing their instruments and singing; the whole effect is amazingly convincing. The giveaway is the lyrics: They are really pretty awful, in that precious folk-style way. The three groups are obviously loosely based on the Kingston Trio (Folksmen), the New Christy Minstrels (= New Main Street Singers), and Ian and Sylvia (&gt; Mitch and Mickey), although all these groups had lots of imitators. I noted also that a Bob Dylan-like character was not among the 'artists.' The real scene-stealer in this film is Eugene Levy as Mitch Cohen, the burned-out folkie who seemingly never recovered from his breakup with Mickey Crabbe (Catherine O'Hara). He walks and moves like someone tanked up on Thorazine or Haldol and talks like someone who's had a few too many electroshock sessions. Also worthy of note is Jane Lynch as Laurie (ahem) Bohner; Lynch's specialty seems to be the absolutely upright and respectable-appearing façade that conceals some pretty extreme weirdness; she also seems to be a master of an ingratiating breeziness that is truly obnoxious.Still other reviewers have complained that the ending is a big disappointment. The ending is really an anticlimax. It is very muted, and I think it is still more reflection on the way time changes our ambitions. The bit about Mark Shubb (Harry Shearer) having undergone a sex-change operation is just a tag at the end of the scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idea for movie from Saturday Night Live Sketch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched an old 1984 episode of Saturday Night Live with guest Michael Mckean and musical guest Shaka Kahn. I believe that this episode was the start of the idea for "A Mighty Wind".In the episode there is a sketch about and old trio folk band reuniting after 20 years. It featured the same actors that appeared as the Kingston trio in the film and even sang the same songs!!! It went throughout the series of interview with each singer talking about the reunion and then showed them rehearsing. At the end of the sketch they sing there famous song "Eat at Joe's". It was great!Now, I gotta say, I am a huge Christopher Guest fan. I think his story telling is great and fun. Some films are better than others, but in a whole they are all original and entertaining. I was so excited when I saw this sketch. Seeing the origins of a movie that would be made nearly 20 years later.Thanks for listening.</fullReview>

(NOTE: the same actors playing "Spinal Tap" actually also opened for "Spinal Tap" in the guise of "The Folksmen" when they did their brief live Spinal Tap tour). The movie is excellent - Eugene Levy &amp; Catherine O'Hara steal the show in the reunion of "Mitch &amp; Mikey". Very subtle humour - the DVD commentary by Christopher Guest &amp; Eugene Levy reveals great information for fans of these films and this genre. Harry Shearer (of Simpsons &amp; Spinal Tap fame) is also great and has a surprise twist at the end. Actors actually sang and played all music live - some of them learning new instruments for the movie. Fred Willard (love him or hate him) gives a great &amp; strange performance as the wacko band manager for "The New Main Street Players".... Watch this movie - you won't be sorry...</fullReview>

Touching at the ending of the movie especially the scene with McKean in the dressing room, maybe 10 seconds but very well played out. The music was very good, although I am not into folk music. Eugene Levy was great in his role, Christine O'Hara very good as well. Yes these films in his series are kind of starting to follow the same formula, but what a good formula to repeat. If Hollywood could produce a comedy with 10% of what Christopher Guest had to offer, there would be a helluva lot more quality out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should have a better appreciation for Christopher Guest and his troupe of performers. They are doing some of the toughest theater in the world. Walk in with no lines, no plot, only the scantest of guidelines, and say something funny.On the other hand, Guest allegedly had several hundred hours of footage, and this was the best two he could come up with. This should say something.It hurts to give this movie as low a rating as I did, because they did try hard. Unfortunately, there isn't that much funny to say about folk musicians. They are earnest, wet-behind-the-ears, and look really silly in retrospect. Compare this with Heavy Metal (Spinal Tap), which looked pretty dumb from the beginning.Note to Guest. Choose your targets more carefully in the future. Before you blow a year of your life and hundreds of thousands of dollars on expensive film stock, have the crew get together for a few hours of free association on the subject with a few interested participants looking on. If you can't get at least two p*ss-your-pants-funny jokes out of the initial session, it probably won't get better with time.6/10.</fullReview>

Parker Posey had a small but funny role, and Levy and Catherine O'Hara are great together!My only complaint about the movie was that there were too many characters with too little screen time, resulting in the audience not being able to name any of the characters -- beyond "Mitch" and "Mickey", of course.But nonetheless the movie worked, and throughout I was happy, satisfied and laughing.I'd give it an eight out of ten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fat budget isn't always a benefit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am as "cultish" a fan of "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best in Show" as anyone. Being such, as well as a child of the 60's and a huge folk music fan, I looked forward to the release of A Mighty Wind with baited breath. As far as the originality and humor of the movie is concerned, I was not disappointed. However, I really sense that the Guest/Levy "magic" has really lost something. After much thought I concluded that the issue lies in the fact that Guffman and Show were both made on a modest budget. Mighty Wind obviously was given much credibility by the people holding the purse strings and had much more money poured into it. The result was an increase in the number of cast members, lots of state of the art sets, props and extras and removed a lot of Guest's creativity to make do with the resources at hand. It also drastically limited the amount of screen time for the key actors that made Guffman and Show such awesome pictures. I will purchase the DVD when it becomes available and it will join my collection of favorites, but this one won't be my first choice to introduce the "unenlightened" to the comedy genius of Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy.</fullReview>

The finale in A Mighty Wind doesn't have the same impact - which wouldn't matter except that I get the impression it was supposed to. Still there is satisfying closure and I was left with the glow generated by the main body of the film.What's of most value is the remarkable interpretations of these characters by actors who've assumed (in some cases) completely different personas in previous Christopher Guest films. Folk music is one genre that always had a tendency to be either totally fervent or totally frivolous, and A Mighty Wind plays this angle to great advantage.</fullReview>

"A Mighty Wind" is true to this pattern. It's about nostalgia. The cool thing about these movies isn't just that they're funny (I got more yuks from "Best In Show") but in a weird way they're wise (this one is tops) and tackle subjects which are real but appear no where in pop culure.Can't wait to see what comes next.

Eugene Levy is at his best and makes the most of the role of Mitch, a down and out folksinger, hamming it up on album covers when he doesn't have a line. Unexpectedly, Levy delivers his part as Mitch in a poignant, engaging way. Mickey, (Mitch's ex), played by Catherine O'Hara is at the top of her game too. But the drama is unexpected. The script and film aren't pure silliness that we expect from the makers of Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, and This is Spinal Tap. Further, the drama doesn't come to fruition.Despite the fact her lines Parker Posey's lines aren't very funny, she's a luminous beauty and because she's delivers her lines so well, I hung on her every word. I was actually disappointed with Jennifer Coolidges lines, because she's so funny and wasn't given enough to material to work with. But trust me, despite the weak script, the actor's enthusiasm delivers a winner. Wait till you see Deborah Theaker as Naomi Steinbloom. Her performance is comparable to a welfare mom making lobster au gratin from a box of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. And she's not the only actor that is inspired this way, rising above an uneven script.The writing is hysterical with regularity, the film is visually interesting, all the actors are at the top of their games. If you are any kind of fan of any of the actors, go see the film. I'm grateful for the laughs and the inspired performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as "Best in Show" or "Waiting for Guffman", but still impressive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Guest's "A Mighty Wind", done in the same documentary-style of his previous films "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best in Show" is not as funny, as well-acted, or as interesting as his previous efforts, but is nevertheless a mostly well-done and realistic portrait of the folk scene. "A Mighty Wind" documents three different groups: The New Main Street Singers, whose members include John Michael Higgins, Jane Lynch, and Parker Posey, and who make a living by performing at amusement parks. The Folksmen, a group from the 60's, whose members are "This is Spinal Tap" alumni Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer (making his first appearance in a Christopher Guest-directed film). Mitch and Mickey (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara), were known for a song called "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow", which includes one of the most famous kisses in music history). Their group broke up after Mitch had a breakdown and was in and out of mental institutions. All three groups are going to a musical reunion held by the son of a late record producer, who promoted all three bands.Up into the big show, "A Mighty Wind" is slow-moving, uncomfortable, and a hell of a lot less interesting than his previous efforts. The show, however, is a big wow, as the actors sing very well, and make people who always cringed at folk music (like me) actually get wowed! Besides the music being of quality, it is quite surprising how much emotion can be evoked my fictional musical characters. I can't put this up with "Waiting for Guffman" or "Best in Show", but this is still a lot better than the other mockumentary about the music industry, the overrated "This is Spinal Tap". 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty funny but a little uneven</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Christopher Guest's third mockumentary type of film and to be honest its his least funny. The story starts with a man named Jonathan Steinbloom (Bob Balaban) who is the son of a deceased music mogul and in his memory he wants to stage a folk music reunion with the bands New Main Street Singers, The Folksmen and Mitch and Mickey. The film does a good job of introducing all the characters and showing us the background of each one of them, some with flashback sequences. The film ultimately ends up with the big reunion live on television and the music really dominates the film. The music is entirely made for the film by various members of the cast and it is quite impressive to listen to. As I watched this film it dawned on me that all these actors are just so immensely talented with the singing and instrument playing, not to mention the character development that is needed. But the major flaw of the film comes with Eugene Levy as Mitch and Catherine O'Hara as Mickey. The story line with these characters becomes serious in tone and it seems out of place with the rest of the film. Mitch and Mickey split up years ago and now Mitch is a border line psychotic with real issues of self doubt. These two terrific performers show that they can handle serious roles but it should be in another film. Also, as good as the music is it seems to take over the film and your kept waiting for the humor to return. There is still plenty of laughs to recommend this funny film and as usual Fred Willard practically steals the picture. No where near as good as "Waiting For Guffman" or "Best in Show" but this is still a very entertaining film with enough laughs and charm to carry it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the Point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is ironically Chris Guest's misfortune to have begun his career in "mockumentary" (a term Guest hates) with the Gold Standard of the form, "This is Spinal Tap" (which Guest did NOT direct; Rob Reiner did, so the tone of that film may be laid largely at his feet.) His subsequent efforts, "Guffman", "Best in Show", and now "A Mighty Wind", have naturally been measured against "Tap". But they are VERY DIFFERENT PICTURES! "Tap" was a true satire, in that it was meant to cut, to poke fun at, to criticize. Guest's films are full of affection for the human foibles of his characters. He may be the only dramatic artist working today who walks firmly in the footsteps of Chekhov, whose humor (yes HUMOR) stems from his characters delusions, denials, and obsessions, which can also be recognizable as ours."A Mighty Wind" is not as comical as "Tap", but it is more humanly moving. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara as Mitch and Mickey are the emotional center, and I think Levy for the first time lets the actor break the shell of the caricaturist. His Mitch is complex, hilarious, moving and TRUE. I think the kiss at the concert should get at least a nomination at the MTV Movie Awards. The rest of the cast is just as detailed, funny and TRUE.Go and watch Guest's (and Levy's) films again -- and try to forget "Tap" for a few hours.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guest is one of the finest comic talents in the film industry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely do we ever see comedies that give us anything original. For the most part, today's parodies are filled with rehashed jokes and clichés that are so overdone they make an average person want to leave the theater. However, there are a few comedic actors out there that stand out among the rest for their true talent and ability to give the audience interesting, yet hilarious stories. As is the case with writer, director and actor Christopher Guest, whose new film, `A Mighty Wind,' follows his unconventional comic shtick with making mockumentary films. Despite the fact that the film is a hysterical romp, even Guest seems to be playing off of his own clichés in the format of the film. But it doesn't seem to harm the integrity of the movie or the performances-`A Mighty Wind' remains extremely funny. It just goes to show that Guest is one of the finest comic talents in the film industry.`A Mighty Wind' is the story of three separate folk bands from the 60s who reunite for a concert after the inspired leader of the folk genre dies. The reunion brings together bands that have broken up, such as the beloved `Mitch &amp; Mickey' played by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, whose song `A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow' stole the hearts of millions. Through a blend of characterization and witty humor, we are taken from meeting the bands to the reunion concert where the actual concert could turn out to be a success or go completely south. The great part of Guest's mockumentary films is how realistic they are. If you didn't know anything about the film and just happen to see it one day, you would think that you were watching something completely real. The only aspect of the film that gives it away as a phony is the fact that the characters are incredibly eccentric. From ridiculous songs like `Potato's In the Paddy Wagon,' to the dazed Mitch character, one can't help but laugh out loud. The only problem with `A Mighty Wind' is Guest's mockumentary formula. We meet the principal characters that are all extremely whimsical. They all end up getting ready for some big event where things go wrong, but in the end it all works out. This is followed by an epilogue, taking place several months after the event. If you've seen `Waiting For Guffman,' or `Best In Show,' then you already know what to expect when seeing `A Mighty Wind.' Either Guest needs to change his mockumentary format, or perhaps abandon the mockumentary in pursuit of something new. The acting in `A Mighty Wind' was boisterously entertaining. Levy has become a household name for his portrayal as Jim's dad in the `American Pie' films. He's one of several actors that Guest consistently works with and regardless of which film he's in, Levy always steals the show. Among other returning faces are O'Hara (`Home Alone'), Michael McKean (`Auto Focus'), Harry Shearer (`This Is Spinal Tap'), and Bob Balaban (`Close Encounters Of The Third Kind'). Ultimately `A Mighty Wind' is a good movie.certainly far better than the average comic film out there today. Unlike the conventional Jim Carrey or Adam Sandler routine, Guest's films still hold true comedic performances that don't reach for the auidences laughter with swearing or fighting, but rather with true ironic humor. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mixed Bag; Funny At Times, Painful At Others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On balance, I had fun, but this is not a movie for everyone.Pros:--The Folksmen. McKean/Guest/Shearer can do no wrong, and they were fabulous. If the whole movie had been focused on them, I wouldn't have minded a bit. Theirs was the only song I walked out of the theatre still singing ("Wellllll therrrrre's...")--Fred Willard. He was completely stupid and completely obnoxious and I laughed my a$$ off every time he was on screen. Well done.--Bob Balaban. Though he got a little obnoxious during his scene with the theatre manager at Town Hall, overall he was extremely funny. Great job with the character.--Ed Begley, Jr. speaking Yiddish. Laughed my a$$ off again.--The songs. Simply superb. I ordered the soundtrack, and it's even better.--The final performance at Town Hall. I'd give it a standing ovation.Cons:--The New Main Street Singers. Yes, they were funny in spots. But they were so big that they got shafted in terms of story; I felt like I was watching a Lawrence Welk act the whole time they were on-screen, and I just wasn't getting into their story. Poor Parker Posey gets especially shafted here. Though when they sang The Folksmen's "Never Did No Wanderin'" I found myself laughing until I could not see straight.--Mitch and Mickey. Great idea, not well executed; I could not get into Eugene Levy's character at all, and their story drifts so far apart from the rest of the groups that you find yourself dreading every time they're on screen. But their harmonies were awesome.--The pacing of the story. Though it's only about 1:40, it drags badly in a couple of places (noticeably in the Mitch/Mickey segments).Still, though, I thought it was very funny in spots and well worth seeing if you're old enough to remember the 60's folk scene. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My kids took me to see this movie after seeing it themselves -- they were fairly sure they hadn't "gotten" it all and they figured a mom who spent most of her college years draped over a guitar might. From my perspective, it was funny and moving. But the most fun I had was listening to the audience after the film explaining to their partners "who the groups were." How about the New Main Street Singers as the Weavers? The Folksmen as Peter, Paul and Mary? And a whole lot of "I don't knows" for M&amp;M. Puhleez: New Christy Minstrels, Limeliters, and Ian and Sylvia! But maybe it depends upon what part of the folk music scene you were involved in ... Certainly recommended for those of us in the first wave of baby boomers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't listen to these posters-Watch it for yourself!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying how stupid some of the people that post their comments here are being-Just because one has seen "This is Spinal Tap", "Waiting for Guffman", and "Best in Show" does not make one an expert on movies or even Christopher Guest-It makes you sound pompous and ugly. As a film-watcher, always associating one film with another to make yourself sound smarter or more elite is not the best practice, and you know what else? NOBODY CARES THAT YOU'VE SEEN THOSE MOVIES! They want to know about "A Mighty Wind"!. So, if you've seen any of the aforementioned films-Keep it to yourself! The only thing that links the other movies to this one is the cast-It is a separate entity entirely. With that out of the way, let me say that I was blown away by the film, "A Mighty Wind". Blocking out other distractions (like normal people do when watching a film!), I was completely taken in by the film. The characters were wonderful, the acting was amazing (Catherine O'Hara for Best Supporting Actress next year!), the music (for a non-folk song enthusiast) was outstanding; in short everything about the movie was great. I have since seen the film three times and bought the soundtrack. Once was not enough and I have a feeling I'll be back again. When the DVD comes out, I can bet I'll add it to my collection. It is refreshing to find a film that is well-acted and well-produced in today's society. I laughed, almost cried (you probably know which part) and returned again and again and again. Hopefully, you'll ignore the pompous people and find a true gem of a movie-you might return, too!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a mighty wind of satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genius of much satire is to pick a subject so ripe for it, many people may not get it. That's the risk you take. The trouble with alot of the 'folks' who don't get this movie is the long memory required and an eye for detail and emotion. AMW is so pitch-perfect in both that it went by so fast and mentioned with such subtlety that it blows by like a light breeze, belieing the title. The three Steinbloom children represent what a wise friend of mine aptly called 'the 3 faces of guilt'. We could laugh good and hard at Jonathan's obsessive attention to things that could cause bodily injury, but blithely cut his secretary off at the knees when she suggests he get an important committment in writing. There's more obvious laffs (like a good Swedish boy's uncanny grasp of Yiddish), but I had a good internal chuckle at the quality of the artwork on the PLAYBILL for the event which looked like it was done by a stoned high school freshman drawn freehand with ballpoint pen and then xeroxed. My high school variety show was coming back to haunt me. There was also some pain with your humor, like Eugene Levy's haunting delivery of his lines, the hesitation serves to augment the conflict inside a guy who's life has pretty much gone to crap. And Catherine O'Hara was reminding me ALOT of Grace Slick on 'Behind the Music'. I imagine this was deliberate. Don't expect to be hit over the head by funny here. Having some miles under you and an eye for reference helps. Having parents or older siblings that listened to the folk of that era, invaluable! A few posters here have already dropped the punchline in the title song. All I'll say is you have to remember a time where that line may have been perfectly acceptable in that context. Really. I'm leaving alot out, but there was alot in there. There were many of the same ensemble players here that were in 'Best In Show'. I'd love to see this again, but I will balk at having to once more sit through the NEW Main St. Singers cloying rendition of 'Potato's in the Paddy Wagon'. I mean, ow!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite of the bunch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am dumbfounded by the number of people who have said that they were let down by this movie, or that it was not as good as `Best in Show.' While it is true that there is not as much slapstick humor, or the ongoing sexual reunion shots with Catherine O'Hara's `Best in Show' character to give it the typical `mainstream studio audience humor', this movie is by far my favorite of the Chris Guest trilogy.I would also compare this movie favorably to `This is Spinal Tap,' the first time we saw Guest, Shearer and McKean in a musical comedy shot in documentary form(Guest hates the term `mockumentary'). The music is certainly as clever (if not as raunchy), the characters are fully developed, and there are far more characters involved.Furthermore, it has the courage to actually tell a bit of a heartwarming story that gives you the kind of warmth that many of the classic comedies of the 50s (`Harvey' as an example) offered along with the overt humor. In most typical Hollywood comedies, any subtleties, real wit or clever humor give way to the `easy, lowbrow laugh' (Carrey, Sandler, Murphy et al). Not so with this caste of very talented, improvisational actors.As a musician, I appreciate the incredible work it took to pull off the live performances, knowing that many had to learn their instruments for their roles. I also feel that the underplayed, yet very witty look `inside the folk music industry' will continue to play well for years to come. Guest and Levy did not have to resort to as many `over the top' comedic clichés to make their points (the literal `two left feet' in `Best' comes to mind), and yet the audience in the theater howled almost nonstop.After `This is Spinal Tap' (Guest's collaboration with Rob Reiner) which played out almost totally as an `inside joke' for anyone who had ever been in a 70s rock band (myself included), I feel that there has been a steady improvement in both quality and humor since `Waiting for Guffman.'I can't wait for the DVD on this one. I just ordered the CD, and am looking forward to seeing the movie again soon. This was one of the funniest movies I have seen in years. And, I'm sure it will continue to be one of my favorites for years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Guest is a genius. I am no fan of folk music but you don't need to be to die laughing at a lot of this stuff (song lyrics such as "a mighty wind is blowing you and me," for example, or Jonathan's admonition at the start of the show that the flower arrangements were dangerous). Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara have great on screen chemistry as usual, and the New Main St Singers-with a porno queen lead singer-are great as NKOTB-type of canned, stylized quasi-musicians. My only complaint is this: most of the cast are not old enough to have been big folk stars in the mid-late 60s. A small point, I know, but it did bug me. No matter. See it anyway and find out how we come up with big trains!</fullReview>

Bottom line is: well worth seeing but please, don't make any comparisons to Spinal Tap, which is by far still the best of the bunch (even though it was not directed by Guest, but by Rob Reiner).

The main criticism I've heard is that it's more of the same. This is somewhat true, but if you hadn't seen the previous two this would be a hilarious film with some wonderful, truly extemperaneous scenes it it.

This is a film that calls for repeated viewings, as there are so many things going on at once. As with "Spinal Tap," a little pre-knowledge helps to catch the insider jokes, but the humor is so broad that everyone should enjoy this. My biggest laugh? Stiffler's mom's character's comment about the trains... I dropped my popcorn (really!). As in "Show" she is funny. And Eugene Levy deserves an award for his spaced-out, pining-for-the-past Mitch. I cannot decide who I liked better: Levy or Balaban. Thanks for reading this.</fullReview>

I mean, if you can't appreciate My Dinner With Andre action figures, then comedy is dead.And I laughed, a lot, in this movie. A lot of great bits, moments and jokes.But something was missing. Don't anyone tell me I missed the subtleties, just because I don't think it was a perfect film. Knowing the method behind the filming, and that they had over 80 hours of footage to work with, I wonder what other directions could have been chosen that were on the cutting room floor. Guest's films are always short, and maybe that's part of the formula for success of this genre, but I really wanted more character development. Or more continuity. More something, I'm not sure what. Seeing the immense outtakes on both the criterion and later "special edition" of This Is Spinal Tap, you see that there were many subplots and abandoned storylines that could have made it a very different movie. I hope the same volume of material is on the Mighty Wind DVD when the time comes, because I am curious to see what Guest decided to abandon in the editing process. Still smarter and funnier than 99% of hollywood's "products" but I don't measure the good stuff against Dumb and Dumber. Comparing it to other genius work by these great comics, I feel a bit let down. Still looking forward to that DVD. </fullReview>

Unfortunately Eugene Levy overdoes it as Mitch and many of the other characters are insufficiently developed. The music is brilliant and there are a few genuine laughs (the New Main Street Singer with the porno past) and Fred "Wha' happened?" Willard in fine form.

Guest and co-writer Eugene Levy have the gang back to poke fun at folk music. Like their previous efforts, there is a bit of affection at the center of the satire.The film owes it's genesis to a sketch that Guest, Harry Shearer, and Michael McKean performed on Saturday Night Live (at least that's where I first saw the group) where they portrayed the Folksmen, a nod to the Kingston Trio and other folk groups. They even performed the same signature song.The performances are great, as always, with Levy, O'Hara, and Ed Begley Jr. as personal favorites. I couldn't stop laughing as Begley, the whitest of whitebread Swedes (in the film) tries to pepper his words with Yiddish! Levy sounds like he is both medicated and constipated throughout the film. Fred Willard once again steals the fun with his usual oblivious flair.What really surprised me, although I don't know why it should, is that the music was so good! Yes it's silly at times, but it really captures the flavor of the great old folk music. This is one movie with a soundtrack that is worth hearing by itself.I've read some mixed reviews, but I loved this. Humor is subjective; but, even at its worst, this film leaves you with a smile on your face. There aren't many movies that do that for me anymore. The film proves that you can be both smart and funny; that not every comedy requires toilet humor and screaming leads (I'm looking at you, Mr. Sandler). Definitely the cure for the Daddy Daycare blues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as funny as I expected.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing "Best in Show" I went to see "A Mighty Wind" expecting to be surprised and amused. This movie, in my view, lacked the creativity in plot and characters that the former movie displayed. I was especially disappointed in Eugene Levy's character, Mitch, who appeared to be on Prozac. I've always loved his character interpretations in the past. But this time he missed the boat, so to speak. On the other hand, Fred Willard was a hoot and Michael McKean was right on. I have to say that a lot of people in the audience were howling with laughter, but for the most part, I thought the movie was amusing but just mildly so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. What do you do for an encore to this one, Mr. Guest? The movie leaves you wanting more. Fortunately, there IS more -- in the form of the soundtrack, featuring songs from all the "groups" -- The Folksmen, Mitch &amp; Mickey and The New Main Street Singers -- many of which don't even appear in the movie. Absolutely fantastic, "true" to the era of folk music, many with amusing twists to them. And if you've never heard the Rolling Stones' "Start Me Up" done to a folk tune melody, you're in for a treat.If you are looking for a gut-busting, laugh-a-minute film, this is NOT the film for you. If you are looking for a film to make you think, smile and reminisce a bit, then this is for you. The all-star cast, made up from the casts of THIS IS SPINAL TAP, WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and BEST IN SHOW, are all here. You'll spend your first time watching the film looking for the various actors. You'll go back to watch it more carefully and more fully enjoy the music.And after the movie -- remember -- EA A OE'S!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great nostalgia trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why did I give this film a "10"? Well, to begin with, the computer wouldn't let me give it a "12." It's been ages since a film gave me such a feeling of complete joy. To think of an equivalent, I'd have to go back to its real-life counterpart and possible inspiration, "Wasn't That a Time?" For those of us old enough to live through the folk era, this film was a reminder of all that was good about the music of the time. I immediately bought the CD and have been wearing out the repeat button on my player listening to my favorites over and over. Since there are no leading actors, this film might not do well at Oscar time, but the award programs that have an ensemble-acting category might give this gifted cast the attention they deserve. At least three of the songs deserve best-song nominations--and I say that with confidence in May. It may not be as funny as "Best in Show," but it has more heart. Before it was over I was wiping a few tears from my eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that Christopher Guest and his troupe might be the most talented collection of people in the film community. To be able to play newly learned instruments, sing, and maintain character on screen is difficult enough. To have to completely improvise your dialogue in addition to that demonstrates a huge and highly spontaneous talent. "A Mighty Wind" is definately the most serious of Guest's films in terms of subtext. There is a lot more going on than singing and funny sex jokes. I won't be pedantic, and perhaps I'm just reading into things, but it seems like there's a lot more going on. Think about it. In any event, hats off to Guest and company. I can only imagine how funny their next enterprise will be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Christopher Guest stock company has done it again. I thought that they could not possibly match their wonderful work in `Best in Show.' I was wrong. They did it. This is improvisational comedy at its best. The way these wonderful actors play off against each other is a joy to behold. The cast also performs its own music and does it very well. There are scenes that are as touching as they are funny. Guest and his co-writer, Eugene Levy, are acute observers of the human condition ? and funny, funny guys. This is the kind of comedy, like `Monty Python and the Holy Grail,' `Princess Bride,' and the rest of the Guest oeuvre that gets funnier with each new viewing. Highly, highly recommended. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly great comedy, best movie of the year so far. The quality of Guest'smasterpieces from Spinal Tap to Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show and thenthis movie has been steadily improving. This one has added a new touch to the mockumentary genre: a mix of drama which contrasts with comedy and makes itshine.Adding drama to comedy is akin to mixing fire and ice, Fellini and Chaplin could do it, Woody Allen tried for years, but never quite got it. This new mix has left even some of the mockumentary lovers scratching their heads. A few negativereviews are entertaining and appear to be written by characters from the movie: apologizing "for being unable to determine how to type the necessary accentmark for the "e" of cliche" is similar to Balaban's fussy character, who wasconcerned that the audience might hurt themselves on decorative flowerarrangements or get poisoned by chewing on the vines. This movie is a tribute to art, no matter how clumsy it may be, as long as it is sincere, it has a magic ability to transcend the absurd, the ridiculous and the mundane. .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dead-on skewering of the folk music scene in the 60's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all know that this is a Christopher Guest film, a mockumentary of the music industry, and that he has had successes with his other films (Waiting for Guffman, This is Spinal Tap;) so there is no reason to rehash the obvious. What isn't obvious about this film, especially if you have not lived through or been involved with the folk music scene, is how deadly accurate, (and therefore extraordinarily funny) it is.The plot is familiar territory: it's a reunion of three major folk-music groups of the 60's, to honor the life of deceased promoter Irving Steinbloom. The groups represent the evolution of folk in its earliest stages: the sweater-vested ensemble singing (the "neuftet")of The Main Street Singers, a sort of sickly-sweet, terminally upbeat version of the Serendipity Singers; The Folksmen, a trio of genial guys a la Kingston Trio; and finally, Mitch and Mickey, a sort of "enter the counterculture" introduction to Ian and Sylvia. Their portrayal of the styles, the attitudes and music of these three groups is so unbelievably accurate it is difficult not to believe that they actually ARE the groups they are parodying. What is even funnier and more amazing is the way they have evolved over the intervening years between initial fame and the reunion concert. If anything, Guest's genius in drawing character out of caricature is more finely tuned than it's ever been, even more so than in what is considered his masterwork, This is Spinal Tap.The folk scene of both yesterday and today is beautifully rendered. I say beautiful in the sense of someone witnessing the perfect practical joke, or hearing the perfect comback to a heckler--as in "Man--that was BEAUTIFUL!" I was holding my sides laughing several times during this film, because not only have I known and worked with these people, I still do--and they still exist! Throughout the film I kept 'recognizing' people I knew, or people I had listened to or people I still know.If you've ever had anything to do with folk music, New Age religion, or the 1960's, you will enjoy this film--provided you have a healthy sense of humor and can see it for what it is: a dead-on skewering of the genre and the people who created it. It's a delicious piece of work by a master parodist, peopled with gifted actors and musicians who pull every nuance they can from their characters to make them real people.Even the music is good--accurate and faithful to the originals. From "Old Joe's Place" to "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow", you will laugh and remember, and be amazed at the precision with which Christopher Guest aims his arrows. He hits his target every single time.This film is a little gem of a movie, one I will surely purchase to watch again and again. I recommend it highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can count me in with the people who really liked this one, especially because it deviates from Christopher Guest's old formula. The way Waiting for Guffman skewered the pretensions of the residents of Blaine, and the way Best in Show skewered its dog owning protagonists certainly had a bit of poison in it. In this film, the audience can empathize at some of the characters while laughing at them, Mitch and Mickey being the best examples. I think it's a big risk for Guest to take in a satire, and for the most part, it pays off.A couple of sidenotes: One aspect of this film that I loved was its realism, something missing from Hollywood these days. The Folksmen dressed like ex-hippie Baby Boomers, right down to the Birkenstocks, and Fred Willard's office had all of the little knick-knacks that one sees in the offices of smarmy people like him. I think these little details make it easier for the audience to get into the film despite its obvious artifice.Also, I think that the humor in the film can appeal to a wider audience than one might think. I saw it in a three-quarter full theater in downstate Illinois -hardly a place brimming over with "mockumentary" fans- and the place was rollicking with laugher. Despite the fact that most people there probably had little connection to folk music, they loved it. Almost the entire audience sat through the credits just to hear some more of the music, which is awfully catchy. I take it as a sign that Hollywood should stop underestimating the intelligence of the movie-going public, and hence put films like this in more theaters instead of giving 2000 screens to offal like The Real Cancun and Daddy Day Care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The more serious and least amusing of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really think Christopher Guest is a genius. Moreover, his loyal cast of regulars that have been with him in his three films are just incredible as well. In fact, they might be just a little too talented. Let's face it, people want to see those same actors that they loved so much in "Guffman" and "Best in Show." I wanted to see more of them in this film. Now, I know that Guest has a burden in trying to squeeze in the Parker Poseys and crew, point taken. However, this film was about 80 minutes long. Mr. Guest, you are going to have to explain to me, why we see so little of our favorites in this film? This film could have easily incorporated another 30 minutes of running time. I feel this film might have took a hit in the editing room and perhaps the DVD of it will alter my perception of how good it was.I am not going to say that this film is bad or even dissappointing, however, it was a departure. I missed the craziness of the other two films. This film is more of a serious attempt at the "mockumentary." In fact, we might want to remove the "mock" from it all together. The story centers around a folk festival being planned as a memorial for a great folk producer that has passed away. Of course, all but one of the three original bands being asked to perform have been split up for sometime. It is interesting watching them as they attempt to bring back a musical art form that has been dead a great while.This film will draw on the heart strings, where as the other two really were more interested in laughs. That is not to say that the first two Guest films did not have emotion, they did. It just seems this one has a little more. However, in the end, I feel this movie did pale in comparison to the other two. You can tell a good story and still be hysterically funny. Guest seemed to forget that here and decided to concentrate more on just one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really can't say anything about this movie that hasn't already been said, but that's never been known to stop me.I thought that A Mighty Wind was fantastic. Not as good as This Is Spinal Tap (but then again... what is?), but better than Waiting For Guffman and Best In Show. However... I think think that the entire "mockumentry" genre of movies is not one that appeals to a wide variety of people. They tend to be slow-moving, and not everyone really "gets it". If you've seen any of Christopher Guest's previous mockumentries and didn't like them, then I can almost guarentee that you won't like A Mighty Wind. I can understand that, and almost respect that, but being that I am about as big of a Mr Guest fan as you can find... I loved this movie.Mad props to Eugene Levy, who successfully managed to portray a very funny and touching character with such ease. If you ask me, it's his best performance ever. Also, there's something magical about seeing Spinal Tap members Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer together again in a different form. It was amusing, if nothing else. And Fred Willard... don't even get me started on that guy. He's hilarious in every sense of the word. The rest of the cast shines as well.So, to sum up, if you've enjoyed Christopher Guest's previous movies, this is a must see. If you haven't, then you have my permission to skip this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Inconsistent, Limp Failure.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most other viewers are either biased because this is a Christopher Guest movie or see something I just don't. For those who don't know, A Mighty Wind is mockumentary of the 1960s folk music revival. A famous folk musician dies and several other folksters decide to hold a reunion concert. The film follows the three groups who participate as they discuss their past and prepare for the concert.As with all Guest mockumentaries, the individual groups are designed to parody actual figures (and the folk music scene itself). Unlike the targets of his two previous films (Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show), the subject matter of Wind isn't intrinsically funny. Community theater is funny because it's so pedestrian and cheap (Guffman) and Dog shows are ridiculous because the owners are pompous and deluded (Show). Middle-aged folksters aren't inherently funny and so it seems Guest has trouble evoking much humor and maintaining a lively pace. Unlike the characters in his previous films, the folk musicians in Wind are so similar to actual folk acts, the film leaves the realm of satire and becomes emulation. With Guffman and Show, Guest mocked his characters unmercifully. In Wind, he parody's his subject matter so closely, Wind fails to be consistently funny. This is especially true during the reunion concert, which takes on the personality of an actual concert rather than a satire of one. Even the music itself bares an uncanny resemblance to authentic folk music; the songs are catchy and well written but again sound more like actual songs rather than parodies.To be fair, A Mighty Wind does have a few very funny scenes, but for every minute of genuine humor there are ten minutes of dead air. Wind is the type of film which keeps you grinning, but only seldom evokes laughter and is easily forgotten after you exit the theater. Ultimately, Guest just seems too fond of his characters to lampoon them effectively and create good satire. The community actors in Guffman were absurdly incompetent, the dog owners in Show were ridiculously serious. The musicians in Wind know they're just innocuous nostalgia acts and have no pretense about it. Consequently, Wind just doesn't have the sharp wit of Guffman and Show. A Mighty Wind is more pseudo-documentary than comedy, or more accurately, a mockumentary sans the mock.Rating: 2.5 out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Mighty Wind, a mockumentary look at a reunion of 3 Folk Music groups after a legendary producer passes away, comes from the same team that put together Best In Show and Waiting For Guffman in the past years. If you see this, prepare to miss some dialogue due to how much you will laugh. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer steal the show as The Folksmen. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara (Jerry and Cookie from Best in Show) portray a duet that is irresistably impossible not to find a perfect match. And finally a group of 9 make up a regrouping of a classic folk group, The New Main Street Singers.Fred Willard is gifted to say the least, how he can improvise these ideas is beyond me. There is just too much to list about how funny each character was. Those who speak some Yiddish (like me) will find an additional comedic genius to this movie from Ed Begley Jr. who throws in some phrases that had me laughing for minutes at a time.I was lucky enough to see this movie at an Advance Screening through a friend of mine, and when it opens in actual theaters I will be sure to be back again. A Mighty movie, to say the last. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Start off by saying that I am a big fan of "This is Spinal Tap" and "Waiting for Guffman", but I thought "Best in Show" was over the top. I was happy to see that Christopher Guest returned to his slightly more subtle comedy roots for this one. Guest is a master of weaving a bunch of comedy sketches together to form a story. To really appreciate the humor your mind has to be sharp as you quickly combine the visual with the dialogue of the quite quirky characters. "A Mighty Wind" adds the dimension of song lyrics just to keep us on our toes. Collaborative efforts seem to work best as when Guest joins with (Spinal Tap buds) Shearer and McKean as a twisted Peter Paul &amp; Mary trio. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara are so close to reality at times that you feel guilty laughing. Simply hilarious is the scene where Jane Lynch and John Michael Higgins are interviewed and discuss their stories on what got them involved with folk music and each other. The brilliant Larry Miller teams with Jennifer Coolidge for a funny scene explaining the importance of good PR. Individual kudos to Bob Balaban, Parker Posey and especially Ed Begley, jr. As usual, Fred Willard jumps off the screen, but does seem to be a 5th wheel in this film. Something tells me Fred Willard is quite comfortable in his role as 5th wheel! Film probably could have used a little more flashback material, but overall a very funny movie with some brilliant touches from the talented Christopher Guest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that, perhaps those who were offended by this film's treatment of folk music may have taken the film a tad too seriously. I have relatives who were good friends of Pete Seeger and the other Weavers, yet I thought this film was hilarious. Almost every facet of life has something that can be poked fun at, and Christopher Guest and his ensemble have an excellent knack for finding something worth lampooning in just about any situation. I think my favorite characters were the Bohners (of the New Main Street Singers) and Lars, the Swedish-born public television executive who tosses around Yiddishisms better than most native NY-ers.I loved Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show, but A Mighty Wind is now my favorite.Bravo to one and all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third in Christopher Guest's mockumentary series (Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show), or fourth, if you count This Is Spinal Tap, is A Mighty Wind. It's the funniest and the best out of the four.A Mighty Wind basically revolves around three folk bands. The Folksmen consist of Alan Barrows (Christopher Guest), Jerry Palter (Michael McKean), and Mark Shubb (Harry Shearer), and they are laid back and comfortable. Mitch and Mickey was a duet with Mitch Cohen (Eugene Levy) and Mickey Crabbe (Catherine O'Hara), and Mitch was just released from a mental hospital, but he may not be fully healed. The New Main Street Singers are a cult-like group of nine or so. Some members include Terry and Laurie Bohner (John Michael Higgins, Jane Lynch) and Sissy Knox (Parker Posey). The son of Irving Steinbloom, a concert promoter with a penchant for folk music, named Jonathan Steinbloom (Bob Balaban), decides to have a reunion show for these three bands to memorialize his recently deceased father.Obviously, it has a lot of improv, but it was hilarious. The Folksmen's first record didn't have a hole in center, making it `hard to center, but you could poke a hole in it if you wanted.' Many other times had me laughing so hard that I almost fell on the floor. I found that Fred Willard was the funniest (`Wha' happened?'), but I also really liked the Folksmen and Mickey. Mitch didn't do anything for me. He didn't make me laugh that much, and if I did, it was for what else happened in the scene (like at the hotel).Balaban probably has the most screen time (and a larger role than his roles in other Guest movies). He was worrying over every little thing (such as thorny plants may injure guests), and he was very funny. Balaban proved that he could lead a movie. Guest, McKean, and Shearer were quite funny, especially when Shearer, who doesn't talk much, got in a little bit of improv. I liked the songs they sing, such as `Eat at Joe's'. O'Hara was very funny, and I like seeing her act. Levy was good at acting, but he didn't make me laugh much. Everyone else was funny.Like all of the other Guest movies, there's a giant, climactic scene (the musical in Waiting for Guffman, the dog show in Best In Show), and this one is very good, at the reunion show. We hear a lot of the songs, and they're very funny. I wonder if everyone did their own singing. I would bet so. Something I like about Guest movies is that there can be a lot packed into a little amount of time. 90 minutes can hold lots of humor, character development, and more musical numbers than most musicals. The time seems longer than usual, because most of the movie is talking, but it is still fascinating. I would like to see more people try the mockumentary genre; although none can do it was well as the almighty Guest.My rating: 9/10Rated PG-13 for sex-related humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mighty Funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what has, not atypically, been a dismal year thus far for films, Christopher Guest's "A Mighty Wind" stands out like a rose in a trash pile. Another of Guest's "Spinal Tap"-style pseudodocumentaries, this film, about a reunion of once-popular folk musicians for a special concert, is funnier than the previous dog-show mock-doc "Best In Show", but is also surprisingly heartfelt, building a gentle feeling of good cheer that stays with you long after the final song fades out.Folk impresario Irving Steinbloom is dead, and his emotionally stunted son Jonathan (an slightly Woody Allenesque Bob Balaban) has planned a grand memorial for him: a concert broadcast on public TV live from New York's immortal Town Hall. He pulls together some of the most beloved acts of the mid-sixties folk heyday, including the old-fashioned Folksmen and the homogenized, creepily cultlike New Main Street Singers. But there's a wild card in the mix, and his name is Mitch (Eugene Levy). Formerly one half of the beloved romantic singing duo Mitch and Mickey, the singer / guitarist suffered a mental collapse after an mid-performance kiss with Mickey (Catherine O'Hara) on a TV show came to nothing, and has to be coaxed into doing the concert like a yogi being soothed into walking on hot coals. Now a zonked-out shell of a man with a weirdly clipped way of speech and nervous, dizzy eyes, Mitch finally agrees to take the stage with Mickey...but will the kiss that captivated America be repeated?A concert in honor of a dead man, emotional anguish, a yearning for a furtive kiss...doesn't sound like laff riot material, does it? But Guest and his hugely talented cast pull it off. Virtually all the actors from "Best In Show" are here; the company, in addition to those named above, includes Michael Hitchcock, Jane Lynch, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, Parker Posey, John Michael Higgins, Ed Begley Jr., Fred Willard, Paul Dooley, Jennifer Coolidge, and Guest himself as a banjo-playing wiggly-voiced Folksman. This is the director's third film with this talented repertory, and the actors, largely improvising from a scenario created by Guest and Levy, throw themselves into the material with gusto, creating characters who provoke effortless laughs and left me with a giddy smile on my face through the whole film. Knowing that the most effective comedy, no matter how outrageous the laughs, often proceeds from a firm bedrock in reality, these performers wisely do not push their admittedly caricatured creations into cartoon territory, keeping them just grounded enough so we can laugh in recognition at the bizarre vicissitudes of human nature as much as in disbelief at their silliness.Naturally, with such an enormous cast, there are bound to be a few standouts. Willard, whose dimwitted dog-show announcer was the comic highlight of "Best In Show", steals scenes as the New Main Street Singers' boorish manager, former star of an obnoxious sitcom called "Wha' Happened?" (canceled due to "total lack of interest", according to "Variety"). Begley is amusing as a Swedish TV producer with a penchant for Yiddish phrases, and Hitchcock has some fine verbal duels with Balaban as the Town Hall rep putting the concert together. All these performers score laughs, but Coolidge, as a feather-brained PR agent, delivers an offhand remark about model trains that had me worried I'd lose the rest of the scene's dialogue under all the laughter in the theatre (some of it admittedly mine).Still, it's Levy's performance as Mitch that will stay with me the longest, as the actor, in the midst of a career renaissance, turns in a characterization that's almost Chaplinesque in its deft combination of humor and pathos. Mitch is a man whose unrequited love for his former musical partner has broken his brain, and it's honestly touching to see the poor man wandering the streets in lovelorn confusion, sitting in his drab hotel room as he listens to the enthusiastic sex of the people in the next room, and wistfully recalling the story of how he and Mickey first met. O'Hara matches him with her own frustration at his daffy lovesickness, but when the two of them get onstage to sing at the end of the long concert sequence that concludes the film, I was amazed to find that I was just as anxious as the film's characters about whether or not that famous kiss was going to happen again.Guest is by now an old hand with this documentary-style storytelling, and he thankfully does not cram the form down our throats with scripted narration or a constantly darting handheld camera. There are a few nicely recreated period-era stills and some great old pastiche TV footage (I especially liked the chintzy hearts-and-clouds set Mitch and Mickey performed on back in the sixties), but for the most part, Guest's most utilized documentary device is talking-head interviews, which would run the risk of bringing the film to a grinding halt if the dialogue within didn't contain some of the movie's biggest laughs. Fred Willard sitting at a desk talking in this film drew more solid laughs from me than all the slapstick gags in the amusing but problematic "Anger Management".In a further testament to the talent of his cast, all the songs in "A Mighty Wind" have been written and performed by the actors themselves. Folk music fans will of course find the most to appreciate here, but even if the stuff makes your teeth grind, you'll likely find something here easy on your ears. Among the film's musical standouts are the New Main Street Singers' rendition of the hard-luck manifesto "Wanderin'", the Folksmen's jaunty "Old Joe's Place", and of course, Mitch and Mickey's signature tune, the really quite lovely "A Kiss At The End of the Rainbow". Honestly, most of the music here is more pleasant than funny, but the final line of the film's title song more than makes up for it.Warner Bros. wisely chose to release "A Mighty Wind" at an off-time of year, before the loud FX onslaught of summer and the heavy hammering of the weighty Oscar-bait fall releases. Indeed, spring seems like a perfect time for such a light, sweet, touching film, and especially considering the drecky leftovers that often glut the theatres at this time of year, a truly enjoyable picture like "A Mighty Wind" is all the more welcome. No matter what the release date, though, this film is a real treat, a lot of laughs, a perfect date movie. At least I think it would be; I'd have to go back with a date to be sure. And I figure if Mitch and Mickey don't get her ready for that good-night kiss, nothing will.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most of the strange troup from "Best of Show" is back for another assault on the absurdity of American culture! This time out it is the folk music craze of the late '50's early 60's. The film catches the faux intellectualism that was associated with the folk music scene and lampoons it mightedly with a mix of off the wall folk music "hits" and wacky folk music performers. The story revolves around the reunion of three old folk music acts that gather to reprise their music at a tribute for their recently deceased mentor. Eugene Levy must be seen to be believed as a burnt out folkie! If you liked Best of Show and Guffman you will definately want to see A Mighty Wind"!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With "A Mighty Wind," Christopher Guest shows that he can consistently create what today is a rarity: a comedy that is actually funny. That he does so using the same troupe of actors in each film just adds to the wonder and enjoyment.Audiences accustomed to humor involving oversexed teens and immoral acts with pies might have difficulty adjusting to the understated tone of humor in Guest's trio of mockumentaries. The laughs come not from outrageous situations, but from watching and listening to quirky, only slightly exaggerated characters interact in their own little specialized worlds: small-town theater, championship dog shows, and now folk music.We can laugh at the characters in these films, but it's a laugh of familiarity. We know these people. We may even be these people. The laughter that comes brings just the barest hint of discomfort, for we know we all might appear just as ridiculous if Guest's cameras followed us around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Mighty Wind" is the latest "mockumentary" to come from Christopher Guest, which includes many cast members from his previous movies, "Waiting For Guffman," "Best In Show," and even "This Is Spinal Tap." And out of all four movies mentioned above, "A Mighty Wind" is the best of them all! It centers around a concert that brings together three folk singing groups: the jolly, laid-back Folksmen, the strained sweetheart duo Mitch and Mickey, and the cult-like New Main Street Singers. This movie has a lot of good laughs. Fred Willard's performance as the manager of the New Main Street Singers is particularly hilarious! Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara also put in good performances as Mitch and Mickey. There is a bittersweet tension between them that builds up until their performance of "A Kiss At the End of the Rainbow," which gives the song a tear-jerking edge. All the music in "A Mighty Wind" is fun listening. I myself felt like clapping along to "Old Joe's Place." On a personal note, I have seen the original Folksmen sketch when it aired on "Saturday Night Live" in 1984. It fascinates me that it would lead to this great movie! "A Mighty Wind" shows how Christopher Guest and his troupe have come, and makes me look forward to their next project!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess these people are basically like a theatre company now, and of all their productions this one seemed kind of the measliest. The movie acts as though it's "above" jokes, but then it'll make a really broad, tacky joke about incontinence or someone with te last name "bohner" which sounds like--teehee! I liked watching them play instruments, and I felt like the Eugene Levy-Catherine O'Hara story had potential which it didn't really realize. These people have an interesting process for making movies, but that doesn't excuse the film's many faults, nor should they want it to. I saw this to be entertained and not merely a witness to some kind of creative history or something. Not very funny, not very touching, not all that "mighty." The women were better than the men, by and large.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a lover and, I daresay, an expert on folk music of all ages. Needless to say, I was thrilled to overhear others at my workplace mention that a movie about the folk movement of the early 1960s A.D. was about to be distributed to major theaters.Could Hollywood have finally realized the magnetism of folk music to children and adults alike? Finally realizing that money can be made on such a venture?But, I was devestated when I saw the result. I should have realized what the glossy producers of Tinseltown would do the music of Everytown.First of all, the music was terrible. The supposed "hit" from this film is a one "Eat at Joe's". Yet, as you can probably guess from the title, this song was so riddled with cliche (I apologize for being unable to determine how to type the necessary accent mark for the "e" of cliche). Several in the theater even laughed out loud at the gall at which these Hollywood song writers took every Limeliter nuance and cheapened it for mass consumption. They did this to the Serendipity Singers and the Brexton Boys as well.The movie itself was also terribly confusing. No narration and the actors literally looking into the camera and stammering. I'm not stupid. I understand the theatrical concept of breaking the fourth wall. But, that is not what was being done here.I'm not stupid, I realize that these characters all were really, in essence, symbols of real performers. (However, Hollywood didn't use their real names so that they could force them all into this sort of Fantasy Football for Folk Fans without being sued by various estates. I'm not stupid.) I knew who each performer was supposed to be. I even know some who were not portrayed in the movie.The worst performance Oscar, if they still give it out at that putrid show, was M. Harry Shearer's portrayal of the Johnny Cash character. The deep singing voice he strained to achieve being the only component at all indicative of M. Cash. The actor's speaking voice, look, style of music, the instrument he played and his story in this movie were all completely not that of the Man in Blakc. Terrible.M. Guest, I have one suggestion. Stick to comedy. The musical parody and the dog show films were very enjoyable, I must say. Stick to joke writing and stay away from folk music. For you ruin it by trying to popularize it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director Christopher Guest leads a hand-picked cast of improv veterans through the story of the planning and preparation of a folk reunion show. The three bands include The Folksmen (displaying shades of the Kingston Trio), The New Main Street Singers (an obvious parody of the New Christie Minstrels) and the utterly brilliant folk duo, Mitch and Mickey.Fans of Guest's other films 'Best In Show' and 'Waiting For Guffman' will be feel at home with the documentary-style filmmaking and quick, clever comedy. The characters are funny, dysfunctional, and realistic.A Mighty Wind is one of the finest moments that improvisational comedy has ever seen.

		<fullReview>Christopher Guest's 'A Mighty Wind' is a follow up to the brilliant 'Waiting For Guffman' and the wonderfully funny 'Best in Show'. With 'Guffman' he focused on the obsession of small timers trying to become big timers and in 'Show' he focused on sadistic men and women trying to live viscously threw their pets. Though this time he tackles a much more light-hearted topic, folk music, the laughs never stop.Do to the the recent death of a famous concert promoter, Jonathan Steinbloom (Bob Balaban) decides to honor him, his father, by holding a reunion of all the great folk bands of the 1960's.There is a great talent on display here. Watching Guest, Shearer and McKean up on screen was quite gratifying. Seeing these men perform together is like watching jazz-improvisation; the jokes and lines come out of left field and when some one hits a bad note, some one's right their to fall back on. And it some scenes, it comes quite apparent that these men are great musicians as well as comedians. Catheron O'Hara and Eugene Levy play the once husband and wife group, Mitch and Midge. The scenes with them are funny but mostly very subtle and sometimes quite sad. And of course, Fred Willard is back and proves once again that he is possibly the funniest man on earth. The rest of the players, too many to list, all do an excellent job.If there's a flaw in the film, it is that there just isn't enough of it. Such characters as Sissy Knox (Parker Posey) should have been given more screen time and structure. This is a 100-minute film squeezed into an 80 minute one.****1/2 (Out of 5)</fullReview>

Also of note are the performances of Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, although all the performances are never less then excellent. Mr. Levy, in particular, deserves praise for his incredibly affected performance as Mitch Cohen. I couldn't help laughing whenever he spoke.

		<shortDescription>A MIGHTY WIND-- terrific fun at so many levels!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A MIGHTY WIND, a film from director Christopher Guest and his talented ensemble of improvisational players (Guest himself, Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard, etc.) is both delightful and disturbing, but on balance I enjoyed it very much. It is not so much a send-up/spoof of folk music as it is a (mostly) successful attempt to find the funny, ridiculous, and perverse foibles of any people who are passionate about something and found-- however briefly-- even moderate success with their passion. The MIGHTY WIND experience is unique. So much so that there is really nothing to compare it with, and my evaluation reflects my being tremendously impressed, perhaps more than its actual overall accomplishment (although it is quite good). There will be a tendency to compare it with THIS IS SPINAL TAP (where Guest, Shearer, and McKean first impersonated a musical trio), and also to Guest's other two `mockumentaries'-WAITING FOR GUFFMAN and BEST IN SHOW. Such comparisons are not really apropos. While the style and format of all these films may be the similar, and while they may share many of the same brilliant cast members, in substance A MIGHTY WIND is, indeed, a different piece of work. The film is certainly another "mockumentary", but by definition this is simply a mock documentary, not necessarily a mocking one. Indeed, the satire is pointed, but fairly gentle, and there is about the whole experience as much the quality of a tribute as there is of comedy. Guest et al seem to enjoy the folk music genre, and, unlike BEST IN SHOW, they often find themselves laughing with it, not at it. What makes it all work are the songs. The creators (Guest, Levy, et al) have gone out of their way to fashion a credible backstory, complete with truly original songs written for the film, which are. performed (sung AND played, often live) by the actors who play The Folksmen (based on a bizarre combination of The Kingston Trio, Limeliters, Brothers Four, Cumberland Three, Highwaymen, Tarriers, Brandywine Singers, etc.), The New Main Street Singers (a very loose mix of the New Christy Minstrels, Back Street Majority, Serendipity Singers, Seekers et al), and Mitch &amp; Micky (who owe a lot to Ian &amp; Sylvia, with a dose of John &amp; Michelle Phillips thrown in). Still, none of these comparisons can be made too literally, as all are leavened by a dose of the creators' unique sense of humor.The songs themselves are worth listening to. Of course they are parodies. Anyone familiar with the 60s folk genre has but to listen carefully to the lyrics. But they are performed so sincerely, so seriously, that at first you don't notice: you just enjoy the pleasant, somewhat nostalgic harmonies. When you finally figure it out, the straightforward (nothing coy or wink-wink about it) presentation makes it all so much more effective and brilliant. They are also good songs which perfectly capture the special sound of each particular group or style they are trying to evoke, and they are all the funnier for the sincerity of their performance. The performers are obviously enjoying themselves, and so will the audience.Parts of the movie are hilarious, other parts perhaps a tad stereotypical and maybe even offensive. But as a creative exercise that will introduce more people to the essence of folk music's popular heyday, it is definitely worth seeing (and hearing). Folk music in this country is centuries old, and the movement continues to this day. It was only during the Great Depression, however, that it began to assert itself as `popular music', represented by pioneer performers such as Woody Guthrie. In the 40s, the Almanac Singers featuring Guthrie were among the first of the popular folk groups, exemplified by The Weavers during the 1950s. Social commentary and protest was as much a part of folk music as entertainment, and Bob Dylan continued that emphasis into the 1960s. But in the early part of that effervescent decade, folk music exploded as an incredibly popular and commercial force, represented by groups like The Kingston Trio, The Highwaymen, The New Christy Minstrels, and Peter, Paul, &amp; Mary-all of whom (along with others) charted number one hits and found themselves more than once in the top twenty. This `Great Folk Scare' (as the rock n'roll community labeled it) did not last long. Bob Dylan and the Byrds electrified folk, while The Mamas &amp; The Papas carried the sound to new and different heights. Except for The Limeliters singing `Things go better with Coke', folk music no longer was in the commercially popular spotlight, but it did not go away. In various permutations, The Kingston Trio, Highwaymen, Limeliters, Brothers Four, New Christy Minstrels, and Peter, Paul &amp; Mary continue to perform today, and while they still sing the old songs well, they are not content to rest on their laurels, but are always open to new songs and original music. In addition, new folksingers have emerged on the scene, keeping the medium vibrant and alive. A MIGHTY WIND recaptures the glory years of commercial folk popularity in the early 60s. It recognizes the differences that existed even then-between songs with a message and songs that sell, and between traditional style and more crowd-pleasing entertainment. All of that is brought into today, using established venues such as New York's Town Hall and recognizable references such as Public Broadcasting, while skewering pretension with such players as Fred Willard, Jennifer Coolidge, and Ed Begley, Jr. (a Swedish Yiddisher?) leading the way. The balance struck between the extreme and the sincere is what makes a MIGHTY WIND, with its intentionally effective original music, so compelling and delightful. Since so few good original songs are written for films these days (particularly songs which have anything to do with the film itself) it wouldn't surprise me if a song or two from A MIGHTY WIND found itself/themselves nominated for the Best Song Academy Award. My Oscar recommendation goes to "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow". But you see it and decide for yourself. If I have one strong objection to this film, it is that it is too short, with not enough made of certain dynamite characters (Parker Posey's for one, and Jennifer Coolidge's for another: although they are perfect). Guest recognizes Willard and Begley as his comic center and Levy and O'Hara as his dramatic center, and this gives the film a narrative focus that some of his other works have lacked. Still, I kept hoping for more. You will too, I think. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good but not the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>as a rather violent fan of both Spinal Tap and Best in Show, perhaps i went into this with unrealistic expectations. don't get me wrong, "a mighty wind" does deliver a few excellent moments, both through the beauty of editing and through the talented actors. the issue really seems to lie with the pacing. there are extended periods of time where nothing really funny happens, and if it weren't for my faith in christopher guest i would have gotten bored. in particular, the "folksmen," the band featuring the spinal tap boys - Guest, McKean and Shearer - are probably the least entertaining. it is eugene levy who really saves the movie with his staggered delivery and bizarre eccentricities. the other scene-stealers are kept in too limited a role too: fred willard is spectacular, as is parker posey and the women with the strange lips who played the "glamorous" lesbian in Best in Show. overall, the movie does have a lot of great moments, but it almost seems to caught up in its own plot to be as outrageously funny as Best in Show. nonetheless, the novelty of the "mockumentary" makes it a worthwhile watch and you'll still enjoy yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is not as good as Guest's other films. While performances are great, and comedy is funny -- and Guest is brilliant at multiple characters and complicated storylines refreshing these days) -- the music is not really folk music, and I think it's completely off the mark here. Working in that scene and knowing how much can be made fun of, I found it really disappointing that Guest, normally so super-smart on his incisive looks into groups, just missed it here. A lot of the satire is just about weird people, not about the folk or old-timey music culture specifically (could be about anyone who's just weird). The music subject doesn't seem clear, calling it "folk music," but instead using some of the old-timey music culture instead. Ultimately, a few characters were terrific (Mitch and Mickey) for satire on the folk music culture specifically, but the others are diffused or playing other kinds of music -- and that's as if Spinal Tap had played Rolling Stones or Cream tunes -- just "off." The actors are generally terrific, particularly Michael McKean and (I don't know her name) the blond singer into color worship. I just felt that they were having such a good time doing "funny" things that they lost sight of what it was all about instead, and that left me feeling somewhat entertained, but sometimes feeling like it's oh so easy to point and laugh at people. The best satire of this kind also makes you respect or feel for the characters -- and I wish Guest had just gone that extra step as he has in the past.</fullReview>

Fortunately, you don't need to have been there to enjoy this film.A Mighty Wind is a mock documentary about three imaginary folk music groups who were big in 1960. Forty years later, they are reunited to perform in a concert in memory of their producer.The film has relatively few "in jokes" about the folk scene -- the humor stands on its own. I and the other audience members were frequently taken by surprise and added our own laugh track.Besides the intelligent humor, this film has a lot of heart. I found myself really caring for the characters. The acting is excellent. There were some very clever song parodies as well as some beautiful lyrics and melodies. Of course, it helps if you like the folk music sound -- acoustic guitars and vocals, some with very nice harmonies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Likable but not hilarious.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fierce devotee of "Spinal Tap" and the previous Christopher Guest/Eugene Levy forays, I was extremely excited for this film. I won't say I was disappointed exactly, but it wasn't what I expected."Spinal Tap," "Guffman" and "Best in Show" are packed to the gills with laughs--enough to bring you to tears. "Mighty Wind" is full of...smiles. Catherine O'Hara's subtle, gentle comic hand makes you smile. Bob Balaban's wimpy earnestness makes you smile. Guest, Shearer and McKean's good-natured dorkiness makes you smile. But little outside of Fred Willard's inspired comic-hack-turned-manager makes you explode in laughter like the other films did on a regular basis.On the one hand, you could argue that this type of humor has caught up to Guest, Levy and their stable. They've become SO subtle, SO lifelike, SO dry that the laughs have drained out of the party. On the other hand, this is still so warm and entertaining and REAL that it's hard to complain. Plus, breaking out of the laugh-a-minute constraints of total comedy allows for some nice depth. The romantic tension between Levy and O'Hara is more successful on a serious level than pretty much any element of "Guffman" or "Best in Show."The music is good, too--maybe too good for the purpose. Spinal Tap was able to be funny with surprisingly solid musicianship. But Spinal Tap wrote goofy songs, while the Folksmen's on-screen run-through of "Never Did No Wanderin'" actually chills you to the bone. And, okay, I'm gonna admit it--I wanted to cry during O'Hara and Levy's song. Again, I'm still trying to work out in my head whether all this is good or not. What I can say is that this is definitely worth seeing, and that Guest and Levy refuse to sit still and do what's expected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's more than just a "mockumentary"--and works fine on that level, too.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now, it's fair to say that Christopher Guest and his associates have developed a genre of their own. He and Eugene Levy have assembled a very talented ensemble and written a marvelous script that allows most, if not all, of the performers to score plenty of legitimate points. I was in college when the commercial folk music mania reached its peak, when almost everyone knew how to play 3 guitar chords and sing simple harmonies, and every college had its own version of the Kingston Trio--though, usually not as talented. Without in any way trivializing or putting down the many positive aspects of American traditional music, this movie shows that there was plenty from that era that merited some gentle mockery. To get specific is to risk scattering spoilers everywhere, so I'll confine myself to saying that the songs-written for the most part by performers in the film--are marvelous examples of self-enchanted kitschy claptrap, with some great double entendres here and there, and that the acting, which ranges from restrained and subtle to over-the-top is excellent. Special praise should go to Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, whose work as the due of Mitch and Mickey is not only funny, but provides a sweet and touching note as well. I look back fondly on that time and that music, even the kitschy elements of it. AMW doesn't disrespect the music or the time, despite what a few writers have claimed. It was a delight from beginning to end, and if the end seemed to come too soon...well, it's a hell of a lot better than an ending which comes way too late. See this, by all means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guest and Levy have yet again mined comic gold. Like all of their previous films, (Best In Show, Waiting for Guffman, etc) A Mighty Wind was not disappointing. From the very beginning of the film with Bob Balaban speaking, to the "surprise" Folksmen ending, I was constantly laughing. However, I give you one warning: do not get a large drink, as you may be threatened with the possibility of walking out of the theatre with wet pants. I do believe, like Best In Show, that Fred Willard stole the show. Playing Mike LaFontaine, an eccentric manager of the Main Street Singers, Willard comes up with crazy thoughts and ideas throughout the film. Overall, this is a 5 Star film, and hats off to Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy and the entire cast of A Mighty Wind.</fullReview>

All the elements are there, but the milquetoast world of Folk Music doesn't have the punch of Rock and Roll, the ironic characters of a dog show or the ridiculousness of a local play troupe. Eugene Levys character is downright disturbing and the music isn't really that funny. On its own it is hilarious. But it is hard to watch it and not compare it to the aforementioned three films for all the obvious reasons. Its to bad, because it is being compared to the best comedies of all time-argueably.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Helps If You Were There (the 60s)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some critics are taking Christopher Guest's latest send-up, "A Mighty Wind," his "mockumentary," far too seriously. What we have here is a spoof of the late 1950s and 1960s folk song revival and hootenanny movement. It brought all manner of folk singers - excellent, good and not too infrequently, bad - to darkened clubs where underage kids were served beer, to folk fests and to national TV. In New York City, Gerde's Folk City in the Village was the movement's iconic representation and counterparts existed in most major cities and, especially, university towns. Guest (writer, director and actor) uses the documentary interview style to parade a bunch of has-beens from the Great Age of Folk Music who come together for the kind of nostalgic concert that too often features cracked voices pealing out signature songs. Preparation for the concert - a memorial to a hootenanny impresario staged by his neurotic son in New York City's venerable and gorgeous Town Hall - introduces a bunch of former singers who would be best served by enjoying dwindling royalties while staying off any stage.Some of the singers have settled into comfortable lives. One is a pill popper, a caricature of his former stage self. Others hunger for a moment of fame and recognition. A few young folks have resurrected the name of a once hot group (hint: ever hear of the real New Christy Minstrels?) and they perform in venues not associated with the folk renaissance of the 60s - like theme parks.Yeah, the humor gets a bit repetitious and the Nordic producer who relates all his feelings employing Yiddish won't be understood in most of the country but that's no problem because this film isn't going anywhere except big city theatres and not for long at that either.Today's Upper West Side audience was more or less divided between young folks and old geezers of my generation who used to buy LPs of the top singers and spend scarce dollars on concerts by Joan Baez, Judy Collins and a scraggly young guy who seemed to need a bath - Bob Dylan. Remember how the Gross National Product went up 2% solely because of the purchase of guitars by people under 20?The young laughed at the odd lyrics written for this film and the weird personalities portrayed. But those of us in the know howled at the representation of such once vaunted superstars as Peter, Paul and Mary, Ian and Sylvia, the Kingston Trio and the aforementioned New Christy Minstrels.Anyone can enjoy "A Mighty Wind" but if hootenannies were once your thing, listen carefully to the lyrics. We're the generation who now laugh at the film send-up of the movement that we once thought was the apex of meaningful music (at least those of us not fortunate enough to have discovered leider before shanties).Parker Posey, Queen of the Indies, is appealingly cute but this extraordinarily talented actress should have far more solid roles than what she has here. It's way past time for mainstream producers and directors to latch on to this fine actress for major projects.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Christopher Guest troupe makes another great one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let's get one thing out of the way. I was born in 1984. My only connection to folk music was that my father was John Denver's photographer.Even though I didn't come within two decades of experiencing the heyday of folk music, I thought this movie was hilarious. Christopher Guest has found his niche and made himself quite comfortable. For those of you who don't know, Christopher Guest's films are very low budget documentary-style comedies shot with cheap 16mm hand-held cameras. Guest picked up this technique from Rob Reiner, whose 1984 film "This is Spinal Tap" made Guest a star. The result looks oddly authentic, like an actual documentary, but the entire content of it tells you it's a joke, which makes it funnier.The characters are all brilliantly conceived and executed as usual by the talented comedy troupe, consisting of Guest, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael Hitchcock, Jennifer Coolidge, Fred Willard, Bob Balaban, Ed Begley Jr, Harry Shearer, Don Lake, Michael McKean, and John Michael Higgins.The folk music sounds very authentic, and the characters are nothing short of hilarious. "The Folksmen", consisting of Guest, Shearer, and McKean, are brilliant as a hillbilly trio. Jennifer Coolidge and Fred Willard always steal the show, and this is no exception. Coolidge plays a spanish woman with the IQ of a Venus' Flytrap, whose insight on model trains is nothing short of gut-busting. Fred Willard's obnoxious humor is always a hoot, although Willard doesn't tear it up the way he did in Best in Show. Speaking of which, John Michael Higgins is a bit distracting onscreen as a straight man, as he will always be that flamboyant homosexual from Best in Show in my mind.The best performance comes from Eugene Levy. He gets so deep into his burnt-out hippie character, you really feel empathetic for him. It's simply brilliant.All in all, this is a terrific film that is well worth seeing, although it doesn't quite touch the sheer genius that was Best in Show.8.5/10</fullReview>

Great writing, think Spinal Tap, but with folk singers. I would bet that most of Eugene Levy's stuff was improv, you just can't write dialogue like that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris Guest's humor might be too intelligent and subtle for some mainstreammoviegoers, but even mainstream fans of bad 60's folk music will be able tosense the affection this gifted movie maker has for his latest subculture. The big surprise in this film is that it's not just funny. There are sad and poignant moments that will surprise fans of Guest's former films, Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show. "A Mighty Wind" looks at music making and music celebrity on a number of levels, some of thm funny, some of them not. That Guest can make us laugh and cry in the same hour and 27 minutes is a rare and precious talent.The film brings together all the usual suspects of Guest's former films; Catherine O'Hara deserves an award for her performance (and I hope the studiocampaigns to get her one) as Mickey, the female half of a romantic 60s folks duo called "Mitch &amp; Mickey"; Eugene Levy creates yet another of his uniquecharacters for film, this one a musical mental patient whose conversation and facial expressions are rarely in sync; Jennifer Coolidge steals with movie as Amber Cole, a public relations flak who dresses like an Austrailian's nightmare and talks like a cross between a Swedish porn star and Jennifer Lopez; andJohn Michael Higgins gets to showcase his musical staging talents, not just his dead--on drag queen (or princess) .This is a movie that all Guest film fans will be eagerly awaiting on DVD Then we'll get to see the wonderful scenes that were cut and we'll get to watch for all the embedded Guest jokes that can be picked out in props, costumes andcharacter movement.And for those who've seen "A Mighty Wind" already, buy the soundtrack. Itincludes a priceless music video from Mitch and Mickey that's not in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not as funny as "Guffman," but with considerably more heart, this affectionate and gentle film in the now-familiar Guest style lampoons both the folkies of the sixties and the nostalgia of the 2000's.All your favorite performers from "Best in Show" return, and again Guest has wisely taken a smaller role on screen in order to have more control behind the camera. All the performances are rich and funny, but the film belongs heart &amp; soul to Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara.They play a former duet known as "Mitch and Mickey" - imagine Leonard Cohen paired with Joan Baez - whose relationship deteriorated thirty years ago. Levy is both sweet and shrewd as a visionary burnout and O'Hara is simply amazing. The film is largely the story of their reconciliation, a subtle blend of comedy and genuine emotion that builds to a beautiful climax.Fans of "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best in Show" will certainly get some solid belly laughs out this film, but as Levy and Guest grow as filmmakers, they are moving past satire and into something with greater depth. So don't be surprised if you get a little choked up, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Face it, if movies were graded on a curve, any Christopher Guest offering would be at least a letter grade better than any other comedy out there. Is A Mighty Wind the best/worst of the three mockumentaries? Who knows? Who cares? I had a hard time hearing all the jokes over the laughter at the packed Uptown Theater in Minneapolis, where people waited in line in 30-degree weather with gusty winds (appropriately enough) on opening night. The premise and performances are once again outstanding. I disagree with the handful of critics who have said Fred Willard is off-pitch in this movie. He's hysterical as usual. In fact, he gives the movie the occasional pick-me-up it needs. If I had any criticism, it would be that Eugene Levy's character (not Willard's) doesn't quite hit the mark this time, and that more time and attention should have been given to the songs, which in and of themselves are such brilliant satire, it's scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-acted but disappointing gust of wind from Guest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Mighty Wind isn't as good as Best in Show and is nowhere in the league of Spinal Tap. It felt kind of hacked together. However, A Mighty Wind still proves entertaining. There were a few brilliant moments, but this overdone concept soon gets old and tiring.AMW reprises nearly the entire cast of Best in Show. Part of the humor is seeing these same actors in different roles, but still playing very similar to their BIS characters. If you see BIS first it will probably make this movie more entertaining.Highlights include Eugene Levy (who co-wrote the screenplay w.Guest) as Mitch, a mentally disturbed former folk-star w.his ex amour Mickie (Levy's frequent and perfect foil, Catherine O'Hara) Levy's uptight performance is hilarious and his interaction w.O'Hara provides the film's most comic and touching moments. Also watch for the BIS British dog commentator in a cameo as Mickie's husband. Another highlight is Guest newcomer Ed Begley Jr. as Swedish-born TV producer Lars Olfen, who peppers his comic idealism with countless Yiddish terms. This character is a fantastic addition and Begley's delivery is spot-on. Harry Shearer gets some long-overdue screen-time and notoriety in this film. Shearer, Guest, and Michael McKeon have a Spinal Tap reunion of sorts portraying the reunited folk trio, The Kingsmen. Usually playing third wheel to Guest and McKeon, Shearer gets the most fleshed out and flashy character of the three here. He really distinguishes himself as a comedic force not needing the hijinks of the other two.The great disappointment of this film was that Guest and McKeon really aren't that amusing in themselves. The rest of my qualms lie with the concept, grievously overdone to the point of being (unintentionally &amp; predicably) corny. Giving great importance to the stupid was a once witty and novel, but it just seems cliched here. While Best in Show followed a similar route, it was more original, more amusing, and more meticulously crafted. A Mighty Wind had it's moments; but it felt formulaic and hastily produced. The mockumentary is a genre so overdone that, save exceptional cases, it has lost its excitement and novelty. Guest fans may be a little disappointed, but anyone who isn't well-versed in this formula and the like should be amused by A Mighty Wind. But for Guest at his best, rent Best in Show. And for the ultimate mockumentary, rent Spinal Tap-- it puts all others to shame.Whenever you end up seeing this film, I would keenly advise you to pay attention to the acting, the sometimes amusing dialogue, and the team of Levy and O'Hara-- they are all fantastic and make A Mighty Wind, well, not blow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw "A Mighty Wind" at a 2pm Thursday Matinee in a nearly full auditorium. The audience, like the actors in the film, was populated mostly by white women and men who came of age in the 1950's and '60s. I've never heard an audience quite like this one. The chuckles started even before the opening credits had faded. The chuckles continued virtually nonstop throughout the film, even though there was only one true "kneeslapper" in the film.Although the local critics seemed to be disappointed that the film eschews political statements, the characterizations, especially those of Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, and also Jane Lynch, Parker Posey, and Bob Balaban are so dead-on that I may have to see A Mighty Wind two or three times in order to fully appreciate all the levels upon which it works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you liked "Waiting for Guffman," "Best in Show," or "This is Spinal Tap," you simply can't not see "A Mighty Wind." I drove 100 miles to see it on opening day yesterday, and I'm glad I did. (It's currently only playing in limited release, but is definitely worth seeking out).I thought it was great. I laughed hard and often, especially in the first half of the film. The second half emphasizes the emotional rollercoaster that is Mitch and Mickey (a folk duo played stunningly by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara). It's amazing that in this improv-style, they can make you laugh. but can also make you cry.I'd say joke-for-joke "A Mighty Wind" is not quite as funny as "Best in Show," but it's still the funniest thing I've seen in a long time.Fred Willard has always made me laugh, and he really steals the show again here as he did in "Best in Show." In "A Mighty Wind," he's a has-been tv "star"-turned cruise-ship entertainment promoter who keeps milking his long-since-forgotten tagline, "Wha' happened?" I couldn't stop cracking up whenever he was on the screen.Jennifer Coolidge, the primped owner of Rhapsody in White from "Best in Show" is also hilarious here as half of a PR team promoting the tribute show. "Mmm...model trains. Good thing they had those, or they wouldn't have been able to build the big ones."Catherine O'Hara just about deserves an Oscar nomination for her improvised performance here as Mickey, the lovelorn half of the folk duo Mitch and Mickey. Eugene Levy is great, too, as Mitch. Their history together dating back to the wonderful SCTV really helps add to their effective chemistry here.There's also a lot of great original music in this movie, just about all of it played live in the film by the actors.My only complaint about "A Mighty Wind" is that it's way too short. It's got a running time of about 90 minutes, and there was a lot of funny material from the trailer that's AWOL in the movie. You get a feeling that they really wanted to pare down any extraneous laughs in order to bring the Mitch and Mickey story to center stage. As a result, the other two bands get a little short shrift, and you feel like things are being summarized. It'll be good to see all the unused footage on the DVD.This is a slightly different type of film from Christopher Guest and Eugene Levy. It'll still make you laugh until you cry, but it'll also make you cry...until you laugh again, I guess. Anyway, "change is good," as Harry Shearer says in the film's quirky epilogue. "Change is life."</fullReview>

When she's on screen (all 4.5 seconds) she lights it up! But, I suppose when you're trying to fit hours and hours into 94 minutes, someone's going to get the shaft. I only hope she's more prominent in the next film.The great thing about the music is, as folk music goes, it's actually pretty good stuff. The Soundtrack is a recommended purchase. Crisp recordings, and a bonus video of Mitch &amp; Mickey not used in the film. And the title track is quite infectious, given a couple of listens.</fullReview>

The long-suffering female half of a romantic-folk duo with the crazy male partner? The not-so-clean-cut-and-sunny members of a "New Cristy Minstrels-type" troupe? The most significant kiss in the course of history? The way all of this was presented in a straight documentary form as if all of this was perfectly normal? There were just too many high points and wacky characters to pick anything out. This is something that has to be seen to be believed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most obvious problem with this movie is that it is very funny. This is a problem because the audience laughed so long and hard that significant amounts of dialog were drowned out and could not be heard. For myself, I thought there could have been a little more bite to it all - as in Phil Ochs' fiercely satirical folk song of the period - "Love Me, Love Me, Love Me, I'm a Liberal". I'm not sure why this film followed the path of being so blandly saccharine. That said, I can't remember the last time I laughed so long and hard at a movie - 'til it hurt. That counts for a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christopher Guest and Co. go Double Platinum with A Mighty Wind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was with much excitement that I attended a screening last evening of Christopher Guest's newest "mockumentary." I was not disappointed, and in fact have found a movie which surpasses "Guffman" in its laugh out loud, cheeks hurt, can't catch your breath hilarity.It's worth the trip to the theater if only to see Jennifer Coolidge as Amber Cole utter one of the funniest single lines in the CG canon. The entire ensemble is superb and the laughs come so quickly and often that I have to return to hear the lines that I laughed through on the first viewing. I was a little disappointed that Parker Posey didn't have a bigger part..but was gratified that Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy, as usual, did not disappoint as Mitch and Mickey. Brilliant! Also Jim Piddock (who you'll recognize as the commentator and sidekick of Fred Willard from "Best in Show") as Leonard Crabbe deserves mention as the model train collecting, catheter selling husband of Mickey Crabbe (C. O'Hara). Too funny.I wasn't sure I would find a movie that surpassed "Guffman" as it has always been my favorite. I'll reserve that judgement until some additional viewings of "A Mighty Wind"...but I think it has the timing, ensemble, pacing and laugh per minute ratio that will edge out "Guffman' as my new Christopher Guest favorite.Run, don't walk to see "A Mighty Wind" on April 16.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FORGET the past reviewer! THIS FILM IS HILARIOUS!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I want to start off by bringing up a couple of points...1) Ever since 9/11, comedy has been in higher demand than in previous years. The norm of this country seems to be in the need for a relief after that horrible tragedy and comedy most certainly works in this case. After all, having a good laugh makes one feel better versus being subjected to a depressing drama.2) This is just my personal taste but quite honestly, American comedy films of recent years have been DREADFUL. I'm talking about 85% of comedies released for the past decade. Hardly any of them ever seem to be inspired or original. It almost makes me want to turn to the British, who generally make much wittier comedies.That being said, I think Christopher Guest has proven that he's one of the few exceptions of filmmakers working in America who actually makes comedies that are inspired, instead of raunchy sex stories or tired formulas that seem to recycle one cliché after another. Seeing "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best in Show" made me wonder why there aren't comedies like these opening up every week in our multiplexes. Moments in these films just come straight out of leftfield, versus a comedy such as "American Pie" which you can predict most of what's going on.However, I will go on record and say that "A Mighty Wind" is not only flat out HILARIOUS, it's the best comedy released in the United States since "Best in Show." How ironic that I feel this way for a film that's written and directed by Christopher Guest, as is "Best in Show." Sorry but "Rat Race" is not THAT funny and neither is Scary Movie nor its sequel.Now I did mention that in Christopher Guest's films, there are moments which just come out of leftfield. This is very much the case with "A Mighty Wind." There are lines and moments in this film which you can never expect to happen. What makes them work even better is having a cast of very talented and funny actors. Eugene Levy, Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara, Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, Larry Miller, Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Parker Posey, and so on.I don't want to go into spoilers because I'd rather you see the film for yourself but I shall go into the summary. A folk concert is in the process of being set up in dedication to the recent death of fictional legendary folk singer, Irving Steinbloom. In charge of the project is one of Steinbloom's sons Jonathon (Bob Balaban). The target is to get three groups of folk music singers to perform at the concert. Each of these groups has their own history. The New Main Street Singers are a modernized group of the Main Street Singers, a group whose lead singer (Paul Dooley) ends up being a part of the New Main Street Singers. The Folksmen (Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer in a trio for the first time since This is Spinal Tap!) are to perform for the first time together in years. Unlike the New Main Street Singers, the Folksmen do a lot of their own writing and a lot more improvising. They show a lot more passion for folk singing. Mitch &amp; Mickey (Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara) on the other hand, are a duo singing much like Simon &amp; Garfunkel who divorced long ago and have yet to easily make it to the concert because of Mitch's reluctance to perform again.The highlights of "A Mighty Wind" are as follows...Eugene Levy- This performance is in a complete 360 degree turn than any of his roles in "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best in Show." Playing a singer who has done quite a history of drugs and doesn't speak as quickly as Mickey is quite an achievement. It's more as if Levy is not playing Levy as he has done in previous films. You can hardly recognize him in the makeup.Fred Willard- Just as in "Best in Show," he STEALS this film, portraying Mike LaFontaine, the manager of the New Main Street Singers. Here he brags about a failed sitcom he stared in called "Wha Happened?" and has the idea that maybe the New Main Street Singers could incorporate parts of the show into their act at the upcoming memorial concert. Willard seems to be having the most fun out of anyone in "A Mighty Wind," literally having the best lines.Jennifer Coolidge- I won't go into details about her character Amber Cole but she comes unexpectedly hilarious, much more than she was in "Best in Show."Ed Begley Jr. - If you recall in the trailer, he mentioned, "I made a song that you might have heard of... WHODALEGEDHEDAHOOMEN... which means, how's it hangin' Grandma." Well, if you thought that was funny, wait until you hear the history of Ed Begley Jr's character (forget his name but he's a TV producer) as he's mentioning the song.The most surprising element of this film isn't the fact that it's funny but that the three groups performing actually can sing. Every actor did his/her own singing so when you hear the songs and the lyrics, you're laughing not because of the lyrics but that these singers can actually sing these silly lyrics so well.After seeing "A Mighty Wind," there was just one problem I had with it. It wasn't long enough! Well, that's just a feeling I had because I wanted to see more of these outrageous characters. The 92 minute running time seems appropriate but I desired more. Here's hoping that Christopher Guest's next feature will promise this demand.In the time being, I suggest that you all should take a look at the "A Mighty Wind" website and view several video clips. It may come as a shock to you but none of these clips actually made it into the film. One of these clips you might know from the trailer, where Mike LaFontaine (Fred Willard) spits water out of his mouth right next to Jonathon Steinbloom (Bob Balaban) and says, "Excuse me but I must be full." That clip isn't in fact in the film itself. So the website is a little added bonus.Anyway, that's about all I have to say as far as reviewing "A Mighty Wind." Like I said spoilers will just not make you laugh as much. Even if you find the film to be a disappointment, it's better to say that after seeing a film without spoilers than to be spoiled and then be forced to laugh.I will insist this film is VERY FUNNY. You should be very pleased.Pips Orcille</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Weak Attempt on Guest's Part</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I might not understand folk music as much as I do the world of rock or heavy metal as so perfectly committed in mockumentary form in This Is Spinal Tap, Christopher Guest and co have failed to get the same reaction out of me in this film, neither in concept nor in execution. Concept-wise, the film would work but it seems that the story could have benefited from the direction of someone else other than Christopher Guest, who doesn't manage to pull off the mockumentary look (or flow) like Rob Reiner or others before him have done.Over-acting on the part of several players (most prominently Eugene Levy and Fred Willard) really sold this as a terrible mockery of the mockumentary genre. The plot was lost in the attempt to film this as a mockumentary and so the film loses its ability to define itself much like most of the folk singers are incapable of dealing with the loss of their identities in the latter parts of their lives after the folk sensation died down.This one gave too much away, the only way I didn't recognize This Is Spinal Tap as a real documentary in its realism was the appearance of Fran Drescher. Definitely a weak movie, this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Guest created a quartet of pseudo-documentaries with "A Mighty Wind", about a bunch of folk singers getting together when their producer dies. The movie lets the audience see everyone's personalities develop as the movie progresses, namely with the "ninny/nonny" scene, and "now-tro". Probably the most intriguing character is Eugene Levy as the mentally whacked Mitch; I still wonder what he was thinking about during his performances! Anyway, it's a really good comedy. Poking fun at the folk music scene without being nasty, they know how to do everything. Also starring Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara (happy birthday, Catherine!), Parker Posey, Bob Balaban and Ed Begley Jr.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>beautiful homage to folk music--with a little bit of humor to boot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a lot different than its predecessor, BEST IN SHOW. While most of the cast is a reprise of this earlier film, A MIGHTY WIND is a lot more subtle and more of a homage to folk music instead of a parody. BEST IN SHOW was laugh out loud funny, while A MIGHTY WIND is more of a well-made imitation of the sounds of 60s folk music. And, surprisingly, the cast of non-singers do an incredible job. In fact, some of the music is very catchy and you will probably find yourself tapping your toes EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE FOLK MUSIC. In particular, the "SPINAL TAPPERS" (Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKeon) sound almost exactly like the Kingston Trio! And, while Eugen Levy and Catherine O'Hara are not great singers, they make the absolute most of their talents in this sweet little film. Watch it for the occasionally funny moments and watch to see what a spot-on recreation the actors do of this medium.</fullReview>

Fawcett's comments - it's a GREAT movie.The actors are fabulous, and it's amazing to watch the same team of people who were in Spinal Tap &amp; dog show mocumentaries, and watch them playing such diverse characters - metal musicians in Spinal Tap and folk singers in A Mighty Wind!

Mitch is a shell of a person, grotesquely gray-haired and untidy, inward-centered, painfully shy, miserable. The Folksmen (Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer) are in better shape but inhabit a fantasy world in which they still put out sounds worth listening to. The New Main Street Singers (John Michael Higgins, Jane Lynch and the inescapable Parker Posey) are a contemporaneously cast shadow of the original Main Street Singers.

		<shortDescription>Christopher Geust has done it again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw A Mighty Wind recently and I couldn't stop laughing. Christopher Geust and Co. really out did themselves on this project. This new mocumentry from the people who brought you Spinal Tap, Best in Show and Waiting for Gufman is sure to leave you on the ground laughing like a mad man.As some of you know, folk music was really popular in the 60's and many folk groups where created because of it, this is the story of 3 of these groups. All of them had 1 thing in common, they were all founded and made famous via Irving Stinebloom the head of a major record company. Unfortunately, it was his time to go, and he checked out. His son who now is in charge of the label wanted to have a special in tribute to the passing of his father. So he gets the 3 major folk groups, The Main Street Singers (now the new main street singers), The Folks Men (you may know them better as same 3 guys who played Spinal Tap), and the duo Mitch and Mickey (broke up in the late 60's). Hillarity insues as various sub plots take place during the film, but in my opinion, the best one is the one about Mitch and Mickey. During the 60's they we're THE couple in folk music, but an unfortunately recording room incondent in the late 60's they disbanded. Mickey went on to other things while Mitch went completely insane. So when they got the invitation to play in public television special, rough waters are excpetcted.A Mighty Wind is a a 4th testoment to the brillents that is Christopher Geust and Co. Most of the film was improvised, and they still managed to keep it funny. The whole cast was hilarious, and its got great music. I myself am a fan of Guest and Co. movies, and I hope they make more. So in closing I give Mighty Wind a solid 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True love lasts forever...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By now if a person has visited this page they probably have already seen the film and know the plot or already read the twenty-millions reviews of the film (hehehe, a bit excessive there). What I mean is I think I will leave my explanation of the plot to: folk singers come back to perform a tribute to the man who started their bands out. There. Said and done. Being a character actress who denies that she is a character actress I was pleased to discover the genre of "improvised mockumentary." I figured if they were willing to let actors go out and make up lines they must be pretty talented and I am sick of watching films with no talent. Even if you hate this film you cannot negate the talent. Just ask yourself: can you make up bizarre things (that are accurate like the Yiddish speal) off the top of your head for hours on end? Probably not. But Christopher Guest's films are not for everyone. I would state that there is a subtle thread of dark humour mixed in a blender with drama, The Far Side and insanity. Do I love these films especially A Mighty Wind? Yes. Oh yes. To know and love this humour is an acquired taste. Even if you are a fan of folk music, it might not be funny to you. You can appreciate it though as I can being a fan of folk music myself. Why I think it is funny is because I have a sick sense of humour. Why say true love lasts forever? Although all of Chris Guest's films have circled around a number of people, A Mighty Wind takes a different turn and that is what makes it different from his other films. Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show all took funny situations and made them funny, even idiotic at times but in a great way. They showed how serious people can be about something not very serious. One reason why I think they're funny is because I know people who are obsessed about their pets and also I've been in a number of community plays and they are that serious about it.They think they're the best, negating that there are billions of people in the world. But A Mighty Wind neglects what Christopher Guest has done before: it creates a real drama. Yes, there are the funny Folksmen and zany New Mainstreet Singers, but Mitch and Mickey aren't really funny: they're poignant. Mitch's formerly overdosed brain is hilarious, yes and the way he is out of touch with the world sends a person into a state of giggles (plus that hair) but when he and Mickey begin to feel the pangs of lost love. Instead of going for the gusto and ending up in bed (as many films do) their love is underlying and questionable: should they get back together or should they stay apart? Mickey has gone on with her life, has a husband now whom she is devoted to and has given up on that life before but Mitch maybe still holds onto that dream. They don't jump the gun, they skirt around it, questioning it, wondering about it and finally deciding that maybe it would be best if they didn't relive those former passionate days. Of course if other actors would have played the parts and if their had been a script I don't think it would be as passionate, real and truly bittersweet as Catherine O'Hara and Eugene Levy made it. When Catherine looks at Eugene as they sing one wonders what they must have felt during their SCTV days, maybe not love, but a bond that true friendship forms, a friend love affair. It exudes itself so well on screen that when they do have a brief kiss tears will flow. In that sense the whole film was pulled off so well. Even if they would have not have gotten back together, but had more than the stage kiss I think the film would have dropped in its true to life telling and certainly its tragic love story. The film as a whole is wonderful with brilliantly odd ideas and characters, but the fact that Christopher Guest let Catherine and Eugene create Mitch and Mickey and give them the path they lead in the film started a new road for the cast. If they had not had the humour of Mitch or really of any characters, the heart break of M&amp;M would have been too great. The whole atmosphere of the film works and I hope that Christopher Guest will do the next with the next Chris Guest and Co. film. True talent does not have to lie in the background music or in an explosive setting where a ship sinks and tragedy lies overhead. It lies in the actors and their ability to rely on another and this team makes it work effortlessly (and their ability to learn instruments, sing and compose). And kudos to Jim Piddock and Ed Begley, jr. for adding just a touch of authenticity and sheer insanity to their characters. I will never look at catheters or my Swedish family in the same way. If I had to rate it, of course I would give it **** out of ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed "Best of Show" -- it was odd, but I got it. So when "A Mighty Wind" showed up on HBO I gave it a whirl. Now I know this movie won't be for everyone, but I was raised on my Mom's folk music. Songs by Joan Baez, the Chad Mitchell Trio, The Smothers Brothers, The Kingston Trio, Harry Belafonte, Peter Paul and Mary and the New Christie Minstrels were always on her lips and became car songs, bedtime songs, you name it. So to see that era in music spoofed in this film -- so accurately, lovingly, pityingly -- I was almost in tears with laughter. That vacant look on Eugene Levy's face in most of the film (except when singing, of course -- the tortured artist) was prize. The songs are great -- some even quite beautiful and/or "snappy". So we now have the soundtrack in our car. I made my husband watch it with me (he is a movie buff, but tends to prefer sports or more sappy films like Field of Dreams, though Wrath of Kahn is a favorite). Now I can't PAY him to stop quoting lines from this movie. Another insider "joke" that made the movie even more amusing for me was the fact that almost ALL of the actors were also in "Best of Show" playing completely different types.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jon Monsarrat review: original, but... doesn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the autobiography of Chuck Jones, the fellow who created Bugs Bunny. He said that comedy is when the protagonist is an everyday fellow who is surrounded by strangeness. When the protagonist is the strange person (Mr. Bean) that's farce and it just doesn't work.I feel the same way about A Mighty Wind, and similar fake documentaries, Best in Show and This is Spinal Tap. There are some weird antics, but there's no protagonist, no straight man to identify with. Some of the bits are genuinely funny, but most of the film meanders with little plot and only mildly quirky stuff that's not worth a chuckle. Worst of all, the major question of the film (I won't give it away but it surrounds Mitch's past) could have been drawn into a warm and powerful conclusion. It wasn't. More meandering.So A Mighty Wind comes away as more a character sketch than a story and not an especially interesting one. I liked Best in Show more, and This Is Spinal Tap a lot less. If you want to see a fake documentary that's hilarious, check out the old British TV series "People Like Us"... they INCLUDE a straight man -- the interviewer is one of the characters -- which is why it works.Who should see this film:-- Folk music fans from the 60s, maybe there are some in-jokes?-- Comedy lovers but only on a rainy day if you've nothing better to do-- Eugene Levy fans, I can't stop you, but... you won't see any of his genius in this film. His was the least funny of all the characters.I'll give A Mighty Wind a disappointing 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

Catherine O'Hara, Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy and others headline this story of a group of 60s folk performers gathering together, decades later for a memorial tribute to a recently departed fellow performer. One of the songs, a high-lite of the concert, was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song and probably should have won!

The film is very well-conceived and has several amusing moments (mostly from Ed Begley, Jr. and, in particular, Fred Willard, who again shows his great skill and comic timing with an oafish, self-centered character), but it's perhaps too enamored of itself, too sweet and nice for the creative juices to really get cooking. The original songs, so well-attuned to the nostalgia of the situation, may also be the picture's weakest link comedy-wise: they are too close to the real thing and don't quite play as satire. Pleasant for what it is, this can't hold a candle to Guest's delirious "Best in Show". ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Mighty Wind is a unique comedy, possibly one of the few of which you'll see this year, in that it contains all the schematics and effort of a satire (this is easily describable by some as the folk version of Spinal Tap, which is true with the Folksmen), but it isn't as vicious as other satires go for, or like how Best In Show and Waiting for Guffman went for it's characters. This time, there's a sort of sweet nature in dealing with the poking and proding of their creations and their backgrounds, music, and friendships. As with the other Guest films, as well as the classic Spinal Tap, a story is laid out as the simple set-up: an old producer and innovator of the folk scene, Irving Steinbloom, passes away, and his three children (one of which played by Bob Balaban, the other two Don Lake and Deborah Theaker, each of which have a good dose of humor to add) decide to form a reunion concert of the groups he produced- The New Main Street Singers (half of which are part-time witches), The Folksmen (Shearer, McKean, and Guest, Shearer getting the most laughs and each of the songs a riot), and Mitch (Levy) and Mickey (Catherine O'Hara), who were once lovers but split due to Mitch's 'personal' issues. As the film explores the members' pasts, the rehearsal periods, the behind-the-scenes personel, and then the concert climax, there seems to be something new to laugh at every or every other minute. A brilliant part of the Guest improv picture is that it demands repeat viewings since on the first view you get all the straightforward gags and jokes, and then on the repeats a viewer can soak in all the subtle touches and little things about the characters; noteworthy moments for me included Shearer's beard (and what unfolds with him), Mickey's husband's train set (and Levy's response), and of course Fred Willard as Mike LaFontaine, who is arguably the funniest of the bunch. Overall, it seems that Guest, Levy, and their whole comedy-company have done it again, with a movie that, if anything, leaves the person with a smile on their face. Oh, and big props to Jennifer Coolidge! Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But Lacking Something</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A number of reviews said this was one of the funniest films of all time, or close to it. I watched this, anticipating a number of laughs. What I got was a well-produced, very good film that had a lot of very good moments, and was very astute to almost every little detail, but it was not very funny. This was a film by Harry Shearer, a very unique film maker, but this is not one of his better films. Best in Show was slight better. Overall if you are looking for a film that is excellently done, but not very funny this is the one to watch. The movie is a documentary, a satire on a reunion of folk groups popular in the 1960s (all fictitional) in modern day. The groups have a number of adjustments to make as they get together again, and perform again. This is a funny movie, but really lacks something, it is not that funny. Still I guess it is worth watching, if for nothing else the excellent production values, and the great cast of character actors who actually do very well here, and some good music too. But I cannot understand how everyone thought this was hilarious. There was a movie I also have a review for called Fear of a Black Hat, which is a documentary of a similar tone, except it is about gangster rap. That movie is far funnier, this movie is silly, and not always that funny. Still you can appreciate the movie for it's impeccable production values, its storyline and the acting. Fred Willard as he always is, is excellent. But for some this was one of the funniest movies ever, but to me it's no Marx Brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christopher Guest Loses His Touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Christopher Guest and his ad-libbing ensemble take aim at folk music in this mockumentary about a folk music festival."Best in Show" was a diluted and less funny product of the same formula that made "Waiting for Guffman" such a comedy classic, and "A Mighty Wind" dilutes the formula even more. There's not much to remember about this film other than the Academy Award-nominated song "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow," a lovely little tune sung in the film by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, a married folk act who have found themselves drifting apart from each other over the years. The storyline might have had some real dramatic potential, but it's buried underneath all of the other narrative threads and Guest's determination to keep his film glib and inconsequential.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is great. And to think that there was no script involved makes it even better. They just worked so well. Also, if someone mentioned something that could be put into the movie, they did put that into the movie. Example: When the guy talked about the cruise, they actually made a poster of that cruise. The acting was excellent. That guy from American pie was great. Also the man who said, "Wha happened?". Genius. The songs weren't that great, but it didn't really matter. I am really hoping to see best in show. I don't know why some people really think this is an awful movie. It just is funny randomness. I am really hoping that they do not make a sequel cause that probably wouldn't be so great. Although it would be because of the great acting. Once again, this movie is genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Admittedly, this is not the best Christopher Guest and pals movie. But, if you are a fan of this troupe's previous works (Waiting for Guffman or Best in Show) then you will absolutely not hate this movie.First watch Guffman and then Best in Show. Both (like this one) are written in Mockumentary style and the uninteresting characters who stammer and insert the occasional awkward pauses become much more real because, let's face it, awkward pauses happen in real life.None of these movies is about "pretty people", Parker Posey being a notable exception, but rather about those mediocre people you meet in every day life that excel at something 99.999% of the populace couldn't care less about. Their triumphs, though small, are important for them and this is what makes the movies so great.If you liked Best in Show, then give this and Waiting for Guffman a try. It may be the weakest of the three, but if you are a fan of the others you'll laugh knowing how much fun the actors are having and because you're in on the joke.</fullReview>

We all know SOMEONE like these characters they portray. If you watch one, you will want to collect them all. I did!! These movies reveal an incredibly talented group of actors. You believe every character they portray. The scripts are witty, with an unerring ability to make you pay attention, in case you miss anything. Trust me, you will catch something every time you watch them, that you missed originally. I cannot switch the channel, if I see one of these movies on TV. And I laugh every single time. Both my daughters are addicted too, one whom is 23, and the other is 33. Literally appeals to all ages. As funny as they are, they are good musicians and singers too.

		<fullReview>The music is as cleverly written as the movie, with the actors having written and performed their own music. The case was excellent, with the movie having a style reminiscent of the SCTV TV show, which Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara were part of. Even though the three folk groups in A Mighty Wind are fictional, it is easy to picture them as real and want to know even more about them, especially about Mitch &amp; Mickey, played by the aforementioned Levy and O'Hara. Harry Shearer, Michael McKean, and Christopher Guest are back together, only not as the band Spinal Tap, but as The Folksmen. In my opinion, this was a better setup for them. This film is well-worth watching, and then watching again. I've played the soundtrack on cd over and over and over. It cannot be beat. This is satire at its best, not crude, but very, very clever!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`A Mighty Wind' is not based on irritable bowel syndrome disorders. That story is based in a galaxy very `fart, fart' away. `A Mighty Wind' is mockumentary guru Christopher Guest's latest effort. The film mocks the corny, but yet, heartfelt world of folk singers. What the `folk' would guest invite himself to mimic such a ludicrous musical profession? Because guest has the creativity, goofiness, and intellect to just about mock anything he chooses. The folk characters in `a mighty wind' include: Mitch &amp; Mickey, The Folksmen, and The New Main Street Singers. And yes folks! They are wacky folkpeople! Guest included his usual improvisational master posse of actors: Eugene Levy, Catherine O' Hara, Parker Posey, Ed Begley, Micheal Mckean, Harry Shearer, Fred Willard, Bob Balaban, John Michael Higgins, and of course Guest himself. Most notably, Levy levies up his unique talent once again with his boisterously entertaining performance as Mitch. Willard also continues his will to be a mighty funnymen with successful results. However, I must state that `A Mighty Wind' did blow it at times. Guest flocks around too much with the finale concert instead of `folkusing' more on these folk characters. Nevertheless, `A Mighty Wind' is a recommended viewing. Don't be a `mother folker'! Check it out! That's all folks!!!! *** Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Christopher Guest strikes comedic gold yet again in this uproarius mockumentary revolving around a folk music fundraiser, and the three bands that will be performing. The musical numbers in the film actually feel like real folk tunes, and one rightfully so was nominated for an Academy Award (Mitch &amp; Mickey's "Kiss At The End Of The Rainbow"). Although The Folksmen (whom contain Guest himself) and Mitch &amp; Mickey are entertaining, I didn't feel a connection toward The New Main Street Singers. A rebound from the uneven "Best In Show", Mighty Wind is the type of movie worthy for the acclaimed Guest series.VERDICT: ***1/2 OF **** Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing Movie found on CD and DVD Bonus Features</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Mighty Wind" marks a low point in Christopher Guest's series of mockumentaries, and it almost seems as if the comedic auteur wanted it to suck. Anyone who's seen the movie can tell you that it is a crashing bore--40 minutes of movie crammed into an hour and a half. And not much of that 40 minutes is funny, either. But if you have listened to the songs on the excellent soundtrack CD or watched the hilarious deleted scenes included on the DVD you can tell that there WAS a funny movie to be had. For instance, the songs in the finished film's big finale are given the short shrift because Guest rarely lets them be heard in their entirety, preferring instead to make frequent cuts to scenes of concurrent action that add nothing to the film. Sure these intercut scenes tell the "story." But the story is shallow and dull. And, even more frustrating, virtually EVERY SINGLE ONE of the deleted scenes is funnier and more interesting than anything that made the final cut! Worse even still, and most unforgivable: the amazing Parker Posey has only one scene of dialog! What was the man thinking? Why the self-sabotage?I mean, really! Given the excellent material he obviously had on hand how did Guest and his editor end up with such a boring piece of junk?Very sad.</fullReview>

Finally, I resented the fact that the ever lovely Parker Posey was practically just an "extra". Overall there are some chuckles in this one, but it's not a memorable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just don't see the point of this movie. It reminds me of the within the movie spoof of old Hollywood films in "Singing in the Rain" except that this mostly unfunny spoof is the real movie. There's a lot of wasted talent here. I'm not sure why they wasted their time on it.In the 60's, there were two major folk music styles that had different audiences. There were the very white and do-good activist folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary and the New Christy Minstrels along with Pete Seeger and The Kingston Trio. The other style of folk was the more blues oriented and darker, more traditional artists like Bob Dylan, Dave Von Ronk, Eric von Schmidt, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, the Farinas, Joan Baez and Arlo Guthrie.I never had much interest in the first style of folk musicians so a spoof of their reunion held little interest for me. The only good scenes in the film, in my opinion, were those between Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara. There were some tender moments there and I really liked her husband, the English guy with the trains but he kind of disappeared somewhere in the middle.Kind of a waste for a major film release. This should have been a TV movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About a decade after everyone else noticed, the corporations picked up on folk music. As they have done time and again, the "majors" caught scent of an important musical scene that was ready to explode and realized that it was the perfect time to exploit it. The heart and soul was ripped out of folk and in its place came profit and disposable # 1 singles from bands clueless toward what made the music great in the first place.A Mighty Wind is a "mockumentary" featuring fictionalized versions of these lesser folk "artists" reuniting for a one night only memorial concert. Director/Screenwriter/Actor Christopher Guest, along with co-screenwriter and actor Eugene Levy, have, once again, created a story about a group of people whose eerie dedication to their marginal work is made enduring due to the child-like enthusiasm they have for their craft.Guest and Levy hit upon something new back in 1996 with the very funny Waiting for Guffman. The two sat down and wrote a script that included everything but the dialogue. Guest, as director, set the stage for the incredible cast he assembled, turned on the camera and let them flesh it all out in documentary form. The improvisational approach lent a breath of fresh air to the feature that put it a step above most of the scripted comedies that were relying far too heavily on stock jokes and formulaic plots.Four years later the duo took the identical approach with Best in Show. The film worked, but to a lesser extent than their earlier effort. Now, along comes A Mighty Wind. Although the movie isn't significantly worse than Best in Show, it suffers largely by having the *ahem* wind taken out of its sails by its predecessors. A "been there, done that" feeling creeps into the movie within the first few minutes and stays with it until the end credits roll. It doesn't help that the film grows less and less funny as it moves toward its climax.A Mighty Wind begins to make the mistake of taking itself seriously and the music, most of which isn't that humorous, begins to take precedent over the comedy by the time the actual memorial concert begins. The film deteriorates into the equivalent of a night watching washed-up one hit wonders playing at the county fair. A "six months later" type finale is slapped on as an afterthought to remind the audience that the movie they had just witnessed began as a comedy.The actors in A Mighty Wind vary from good (Fred Willard, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara, John Michael Higgins, Jane Lynch, Jennifer Coolidge, Bob Balaban, Paul Dooley, Jim Piddock) to wasted (Parker Posey, Larry Miller, Ed Begley Jr.) to cartoonish and implausible (Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer, Eugene Levy). Of course with this many performers some are going to be stuck in forgettable roles and others are bound to have an "off" day.Although they sometimes come up empty, everyone involved gives it their all and the good time the actors are having translates into a fairly fun time for the audience. The first half of this film still has some of that old snap, crackle and pop that we felt with Waiting for Guffman. You could do a lot worse at the theater than A Mighty Wind. It's worth a recommendation, just not accolades.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Given the cast of this picture it would be difficult not to compare it to This Is Spinal Tap. This would be a mistake. This Is Not Spinal Tap. Is it good? Well, in it's favour (yes that's a "u"), it has some excellent characterisations but as a film, it meanders, sometimes aimlessly. Almost immediately I felt that the film failed to pull me in. There were a series of interesting and playful scenes. As another review here states, it just isn't funny and I think the reason that is has to do with the fact that nothing really happens. What's the story? Where's the tension? So you've got these polished characters but their relationship to each other is forced by circumstance so you get a group of people all trying to come up with the funniest line. Such a shame. I also think the back story to a lot of the characters was a little grim. Fine I love black comedies but this didn't seem to fulfill any purpose or give us any insight to why they behave the way they do, aside from Jonathan Steinbloom's character but they handed it to us on a plate! Sheesh! We could have worked it out ourselves.Verdict: Yeah, watch it. A lot of people really liked it. Given the cast and talent involved, it had so much potential. Sadly it's a bit of an underachiever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'A Mighty Wind' has been billed as "from the makers of 'Best in Show' and 'This Is Spinal Tap' ", and that much is truth in advertising. But while it shares a lot with its predecessors beside the casts, it tries a little too hard and falls a little short of those efforts.If you've seen 'Best in Show,' then the first half-hour of 'A Mighty Wind' serves as a class reunion, wherein you get to see all your favorite actors return in different guises. It almost plays out like a game of musical chairs, where each participant gets to bring the same madcap sensibility to a different character than before. For instance, Jane Lynch, who before played a butch, semi-closeted, lesbian dog trainer, now returns as a (straight) porn-star-turned-folk singer. Jennifer Coolidge, who before played a ditsy, superficial heiress-to-be, now plays a ditsy, superficial promoter's wife. Michael McKean's character is now straight. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara, instead of having their marriage tested, are having their separation tested. For many of the troupe, the changes are completely superficial. For example, Levy plays the same lovable schmuck, only with a different hair style and a funny voice. Fred Willard doesn't even bother with a funny voice.Since the movie tries so hard to emulate 'Best in Show,' a direct comparison is fair, and this is where it comes up wanting. In 'Best in Show,' each actor managed to find a near perfect balance with their character, and each scene pushed the comic envelope just far enough. Everyone stayed true and believable to their character throughout, while at the same time milking the maximum potential comedy from the situation. 'A Mighty Wind' often accomplishes that, but it also has several instances where they stray too far one way or another. A good example is Jonathan Steinbloom (Bob Balaban), who swings from calm &amp; reasonable understatement to zany incomprehension of lampposts. The music, which in 'Spinal Tap' was ideally true to the source while being satirical, is here so true to the source that little humor comes out of it. The scenes between Levy and O'Hara often get too sentimental to be funny.Perhaps some of this is intentional on their parts, but the result is a disappointing effort for fans of 'Best in Show'. On the other hand if you have not seen 'Best in Show,' I would recommend seeing this first as a prequel, and I bet you'll wind up enjoying both thoroughly.</fullReview>

I spent the majority of the film looking at my watch and comparing it to the estimated running time stamped on the box. The plot is slow to develop and there is not enough time given to any character in order to develop them enough as a character to form any sort of attachment to them. This movie offers nothing new that wasn't done before in the previous film. The saving grace to this movie was the music. I'm not a really big fan of folk music in general, but much of the music that was played in the film had me listening and wishing that they would have done more of it more often to help keep the movie moving. If this movie interests you, you'd probably be better off just listening to the soundtrack and avoiding the rest of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into seeing this movie only with the knowledge that it was a Christopher Guest movie. I walked out of the theater with the feeling of Spinal Tap meets Best in Show, then rots at the bottom of the garbage heap for a couple of weeks. Where was the humor in this movie?I thought Best of Show was funny, but using the same style of quirky characters, it was simply not funny this time around. I didn't give one hoot about any of the characters and what they were going through. Best of Show was funny because the story was taken seriously. The group was a bunch of people who cared deeply about the competition. In the Mighty Wind, the story was taken very lightly, intended from the very beginning not to be serious. This is where the great err was made.Instead of one coherent story line, (thought I know there was one) I felt like I was watching a series of SNL bits. This scene is a gag about inappropriate lunch conversation. This one is a bit about how stupid this woman is, or how ignorant this one is. Nothing ever built from one scene to another. Any humor that was achieved, died before anything funny happened again.In summary, this weak story should have been scrapped on the drawing board. What did it build to? Why did I watch it? What did I care? None of these questions were answered. Each character was given some specific quirk, but it was never taken anywhere, never developed. This movie was a first-act, but nothing more. By the end of it, I finally knew who these characters were, but where was the conflict? Apparently the filmmakers thought this anti-climactic performance was at the top of the arc for this movie, but it just started the climb up. It was a waste of $6 and 2 hours of my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`A Mighty Wind' is the latest `mockumentary' by writer/director Christopher Guest and his co-author Eugene Levy. Having explored the worlds of regional theatre and of competitive dog shows in `Waiting For Guffman' and `Best of Show,' respectively, these two talented filmmakers have now seen fit to apply their unique brand of affectionate satire to the subject of folk music. As always, they have chosen to tell their tale using a film-within-a-film format, interspersing ersatz on-camera interviews amidst straightforward narrative passages ? all centered on a reunion concert of some fictional folk singers from the 1960's and ?70's.As a person who loved both `Waiting For Guffman' and `Best of Show,' I must say that I was a bit disappointed by `A Mighty Wind.' It isn't that there aren't some very funny moments in this film; it's just that there aren't nearly enough of them to bring the movie to the level of the earlier works. Apart from the fact that Guest and Levy seem to have reached the point of diminishing returns with their style ? it may, indeed, be time for them to branch out a little and try something a bit different in the future ? the writing in `A Mighty Wind' just doesn't feel as sharp or as well thought-out as it needs to be to make the concept work. The movie, as a whole, in fact, comes across as somewhat less fleshed out and fully developed than those previous films. As always, Guest and Levy - ever the clever, if benign, social critics - get perilously close to becoming condescending and superior in their attitude towards both the characters and the world they inhabit, but the large and gifted cast hits the right note in making the characters sympathetic and likable even when we find ourselves laughing `at' rather than `with' them. The only exception, ironically, is Levy himself, who overacts badly in the role of the depressed male member of a once-romantically connected singing duo.The filmmakers have done a seamless job in blending present day footage of the characters with cleverly faked photos and film clips of the performers in their younger days. Moreover, the music itself sounds terrific and goes a long way towards mitigating any feeling of disappointment that may arise from the uneven nature of the writing.`A Mighty Wind' isn't Guest and Levy at their best, but there are enough laughs and fine performances to make it worth seeing ? and the music itself is worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missed opportunity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some endearing moments, some fun moments, one very good Oscar-nominated song, some fun characters(especially the ex "catch-phrase" TV comic played by the guy who played the father of the bride in American Pie: The Wedding; and the male and female leaders of the New Main Street Band are also fun). But on the whole, what it lacked was direction, in many senses of the word. Christopher "Nigel Tufnel" Guest, who writes, directs and acts, left me quite unfulfilled and disappointed. There isn't a scene in this that was right: they were all too drawn out, with actors constantly trying to draw the most out of a moment, and a director who didn't know to tell them more will come if they don't try so hard. Eugene Levy, in a key role for once, surprisingly missed the point, giving us a broad character, over-played and out of place in a mockumentary. Guest did help write seminal mockumentary This is Spinal Tap, with his Mighty Wind co-stars Michael McKean and Harry Shearer, but the element sorely missing here was Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally co-writer-director Rob Reiner. What Reiner did with around the same number of movie-minutes is astounding compared to how Guest chose to fill his. At the end, you never feel like you get to know any of these people, and you wonder how they should end up, because you don't know why anyone ever introduced you to any of them in the first place.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Christopher Guest is a beautiful actor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>He speaks to me. This is critical in an actor. He is fine and sublime. He touches a chord in humanity. His acting "sings". He makes me believe in the human race. He, Christopher Guest, found this actress, Jane Lynch, who played a role in this slight and deflated movie-A Mighty Wind. She is magnificent, as a slightly batty cultish guru of: whatever-it-is she is selling. Whatever it is-----I am buying it. She is truly wonderful, in a color-coordinated scene which features John Michael Higgins. This is genius. That said, this movie plods along.This is a fruitcake or amalgam of hit and miss acting: that tells me this genre of movie-making is about ready to give up and quit. Oh my Brothers-this is sad for me as well: the great Christopher Guest has run out of ideas. I have loved Mr. Guest since 35 years ago. Platonically. Despite this, I promise I will not kill myself out of grief. Really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The formula is starting to show signs of weakness, but Guest's mockumentary is still the best in show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You may remember Christopher Guest from "This is Spinal Tap." You may also remember him as the six-fingered man in "The Princess Bride." Both were Rob Reiner films, but with 1996's "Waiting for Guffman," he created his own post-"Spinal Tap"-mockumentary about a small town that put on a pageant, despite lack of interest.Then, four years later, he struck gold again with "Best in Show," reuniting many of the actors from "Guffman" for a documentary-style parody of modern day dog competitions. It was a very funny film, but like "A Mighty Wind," its humor is very subtle, and therefore some audiences just don't "get it."I got it. I like subtle humor and laugh-out-loud humor; I appreciate subtle humor as a smarter type of humor, on most occasions, and laugh-out-loud humor is respectable in a different sort of way. "Dumb and Dumber" always puts a smile on my face, but so does "The Odd Couple," and though the two films are similar in nature they are also wholly different. It depends on what mood I'm in.Make sure you're in the right type of mood when you sit down to watch "A Mighty Wind." It's Christopher Guest's worst mockumentary film to date, but then again, that hardly makes it a bad movie at all, does it?"A Mighty Wind" returns to the "Waiting for Guffman" roots; it's about a television-broadcast reunion of folk music icons, all joining together again as they were in the sixties to say a fond farewell to their old manager, who has just passed away from old age.The two primary bands are The Folksmen, led by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry "Principal Skinner" Shearer, and Mitch and Mickey, led by Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara. Mitch and Mickey used to be a couple back in the sixties, but as all the fame and glory stories go, they broke up and haven't spoken for years. The Folksmen are just three ordinary guys with a talent for being quite unlucky (even the song they choose to sing at the reunion has already been taken and they have to quickly think of another to play).These mockumentary comedies are all made up of quirky characters, and "A Mighty Wind" is no exception. Catherine O'Hara's Canadian accent is splendidly funny to listen to, Michael McKean (his most memorable role being his smallest as the state trooper in "Planes, Trains and Automobiles") is subtly funny as always, Christopher Guest is...well...Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer will constantly remind you of Principal Skinner from "The Simpsons" (his own voice), and "SCTV's" Eugene Levy is the highlight, channeling a sort of Ozzy Osbourne persona for the character of Mitch, the nice singer who slumped into an era of drinks, drugs, and depression during the 70s after his romance with Mickey broke apart -- or so we can only assume from the wasted look in his eyes and the staggering walk of a permanently drunken man.The other key to these movies is not only its characters but also its delightful realism. "A Mighty Wind" has created an entirely false universe for itself, much like "Adaptation" did with some of its in-jokes regarding "The 3" and so on and so forth. Guest provides us with clippings of black and white music performances by the singers, and lots of other fake footage and album covers that are all false but look so very real. It helps the audience believe what they're seeing is truth. Without little things like old footage, the film would simply not be as funny.Much of the cast ad-libbed in "A Mighty Wind," and it shows. The film's weakness is that it seems to move slowly with long absences of laughter. But when the laughter comes -- and it will -- you'll be howling. I rarely laugh when I'm watching a film by myself (usually this only occurs while watching funny segments of "Saturday Night Live"), but one scene in "A Mighty Wind" did make me laugh out loud quite hard with no one else in the room. The scene is that in which Eugene Levy's wild-eyed character Mitch is brought into the basement of Mickey's house, where her husband shows Mitch his obsession: model railroads. Mitch making comments about Crabville just cracked me up. After a long scene of Levy doing hilarious Ozzy Osbourne facial expressions and saying funny things, Mickey's husband says, "It's Crabtown, not Crabville." You've got to see it to get it.The other highlight of the show is Fred Willard, and I'll summarize his character by saying, "Wha' happened?" Watch the movie and you'll get that, too."A Mighty Wind" wasn't quite as funny as I had hoped it would be, and the whole joke is starting to wear a little thin by now. Christopher Guest is both a talented actor and director, and though I enjoyed and recommend "A Mighty Wind," I think that it's about time he either moved on or dramatically increased the wit of his script for the next mockumentary he may decide to make, because as it is, "A Mighty Wind" is starting to show signs of formula weakness.3.5/5 stars.- John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow, Nasty and Awkward</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I really like folk music, so I was initially biased against this movie which makes a lot of nasty jabs against folk music and folkies. Before I saw the movie, and even afterwards, I never really saw what there was to make fun of in folk music. Most folk singers are so laid back and stay so far out of the limelight, that unlike "This Is Spinal Tap," there is very little popular reference to compare the parody to. Also, most of the folkies I know are basically old hippies or the children of old hippies -- and whatever else you might say about hippies, they are not ones to aggressively hog the limelight. Whereas the genre of flamboyant rockers about whom "This Is Spinal Tap" was based, were natural targets for parody. A satire of basically inoffensive old folkies, is a lot like beating up a guy in a coma -- there's not much point, and its rather cruel.However, there were enough comedic elements in the story that it could have worked, if it hadn't been painfully slow. We are taken from one singer's rambling and awkward account of his or her life, directly to another singer's, and then the second singer's account is interupted to go back to the first's, where we get the punchline to something he started talking about ten minutes ago. It was dull.In addition to being dull, though, it was tedious. The author of this film might have thought that he was capturing the way people actually talked by having them stammer, ramble, correct themselves, and go back to what they had been talking about earlier and in some cases, this may be true. However, all the characters in this film talk in the identical "uniquely quirky" manner. You need only listen to any interview on TV -- and I don't necessarily mean interviews with professional speakers, it could be any kind of interview -- to realize that people don't speak like that.What made it even more painful, is that the music that they played was actually pretty good. It was painful because more often than not, you heard people not really playing it, but rehearsing it a very broad exageration of a rehearsal. Then when you actually heard the music, you'd only hear a small snippet of the song before moving on.My friends and I turned off this movie after we had watched a half an hour. It was slow, and tedius, and we felt that it ridiculed a genre that we enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The art direction on the end credits was cleverly done. Ashame the script wasn't. I have a copy of "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best in Show" that I love to bring out and show friends. I won't buy a copy of this one as I would fall asleep if I had to watch it again. The only funny part was performed by Jennifer Coolidge - she was brilliant - I was hoping there would be more of her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry. I liked Best of Show. This is just a revisiting of the same material. It was funny once, now it's boring except to those that didn't catch Best of Show the first time. This can not be a fully objective review as I turned the film off after 20 minutes of this nonsense.Wow, there's a wife who screwed everyone or who is a porn star once again. Eugene Levy is once again in a film as a social retard. Don't get me wrong here...Eugene is funny...the role is funny...but much like a fart joke on Thanksgiving...It's only funny so many times.Oh yes and there's the chuckling idiots who revisit one another after years away from one another.

		<shortDescription>How to bore yourself silly for 95 minutes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie redefines with every single frame of video the term "boring". This movie is a mock-u-mentary of folk bands from the 60's trying to score a comeback. This has to be one of the dullest films that I have ever tried to sit through in the past 10+ years. The story lacks any type of climax, or real plot. It is simply a really lousy fake documentary that attempts unsuccessfully to make a mockery of folk music. One may expect that this film has atleast a tinge of humour about it, but alas no.The only good thing I can say about this film is that it discourages procrastination. Every single moment I watched the movie I found a thousand other things that I would rather be doing elsewhere.So if you want to clear the living room of kids, or need motivation to clean out the gutters or tackle some other menial chore then please do give it a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mighty High Odor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In between the very sparse amount of effective humor in this film, my mind was left to wander. Left to it's own devices, this uninspired bit of filmmaking falls flat.From about a half-dozen decent jokes, the funniest of them inspires nothing more than a snort. In other words, mild appreciation at the attempt, but nothing that inspires closer attention to the characters or an appreciation for the intelligence of the screenwriting.Second: this is an unsophisticated form of satire. It is satire that plainly mocks what it's mocking while having none of the fun that the target can inspire. It's fine to mock folk music, could even be funny. For instance, you could mock the backstage antics of the musicians while giving the musicians good music to play "onstage". But the folk music in this movie stank! Remember when Shubb gets the audience to participate in the song by cycling through barn animal sounds? Stoooopid. I know it's a PG film but does anyone really want to listen to pre-school sing-a-longs?Constrast A Mighty Wind with the Schwarzenegger movies from the 80s. He knew that his characters were jockstraps, so he always had an ironic glint in his eye while he blasted, chopped, and booted his way through entire divisions of latin american soldiers. He had fun while parodying his character.Furthermore, the freshness of the mockumentary genre that Guest introduced is going stale. It was fun for awhile, but now it feels mainstream, and I suspect that Guest has lost a lot of inspired momentum because of it. "Best In Show" was fun and energetic but "A Mighty Wind" is just Guest punching the clock like any other faded Hollywood stiff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sounded good from the reviews, but I had to stop the DVD recorder after just 20 minutes. I found the movie very dry and not funny for a comedy.I kept waiting for it to shake out of its shell and get funny. In the 20 minutes I watched there was only one really good line which was about a record company producing records without a hole in them. For myself it was not worth wasting a dollar on a blank DVD disk.As for the music I did hear, it was not bad, but I could not sit between the music spots just to listen.If I could have rated this movie a zero I would have and I give very few movies a 1.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is THE worst movie I or anyone else I know has EVER seen. I almost slept through it. It was extremely boring and fake. I'd give a negative rating but that's impossible. This movie is the worst movie you will ever see. I think everyone else slept through the small part we saw. This movie was a total waste of time, and it made me never want to see a "mockumentary" again. You should get paid to see this horrible movie. It did get better for about two minutes, but then it got even worse. After wasting an hour which felt like ten million on this movie, I didn't want to see any more of it. I stress again, do not see this movie unless you want to watch a movie so bad you can sleep right through it....</fullReview>
