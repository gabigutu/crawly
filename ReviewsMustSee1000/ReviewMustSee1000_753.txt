		<shortDescription>Thought Provoking Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lyrical quality to this film that makes the brutality of the oppression it depicts seem almost tangible, and `Before Night Falls, ` directed by Julian Schnabel, is photographed in a way that gives much of it something of a documentary feel (and, indeed, some archival footage is included), which defines the drama and adds to the overall impact of the film. And quite a story it is. The true story of writer Reinaldo Arenas (Javier Bardem), who was born in Cuba in 1943, it touches on his childhood, but concentrates on the '60s and '70s, during which time Arenas was considered a counter-revolutionary by the Cuban government because of his writing, as well as his homosexuality. Schnabel pulls no punches as he presents an incisive picture of the suffering inflicted upon Arenas (and others) through the wanton mistreatment and discrimination of Castro's regime. Extremely well crafted and delivered, it's a film that makes a powerful statement about many of the things so many take for granted. Like freedom of speech and assembly. For as the film points out, in post-revolution Cuba, a gathering of more than three becomes a criminal offense; a group of people getting together for a poetry reading become criminals of the State, and the punishment for expressing one's own thoughts can be, at the very least, torture and imprisonment.This is the environment in which Arenas grew and matured, as a person, a poet, a writer; still, he was irrepressible when it came to his work, and managed to create and have some of it published, but only by smuggling it out of Cuba (in one instance to France, where his book was named Best Foreign Novel of the year). It's a ruthless, uncompromising world Schnabel lays bare with his camera, and it's that realistic recreation of that very real time and place that is one of the strengths of this film. But what really drives it and makes it so compelling, is Bardem's incredible portrayal of Arenas.To say that Bardem's performance was worthy of an Oscar would be an understatement; along with Ed Harris (in `Pollock'), it was quite simply one of the two best of the year (2000). In order to bring Arenas to life, it was necessary for Bardem to capture all of the myriad complexities of the man and the artist, which he did-- and to perfection. It's a challenging role, and Bardem more than lives up to it, with a detailed performance through which he expresses the physical, as well as the emotional aspects of the character: His mannerisms, his walk, the body language that says so much about who he is; how he copes with living in a seemingly hopeless situation. By the end of the movie, because of Bardem, you know who Reinaldo Arenas was, and you're not likely to forget him.The most poignant scenes in the film are those in which Arenas' words are being recited as the camera creates a visual context for them, looking out through the window of a moving car or bus at the streets, towns, buildings and people, as Arenas describes them. These scenes fill the senses and are virtually transporting; and it is in them that the true poetic nature of Arenas is made manifest. It's beautiful imagery, and the contrast between the beauty of the words and the ugliness of the reality against which it is set is powerful. All of which is beautifully conceived and executed by Schnabel; an excellent piece of filmmaking.In a dual supporting performance, Johnny Depp is effective as Bon Bon, a `queen' Arenas meets during his incarceration, and also as Lieutenant Victor, who oversees the prison. Each character is unique, and it's quite a showcase for Depp's versatility. Rounding out the supporting cast are Olivier Martinez (Lazaro), Andrea Di Stefano (Pepe), Sean Penn (Cuco), Michael Wincott (Herberto), Pedro Armendariz Jr. (Reinaldo's Grandfather) and Vito Maria Schnabel (Teenage Reinaldo). A film that is not necessarily entertaining, and at times unpleasant to watch because of it's stark realism, `Before Night Falls' is, nevertheless, thought-provoking, riveting drama that is thoroughly engrossing. And it proves that beauty can indeed be found in the least likely of places. But it also makes you realize that it is up to each individual to care enough to seek it out, and to hopefully have the wisdom to realize it once it is found. And that's the real beauty of a film like this; it affords you the opportunity to do just that. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging, poetic, touching bio-pic about Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Incredible central performance from Javier Bardem ties the film together and makes you really care what happens. Great supporting players: Sean Penn has one incredible scene early on, who had us convinced he was Cuban. We didn't at all recognise him. Johnny Depp plays two small parts, but two very memorable ones. Growly-voiced Michael Wincott (played the bad guy in The Crow and Along Came a Spider and The Doors' manager in The Doors) is memorable. Andrea di Stefano is great as a central antagonist of Reinaldo, as is the now-Hollywood-famous Olivier Martinez who plays a touching, platonic friend to Reinaldo.Beautifully photographed and directed in an admirable manner that draws attention to style every now and then in a poetic way very fitting for a bio-pic about a poet, and at other times just utilises style to tells the story very well, and seem not to be fussing about style at all.There are scenes here where the sound effects track stops and this gorgeous cello music by Carter Burwell (composer of Being John Malkovich, Meet Joe Black, Man who Wasn't There, with another beautiful score) plays while we watch Bardem sitting in a club while people dance around him, and the music tells us he is far away. It is a wonderful scene, akin to Kurosawa's use of music in the brilliant burning of the first castle scene in Ran.The way the camera tells this story was so marvellous and slick (though using rough camera work to tell moments of uneasiness, importantly this is not over-used as it was in the recent Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) that i knew the filmmaker had been influenced by American filmmaking, but throughout i had no idea the guy actually WAS American! The TV program misleadingly told us it was a Cuban movie (which it is not - it is an American production with Spanish, Cuban and American actors)I'm even more shocked considering this is the guy who made Basquiat, which i always thought was more a tele-movie, and more about art than about movie-style. Julian Schnabel, i now learn, was a neo-expressionist painter in the 80's! Basquiat, about an artist, perhaps was a movie where he was making the transition between art-language and movie-language. Before Night Falls uses traditional storytelling, to be sure, but it has such a spellbinding cinematic quality i felt sure its director was one with cinema on the brain. Perhaps Schnabel has caught the bug after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>BEFORE NIGHT FALLS, directed by Julian Schnabel is the best movie made since SCHINDLER'S LIST, and just might surpass it. There is hardly anything I would change about this movie, it is in my mind as perfect as they could have made it. The only thing that could have been better was going deeper into Bardem's character, but I don't think that they really needed to, because like in OUT OF AFRICA, the character is not gone into very deeply, but the performance of Meryl Streep, or in this case Javier Bardem makes you feel like you know Arenas. The tiniest nuance is played out beautifully by Bardem, who had to learn Cuban Spanish and English with a cuban accent as well as gain a lot of weight, and probably hours of thought put into his performance. The writing is amazing, going from one event to the other, more about the author and what happens around him than an actual basic plotline. The music is terrific and well chosen, and Burwell's original score is the best original music in film history. The cinematography is innovative and excellent, audiences have seen few examples of the photography used in this film. And to top it all off, Julian Schanbel does a perfect job of directing, showing Arenas's life with a beautiful new narrative technique, while at the same time showing the contrast of the Revolution and it's events and the beautiful Cuban country. As in the memoir by Arenas, the film is seen through Arenas's eyes, and it is like the whole world is gay, in a sense, and it's fabulous. I also love how when showing the documentary footage, and Bardem read excerpts of Arenas's writing, it was spoken in Spanish, being true to the author's work, while the beautiful Burwell music played. Granted, this film is not for everyone, in fact I expect ninety percent of people to detest it, but to me, it is an amazing movie that is one of the few to get a ten out of ten from myself.Absolutely fabulous, but if you like a basic, clear plotline with rising events, climactic end, action, and humour that comes out as jokes and not just funny situations and such, you won't like it. In fact, as I said, I expect most people reading this not to like it, but to me, it may be in my top five, should've won best picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful and Affecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julian Schnabel is primarily a visual artist and secondarily a film director, and his mastery of visual media dominates this patient and precise bio of the late Reynaldo Arenas, a novelist and poet who was imprisoned and later exiled from his native Cuba for his controversial writings and his open homosexuality.Most of the objections to this film have to do with the faithfulness with which Schnabel treats the memoir of Arenas (also titled 'Before Night Falls'), which, despite its beauty, is undoubtedly biased in its presentation of history. Furthermore, Schnabel seems to downplay Arenas' contempt for Fidel Castro and the post-revolutionary totalitarianism of his regime, under which countless poets, writers, artists, and practitioners of alternative lifestyles deemed 'counter-revolutionary' by the regime were jailed, tortured, murdered, and, in some cases, expelled from Cuba. Schnabel presents Arenas as far more of a victim than an active voice of dissent, which is, in a certain sense, unfaithful to his legacy. It feels as if Schnabel may have had some reservation about being overcritical of Castro and, by default, of Communism, both of which are sympathized with by many artists and leftists worldwide (including the family of the film's star, Javier Bardem, a Spaniard whose parents--influential figures in Spanish cinema--are longtime outspoken Communists/Socialists).Both actor and director have publicly avowed that the film means to critique totalitarianism in general more so than Castro or Communist Cuba in particular, which seems like a bit of a cop-out. Nevertheless, art, despite its inherently political nature, should strive to be a-political, and this film does so effectively with its blending of gorgeous image and fine, subtle performance, particularly by Bardem as Arenas. Bardem has the face of a classical statue, and his deep set eyes, broken, Roman nose, and expressive mouth are mesmerizing. With the right role, he could (and should) be a major star in the US, as he has been for some time in his native Spain. Every move he makes is compelling to watch, and he creates a sympathy for Arenas few other actors could manage. His narration of Arenas' poetry and prose is patient and soulful, adding much to the already gorgeous shots of rural and urban settings (the film employs archival footage from Cuba, but was filmed in Merida and Veracruz, Mexico, in the Yucatan, the region of Mexico closest to Cuba).Because the film is based on a memoir, it proceeds episodically, following the young Arenas from his boyhood to his early accomplishments as a poet and novelist through his imprisonment and later his escape to the United States during Castro's 'purge' of undesirables in 1980 (the same means by which Tony Montana escapes Cuba in 'Scarface'), when criminals and homosexuals were invited to voluntarily expatriate to Miami so that the demand for basic resources in Cuba under the US-led embargo could be relieved somewhat. The film spends considerable time reflecting on Arenas' sexual initiation and his gay lifestyle, which is slightly problematic in that it suggests that Arenas was persecuted solely for being homosexual, which is at best a half-truth. Though Arenas himself was probably persecuted less for his lifestyle than for his public criticism of the regime, it is probably not inaccurate in its portrayal of the turn against art, life, and experimentation taken by Castro's brutal totalitarian ethos. In any case, Arenas ultimately makes his way to New York with his friend Lazaro (Olivier Martinez), where in 1987 he began to suffer symptoms of AIDS. He died in 1990, after which his memoir and several letters condemning Castro and the failure of the US to rescue the Cuban people from his tyranny were published, to wide acclaim.The film should not be overly criticized for its historical errors and omissions, because it is primarily a showcase for Schnabel's artistry as a director and Bardem's astonishingly charismatic performance as Arenas. The film is also graced by fine performances by Martinez as Lazaro, who rebuffs Arenas' sexual advances but later becomes his dearest and most trusted friend; Johnny Depp in dual roles as a jail house transvestite who helps Arenas smuggle his manuscripts out to the world and as a sadistic prison guard; Sean Penn as a farmer who encounters the young Arenas on the road to Havana; and Michael Wincott as Herbet Z. Ochoa, a poet and essayist forced to publicly renounce his art by a Communist tribunal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow but beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The little-discussed topic of the persecution of homosexuals in Castro's Cuba is the prevailing theme throughout Julan Schnabel's masterful film of the life of writer Reinaldo Arenas. But this is far more than a simple piece of political agit-prop; instead, it's a beautifully constructed movie about the artistic temperament but with plenty of the same quality itself; visually, the movie is consistently striking, and yet of a piece. There's also a fine performance from Javier Bardem in the lead role. What the film doesn't do very much is follow it's characters in real time for anything longer than the duration of a snapshot; this slightly distances the viewer from the mechanics of the drama, and in consequence, at times it feels slow. Instead, it communicates through images (and fragments of the writer's own poetry); and the scene where the hot air balloon rises through the roof of a ruined church is so perfectly created it's a work of art in itself. 'Before Night Falls' is not light entertainment; but it's seriously good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many praises for a movie about freedom and artistic expression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Night Falls is a brilliantly devised and executed account about the famed Cuban novelist Reinaldo Arenas. The film documents his childhood as a peasant, his support for Castro's rebels as an idealist youth, and as a man, his struggles, not just as an independent thinker but also as a gay man living in Communist Cuba. Throughout the film we respond to his hopes, fears, and claustrophobia as we witness the persecution of a true artist.As a student of Latin American History and Literature I was pleased with the way the film handled the historical context of Arenas' time. The political context of Before Night Falls shouldn't come as any surprise. The artistic, social and political invisibility of gays in Cuba under the Cuban Revolution represented a dark stain on the revolutionary record. In 1965 Fidel Castro told Lee Lockwood (in Castro's Cuba, Cuba's Fidel) that `we would never come to believe that a homosexual could embody the conditions and requirements of conduct that would enable us to consider him a true Revolutionary, a true communist militant. A deviation of that nature clashes with the concept we have of what a militant Communist must be' In the mid-1960's, the infamous UMAP work camps (Unidades Militares de Auyuda a la Producción) sought to rehabilitate what they perceived as alleged antisocial elements. This is an event that is accurately depicted in Schnabel's film. The purges and denunciations of homosexuals continued into the 1980's. Today in Cuba discrimination against gays still represents a major problem. The revolution dealt with gender and racial discrimination but not with discrimination against gays. This is all documented with stunning use of archival footage and reference accounts from Arenas' autobiography.Any review of the film would be incomplete without mentioning Javier Bardem's work. I have seen a lot of movies and few performances are even in the same league as Bardem's. I was fascinated with how he carried this film with a performance that must have been very difficult for him to adjust to. The supporting work by Johnny Depp should also be praised. His dual performance, for me, accurately identified how many within Castro's army may have used their positions as a front to deny their own sexuality as well. Overall, I was very impressed with this film and I highly recommend it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evocative film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Evocative and moving story based on the life of Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas. The film has excellent acting from Javier Bardem (and smaller but equally excellent performances from Johnny Depp and Sean Penn), wonderful scenery and, most of all, powerful and moving snippets from the work of a novelist whose poetic powers can inspire and lift above the poverty of life or bring emotional poignancy to the depths. This is set in a country where, under Castro's rule, there is no "upper class" - and yet where brutal intolerance can be shown to any 'misfits'. Arenas happens to be homosexual, which is unacceptable, and his poetry extols natural beauty (which is, it seems, seen as counter-revolutionary). The writer survives torture and imprisonment but his works survive and the success of his novels prove an inspiration to him as he survives in abject conditions. The film is a bit slow to start, and occasionally meandering, but overall it provides a powerful piece of cinema.</fullReview>

Javier Bardem gives a towering performance as Arenas, the famous Cuban poet who found himself constantly in a state of being unwanted by the world around him, and yet still full of the ability to see the beauty in it. Using stock footage of Castro's military-ruled Cuba, a haunting score by Carter Burwell (with Lou Reed and Laurie Anderson), and many cameos by famous actors (Sean Penn being the only one that really misfires, Michael Wincott being an exceptionally good one), director Julian Schanbel has created one of the most touching, affecting and polished film works of the whole year.

		<shortDescription>A Lyrical Fight for Survival, without the Survival</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Night Falls (2000)A Lyrical Fight for Survival, without the SurvivalFilmed with such undistracting and unrelenting imagination, Before Night Falls is not only beautiful and seamless, it's a surprise, frame after frame. And it manages to keep flowing visually, with invention, without distracting from the personal plight of the central character, the writer Reinaldo Arenas. Add the full blooded performance by Javier Bardem, who is something of a one man show, and the movie is intrinsically special.Julian Schnabel is turning out to be a better movie director than artist, maybe because his tendency toward formal invention made his art contrived while in the movie world this formalism is embedded with more evident meaning, and so it has something to support beyond its own effects. His subjects show a consistency that reveals an artistic devotion to himself, yes, as an auteur, or as a concerned person. Herzog might be another good example, offhand. From the flawed Basquiat to the compelling (and depressing) The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Schnabel digs into those people who are pushed to be exceptional. All three of these films, at least, are about individuals with enormous talent and resolve, but they are all three also driven by circumstance to be even greater than themselves, or to make themselves into something beyond what even they expected. All of Schnabel's films are artfully made without being indulgent--even the exaggerated special effects used in Diving Bell are necessary.And all three of these examples end in affecting, very personal tragedy. After the Lou Reed concert film diversion (which I haven't seen), it'll be worth watching what this relative newcomer to the movies brings out next.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.The subject here is a natural sensitive who finds a layer of beauty in unexpected cracks in reality. The harder the reality, and the more unexpected niches he makes, the more sweetly surprising are the nuggets he places.But this is not a great writer, not someone who can compose. He is an artist of snippets.Now along comes Schnable, a man of similar sensibilities. He is also a man with no patience for shaping the whole. He reacts locally. But he has lots of talented friends. So what we end up with is a pot luck. Overall it is respectful, and in places it has local beauty. I knew something of Schnable, so avoided this for a while: he has found a market for an artistic philosophy based on attention deficit disorder and that's just not good enough for me.But this has Penn and Depp (Depp in two proximate roles) and any project with them is worth the investment. Depp smuggles the book out of prison in his rectum. If you know their own lives in art, you can see them presented here with no directorial filter whatsoever.Two really annoying things: the two most beautiful gems in this film are shots of the water and a remarkable balloon trip. The former is stoled from Greenaway (`Water Wrackets') and the latter directly lifted from Tarkovsky (`Andre Rublev'). This is not simple quoting. This is not fair use of a vocabulary. This is theft and is indicative of the general lack of artistic vision in this project.The DVD has a tour of Schnable's loft where he pontificates on his pieces of frozen performance art from a more confused and artistically hungry era: `Here is where I had tea with M- and slapped the teasoaked tablecloth against the canvas.' `Here is where I dragged the canvas behind a jeep.'This is for the Hallmark set which thinks it is hip because its small proverbs center on revolution, gayness and aids.Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fascinating glimpse into Castro's Cuba</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** `Before Night Falls' is a compelling film that works on several different levels simultaneously: as a biography of the late Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas; as a scathing indictment of Castro's repressive Communist regime; and as a celebration of the human spirit flourishing under even the most adverse of circumstances. What it doesn't quite do, though, is dig very deeply into the mind and spirit of its main character. We are fascinated by the atmosphere and events that define this life story. We just don't feel like we get to know very well the man at its core.The film, which spans five decades (from 1943 - 1990), stars the brilliant Javier Bardem as Arenas, a homosexual writer caught in a culture openly hostile to both homosexuals and writers. One of the theses that the film posits - one taken directly from Arenas' writings - is that governmental repression often has the paradoxical effect of actually ENCOURAGING the very elements it is trying to stifle. Thus, for a while at least, Arenas is allowed to express fairly openly his homosexual nature. In fact, it is even pointed out to us that a number of high government officials are allowed to flagrantly display their sexuality with little or no consequences. Yet, at the same time, the government has set up concentration camps filled with gays and other political prisoners. But it is not so much for his sexuality that Arenas is eventually incarcerated and tortured - it simply provides a convenient excuse - but for his radical anti-Castro ideas as reflected in his poetry and novels. For it is ideas that most threaten any totalitarian regime, and Castro's is certainly no exception.The movie is so ambitious in its scope and time frame that it occasionally loses us along the way. Every now and then we are not quite sure who is who, where we happen to be, or what exactly is happening in the story. This is partly the result of Julian Schnabel's rather impressionistic directorial style, providing us with quick cuts of imaginings and/or memories that flash through Arenas' mind. The problem is that we can't always tell which is a memory and which a mere fanciful vision. For instance, in one scene, a desperate Arenas, in an attempt to evade the authorities, sails out for Florida in nothing more than an old inner tube. The way the scene is shot we are led to believe, initially, that he has made it safely to America's shore, only to discover later that he is still on Cuba. It is a minor point, but the style often leaves us feeling unnecessarily disoriented at times.On the other hand, the style also contributes a strangely dreamy, otherworldly feel to the film. This matches perfectly the rather exotic nature of Arenas himself, a man who seems to be torn between accepting his homosexuality and fighting the demons that come along with being a societal outcast. When Arenas finally makes it to the `land of freedom' as part of the Mariel boat lift of 1980, fate deals him another cruel blow in the form of AIDS. Yet, Arenas' words live on, a testament both to the cruelty and brutality of life under a dictatorship and to the strength of spirit reflected in any artist who tries to overcome it.As Arenas, Barkem gives a riveting performance, going far beyond the subtle effeminate mannerisms that define the character's surface. Yet, strangely enough, even though the film runs well over two hours and there is almost no scene in which Arenas is not present, we never feel like we really get to know him very well. Perhaps it is because, in his romantic relationships, in particular, Arenas remains such an inscrutable enigma. Apart from his sexual orientation, we often can't tell what makes this character tick. This is why Barkem's performance is so indispensable to the film. The richness he provides in his every word, facial expression and gesture makes Arenas a very real and very recognizable figure. Without Barkem, `Before Night Falls' would be much less compelling than it is.And the fact is, that for all its imperfections, `Before Night Falls' IS a very compelling film, in terms of style, performance, atmosphere and theme. Despite the dissatisfaction we may feel with the film at times, the truth is that the story itself is so gripping that our interest never flags for a moment. And if for no other reason than for the uncompromising glimpse it affords into the hitherto unexamined world of Castro's Cuba, the film cries out to be seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Javier Bardem gives a quietly powerful performance in this, the life story of Cuban novelist, poet, and exile Reinaldo Arenas, who died of AIDS in New York in 1990.Arenas was born, like most Cubans, in abject poverty in 1943. He lived with his grandparents until Castro's revolution came (the cinematography in this section of the film is particularly breathtaking); then he went off to fight with the rebels. With Castro in power, Arenas grows up to become a novelist and poet. He publishes his first novel and becomes something of a young author on the rise.And then Castro starts cracking down on homosexuality.A little-known fact about Castro's government is his complete lack of tolerance for homosexuality. Concentration camps are set up on distant parts of the island, and Arenas finds that his friends are disappearing, being swept off of the streets or beaches by Castro's secret police. Arenas himself is being watched. He manages to write another novel and have it smuggled out to be published in foreign countries, and is jailed for his efforts. In prison, Arenas continues to write and to see that his work is delivered to people that can publish it. No matter what Castro's people do to him, no matter how they treat him, no matter what threats they make, there are two things about Arenas that remain constant: his art and his sexuality.When Arenas is released from prison, he desperately wants to escape Cuba so he can write and live in whatever way he chooses. The last part of the film is primarily concerned with Arenas' escape attempts. It's no secret that Arenas got away; he died in New York City, not in Havana. It's what his life becomes after his escape that's supposed to be interesting.You can rack up another name on the list of people who got screwed at the Oscars by the hopelessly mediocre, bizarrely beloved "Gladiator" in 2000. Javier Bardem's performance in this film was easily and without doubt the best of the year. He holds the audience's attention with such grace and he makes it look so easy - it's the kind of performance that should be burned into the minds of everyone who loves film.If you look closely, you'll catch an unrecognizable Sean Penn in a blink-and-you-miss-him cameo that actually ranks among his most unusual screen moments. Johnny Depp also puts in a brief appearance, as a drag queen in prison and, in an exceptional one-on-one scene with Bardem, as the prison's sadistic warden.Bardem's performance is supported by well-captured images of Castro's Cuba. The cinematography stands out here almost as much as Bardem's performance does. Director Julian Schnabel keeps the action compelling, moving things along at the pace you'd expect from a biopic - until the last twenty minutes or so of the film, when he inexplicably slows the pace to a crawl. Once Arenas leaves Cuba, all the momentum of the movie seems to just stop. Even Bardem, so fascinating for almost two hours, nearly becomes uninteresting in the last part of the movie.It's a small price to pay for two hours of excellence, however.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bardem Is Great, But Film Itself Left Me in the Cold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It wasn't until "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly" that I warmed to the work of Julian Schnabel. Before that there was "Basquiat," which I actively disliked, and then there was "Before Night Falls," which I didn't dislike exactly, but which I also didn't exactly enjoy.No complaints about the performance of Javier Bardem, before anyone knew who he was, as Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. But the film plays out as so many other biopics do, and it's pretty bleakly depressing by the time it's over. The final scenes, as we watch Arenas slowly disintegrate due to AIDS, are especially tough.You might need to be a fan either of Schnabel the director or Arenas the poet to fully appreciate this movie. It wouldn't surprise me if everyone else felt somewhat left out in the cold by it.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dare I Say ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... That this film will appeal far more to a gay audience than a mainstream one ? BEFORE NIGHT FALLS follows the life story of Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas who was a homosexual and thus was persecuted by Castro's regime . It's actually nice to see a movie pointing out that when it comes to homosexuality socialist regimes are no more tolerant than fascist ones or countries ruled by religious fundamentalists but the point about Reinaldo being oppressed by the state due to his sexual orientation seems hammered home too often where we see scenes of suspected homosexuals being rounded up . Toleterian regimes do not tolerate any type of art unless it's sanctioned by the party . Couldn't we have learned more about Reinaldo's poetry and how this was seen as a threat to the regime ? It would have probably made for a better story Many people have praised the performance of Spanish actor Javier Bardem as Reinaldo . I've never heard of Bardem before seeing this movie and have no idea of how difficult it is for a Spanaird to play a Cuban but I'll take everyone's word that this is a great performance . I didn't even realise that Johnny Depp played two roles in this movie but I was swept away by his role as the interrogator , so much so that I forgot it was a famous Hollywood star acting and I can't fault the performances in the movie But apart from the over emphasis on the homosexual aspects I do have a problem with the script and directing . The story is fairly episodic and disjointed and there's scenes that I didn't understand . For example Reinaldo just manages to walk out of prison which I found a bit too incredible to be taken seriously and while he's on the run he writes letters to the UN and International Red Cross - And leaves them hidden under stones ! So if a dissident is on the run in any country in the world if he leaves a message begging for help under a stone an international organisation will find it and take up his case . I didn't get that bit and there's a couple of other scenes like this which confused rather than involved me in the story</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating -- as a train wreck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of Reinaldo Arenas, a gifted poet and novelist who was in turn, suppressed, incarcerated, and brutalized, in Castro's Cuba before gaining exile in the US. Truly, this should be a fascinating story. But, simply telling this story is not enough for director Julian Schnabel. Schnabel overwhelms the art of his subject with his own directorial artistry.We get few samples of what Arenas' gift for poetry and prose -- no sense of how he diffuses the many images of his mind's eye into his art. Instead we are bombarded with montages set to music; we are switched to and from English and Spanish for no apparent reason. The dialect of English spoken by most of the cast is so dense that you pray for the parts that are spoken in Spanish so you can read the subtitles. Director Schnabel prides himself for disregarding normal conventions and thinks nothing of whisking us from actual events into various characters' imaginations without burdening us by letting us know which is which. The result is a study in abstract art. Those who love to interpret their movies will love it. People like me who like to follow a coherent plot and hear dialogue will be bewildered and frustrated.Javier Badem is handsome as anything, but his one-note performance, despite the perceived nobility of his character, certainly didn't deserve an Academy Award nomination ahead of Cuba Gooding, Jr., among others. I found this to be a true disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Outstanding Performance of Javier Bardem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Before Night Falls" is a good movie. However, the most important point to be highlighted is the outstanding performance of Javier Bardem, in the role of Reinaldo Arenas, a Cuban poet and writer. But unfortunately, the script and the direction were not in the same level of this great actor. The impression transmitted of Reinaldo Arenas in the movie is mostly of a gay artist, persecuted by a dictatorial regime not because of his ideas, but because of his behavior being gay. Even his death due to Aids is not clear in the movie. Maybe readers of this writer may find points in the script to be sympathetic with Reinaldo Arenas, but for an outsider of his biography and books, the plot does really show him as a homosexual writer persecuted by a dictatorial regime. The plan of the ideas is not emphasized in the movie. Javier Bardem deserved a better direction and script for such a performance! My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Antes do Anoitecer" ("Before Night Falls")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Javier Bardem shines in this biography of a Cuban writer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie tells the story of Reinaldo Arenas, a homosexual Cuban writer and novelist that was chased during the communist period in Cuba. Only from this brief summary, you can see how powerful this life story is, and even though I haven't read the novel of the same name in which the movie is based on, it seems like the writers took full advantage of Reinaldo's story, going from his poor childhood in the Cuban countryside to his exile in the United States.The main role here goes to Spanish-born actor Javier Bardem. The only movie with him that I've watched is No Country for Old Men, and though he is outstanding in that picture, he does a much better job here. His acting is absolutely perfect. In every scene he is (almost the whole movie), he steals your attention. He is Reinaldo Arenas in this picture, no question about it. He deserved every award he got. And he does that with a supporting cast that has names like Sean Penn (in a very tiny appearance), Johnny Deep (playing two roles), Brazilian-born director Hector Babenco (also a small role), Diego Luna and other unknown actors.Julian Schnabel also does a very nice job directing. Even though a few of the shots reminded me a lot of Schnabel's latter The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, with very similar underwater sequences, shots of people in open cars, and open shots of the town and the woods, I appreciate his style. One shot in particular that is worth mentioning is the one in the beginning of the movie that comes out of the hole Reinaldo is playing and becomes an open shot of the small town. Beautiful work of directing. Another aspect that is worth mentioning is the photography. Both directors of photography do an excellent job, and the movie looks almost like a painting most of the time.From all this I have mentioned, this movie would get a 9 rating. But a few things bothered me. First, the movie is quite boring and slow most of the time, because of the lousy editing by Michael Berenbaum. You could easily cut off 20 minutes of the film. And also there are too many childhood memories throughout the movie completely unnecessary. But what bothered me the most is the language issue. This movie suffers from the same problem as Elia Kazan's Viva Zapata. Both of them have great acting and directing, and all the character's speak in English, but they should be talking Spanish! If this is Cuba, you expect a Spanish-talking picture, but instead you get a few random lines in the correct language. I know this is made to attract north-American audiences, but they should be faithful to the story. Thankfully, Julian Schnabel doesn't make the same mistake in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly. There, they speak French in France!Overral, this is a great film with outstanding acting and directing, but the language issue and the lousy editing keeps this movie alway from having a better rating. A must-see for Javier Bardem and Johnny Deep fans (the only time you can see him as a transsexual).7,5 out of 10, that in this case goes back to a 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The panorama of imminent terror..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Javier Bardem gives one incredible performance in this wrenching auto-biography of Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas who, in 1980, sought political asylum to the United States via his homosexuality after suffering for years under Castro's laws decrying political dissidents and sexual deviates. Born in the north Province of Oriente in Cuba in 1943, Arenas was raised mostly by his female relatives, his father having been banished from the family early on by his mother. Before he was a teenager, Arenas was already writing (carving words on tree trunks for the lack of paper); by the 1960s, he was in Havana studying at the university and winning awards and admirers. These early scenes work best for the film, as the narrative is lean and direct, and the lovely visual attributes (courtesy cinematographers Xavier Pérez Grobet and Guillermo Rosas) clearly delineate a particular (and turbulent) time and place with astonishing skill. The picture truly looks ravishing, and director Julian Schnabel relaxes the pace to help the viewer take it all in. Yet, after Arenas is arrested on fatuous molestation charges--and escapes from custody, and then gets caught and is put through hell--the film becomes more obscure, relishing in artistic flourishes but losing its immediacy. Arenas becomes the Patron Saint of Suffering. When Reinaldo finally gets to New York City, what should have been an exhilarating moment is squashed together with his sickness and death (10 years later!). It is to Bardem's credit as an actor that the final scenes work at all, because by this point we have lost touch with the inner-workings of the artist. Putting a writer's life on film has always been a difficult task for movie-makers (the process of creating isn't always a cinematic one), but Schnabel was doing so well in the first and second acts--allowing Reinaldo's talents to bloom--that it's doubly disappointing his final curtain should play as melodrama. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Lonely Child of Always</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julian Schnabel's "Before Night Falls" initially impresses as an extraordinarily photographed film, by Xavier Perez Grobet and Guillermo Rosas; their use of color is especially beautiful. For someone unaware of the subject (as I was), the narrative is sometimes confusing. The film is a biography of Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas (1943-1990), who is played by Javier Bardem. Mr. Bardem's characterization is about as convincing as they come; he gradually "paints" his role into your viewing consciousness. And, he carries the story through some rough waters. His performance is definitive "Best Actor" material. Also, watch out for Sean Penn, under hat and make-up, as he gives young Reinaldo a lift, after the boy leaves home. Later on, during a prison sequence, Johnny Depp essays a couple of amazing characterizations, as "Bon Bon" and "Lieutenant Victor"; Mr. Depp's acting, and his decisions regarding his successful career, are quite admirable. Handsome Andrea Di Stefano (as Pepe) and handsome Oliver Martinez (as Lazaro) are among Bardem's "Best Supporting" boyfriends. In sum, Mr. Schnabel, Bardem, and the photographers deserve accolades for this good nightfall.Additionally, investigate writer Reinaldo Arenas (as I did): "I am that child of always / Before the panorama of imminent terror / Imminent leprosy, imminent fleas / Of offenses and the imminent crime / I am that repulsive child that improvises a bed / Out of an old cardboard box and waits / Certain that you will accompany me?" ******** Before Night Falls (2000) Julian Schnabel ~ Javier Bardem, Oliver Martinez, Johnny Depp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reinaldo Arenas: Leonardo da Vinci was homosexual, so was Michelangelo, Socrates, Shakespeare, and almost every other figure that has formed what we have come to understand as beauty.It is fascinating that the socialist government in Cuba would take the same position as right-wing religious leaders in our country. I am sure that James Dobson, Pat Robertson, and others like them would not be happy to know that they are no different than Fidel Castro.This was the story of the poet Reinaldo Arenas, his mistreatment at the hands of the Cuban government, and his eventual escape to America in the Mariel boat lift; and Javier Bardem (Mar adentro, No Country for Old Men) was magnificent in the role that played almost like a documentary. The film was cinema-graphically brilliant, filmed near Cuba in the Yucatan. The soundtrack was equally impressive.Besides Bardem, it also featured Johnny Depp (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy). Depp played a dual role as Bon Bon, a transvestite and was also Lt. Victor, the head of the prison in which Arenas was incarcerated. I am continually amazed at Depp's versatility.An outstanding Latino cast in a super film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a film about how creativity can flourish under oppression-well worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A friend and I were recently discussing how the urge to create often burns more fiercely when it has been suppressed. Such is the theme of Before Night Falls, the biography of Cuban novelist/poet Reinaldo Arenas, whose life illustrates how creativity can flourish even under oppression, and what freedom truly means. Born in an extremely poor province in 1943, Arenas nevertheless revels in the natural beauty that surrounds him. `The splendor of my childhood was unique because of its absolute poverty and absolute freedom,' he later noted. Clearly a born poet, the boy expresses himself by carving words into the family's trees, much to his grandfather's furor. When he's 15, Arenas' family moves to Holguin, where the romance of Castro's rebel troops and their attempts to overthrow Batista inspire him to leave home and join the insurrection. Four years later he's acclimating to big city life in Havana and enjoying a job at the prestigious National Library that Communism has awarded him. But alongside Castro's revolution, a concurrent sexual revolution is brewing, and Arenas begins to embrace his homosexuality. He plunges himself into his writing, develops a circle of poets and lovers, and at age 20, writes the first of nine novels, the only one published in his homeland.By the late 60s, Castro's jackals begin to send artists and homosexuals to concentration camps and suppress their work. Despite the lingering threat, Arenas continues to write outspokenly, and when his second book is censored, he enrages Castro by smuggling it to France for publication.[plot spoiler?] We watch with horror as this brutal regime harasses, imprisons, and ultimately exiles Arenas to America for having `weak, nonrevolutionary (i.e., homosexual) genes.' He has dared to express beauty, and beauty, as a mentor notes, is the enemy of any dictatorship.But Arenas' spirit is such that even in a medieval-style prison chamber, amidst the screams and cries, he finds that he has never written so much. He composes letters for the inmates, and when they reward him with cigarettes, he uses the rolling paper to pen his third novel, Before Night Falls.Director/painter Julian Schnabel (BASQUIAT) has given us a film of many strengths, including the juxtaposition of the fertile natural world against Arenas' suffering at the hands of sadistic oppressors. The film opens with a pan through the treetops, sensually caresses the ocean tides, and when Arenas finally makes it to New York, rewards him with a magnificent baptism of snow falling gently on his face.It's hard to play a writer. Most of us eschew Stallone-style emoting, and much of our work plays out in our heads and on the page--not the stuff of box office. But Spanish actor Javier Bardem delivers a phenomenal performance as Arenas, infusing him with depth, will and supreme sensitivity. And if you've yearned to see Sean Penn as a Cuban peasant and Johnny Depp in drag (called `Bon-Bon,' no less), here's your golden opportunity.My wish list for this film would include a more understandable narrator and fewer unexplained incidents. This is another biopic that requires background reading to fully understand what's going on, especially after Arenas arrives in New York. I also would have loved hearing more of Arenas' voice. In the film's most successful passages, the narradore reads from his work, lines like `My grandmother was the only woman I've ever known who could pee standing up and talk to God at the same time.'But all told, this memorable, `triumph of the human spirit' film, pulsing with Cubanismo, is well worth witnessing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film yesterday. I am not a film critic as some who post here seem to be, so my opinion is clearly not as "expert" as theirs. I loved the film even though I thought it had a few flaws. Javier Bardem's performance was totally fascinating. It seemed at times that the film was a documentary, it seemed so believable to me. The inclusion of actual footage of Cuba, Castro's speeches, etc, certainly contributed to that feel. The changes in tone - the documentary-ish scenes, mixed with fantasy and almost magical realism (the party scene with the hot air balloon made me think of Fellini) could have been distracting, but actually I thought the changes worked.What I would change about the film - I would have liked the dialog in Spanish better. All those accents - I don't know, didn't ring true for me. At least Bardem was able to approximate a Cuban accent (so unlike Antonio Banderas in "Mambo Kings"...that one was terribly painful to hear.)Other reviews I've read here seem to miss the point of the film, which for me is freedom. Focusing too much on specific themes really is beside the point. I thought it was a compelling portrait of beauty struggling to exist despite every effort to exterminate it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Julian Schnabel has a superb visual sense, evident from the very first scene of the dense tropical forest with voice-over narration. At every moment, Schnabel's visual poetry accentuates, compliments, illustrates the poetic life of Arenas. While he gives the story room to breathe, he never abandons the narrative thread which takes keeps us involved from beginning to end.The core of the film is in Javier Bardem's wonderfully charismatic performance of the censored Cuban poet and novelist Renaldo Arenas. If one compares this performance with his others (e.g. "The Sea Inside" and "No Country for Old Men,") it is hard not to conclude that he is one of the very best actors working today.The film is a ruthless look at the abuses inflicted upon art in totalitarian regimes. Arenas is persecuted because he is gay, but chiefly because he is an artist who refuses to compromise his ideals or stop writing. His story is inspirational, and it is a great testament to Schnabel that he was able to make a film that makes such a strong artistic statement of its own, but compliments and accentuates Arenas's story, rather than overwhelming it.A masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Painter Julian Schnabel directed this outstanding biopic about Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. It's a thorough revision to his whole life, from the day that he was born till the day he died. To be a dissident homosexual writer in Castro's dictatorship marked his existence. He was trapped in the island and suffered all kind of humiliations and tortures, but he eventually could exile in New York.Despite Schnabel is not a professional film-maker he applied his artistic sense to the film, and it results tough and poetic at the same time. Anyway, "Before night falls" wouldn't be no big deal without the impressive work of Javier Bardem. His performance is so intense and choosing him to get into Arenas' skin was the best decision possible Schnabel could've taken. Bardem proves that he's not only an actor with an impressive physique and so temperamental but also he's capable of perform sensitive characters. He's a genius.As for the script maybe is not accurate enough and some things are not very clear (the passage of time for example), but it is a magnificent movie anyway.*My rate: 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film, Needed More Editing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spanish-born actor Javier Bardem gives a staggering performance as Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas in Julian Schnabel's "Before Night Falls" is based on Reinaldo Arenas' memoir and relates his imprisonment in Cuba and subsequent exodus to the United States. Born a peasant in the 1943, Arenas had the great misfortune of being a gay writer in a country that considered art and homosexuality to be counter-revolutionary. After almost fifteen years of living in both jail and freedom, Arenas was eventually sent to America in 1981 as a part of the Mariel boat lift which later became infamous for being made up of several psychotics and habitual criminals. Ten years later, at the age of 47, Arenas dies of AIDS.Fidel Castro sparked a revolution against Batista in the 1950's. By 1959, Castro was basically in full power of Cuba and controlled the country with the Communist party under his dictatorship. The country soon became a total authoritarian state and civil liberties were disregarded. Youths rebelled against this, with song, with poetry, and soon became a distinctive development in Cuban music and culture. Anyone who did not follow orders from Castro's army, or who did not live the "normal" lifestyle, set down by Castro, were sent to camps to be re-educated. Reinaldo Arenas was one of these rebels.The beautiful cinematography was joined with an amazing cast of international stars, including dual roles by a hysterically memorable Johnny Depp ("Pirates of the Caribbean" and "Finding Neverland"), Sean Penn ("I Am Sam" and "Mystic River"), who convincingly played a Cuban, Michael Wincott ("Along Came a Spider"), and Olivier Martinez ("Unfaithful") as Arenas' platonic best friend. Bardem's acting ability does a beautiful job at holding together a movie that at times seems very disjointed and long-winded. Schnabel seems to have tried to film the movie to fit the feeling and fluidity of Arenas' poetry, but succeeded in making a beautifully visual film that needs a little more editing for the final cut. Nevertheless, Schnabel does a very good job in telling the life of a 47-year-old man in only 130 minutes, and successfully painted the picture depicting the influences of Arenas' writing. The language choices made the movie a bit confusing, as the actors spoke English with Cuban accents so heavy that it was hard to understand what was being said. It was equally annoying when characters would start speaking Spanish in the middle of a scene with no subtitles to aid the viewer. It is no surprise that Bardem was nominated at the Oscars for Best Actor.This movie is no masterpiece, but is definitely worth seeing, especially if interested in post-WWII Cuba. It provides an interesting look into the Communist politics that deal with homosexuality in the past recent decades. The scenery and music transport the viewer to another world, and Bardem does an equally impressive job in making the story feel real.8 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A potentially great film hamstrung by several poor choices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People's revolutions begin with the best of intentions, such as removing unjust rulers, but often have an unfortunate tendency to go awry, exchanging one dictator for another. Cuba is an excellent example of this axiom: in 1959, a small band of revolutionaries led by a young lawyer named Fidel Castro ousted Fulgencio Batista, the US backed dictator. Castro would have been welcomed with open arms by the US, had he not embarked on a campaign of nationalization, which led to Cuba's regional isolation and eventual alliance with the Soviet Union. In keeping with communist doctrine, Castro the liberator became Castro the jailer and began purging the freethinkers and anyone who was "different". If you happened to be a gay author and poet, yours was a dismal future indeed. Reinaldo Arenas grew up poor and free, enjoying the liberation that only a child of the land can experience. His carefree world was shattered when a teacher discovered the boy's artistic bent, and communicated this to Reinaldo's grandfather. His reaction was to banish the boy and run away to the city. Undaunted, Reinaldo continued to nourish his talents and in the newfound post-revolution euphoria explored his sexuality. His ideas and sexual persuasion soon attracted the unwanted attention of an increasingly repressive regime, which would ultimately lead to his internment, re-education and exile.For the second time in as many months, I find myself having a hard time reviewing a movie. According to the trade journals, "Before Night Falls" made fifty film critics' top ten lists (not a difficult feat given the dearth of decent films in 2000), has won numerous awards and is "one of the best films ever made". In light of these rave reviews, I keep asking myself one question - "Did I miss something?" Spanish actor Javier Bardem ("Jamon Jamon") who infuses his portrayal with the appropriate emotional sensitivity and resolve brings Arenas to life. For Arenas, being forbidden to write was akin to being forbidden to breathe, he could not and would not cease his writing, even if it meant imprisonment and torture in a Cuban gulag. Like his passion for writingis sexuality, it was again not a matter of choice, which Bardem makes very clear. Johnny Depp adds another interesting character, or more appropriately characters, to his pantheon of performances in a dual role as a talented transvestite and a brutal military commander. His characters emphasize the duality of relationships in police states, where your best friend may be an informant and you trust no one (as many horrified East Germans discovered in post-wall Germany). Equally impressive was Andrea Di Stefano as Pepe, Reinaldo's part-time lover and all around bad influence. The technical aspects of the film are more ambiguous. Director Julian Schnabel's decision to splice in grainy film footage from post revolutionary Cuba was as bold as it was ingenious. The scenes, which contain little dialogue, contribute a tangible realism to the film, and convey the initial jubilation and eventual stifling repression of the newly "liberated" country. Music is also used very effectively to establish mood, with some surprising non-Latin choices- Lou Reed's "Rouge" substitutes for dialogue in a nightclub scene, and speaks more about betrayal than any words could. I do however, have several reservations about the film.At times, the direction and editing is erratic. This in turn disrupts the continuity of the film and makes several scenes difficult to follow. For example, while I realize that the film is about an author and poet, the inclusion of his poems is done haphazardly and serves little purpose. More importantly, while the poems are read in Spanish, the bulk of the dialogue is in English. This wouldn't normally be a concern, except that, several of the cast members have very thick accents and do not speak English well. It would have made more sense to have Spanish dialogue throughout and use English subtitles. As it was, I regularly had to strain to understand portions of dialogue and almost missed several key elements.Schnabel's film paints a beautiful and sometimes-ugly picture of one man's constant struggle against state-sponsored repression and discrimination. The story is especially poignant when you remember that events unfolding before you are true. In spite of excellent performances, and interesting direction choices, the directing is also inconsistent at times and several poor editing choices cause the film to drag in places. "Before Night Falls" is a very good film that should have been great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The director, Julian Schnabel, has a natural gift for moving-pictureimagery that may be unique among painters-turned-filmmakers.(Even the toweringly original Matthew Barney has less in-the-bonefilm sense than Schnabel.) This biography of the Cuban poetReinaldo Arenas conceives the artist's life as a series of pictorialand sensual raptures. When the young Arenas (played magnificently by Javier Bardem) is swept into a post-revolutionHavana nightclub by a lover, and whirls between a band, theamorous glances of bystanders, and the contortions of men in aswimming pool down below, Schnabel drops out the sound andbrings in Carter Burwell's churning, rhapsodic score--it's one of adozen euphoria-bursts that make you see stars.As the movie shuttles from Arenas' discovery of art and pleasure,to his persecution at the hands of Castro's homophobic cops, tohis deliverance and death on the shores of Manhattan, the fluid,juicily anecdotal screenplay leaves Schnabel plenty of room toexercise his gift: the romanticization of everything on earth. As in apoem by Frank O'Hara or Whitman, one senses a man keenlyaware of his own finitude racing toward one more minute of life asfast as his legs will take him. For all Arenas' agonies, BEFORENIGHT FALLS is a movie about ecstasy--possibly the mostconvincing grab-it-while-you-can movie ever made. And though ithas an assurance and a many-colored mastery that evokesHerzog and Bertolucci, the solarized images--humid, deliriouslydecayed, toxified yet serene--are one hundred percent Schnabel'sown.See it if for no other reason than the smash cut from Arenas'passage on a Mariel Harbor boat full of criminals, to a night spenton a flatbed truck, feeling one's face spattered with new-fallensnow while cruising past the ugly office buildings of midtownManhattan. Smack Schnabel however you will: he created one ofthe most indelible portraits of happiness ever put on the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The short life and times of Reinaldo Arenas.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julian Schnabel's second effort after his masterful Basquiat is another portrait of a fallen artist struck down in his prime but instead of the world of art, we journey into the realm of literature. Reinaldo Arenas is mostly unheard of in this country but this film's greatest asset will be to encourage people to seek out his work in order to, on some tangential level, gain access to the man. As with his earlier effort, Schnabel mixes his painterly past with the auspices of the biopic to create one of the most fascinating portraits of a writer put to film. I was privileged to see this film during the last New York Film Festival and this film although linear in telling, following Reinaldo from practically cradle to grave, we are presented with expressionistic episodes of his life as he becomes initiated to sex, finds his calling when he proves adept at writing, and his most important and ironically fatal decision to engage in homosexual liaisons at a time and place where the practice was looked down upon and ultimately his work and life suffered for it. Never demeaning or lurid, Reinaldo's life is looked upon with a untarnished and honest eye where his rich prose overcame his meager surroundings. A remarkable achievement on every level from the use of archival footage integrated into the narrative to the use of an up to the minute soundtrack (the beautiful Lou Reed/Laurie Anderson cello track `Rouge' during a Cuban club scene) in a period piece, Before Night Falls is one of the best films of the year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Episodic Is Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no doubt that Julian Schnabel knew exactly what he was doing and what he wanted in making this semi-bio on Cuban poet-novelist Reinado Arenas ('43-'90). Trouble is, how interesting a film is it? Clocking in at 133 minutes, it's a long time to wade through so much flabby footage to get to the good material.In a most meandering manner, the film mixes fact with fiction, and contains equally engrossing and tedious episodes. Often actors take too long to react to too little. Then again, the screen is filled with some compelling scenes, which make impressive statements. Like his "Basquiat," made four years earlier, Schnabel doesn't seem to be able to create a consistently viable product with a sense of directorial energy, timing, or structure.On the plus side is Javier Bardem's well executed lead performance. Almost unrecognizable American actors Sean Penn as Cuco Sanchez and Johnny Depp as a striking Bon Bon and slimy Lt. Victor also equip themselves extremely well. But it's Schnabel whose at the helm here. This self-proclaimed neo expressionist "lion of New York art world" painter-art director-writer-director is a bona fide talent. What seems in order is for someone to shape and direct that talent into something with more pertinence and drive. "Antes que anochezca" does have its followers, however, and they can continue to support Schnabel's esoteric art house film career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of talent goes to waste in this indifferent film. It's all surface and sentiment, with many brief scenes that aren't long enough to establish any dramatic energy. The director also seems to have an aversion to depicting the sexual exploits of the main character - perhaps out of misguided political correctness. The sound mix is muddy making strong accents hard to understand under music (espcially in the first ten minutes). When the film isn't in English it seems more to flow more easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema as a piece of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extraordinary film - of the dreamy and experimental kind but with a harsh and realistic story to tell. The real life of Cuban writer Reynaldo Arenas is showed from childhood in rural Cuba to death in New York in 1990, passing through his initial joining of Fidel Castro's revolutionaries and later his being persecuted for his homosexuality and for the anti-conformist writing he smuggled abroad. However much political the film might seem (and it is political, with documentary shots and bits of Castro's speeches interwoven), the real subject is loneliness. The language is poetic much more than ideological. Childhood dramas, the initiation to sexuality, the struggle with society and the estrangement of exile and disease come out not as statements but as high impact emotions - so much the stronger as the viewer is caught off guard. This is where cinema becomes art, where the emotions do not come from the plot alone but directly from the images and sounds. A brief, baroque party in a desecrated church, for example (with music, dancing, sex and alcohol - next to an hot air balloon ready to take off for Florida) becomes a fascinating hymn to rebellion - by force of colors and actors' faces alone. The cut is provocative, exaggerated and unusual all the way to the final credits, shots being put together apparently out of context, but then suddenly clicking into sense. A view of a powerful waterfall - for example - turns into rain in the woods in Cuba - over a voice reading a piece from Arenas. As Arenas is ill in New York, shots are alternated of the decaying sea front of La Habana and the seediest parts of his new city.The music is in Kubrick's style: witness a melancholic piece of classical music played over a scene of betrayal and seduction in a night club where people are dancing to the tune of salsa. Other parallels which come to mind are "Nick's Movie" (Arenas' final disease) and "Kiss of the Spider Woman" (Arenas' nasty prison term in La Habana). The "magic realism" of Latin American literature is an obvious source of inspiration (Jos? Lezama Lima is himself one of the characters of the film, with several other contemporary Cuban writers and intellectuals). One last point: why is this film on show in far away Italy (where it received a prize at the Venice Film Festival) and nowhere else?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this film because I am a big Javier Bardem fan. I am glad he has received international recognition but I wish it had been in a film that I could consider at least good. He has done much better work in much better films. I found this one tedious and boring with an uneven, undeveloped and fuzzy script. The characters were mostly "ghostly" in their development as was the situation. I left the movie thinking that the financial producers must have been a bunch of Miami Cubans set out to get as much anti-Castro propaganda out there as possible. Wholly unsatisfying and definitely not recommendable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A truly Fantastic performance by Javier Bardem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film with strong and powerful moments. The movie uses some documentary footage and exposition about the revolution in Cuba and the problems that people went through, but the real story is about a writer and his struggle to find peace and recognition.It took some time for me to get invested. It bothered me a bit because the movie is narrated by the writer and you see his life since he was young. So, you would expect you to be invested right away. But, for me it took some time in first act getting in to the story because here and there stock footage would pop up and it would take me out of it. Once the main character ends up being accused for something he didn't do, the film picks up and his journey becomes riveting.I like the vintage look of this film, the colors makes it feel like the film was made in the 60's and 70's. Johnny Depp is funny playing two roles, but the actor stealing the show is Javier Bardem who is fantastic in this performance. The movie does a good job in making you understand his motives and ambitions. Even though I didn't care much about his relations, you still understand the fact that it's just how he is personally and he doesn't try to force you to like him. He just appears like himself and doesn't try to be someone he isn't. Which makes the audience respect him.The scenes in a prison were really hard hitting, especially when he is forced to be in a tiny, tiny cell. That most be horrifying, and Bardem completely made you believe what kind of a traumatic affect it would have on someone. Brilliantly made.In short, a fantastic performance all the way through (especially towards the finale), but the film is a bit unbalanced and some of the most interesting parts of the story pass by too soon. It stays a little too long on the writer's romantic life in the beginning, and unfortunately that aspect wasn't as compelling as I think the filmmakers were hoping it would be. Everything about the writers escape and the prison scenes are however great and I would still recommend checking it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This autobiographical movie follows the life of Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas (Javier Bardem). It starts with his childhood in 1943. After the victory of the revolution, he gains friends and success as a young writer in Havana. It's heady days of a sexual revolution until his homosexuality is deemed dangerous. He tries to escape to America but is imprisoned. His writing gains some popularity outside of Cuba. In prison, he is surprisingly valued by the other prisoners for his writing skills. He writes his novel in between writing for everybody else. Bon Bon (Johnny Depp) is a transvestite inmate and Lt. Victor (Johnny Depp) is their vicious guard. Arenas becomes part of the boat lift exodus and arrives in New York.Javier Bardem is simply amazing. His presence is incredible. The movie is a bit long. The early childhood has interesting stuff but is not strictly necessary. It could have started around 1960 after Castro marches into Havana. It could be a bit more interesting style-wise. Johnny Depp is a little weird and seems out of place. Through it all, there is the great performance from Javier Bardem.</fullReview>

Pls try to learn the system in Cuba. Still making films to show the socialism bad is funny and doesn't give to me good feelings about the director and the producers. As a second point, it's very disturbing -- in the film -- that Cuban in Cuba speak English!!! WHY??!?!? This frequently happens in many films which disturbs me too much and causes me to stop seeing the film. I'm not sure if the following is spoiler? I don't think so. I'm not against the gays of course, i know that they born that way, but we watched many films on gays.. I personally don't want to see them kissing and having sex.

		<shortDescription>Poetry Continues In The Dark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Julian Schnabel's 'Before Night Falls' tells the story of poet and author Reinaldo Arenas who had grown up in Cuba during the revolution. Schnabel's approach in direction is quite unique. The use of a brownish filter gives it a distinct look highlighting the Cuban heat and making the overall colours more exotic. In addition the play on languages is done quite wonderfully. I liked that some of the dialogue and the recital of the poems were done in Cuban Spanish (maintaining the Cuban essence). The film itself has a lyrical flow and thanks to the vivacious cinematography and art direction, 'Before Night Falls' is visually appealing for the most part (as it is shown through Arenas's point of view). Humour is also used in a clever and subtle way even though the overall tone is quite dark. Javier Bardem once again delivers one of his career best works as he captures the poet's essence. His hard work has paid off. He is supported by an equally strong cast that includes Oliver Martinez, Johnny Depp and Diego Luna.In the end, 'Before Night Falls' is about artistic freedom and freedom of expression which was forbidden in Cuba and those who persisted were punished. But, Reinaldo was among the few who never gave up on his art and never stayed silent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Revenge.'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Visual artist Julian Schnabel was the perfect choice for bringing to the screen the richly colorful life and times of Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas (1943-1990). BEFORE NIGHT FALLS began as a book, Arenas' memoir, translated and released in 1993: time has aged the eloquence of this memoir but has not marred the impact of the brilliance of the writing. Arenas wrote with a degree of truth and keen observation that makes his moments of antics with his characters like comic relief in a Shakespearean play. The screenplay was written by Lázaro Gómez Carriles, Cunningham O'Keefe and Julian Schnabel who with great homage to Arenas made his life as narrated by Arenas, in an inextricable mix of his memories, dreams, nightmares and pure fiction. He grew up as poor, naked illegitimate child, joined Castro's Cuban revolution and became an intellectual, employed in the public library. After discovering his gay sexuality, he soon shares in the regime's inconsistent persecution. His work and life become dominated by the mix of temptation, fear, betrayal and man hunting in both senses. Finally he makes it to Manhattan, only to get caught in another trap for which there is only one tragic escape in the end - his death from AIDS.Arenas had a gift of distilling Magical Realism, transforming even the radical ugliness of Castro's Cuba into the topical paradise so beloved by Cubans everywhere. This cinematic version lets the viewer experience that rich literary output of one of the most exciting writers of the last century. For example, 'Walking along streets that collapse from crumbling sewers. Past buildings that you jump to avoid because they will fall on you. Past grim faces that size you up and sentence you. Past closed shops, closed markets, closed cinemas, closed parks, closed cafés. Sometimes showing dusty signs, justifications: "CLOSED FOR RENOVATION," "CLOSED FOR REPAIRS." What kind of repairs? When will these so-called renovations be finished? When at last will they begin? Closed... closed... closed... everything closed. I arrive, open the countless padlocks and run up the temporary stairs. There she is, waiting for me. I pull off the cover, and stare at her dusty, cold shape I clean of the dust and caress her. With my hand, delicately, I wipe clean her back, her base and her sides. In front of her, I feel desperate and happy. I run my fingers over her keyboard and suddenly it all starts up. With a tinkling sound the music begins, little by little, then faster; now full speed. Walls, trees, streets, cathedrals, faces and beaches. Cells, mini- cells, huge cells. Starry nights, bare feet, pines, clouds. Hundreds, thousands, millions of parrots. A stool, a climbing plant, they all answer my call, all come to me. The walls recede, the roof vanishes, and you float quite naturally. You float uprooted, dragged off, lifted high. Transported, immortalized, saved. Thanks to that subtle, continuous rhythm, that music, that incessant tap-tap.'Javier Bardem completely inhabits the poet that was Arenas - a performance so delicately nuanced that it remains one of the great moments in cinema. He is ably supported by Olivier Martinez as Lázaro Gómez Carriles, and incidental roles by Johnny Depp, Sean Penn, Diego Luna, Jerzy Skolimowski, Hector Babenco and a host of other fine actors. This is one of those films that remains a standard of the industry and certainly Javier Bardem will never be forgotten for his inhabiting the essence of what made Reinaldo Arenas a great writer. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A few days ago I bought "Before Night Falls" for only ?5. I'm big fan of Johnny Depp and that was the main reason why I bought this movie, even tough I didn't know anything about it. I watched it yesterday and I must say that this one is very good movie."Before Night Falls" is a story of Reinaldo Arenas, Cuban poet. It follows his life from childhood in Cuba to his death in New York. Arenas was also known for his open homosexuality; that mixed with his writing was a main reason why he was enemy of Castro's revolution. This movie is his story, his biography.Julian Schnabel is the main reason why this movie should be watched. His way of direction is amazing, and this was his second movie. My applause to you, Mr. Schnabel. What you got to have when your making a biographical movie is inspired leading actor. Schnabel choose Javier Bardem and he didn't make a mistake. Lots of people know, and started to appreciate him because of his role in "No Country for Old Men"; but Bardem's career is full of amazing roles. "Lunes al sol, Los", "Mar adentro"... Really great Spanish actor. I just cannot skip Depp. He again created characters that are great. He's here in a double role and he's memorable as Bon Bon/Lt. Victor. Olivier Martinez, Andrea Di Stefano, Michael Wincott are good and there is Sean Penn in a cameo role at the beginning. "Before Night Falls" is simply great movie of Schnabel, with strong Bardem's performance. Watch this biographical story about brave Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas, who had to pass through a hell just because he was different then others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Homophobic Revolution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Night Falls is based on the memoirs of poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas. This is one story of many counter-revolutionists who were awfully mistreated and eventually exiled from their homeland of Cuba because of their sexual preference. The film centered on Arenas and his openly gay lifestyle. Throughout the film there are references to the ideology of Arenas verses the Castro administration. The passive/aggressive demands the revolution had implanted onto the Cuban citizens and the affect it had on Arenas himself who was considered anti-revolutionary.While critics argue that Julian Schnabel (Director) should not have centered Arenas' mal treatment on his homosexuality, the discrimination among homosexuals ran rampant and was very much a focus of the Cuban administration and Arenas' true revenge against the insurgency. In 1965 Fidel Castro told Lee Lockwood (in Castro's Cuba, Cuba's Fidel) that "we would never come to believe that a homosexual could embody the conditions and requirements of conduct that would enable us to consider him a true Revolutionary, a true communist militant. A deviation of that nature clashes with the concept we have of what a militant Communist must be." Castro's strong definition of anti-revolutionary is exemplified throughout. Gays and Lesbians were considered a setback to the true communist Cuba and Castro's administration wanted not only ways of riding their population of its "scum," but also ways in which to hide it from outsiders. Arenas was imprisoned without trial, placed in (their form of) a rehabilitation camp with murders and rapists until released: only under the circumstances that he denied his creed and acknowledged being rid of his disease.Films such as these bring attention to those you have been wronged, discriminated and censored in groups by regimes that are supposed to serve all of their citizens. Forms of sexuality are viewed by some as a perversion because it doesn't follow their ideology. Arenas' philosophy of sexuality was so joined to his meaning of freedom. He references the ocean as his universe, the sexual organ, his never-ending exploration. Bit by bit small freedoms are being taken away from his life until finally he is pushed out of the only place he had ever known.An interesting part of the film is when Arenas is sitting on the beach with a group of friends. Arenas said, "Did you know there are four kind of gay men? An openly gay man, closet gay, married gay and a rich gay." This scene gives the audience insight to how Arenas viewed the occurring changes to the revolution. While the openly gay man refuses to hid their true self the closet gay or married gay hides in fear of being caught. The film shows an interesting part of the adaptation that takes place within Cuba, the forms that people took to survive.Homosexuality was formally decriminalized in 1979 and a year later the Castro government tried to purge Cuba of its "anti-social" dissidents, criminals and homosexuals by emigrating them to the US in the 1980 Mariel boat lift: Arenas was one out of 10,000 exiled. The Cuban societies have allowed some literature with gay subject matter to re-emerge. Other films have been released over the years along with Before night falls, examining the nation's homophobia. However, the state's treatment of homosexuals remains a subject of controversy. Gay and Lesbian associations are still illegal and according to the Human Rights Watch Report, the government to this day keeps a watch over nightclubs, restaurants and gatherings that are known to have gay client?le. The law provides for sanctions of up to one year in jail if homosexuality is "publicly manifested" ? interpreted broadly enough to include trans gender people or gay men who act in an "effeminate" manner, as well as any same-sex public displays of affection.This was a beautiful film that showed one person's personal struggle for free will and longing for the world that he lost. Governments in power do not control us, they serve us. We must appreciate the freedom that we have and never let it be taken away from us. All fundamental rules of nature and humanity are cycled through the film and play an important part in making the simple realization that we are all one and should not repress each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inspiring film, tells sad tale...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film Before Night Falls is a critically acclaimed feature film based upon the life of Cuban poet, Reinaldo Arenas. The film brings to life the memoir by the same name, written by Arenas in his final days living in exile, suffering from AIDS in New York. Directed by Julian Schnabel, an artist turned film maker, this film crosses the traditional lines of biographies in that we are reminded of the author and character at the same time, with this film's narrative technique. The characters are very genuine and solid in their performances; lead actor Javier Bardem is successful in his transformation into the historic Cuban icon. Javier Bardem's performance as Reinaldo Arenas earned him many Best Actor awards and nominations, including an Oscar nomination. While prizes are a measure of something, Bardem's acting is well beyond measurement. Bardem is so completely within his character, the role feels as if the real Reinaldo Arenas was simply in dress rehearsal. As a true story, Bardem gives a compelling performance as Arenas who comes to eventually live in New York City after years of struggling with torture and poverty in Cuba and then suffers with the AIDS virus. His character is incredibly detailed and layered with political voyeurism and the integrity to keep Arenas' intent as the priority. I seemed to find myself believing every action performed by this actor, without question Bardem and Arenas were one and the same within this film. The supporting actors found the same comfort within their roles, even the director's wife Olatz Lopez Garmendia did not seem out of place in her usual role within Schnabel's film, playing the role of Arenas' mother. Director Julian Schnabel, a successful American painter from the 1980's and 90's, crafts images of such breathtaking beauty that it hardly matters what's actually going on in the plot. The choice of soft, angelic music over the chaotic scenes gave viewers the mindset of Arenas. One that was truly in another far off place, Schnabel's ability to imply the mindset of his character with music is a gift in this film. At times the dialog was difficult, I do understand the use of English was there due to Schnabel being American but, I wish that the whole film, and not just a few segments, had been in Spanish. The film's use of Spanish at climatic events seemed to be more natural and reflected the Cuban cultural influence in an accurate manner. The use of poetry in assisting transitional periods of the movie was very creative; the director was successful in establishing a train of thought with the author. The thought of longing for a day free to be expressive with one's own sexuality and creative writings. The director does a nice job of rendering of Cuba in the 50s and 60s. The idea that you are there experiencing what Arenas did at that time of his life is there, the buildings, clubs, clothes and people. The description of the political situation seems accurate, both in the great expectations on the Revolution and the gradual conversion into a dictatorship. The use of historical clips adds to the authenticity of the film and characters. I have met Cuban nationals that left the island in the mid 1990's, their description of what they left seemed to match the settings found in this film. The sad part is this film was set 30 years in the past. It is easy to see why many view this film as propaganda, there is very little positive light shed on the Cuban culture of that time. The oppression is very real and stark; this is reflected by Arenas' writings, at a time when his life seemed most bleak, living poor and sick in the US. From the opening scene, with a boy in a hole to the final days of Arenas' life, this film's symbolism keeps you interested in the author. I found myself making an emotional investment, caring about a difficult life of another; you will care about his joys, hopes, dreams and struggles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrowing view of life in Castro's Cuba</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie disappointed me mostly because it requires editing and cutting. The director just seems to have included all the film he shot and as a result the viewer is often bewildered. There are abrupt shifts from one scene to another, and links to what follows or precedes are unclear. The fact that English and Spanish are spoken--as well as appearing in captions is also puzzling. Fortunately the actors, led by the great Javier Bardem, are all fine. Bardem shows us a detached intellectual--and incidentally gay--author so involved with his writing and his circle of friends that he is caught unawares by the vicious homophobia and anti-intellectualism of the Castro dictatorship. Bardem brilliantly enacts the horror of what happened to Arenas at the hands of Castro police/thugs. The final chapter of his life as he succumbs to AIDS is truly sad. I wonder if he ever received any help from PEN. Although I am critical of the overall direction of this film there are small satisfying bits scattered here and there. When Arenas puts a bit of the dirt from the flowerpot into his mouth one remembers the first pictures of the infant Arenas playing in the yard of his grandmother's house. A "Rosebud" moment!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard a lot of good things about this film so my expectations were high. I thought Bardim was excellent throughout the film but was slightly let down by the meandering storyline. Also I couldn't understand why they were speaking in English and occasionally in Spanish, is that what happens in Cuba? I ended up watching it with subtitles anyway because the accents were not always easy to understand. Then up pops Sean Penn looking like Wurzel Gummidge overdoing the haa-cent! Next thing you know it's the Johnny Depp show! Very convincing in drag but did he really need another role aswell. All this badly discredited the authenticity of this otherwise true and important story. It also goes on for a bit too long as the last half an hour drags. Having said all this I would still recommend the film as it is mostly very well directed, teaches you about life in Cuba before and after the revolution, has some very memorable scenes and an oscar nominated performance.

		<shortDescription>Production has some drawbacks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a story about freedom of expression versus political repression and concentrates on the hedonistic, homosexual and tragic life of Reinaldo Arenas (Javier Bardem) Cuban poet, novelist and playwright of the 60's and 70's.On the positive side the film gave us some exquisite camera work and Bardem must be acknowledged for his splendid interpretation of the unfortunate poet. The substance of the film provided some excellent material that could have been assembled with more care resulting in a smoother production. Agreed there were some very exciting moments (prison escapes etc.) but with the scenario broken up into chapters the mood was interrupted and the use of actual footage from the Castro era was another unnecessary hiatus. Another negative was the dialogue spoken in English with a heavy accent. When the viewer has to strain to understand, it becomes a painful experience..A film with a similar theme embracing political repression and homosexuality was "Strawberry and Chocolate" a most interesting film with likeable characters. With Reinaldo we never get to know the man nor do we warm towards him. The poet was charged and imprisoned for his unacceptable behaviour, his homosexuality and counter-revolutionary writing.Life began again for him when he exiled himself to New York where he discovered true freedom and peace, though he rarely looked happy. There is a touching scene at the end when his friend (played by Olivier Martinez) helps him to die with an overdose of pills and alcohol. An ironic situation this since his newly found freedom was terminated with AIDS.Johnny Depp makes two short appearances in the film. Be prepared to be surprised. It's fun trying to spot him in the prison area.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult not to make a movie about a controverse social issue without ever putting the question of what is pertinent and what is over the top. Well, this movie succeeds in creating a new insight into the homosexuality theme, without ever becoming ridiculous or exaggerated. Lead by a career-changing performance by Javier Bardem, the movie never relies too much on its gripping lead actor and instead always cares for the surrounding world of Cuba, and what lies beneath an apparent paradise on Earth. Always between politic message and human feelings, Javier Bardem's character is touchingly stoic and pays hommage not only to members of repressed groups but also to everyone whose wings were clipped by the powers that be. Fascinating movie all the way, creating a world of its own.</fullReview>

I was impressed on the whole with its lyricism, and the way it told the story simply, but with a definite emphasis on visual poetry. Javier Bardem was outstanding, reminding me very much of a younger Al Pacino, and Olivier Martinez was believable as his good friend. The Cuban music was rapturous - loved it.Definitely not for everyone, this film is beautiful to look at and involving on most levels.

		<shortDescription>The life of the Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is similar to the book, but there are some episodes that I do not remember from the original material, e.g. when the policeman Victor (Johnny Depp) put his gun in the mouth of Reinaldo. In fact, Victor was visiting Reinaldo regularly and asking him to write something in favor of the government, and this is not shown in the film. The atmosphere of denunciation is not completely shown either; Reinaldo was once denounced by his aunt. Then at the time he was boarding the ship to US in 1980, it is not shown that the police came looking for him in Mariel port to retain him. In this scene the only thing shown is when he changed his surname Arenas for Arinas. The book also describes intensively a lot of sex he had as a gay, and the film, obviously, did not show so many sex scenes as the original did. One of the things I do not understand is why the Cuban writers Lezama Lima (author of 'Paradiso') and Virgilio Pi?era are called by their real names while the poet Heberto Padilla is shown as HERBERTO ZORRILLA (Michael Wincott), who publicly presented a 'self critic' at the Cuban Union of Journalists. In any case, the film has the right environment, with pictures of Havana city, and its general output can be well accepted. Javier Bardem played very well the role as Reinaldo, writer, poet and gay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One doesn't need to know who Reinaldo Arenas was to appreciate this film. By the time it's over you can't wait to read Arenas' books (or re-read them as the case my be). Julian Schnabel has created a rich and multi-layered film about freedom and art - how staying true to the art of expressing yourself (even in the face of adversity) is the only truly liberating thing in life.For non-Spanish- (or French-) speaking film audiences, Javier Bardem and Olivier Martinez are the acting-Finds of the decade! Bardem is as well known to Spanish-speaking audiences, as Martinez is in France. We can only hope to see them both more often in English-language films that get widespread releases internationally. It's only a shame that Bardem didn't win the Oscar he was nominated for at the 2000 Academy Awards - seldom have I been so moved by an acting performance. Johnny Depp is lots of fun as "Bon-Bon" - the smuggling drag queen, but looks somewhat out of place in his double role as a Cuban police inspector (it's probably the glued-on mustache that doesn't work for me!). Keep an eye out for Sean Penn, too.The film is an extraordinary masterpiece! A "Must-See"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fine, Fine Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just viewed this film last night, quite by accident, on a premium cable station. This is a fine, fine, film. I remember this actor's Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and from what I viewed, he deserved it. I learned alot about Cuba before the Castro takeover, I learned why Cubans arrived in America in 1980, and I also learned how tormented a talented soul can be. Did I know about this artist's writings? No, I did not. Was I aware of the events of Cuba, the bannings, the quests for freedom? Not to this degree. Bravo to the production team for the film running during the end credits!! Bravo for American Actors Johnny Depp and Sean Penn small performances. This film may not appeal to many at first, but I would recommend it very, very highly. There are points in the film that may get bored or want you to turn away, but the performance of the lead actor will not permit you to. He kicked royal butt in this roll. (btw -- Russell Crowe, you were lucky to have won the Oscar over this gentleman.) As a heterosexual, this film made me feel for the homosexual lifestyle of this writer and cringe at how that was used for politics. Out of many films I have seen, I have to add that the way homosexuality was approached in thisfilm was done straightforward and tastefully -- very mainstream. I was very sad at the end of the film as I am with all people who succumb to AIDS. But here is another outstanding world talent who had a rough childhood, lead of rough life that got rougher and ended the roughest. The good news is that we have his writings that will last forever and that is why I believe he graced this earth for the time he did. I for one am glad I got to see this film for I am going to go out and find some of his work to read. And not just that, I am also going to go out and learn more about Cuba for there is alot of things I thought I knew, that I have no idea of.Again, a fine, fine film, an excellent lead acting performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the poetry of beauty and fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a beautiful film in that it mirrors visually the poetry of the protagonist Reinaldo Arenas, which is read in voice-over narration throughout by his portrayer, the amazing Javier Bardem. Not only is the film beautiful and poetic in a dreamlike way, it counterpoints brilliantly with the violence and paranoia not only of the gay lifestyle and its defensiveness in general but of the impossibility of trying to uphold it honestly in a repressive political state. The totalitarianism of Castro's Cuba has never been conveyed as effectively, in my experience, with a very real sense of dread and oppression, comparable to being trapped in the Nazi Occupation, and the terror is made even more palpable by some surrealist/fantasy sequences. "Before Night Falls" surpasses even the lighter but still-great "Strawberry and Chocolate" as a portrayal of life in Communist Cuba (that film also featured a gay man as the central character in a likewise stunning performance.) Bardem was immensely likeable and magnetic in a role that would have alienated me in most circumstances, which was a key to my appreciation of the film and the artist portrayed.</fullReview>

The placing among books in Lezama's library of a book by the writer Guillermo Cabrera Infante is truly offensive, since this writer, Cabrera Infante, hounded Lezama Lima with homophobic fury during the early years of the Cuban revolution (1959-1961). Thus, a book by a notorious homophobe (Cabrera Infante) is placed in the library of one of his former victims (Lezama Lima). Director Schnabel apparently knows nothing about this, since his knowledge concerning such aspects of Reynaldo Arenas's life is controlled by a group of self-serving gospel-makers who are intend upon crafting the cinematic life of a gay saint in favor of their own self-enhancement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances?boring movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This slow paced film is a true story based on the life a Cuban poet, Reinaldo Arenas (Javier Bardim), and his struggle to gain acceptance while being persecuted for being gay. While this film has terrific and believable performances, it seems to focus on the struggles and day-to-day aspects of his life, rather than what he will be remembered for: his talent. Rarely do you get a real feel for what he is writing, but more of what he is going through when he is writing. Arenas had to smuggle his work out of the country (in one instance in a transvestite's ass!), where it became popular, yet made his situation worse by being thrown in jail. Most of the other times he remains homeless and in bad health until he ultimately dies of AIDS in New York City in the 80s after finally being accepted for who he is.While this film is gay-themed, it will not truly offend most of the heterosexual audience (save the one burly man behind me who asked aloud, `What is he?some kind of fag?'). There are no graphic gay loves scenes, but there is full frontal male nudity scattered throughout. So, this is your first warning! Your second is that, while Johnny Depp and Sean Penn are heavily advertised as being in the film, their screen time (both of Depp's roles included) equal less that 5 minutes! With that said, you are left with an art film that will be recognized for it's performances and notable cinematography. Directed by Julian Schnabel (`Basquiat'), the film looks great and truly is an interesting story, it just kind of loses something in the translation. While this film could've taken an edgy and controversial turn, it looks like it took the safe route to the awards shows. So, if you are truly interested in his work, I would suggest you pick up one of his books of poetry. Otherwise, be prepared for long visit to the local art house cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly touching portrayal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do I call this a "surprisingly" touching portrayal of the Cuban writer's life? Because, based on the preview I saw when the film was first released, I got the impression of a sensational, probably pretty tacky "gay exploitation" film. As a gay filmgoer I've been turned off enough times by gay-themed films that I made a decision not to see "Before Night Falls," based on my negative reaction to the preview.Then last week I got a second chance to see the film, and did. I was moved by its eloquence, though a little disturbed by a lack of cohesive story-telling. The final scene--I won't spoil it by detailed comment--is one of the most poignant scenes, perhaps the most poignant, I've witnessed on film. With a devastating absence of sentimentality, the directors and actors managed a tour-de-force that brought me to the verge of tears.There was a small crowd at this screening, and it was smaller by the end of the film, for three spectators walked out immediately after the (only) semi-explicit sex scene. I've been wondering why they came to the film in the first place, since the subject matter was amply publicized ahead of time. In sum, I found this to be a dignified, often visually ravishing, portrayal of a very tough existence confronted with bravery and retold on film with compassion and honesty. Highly recommended for mature filmgoers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For most of us, it is rare to burst into tears during a movie, so be warned: this is one of the most affecting films ever, especially if you have a weak spot for the struggles of artists. It is small wonder Javier Bardem won so many awards for this one. Based on the autobiography of Cuban novelist/poet Reinaldo Arenas who died of AIDS in NYC after surviving an amazing struggle in Cuba because he was gay, Bardem gets the role of most anyone's lifetime. He plays everything from an innocent but scarred, determined teen to a guy in his late 40s dying of AIDs. Much of Arenas writing appears in the film since Arenas was definitely a writer who struggled with and for his art and the film is front and center about capturing that aspect of his humanity. Also much of Cuban politics through the late 20th century is captured on film, and, despite the dazzle of the cinematography it is decidedly not a pretty picture. Though Julian Schnabel, the director, has a painter's eye, he lets the story led the way and there are few story stories as inspirational and gut wrenching as Arenas'. The film's gay themes probably will put off homophobes, for as much as he was a writer, Arenas was a gay man in a country where homosexuality was considered tantamount to treason. Arenas' triumphs as a young writer gave way to his persecution as a gay man. When he is finally exiled to NYC, he falls victim to AIDS. Schnabel does not flinch from any of it. Though the film is only a bit over two hours long, its story is so huge when it is over you may check your watch surprised it was that short. If you can see it through your tears.Also recommended Agnieszka Holland's "Total Eclipse" and Ken Russell's "Savage Messiah."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing this film I knew next to nothing about the subject. All I knew was what I had read about it when it was released in theaters. I had never heard of Reinaldo Arenas, as I have yet to go to college and Cuban authors are not typically required reading at tiny midwestern high schools. After seeing the movie, I definitely intend to read Arenas. I thought the poetry and story excerpts Bardem read were very moving. I really liked the movie. The cinematography was incredible. I had no idea that Cuba was so beautiful. The story was a little hard to follow, and I had a little trouble understanding Bardem's accent. Other than that I have no problem with the film at all. Javier Bardem was terrific, and gorgeous. I had previously seen him a Spanish film completely different from Before Night Falls. At the time I thought he was very good looking, but I didn't know he was such a wonderful actor til now. I intend to watch the movie again soon and I recommend it very highly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice cinematography and music, but the disjointed surrealistic plot doesn't work for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems to me like Julian Schnabel is trying to make two different types of movie in "Before Night Falls." On the one hand, he attempts to create a conventional Hollywood drama--all simpletonish in its approach to history, human relationships, and life in general. On the other hand, he has cut the film up in some unconventional ways, inserting many surrealistic scenes into the mix. To top it off, there is a lot of documentary footage included (which I found kind of interesting) shot about the time of the Cuban Revolution. Somehow, all of this just doesn't work for me. Although I enjoyed looking at the images in "Before Night Falls" due to the cinematography and great background music, I had a difficult time following the plot or developing any real interest in the characters. In fact, in a few cases it was hard to figure out who some of the characters were. But again, this is not to say the film was too complicated either. It was just confusing. The film seemed well-acted to me, though not being up on my Cuban history I question whether everyone in Cuba spoke with a lispy Spain-ish accent circa 1965. And, though I feel sympathetic to the torture Arenas must have gone through in his life, I was not too moved by the prose of his that was read in this film. The last quote, the one that started with "I am the child who..." I just did not get.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally, a movie that lives up to all the hype it generated! "Before Night Falls" is that rare gem, a contemporary independent film that was actually made by a director who didn't just follow the Miramax or MTV visual and editing formulas. Julian Schnabel, the most successful American painter of the past two decades, has now given us two brilliant biopics, both about young, doomed artists he new personally -- first, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and now, Reinaldo Arenas. In both movies, Schnabel crafts images of such breathtaking beauty that it hardly matters what's actually going on in the plot. His musical choices are equally brilliant -- who else would have thought to use a song in Arabic as the background for a snowstorm in Times Square? My only gripe is that I wish that the whole film, and not just a few segments, had been in Spanish. The heavily-accented English used in the Cuban parts (i.e., most) of the movie, made the dialogue less fluid, and it was a joy when the actors slipped into actual Spanish. This might have made the delightful cameos by Sean Penn and Jonnhy Depp a little more difficult, but it would've made for a more elegant drama.On the whole, though, this is a beautiful, stirring picture that you really must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why not so good? Because that is the tragedy of all the films that are concentrated in one character. Bardem is sensational, yes. And the other ones? The political message really sucks. A lot of lines that smash the film (the poetry? important but not enough to the scripters). As I see it, the best stuff in this film is the sound track. Oh yeah! Those two "boleros" performing by Benny More' and "Bola de Nieve" (almost complete!) were achieve to make me feel that the price I payed had any sense. Five points, no more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performances, great rendering of Cuba in the 50s and 60s: a good (but not great) film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good story, good direction, great acting, great cinematography, but something's missing. The rendering of Cuba in the 50s and 60s is great: lights, clothes, people... Its description of the political situation, as far as I know, is accurate, both in the great expectations on the Revolution and the gradual conversion into a dictatorship. Bardem's performance is superb, as the talented rebel-poets who inflicts so many wounds on himself. He even conveys a good cuban accent (not an easy task for a spaniard). So, I must say, are Johnny Depp's cameos. All in all, a good, strong film. But somehow the circle does not come full. The film has great core, but is faulty at the sides (not only the beginning and the end).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before Night Falls was an extremely ambitious project (even moreso than Basquiat), and I'd have to say that it succeeds on mostcounts. However, I can't help feeling that in the end, we still do nothave any sense of Reinaldo Arenas' personality. We only seeArenas live through the ordeals of his life, and Javier Bardem iscertainly wonderful in each of those situations, but there issomething missing. Arenas doesn't seem much more clearlydefined than any of the small supporting players in the movie. Was he a humble artist or a brash and confident one? I have noidea.Aside from this, Before Night Falls really is beautiful to behold. Julian Schnabel's sense of aesthetics is put to great use in thecinematography. The view from a hot air balloon as it floats abovethe city and later comes back down to the ground are images that Ican't forget - they are just too perfect. And somehow, most of thedialogue is spoken in English but still felt authentically Cuban. Except for Sean Penn's character, that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was held spellbound for over two hours by this masterful film. The fact that this was a true story made it even more fantastic. I will be surprised if it is not an Oscar contender.Without reviewing the film, there are a few points that stick in my mind. The musical background is an important part of the film. The tempo of the music and the movement of the people were not the same and yet it all matched perfectly. The camera work was outstanding, particularly when scenes of New York and Cuba were alternated during one narrative passage.The scenery in general was right on target even though parts were filmed in Mexico which stood in for Cuba. The interspersing of news footage with the film was great. And last, but not least...the words...the message...leave much to think about.I'd be interested in comments from people who were moved by this film as much as I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that making a non-documentary film of a memoir is a very challenging business. This film manages to tell the story of a difficult life of another linguistic culture in English in a coherent and engaging way. (With the possible exception of Sean Penn's performance, which I found somewhat embarrassing.) Javier Bardem is riveting. Olivier Martinez plays the sensitive straight Carilles very well. Johnny Depp is excellent in both character parts. Some scenes seemed to verge on Ken Russell 'art', but I think that these were sufficiently rejoined to the story line, when film is looked at as a whole. Schnabel here, as in "Basquiat", seems able to be honest about the artist's foibles, while still conveying respect and admiration for his struggle. No sanitized Van Gogh here. No Heston as Michaelangelo. As an English speaker, I have to say I would have preferred subtitles and a Spanish screenplay. On another technical point, I feel the film handles the end of the Arenas story with graceful and jarring honesty. Finally, how could anyone not be enthusiastic about a feature film with original music by Laurie Anderson? Viva!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Interesting if not wholly successful adaptation of Reinaldo Arenas's memoir operates more on mood and imagery than advancing storyline. This works most of the time--Schnabel seems to be taking us into Arenas's head, letting us view the world through his poetic sensibilities--but equally often it seems like needless flash. Arenas had such a dramatic life, it seems silly to not let the events speak for themselves. Still, one is not bored; at least, not until Arenas finally arrives in New York and the film just...stops...for awhile. But this is worth seeing, don't get me wrong. Aside from the unintentionally funny sight of Sean Penn making like Ricky Ricardo (that accent!)as a Cuban peasant, this is wonderfully acted. Javier Bardem is very moving, especially in the earlier sequences when we see his determination to have a happy life under such oppressive circumstances. And Johnny Depp continues to just astound one. He is his generation's Paul Newman; when Depp is onscreen here (and nearly anywhere) he just wipes everyone else away.</fullReview>

Whether in the prisons created by Marxism in Cuba or by capitalism in the United States, this is a manwho existed on the edge of society. His is the battle ofanyone who thinks for himself or herself in the face ofthe blank mass face of "normal" society.The film is a bit disjointed, but I presume that is intentional to depict the strange world in which the Cuban poet lives.

		<shortDescription>Art? Not in a thousand years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films I like to call "pseudo intellectual".I disagree with Berardinelli here, and almost totally agree with Berge Garabedian's review. On one thing however I do disagree also with Garabedian: in my opinion the Direction was far from good. On the contrary, I believe the Direction to be one of the major shortfalls of this motion picture. And honestly, considering Schnabel is a painter, the cinematography, the visuals should have been much better as well.Having said that, now on to the main 'problem' with this film. As far as I can see, the material (the story) the director and producers had to work with here was first class (as were the actors). What they managed to do with it however is only to produce two hours of first class boredom. In more capable hands (maybe a good film maker instead of a painter, who would do better to stick to what he is allegedly good at...) this could (and should) have been a monumental motion picture, an epic to remember. Instead, what we got was an abstract canvas with randomly painted splashes of color that nobody (including those who praise the film, believe me) can understand. Oh well, if it so difficult to understand, it must be great doesn't it...?Art? Not in a thousand years! Skip this one if you can, it's a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cuba has always been under the magnifying glass since the Cuban revolution took place and the Castro regime became in charge. May be because the government's ideology is opposed to the ideology of the U.S government. Cuba has been considered an enemy of the U.S government for the simple fact that the revolution adopted some Marxist views which the U.S was trying to diminish from all countries at the time and still at present time. The movie Before Night Falls, tells the story of the Cuban Revolution and Cuban poet Reinaldo Arenas. The movie showcases the struggle of a gay poet during the revolution and the rise of Castro's regime which he was a supporter of and left his home when still a young teenager to fight for it. He was forced to leave Cuba after being accused of corrupting minors and imprisoned. He escapes jail only to end up right back in for his writings and his ideology which were considered against the revolution. He finally is able to leave Cuba on the Mariel boat lift and live a free life in the United States. The movie is based on Arenas' memoirs which were written shortly before he died in New York City by overdosing on casual drugs and alcohol and having a sexually transmitted disease. The movie is directed by one of the industry's few successful painter turned director Julian Schnabel. He uses the events of Arenas' life from the memoirs but also adds other elements from Arenas' poems and stories that could have been extracted from and inspired by his life events. Director Julian Schnabel has been anticipating the making of this movie ever since the book came out but because of financial issues he was not able to do it right away. Javier Bardem plays the character of Reinaldo Arenas and does an amazing job in sending the message to the viewers whether it is the last scene where he is weakly dying or the scene in which he is denouncing his ideology. His performance has nominated him for several prizes and made him go home with quite a few prizes for best actor.Reinaldo Arenas is a Cuban poet born in Holguin, Cuba to a poor family that owned a piece of land and had no males to work on it other than the grandfather and the man of the house. He grew up with his single mom and her family. Encouraged by his teachers to write poems and nourish his talent and discredited by his family for having such a talent. He moved to Havana to study in the university. He worked in the biggest Cuban library to benefit from the environment by reading books and writing and he to earn money to pay for his living. He was then introduced to some of Cuban literature's biggest names and encouraged to keep writing but his efforts were fought against by Cuban regime which supposedly turned him against it after being imprisoned. He finally decided to leave Cuba by going to the United States to write freely. New York City was the place where he died in the worst condition ever, having AIDS virus and no insurance after being evicted from a number of apartments. In his first attempt to direct a movie, painter Julian Schnabel had some what of a success. Yet in his second attempt to direct, turning his attention again toward an artist, he succeeded. Using the memoirs of Arenas, along with other stories he has heard from a close friend, he tells about his life and struggles. Unlike most directors of a film, Schnabel makes a connection with his subjects and allows us to feel as though we are seeing the real thing, rather than merely watching the facts of his biography. He allows us to observe within Arenas' state of mind while he fights for his freedom. Schnabel wants his audience to understand and see what Arenas actually went through, from his childhood to his final days but adds his own spin and take on it. There are some things in the movie that Arenas did not mention in his memoirs, but he did mention them in other writings, or where told to Schnabel by his close friend, Gomez Carrilles. Julian Schnabel did a wonderful bringing the story of Reinaldo Arenas to life and his memory in the movie Before Night Falls. The elements of the music and icon throughout the movie have been helpful symbols to understand the state of mind of Reinaldo Arenas and his struggle. The movie is able to send a clear message from the proper casting of Javier Bardem and Johnny Depp. The thought of how Arenas felt about the revolution and his home might have been changed to agree with the director's ideas as Arenas was already dead by the time the movie was made. So in fact because of inaccurate portrayal of the main character, the director made the hero not look like a hero. However when researching the movie's background and than watching it, the viewer is left uncertain about parts that could have been made up and exaggerated from the director's perspective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Night Falls Emphasis on The Film Itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "Before Night Falls is a sad life story about Reinaldo Arenas, and the struggles he had to embrace because of his homosexual life-style in a country that enforce heterosexuality as law. The film shows Reinaldo, a famous writer, go from early childhood where he live in Cuba with his mothers sisters and her parents all the way to his death in America.The movie starts out with an amazing scene of Reinaldo being cared through the woods, by his mother, on the way home to his grandparents. The opening lines are full of poetic narration, and tells how Reinaldo was born out of wed-lock and how his mother would forever be looked down on by society, because of him. In his words through the narration he refers to her returning home with Reinaldo as, "With me as the proof of her failure." The camera work through out the movie is very interesting and beautiful. Starting at the beginning as Reinaldo and his mother travel through the woods to the very end. While they are going through the wood it shows the film to you as if you are there traveling with them, worn out but knowing you must carry on till you reach the grandparents home.The next amazing shot is when it rains at the grandparents. The way that Reinaldo narrates the event along with the music, makes for very beautiful images. But with listening closer, as he talks about how the rain just kept coming destroying everything including houses, you see how the artist can look at events as beautiful even if they are not good events. This theme will travel through the film.Another very interesting use of the camera comes when Reinaldos grandfather finds out, by his teacher, that he is good at writing poetry. The grandfather gets up immediately and grabs an ax to cut down a tree where Reinaldo had carved little messages into it. The film makes you become the ax, as if the ax had eyes and you were looking through them.After that when Reinaldos family moves to the city, in hopes of a better life, the film starts to show the Cuban culture and how sad and poor the society is. There it shows how Reinaldo went of to join the fight for the Cuban revolution, but eventually returns home. During those scenes the camera once again does something very interesting and cuts into old footage of the revolution from back in the day. It makes it interesting and gives the movie credibility for accurately portraying this time.Then the movie goes to an older Reinaldo and how he meets his first gay lover while developing into this world famous writer. When Reinaldo is first coming to the conclusion that he is gay indeed, the war had just began and homosexuality was not persecuted. However it quickly starts to show how Reinaldo got very lucky in many cases to stay alive all while taking risks to get his work out. He goes through some time in prison where he survives by writing messages for other prisoners to send home. He also is persecuted horribly for his lifestyle and for nothing other than being gay. He was said to be a rapist, because some boy who stole his clothes from him at the beach, told the police in order to avoid getting in trouble himself. When Reinaldo is put into solitary confinement. It breaks your heart to see him like that. The camera is placed perfectly and the buzzing of the small light makes you feel like going crazy as well.After some smart maneuvering Reinaldo makes it to America so that he can write freely and not be persecuted or censored. While there he contracts Aids and dies with his roommate Laz.Through out the whole movie the camera work is very interesting and keeps the story serious and emotional. The different techniques used on the film make the film also appear more accurate in telling the story almost as if it really was how Reinaldo saw things while he was here on Earth.Over all it was a great movie about a great writer. It showed all the necessary parts to make the movie meaningful and really didn't use any boring fillers for time or anything like that. The movie was an emotional movie that makes you feel terrible for the people of Cuba. It shows you the poor and the rich of Cuba, but you still want to help both of them. The movie starts with poetry as a visual art and ends that way to. So I think that the overall success of the movie was very high. The only thing that made it hard to follow at times was, the two languages being spoken regularly throughout the film. But it was very important to really get the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Censorship of Art in Cuba</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film "Before Night Falls", released in 2000, was given excellent reviews by critics such as Newsweek's David Ansen and has received many awards. It is an interpretation of the novel also entitled "Before Night Falls". The novel was written by Reinaldo Arenas and finished just previous to his death in 1990, but was not published until 1993. Shortly after, it became a best seller.The Director if the film, Julian Schnabel had long desired to make this film. After quite a long wait, he found the funds necessary to do so, and did so with great fabulousness. He received much positive enforcement from some tremendous actors such as Javier Bardem, and Johnny Depp. The cast took a large part in the creation of this dazzling production.In the film, the very talented Javier Bardem plays the lead part as the talented writer Reinaldo Arenas. He was an excellent choice for the part because he could very convincingly appear as though he was a sweaty repressed homeless Cuban homosexual ex-con writer with AIDS. Two thumbs up for that one. However, taking on a role like this one was not all fun and games it also had a very serious side.This story is an autobiographical description of the life of Reinaldo Arenas. The setting through much of the story is in Cuba. Beginning with his birth, much of his life is spent trying to survive the Cuban revolution. Julian Schnabel's interpretation of Reinaldo's story represents the ongoing battle waged against art censorship. Reinaldo experiences many different problems throughout his life on film that pertain to the censorship of his work.He is portrayed in the film as being treated differently by some because he is an expressive writer of poems. His own grandfather becomes upset with him. It may be because he suspects him of being a homosexual, or perhaps his only thought is that such a thing as being a poet or a writer is a useless endeavor. The end result of the relationship between his grandfather and he is the destruction of a tree that he would carve poetry into while he watched unsuspecting nude men, and the abandonment of him by his grandfather.Reinaldo begins to write novels as a young adult. He attends college and enters a book into a writing contest. He wins. He is then tutored by some local writers to help hone his skill. Unfortunately, his works from then on are in the public eye. He is no longer able to write as he chooses. The Cuban government takes his books and they alter them. The changes are made to suit the purpose of the government. They make sure that there are no anti government writings within the pages of Reinaldo's books. They replace his words with their own propaganda. This of course is no grand prize for an artist. In the film authors are put on trial for writing so called anti revolutionary propaganda. They are forced to denounce themselves as traitors to the cause and their country. One of which is shown to kill herself by jumping out of a window.He continues to write. Eventually he finds someone that can have his books published in Paris. This person sneaks the books out of the country secretly. This has to be done or Reinaldo will be imprisoned. The first book that is published in Paris is called "Hallucinations". His books become famous in France and eventually in the United States. Unfortunately, he receives no credit and he receives no money for all of the novels that were sold around the world. He never even gets to see the book in its published form until several years later.The government suspects that he is doing something that is in violation of Castro's literature laws. They have him arrested on bogus charges. His room is searched and his manuscripts are stolen. They want to know that he is not up to something, they find out at his expense without provocation. He escapes from jail only to be rearrested and is thrown in prison for two years.Castro finally decides to release many people that he considered undesirables. He made them free to go to the United States. The film shows these people waiting to get on a boat at the docks. Reinaldo makes a last minute change to the name on his passport. He finally leaves Cuba in 1990. In the United States he writes several more books, this time he may write as he pleases.Since Before Night Falls was finished on Reinaldo's death bed, Julian Schnabel must have researched the ending. He did an imaginative job of ending the film. Showing Reinaldo's AIDS caused deterioration added a certain closure to the movie. The actual death by suicide is vivid, as is this film in its entirety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is there not to understand?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this film, I watched it with my boyfriend (who's a fine artist), and a gay male couple. Well, my boyfriend and I understood the artistry, the pain, the suffering, the political turmoil, the poetry, the usage of English/Spanish, basically the entire story. This is a pretty straight forward story, that had a beautiful &amp; imaginative cinematography &amp; direction. This was a dynamite film that should be watched. What bothered me was the reaction of the gay couple in the room. One of them kinda understood the sorrow, and at least understood that this was someone's life story, however... the 'control freak' out of the two took this plot as a stab at homosexuality? If I missed something here, please point this out to me! I continued to ask this individual why he thought so, and he said "Its just another film that makes AIDS look like a Gay disease!" I'm like "Are you f*cking kidding me? Did we just watch the same film? Did you pay attention to ANYTHING in that film?" I just dropped the discussion before it turned into a heated argument (because believe me, I can argue.) I thought that movie was done in with taste, despite its frank nature. Who cares if the man was promiscuous or not... that didnt necessarily mean that's how he contracted it! He could've contracted it while he was in prison for all we know... but we don't, and it doesn't matter. It's tragic that he was inflicted with the virus, but it doesn't matter how it was contracted... that was his business. However, the fact that he was openly gay, and that obviously posed as an obstacle as a way of living his life for the most part NEEDED to be addressed in this film... I mean... how was he going to emigrate to America any other way? Let's be honest, his homosexuality was interesting to the plot, and Javier Bardem pulling off those scenes (I have no idea if he's gay or not) it takes B*LLS to do scenes like that convincingly without being typecasted. Bardem was excellent, Arenas was an excellent writer (and yes I have read his literature) and it was a film that needed to be made. I feel Schnabel's direction in this one was much better than "Basquiat", even though that was also a good film, I have a feeling this one was more honest... it was more in your face, and was still a true aethestic vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film, taken from a book and turned into visual poetry bythe great Julian Schnabel. I didn't quite know what to expect, but whatI got was so compelling that I went back to see it a second time. It'srare that you see a film about a poet (that is not a documentary) thatactually makes you see the poetry- Schnabel visualizes Arenas words inways that force you to feel them as you're seeing them, which is no meanfeat. The camera work is all new to me, shot in a style that can only bedescribed as unconventional- and that's not to say that it's noticableor trying to be 'hip'- it's like a singer who has her own style that youcan't quite pinpoint but that is clearly not classically trained. NinaSimone comes to mind. Anyway, it's refreshing and vital and it feelsalmost like a documentary in the best way, you are made to feel that youare a participant. The lead role, Reinaldo Arenas is inhabited fully byJavier Bardem. I've seen him before in some Spanish films, but neverutilized to such a magnificent extent as he is here. He is thischaracter so thoroughly that at times it's frightening. His passion, hislife, his voice, everything about him is absolutely perfect. In fact,all the supporting roles are amazing as well- I was particularlyimpressed with Johnny Depp as two very different roles, and Sean Penn asa local driving a wagon. Not large parts, not showy ones either. Well,actually, Depps is kind of a show boat role- but the fact that thesegreat actors did this film, obviously to help Schnabel get it madesomehow, is quite telling. I don't know the names of the other actors,but the ones that played Arenas gay friends in Cuba were all glorious.And to see Cuba- although it wasn't filmed there!- is a treat as well.The music is perfect, everything about this film makes you want to sing.This is an outstanding film and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Joining the list of the 100 greatest films ever made: Before Night Falls I went into the movie hating Castro for the death sentence he imposes on so many of his people for what they are. I came out of this film in love with the art and power of cinema.If any one can watch this movie and not love its poetry, its sense of the power of what is right and what is wrong in this world. The division between cruelty and humanity is compelling from the beginning to end. I love this film. It is beautiful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. The graphic depictions of gay sexuality may offend some, and the romantic relationship between Reynaldo and Pepe is perhaps underexplored. But, the film makes some attempt to explain the sexual climate in Cuba at the time through Arenas' writing. The intense friendship between Reynaldo and his (straight) roommate Lazaro is as powerful and moving as any romance. The pace of the movie is not "slow," but poetic and thoughtful. Many movies featuring men with HIV/AIDS have been nothing more than "AIDS movies" and did little to humanize their main characters, or portray them as anything more than mere martyrs. But, _Before_Night_Falls_ is well-rounded and spares the viewer very little. Overall, this movie was intense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the finest film of 2000, and one of the 100 best ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Night Falls (Julian Schnabel, 2000)Usually, I give a film five stars when it contains no flaws at all, when it's so unerringly perfect that it's impossible not to like. This time, I give a film five stars (the twenty-third film ever to get five stars, for those who are counting) despite flaws. Before Night Falls is that good.Before Night Falls is based on the memoir of the same name by Cuban author Reynaldo Arenas, who ran away from home as an adolescent to join the rebel armies moving against Batista in 1958. Shortly thereafter, Castro came into power, and as Arenas grew up and became a writer, he was soon made to realize that there was no place for him in the world he'd helped to set up.Javier Bardem, who plays Arenas from the writer's early twenties until his death in 1990, is a revelation. Best Actor isn't good enough to recognize and celebrate Bardem's complex and wrenching performance. He and Schnabel have the same understanding of Arenas' story, and the same desire in presenting it. While Schnabel contrasts the sere beauty of the Cuban landscape (and the even more sere beauty Arenas tries to evoke from the ugliness of New York City later in life), Bardem constantly reminds us that Arenas' life wasn't only about being oppressed, but about the simple joys of quotidian life in Cuba. The contrasts inherent in the film make the inevitable twists of the knife just a bit harder to take each time, and the cumulative effect is devastating.There are some difficulties with the film. Many of the accents fade in and out of recognizability, to the point where the average American viewer will probably not understand what's being said in a few places, especially early on in the film. The general bent of what's being said is never lost, however. The pacing is inconsistent, as well, and the film drags ever so slightly in a couple of places. Both of these problems are forgivable within the greater framework, as Schnabel, first-time scriptwriter Cunningham O'Keefe, and Bardem come together with a spectacular ensemble cast (highlighted by Johnny Depp, once again showing up for less than five minutes in a film, this time in a double role) to create not only the best film of the year by far, but a film that, if there is any justice in the world, is destined to be remembered as one of the finest pieces of cinematic work ever committed to film. Finds a place very high up on the 100 Best list-- perhaps at the top. *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unframed life in every frame.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a lot to be said for a film that tackles many great themes and yet can not be said to represent any of them. It is something more than its parts. It is beauty.I love the fact that this is an unapologetically gay film, yet not a queer film. I love that it shows the poverty and abuse of law in communist Cuba under the revolution, yet doesn't reflect an opinion on these conditions. I love its presentation of the exiled, rejected, persecuted artist, without any comment on his plight. For in this film, we are faced with the truth of a man's life, and the beauty of ours.This is a film that would have the same effect on queers and homophobes alike. On Jesse Helms, as on Fidel. On the criminal, as on his keeper. On the street kid, as on the millionaire. On the artist, as on his audience. For it has no value of its own, no place to belong. As Arenas himself recounts coming to America as a "stateless" citizen, so too this film lives "in the air."This is one of those films you search for in the haystack of cinema, disappointed more often than rewarded. It is not pretty. Not glossed up. There are no FX, animatronics, or other trappings of technology. Not a single blue screen was used in its making. At every step it presents truth and beauty in the real. The trees, sky, grass, dirt, rain. The body, naked though clothed. And everywhere the sea, that most steadfast of truths; The vehicle of salvation for many, of finality for many more. Unframed life in every frame.Quite a different undertaking than "Basquiat," Schnabel's other feature. If this one comes to a cinema near you, jump at the chance. You won't even notice that Johnny Depp and Sean Penn are in the film, though they both give great perfomances. There is simply no room in it for the pretense of celebrity. In fact, the only unreal presentation is the opening credit roll. At first I was baffled by this obvious display of clunkiness. But even this makes sense now: if the film must be accredited then so be it, but let the audience make no mistake that this is superficial to the art, and only grudgingly consented to.For its ability to make the personal universal, and more so for accomplishing this without a frame, Before Night Falls earns *****, and a permanent place in my heart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Asking a Poet to Paint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I must say that what follows is solely my opinion and in no way is intended to represent fact.I have to say that I was somewhat disappointed with Before Night Falls. Director Julian Schnabel is an artist and his artistic talent certainly carries over into his film as art. In his current film, as in his previous work, Basquiat, Schnabel uses the metaphor (or is it symbolism?) of water repeatedly and effectively even when least expected. Witness as the hot air balloon rises and we look down upon a swimming pool. Schnabel also seems to enjoy filming at angles: bottom up or top down. In Before Night Falls, the dialoque(what there is of it), goes back and forth between Spanish and English, sometimes seemingly within the same sentence. I'm guessing that the Spanish dialogue comes directly from Arenas' own work and the English has been added? Surprisingly, it works. Schnabel also has a gift for seamlessly transitioning between two scenes in a way where they seem to logically flow into each other, even though they don't. But Schnabel's greatest gift is his uncanny ability to convey a story with minimal dialogue. I couldn't help but notice how, at critical moments, the sound would drop out, and a musical score unrelated to the scene would enter. We watch the characters speak, but we cannot hear what they are saying We see them move and dance, but we cannot hear the music they are dancing to. Instead, we hear music that explains the scene and explains the thoughts and emotions of the characters. Schnabel does this with tremendous success in this movie.So why was I disappointed? In Before Night Falls as in Basquiat, Schnabel requires his central character to express life through body language and movement. In Basquiat, Schnabel had the talented Jeffrey Wright play the main character. Wright is a gifted dancer who had been on Broadway in Bring in the Noise... Dance is an art form where feeling, emotion, and story are conveyed through body movement and Wright and Schnabel teamed up to put this to use to the film's advantage. Basquiat said very little, but his confusion and conflict were clearly told by Wright's magnificent ability to convey emotion through body language. In Before Night Falls, Schnabel asks the same of Javier Bardem. Bardem is able to speak through his eyes, but he is seemed unable to express himself through the body, which Schnabel's style seems to require. I cared about Basquiat as a person. I didn't care about Arenas, but should have.Basquiat proved that Schnabel is a director who has an incredible talent for presenting material through music and visual scenery, with a minimal of dialogue. Before Night Falls is about a Poet, and, by nature, a Poet expresses himself with Words. Schnabel directing this movie is like asking a poet to paint or a painter to write poetry.Despite my criticism, I gave it a strong 8. It's a fine picture, but one that could have been a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wanted, indeed expected to love this film. I am very interseted in the story of a gay Cuban poet, given my being gay and having a great interest and love for Latin American culture.Indeed, good performances and some poetic images were the highlight of the film. The problem is the amateurish direction. The movie comes across more as a poetry reading or documentary than a passionate story. For such passionate subject material, this movie has very little of it. Nothing really comes to life. This is due, I think, to the very disjointed and dry direction. We are shown a series of incoherent vignettes that I could never really get my hooks into. The movie also had very little presence, it was just dull.I am sorry to say this, because there are some fine elements here, and this is a very important story to be told, both from the perspective of a gay artist, gay society, and Cuban society. A better director could have made this a stunning film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read the posted reviews before trying to capture my thoughts and not be redundant. I do not agree that the theme is loneliness, but propose that the theme is one of human isolation. There is a difference. In loneliness, one gives up one's soul and succumbs to outside values and standards. In isolation, one fights for individual identity and self-determination. In isolation, the fight is hard and fought against all odds of probable success. In this telling of a story, there is success -- even if in an assisted manner in the end.My pleasure in viewing a screening this day was in providing me an updated American connection with Cuba in a real-life manner. Cuba is still held as an enemy of the American people in some strange, leftover meal from the Cold War.Filmmaking and story telling can de-nuke politics. Politics most often makes no sense to any person with a high school education or above. This film covered both sides of the American-Cuban struggle and landed someplace in the middle. It portrays Cuba in a manner similar to the US -- rich in beautiful African culture and intelligence that contributes to both country's society and genetic composition. The main difference lies in degrees of freedom of choice - where the US clearly dominates this two-country confrontation.In addition, we see that compassionate feelings of sexuality or orientation can cross in a mere flash of opportunity and at any level of social encounter. It is opportunity or power or compassion or love or whatever that determines whether the moment of rapture is a flash or everlasting.Such is life. Such is film storytelling. Such is creativity and honesty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The story (adapted from the book of memoirs of the same name by Reinaldo Arenas) is a heart wrenching tale of this sensitive writer exiled from Cuba in 1980 for his expressed homosexuality.The movie spans his birth (1959) and rearing in Castro's Cuba to his untimely death in New York City (1995.) The atrocities he suffered for both his writing and sexual orientation are told with insight and humor.Julian Schnabel's visualization of the story is masterful - ethereal with beautiful landscapes and compelling camera angles, expertly shy of any graphic sensationalism.Javier Bardem plays the writer, Arenas, with incredible depth and sensuality (there is only sexual innuendo) and will most certainly capture your heart.The supporting cast is equally engaging with some superb cameos - most notably Sean Penn and Johnny Depp whose dual role in the Cuban prison sequence is truly Oscar quality. This is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** SPOILERS ***** I really, really tried to like this movie, but I felt myself growing more and more restless as this film progressed. It's a fascinating story, to be sure, and probably gives a very accurate picture of Cuba in that era and Bardem is 100% persuasive in his part as the stubborn and quietly defiant writer. But after a while I felt that the story didn't get anywhere. Except for Bardem, all the other characters remain pretty under-developed and un-interesting. People pass in and out of Arenas life, but stay shadowy. And it annoyed me that the actors, despite the fact that most of them are spanish, have to talk broken english, destroying the feeling of authenticity that still manages to shine through now and then. I would also have seen a little more of his days in New York. If we are to believe this film, he went there, got a boyfriend, contracted aids and committed suicide within a month or so. Anyway, I am full of admiration for Bardem who still manage to deliver such a committed performance, his face alive with so much emotion and determination. I do think this movie is worth seeing, but just for him alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambitious casting turns to be pointless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As many here, I am a big fan of Javier Bardem's acting. As many here, I was sadly frustrated by the lack of dialogs in the movie. As a matter of fact, I think Javier Bardem is not as good as he is used to be because of that. Indeed, the film has mainly a sad tone, and is made with good narrator's comment but scenes of repression are not well contextualized I reckon. For instance, many times a repression takes place after some homosexual community organizes a gathering; but even then, we don't understand how, when nor with whom the party has ever taken place nor why the police got informed. Excluiding the details, I think the movie is quite a bad biography. It does not show enough of Reinaldo Arena's achievements, as it does not show how the revolution transformed itself in a huge machine of repression. Everything is suffered by the characters without any organized dialogs nor helpful situation for us. How can we, viewers, understand the changes? For instance, I didn't get a thing when Reinaldo eventually succeed in going out from jail. How come? Why? How can he recover that fast after that? Another drawback is probably the language chosen. Come on, why should the actors speak English in Cuba ? I always find ridiculous and pointless to match a cultural or historical event with another language that the one originally spoken. What about talking about American civil war with French actors in French or Spanish? That would be pointless don't you think ? Why did he chose English-American, French, Italian and Spanish actors when many Cuban excellent actors exist. At the very least, he could have picked up some Spanish actors (like Bardem)who would have imitated Cuban accent but even like that that would have been pathetic. That's too bad cause I would have loved to know a bit more about this artist.The film is somehow disappointing even if it draw my attention and caught my eye from time to time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, the acting was good and I know it's based on a true story, but...I couldn't watch this in one sitting because it was so dull. From the other user comments and the fact that it came highly recommended from a close friend to whom I normally attribute good taste - I was expecting a heck of a lot more from this film. I am also a fan of Carter Burwell (he did the musical score) but it didn't warm me up to this sluggish, often confusing bore-fest. I didn't care at all what happened to Reinaldo - sure he's dealing with a bad situation (being in Cuba in the 60's) but apart from his poetry he's portrayed as somewhat of an idiot. If you're going to take an inner tube to Florida on a 3 day "float" you might want to take some food and fresh water, and maybe an oar and compass. But hey that's just me. I saw this movie on video, and quite a few of the monologues/narration are in Spanish with no subtitles, which didn't help since I don't speak Spanish. Even some of the English parts had me asking "what's going on? who is this person and why is he doing this?" None of the characters seemed to have much depth to them - I couldn't tell most of Reinaldo's friends/lovers apart for example. The most memorable characters for me were Reinaldo's mother and the two characters played by Jonny Depp (I assume they were two different characters - it's hard to tell what's going on there). Yes, the story is tragic, but the -movie- did not make me shed a tear, except perhaps those tears you get when you yawn a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusing, pointless, and ultimately boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've no doubt that the story of Reynaldo Arenas could have made an interesting film, but no one involved in the production of this offering seems to have had a clue as to how to go about telling the story in an interesting way. Consequently, we're left with a tedious mess of a film that rambles on for too long, and often seems to forget whatever point it was trying to make.The plot is taken straight out of Arenas' book Before Night Falls, and follows Arenas from childhood, where his teacher notices his writing abilities, through his joining up with Castro's rebels, his days in college, and his adulthood spent being persecuted, and ultimately imprisoned for his homosexuality. Eventually, he escapes to New York City, only to contract AIDS, and be smothered to death by his friend.It's not an uplifting story to begin with, but much could be done with the telling to make it satisfying, as is the case with films like Sophie's Choice. Instead, we get a confusing muddle where fantasy and reality are intertwined to the point where you can't tell which is which. Characters are not well developed, even Arenas is still something of a cipher by the end of the film, and the supporting players are not given any depth at all. Apparently, the writers thought the story would tell itself, and therefore do nothing to help it along. The end result is a script which fails to engage the viewer.Likewise the acting is equally stilted. While visually pleasing, Javier Bardem does nothing to make Arenas an appealing, or even interesting, character. The supporting players do little to differentiate themselves, so it is often hard to remember who is who, and who they are in relation to Arenas. Sean Penn's cameo was horrible, with an embarrassingly bad Spanish accent. And while Johnny Depp plays his parts with gusto, they do little to add much to a film that was already a lost cause by the time he appears on the screen.A person's life story could make a very interesting film, particularly when the person has had as much adversity to overcome as Reynaldo Arenas. Unfortunately, this offering does little to draw you into the story, settling instead for a confusing sequence of facts, which ultimately goes on for way too long. Hardly worth sitting through the first time, much less viewing again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can accept that Before Night Falls is a terrificly well done picture, with perfect shots and angles and an excellent cast line up (cameos of Johnny Depp and Sean Penn), but I think there are unnecessary scenes that can make you feel sick. I think it is about half an hour through the movie when it shows the fourteen year old boy having explicit sex and later on showing a fair few homosexual sex scenes. I'd have to disagree with most people and say that I don't think any of the sex scenes were one hundred percent necessary, especially the one with the fourteen year old boy.Although I do still recommend it to people who can easily handle heavy topics and graphic sex, because the movie (when excluding the sex) is very good. It's almost worth watching just for the performance (or the hilarious look) of Johnny Depp's two roles.I'd give it 8.4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some time ago I caught part of an English television interview with Javier Bardem and heard him say that it had been difficult for him to learn a Cuban accent in the film, Before Night Falls. The Cuban accent is highly distinctive, but I didn't think I could distinguish Cuban-accented English from any other Spanish-accented English. When the movie opened in Acapulco as Antes Que Anochezca, I went to see it.I had (foolishly) supposed it was going to be some sort of Caribbean gangster film in English, but it was a Spanish-language biography of gay Cuban novelist Reinaldo Arenas, and it featured at least one scene of full frontal male nudity. I was confused and surprised, to say the least, but I thought the story was moving and the film well done. Since then I have seen it on television, in English, when they put a bathing suit on the underwater shot of the other swimmer. I didn't recognize Bon Bon or Lt. Victor until the second time through.I have just returned from Havana, and I should add that I thought Bardem's Cuban Spanish was very good.</fullReview>

If you're someone who has long idolized that government, then what you see here is mind-blowing. We had long known that homosexuality was suppressed in Cuba, but what happens to poet Reinaldo Arenas (Javier Bardem) is particularly disturbing.I guess that what we need to understand is that any revolution is merely a reflection of what a small group of people consider the ideal. Therefore, the Cuban Revolution entailed banning open homosexuality. And "Before Night Falls" does a good job showing that.So, in conclusion, this is a movie that I would recommend. Also starring Olivier Martinez, Johnny Depp, Michael Wincott and Sean Penn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film biography of Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas is creative and imaginative. I came to the movie after having read the autobiography and feel that, while some liberties were taken, it captures the essence of the man as I perceived him from the book. And are we sure Arenas himself did not take some liberties in telling his own story? It is difficult to know how accurate a story we are getting in an autobiography. Trying to present fifty years of a life in a little over two hours is a challenge. It is a challenge that director Schnabel has met with honors - the montage he gives us gels into a vivid portrait. As highlights we get snippets of Arenas' writings that serve to convince us of his talent as well as a short but fascinating reenactment of an interview.Schnabel draws on his painter's eye to give us many scenes of stunning and sensuous beauty. I knew from the opening scene among the trees, whose tall branches caress each other in the wind, that I was going to like this movie. If you think about how you might have attacked telling this story, that may make you appreciate the artistry and originality of Schnabel's approach. Some scenes are absolute knock-outs. Consider the scene that begins with Reinaldo and his friend Pepe driving up to a nightclub in Pepe's white '57 Ford convertible. Study Bardem in the car before arriving at the club - he is able to portray being anxious yet excited in an understated way that makes you feel it. In the club, when Reinaldo is talking to Pepe, Bardem is able to capture a tenderness using subtle glances, coy smiles, and body movements. When Pepe jilts Reinaldo by taking up with a woman, in short order Reinaldo has made a match with a young male. There are dozens of couples in the club gyrating to a live band and the real stroke of genius in this scene is the score - visually we see that the sound in the club is in the high decibels, but on the audio track we get a bass and viola duet that serves as a startlingly effective counterpoint that mysteriously amplifies the emotional reaction. We hear no spoken words in this segment, but we know exactly what has happened. The musical score is sometimes elegiac and haunting, sometimes joyous, other times meditative and spiritual; the emotional impact would suffer greatly without it.You can't come away from this movie with much love for Castro. Early on we see period footage of a celebration of the rebel victory in ousting Batista, with a voice-over of Bardem reading from Arenas' "The Parade Begins." Later we witness repellent documentary footage of Castro railing against counter-revolutionaries and other "undesirables." Arenas suffered greatly from the dictatorship's oppression of homosexuals, artists, and intellectuals. He was imprisoned for several years. As Arenas' friend Lezama Lima put it, "People that make art are dangerous to any dictatorship." After Arenas' coming to the U.S. in the Mariel boatlift in 1980, he is quoted as saying, "The difference between the communist system and the capitalist system is that when they give you a kick in the ass in the communist system you have to applaud; in the capitalist system, you can scream." Arenas' talent was never allowed to be recognized in Cuba in his lifetime, but his writings were smuggled out and he achieved an audience abroad. As Arenas lamented about one of his book awards, "This book won best foreign novel in France and I don't even have a place to live."Bardem's performance is nothing short of brilliant, well deserving of his Oscar nomination. His body movements are closed down, emphasizing the sensitivity of the man. In the scene where he is in solitary confinement in a cell where he could barely stand up or move around he made you feel the heat, the oppression, the desperation, and the suffering in that room. Sean Penn's brief appearance as a Cuban peasant is pretty much wasted - a real Cuban peasant could have done the job as well or better. Johnny Depp's dual cameo appearances as a flaming transvestite in the prison and as a henchman in Castro's military are priceless. If there were Oscars given for best cameo appearance, Depp would have won two.The ultimate success of this film is in its giving us a sense of the man Reinaldo Arenas. No attempt is made to get at root causes of his personality, what we see is what we get. Arenas' homosexuality is seen to have been deep rooted and, contrary to intuition, repression seemed to excite a sexual response in him and others; sex became a way of fighting oppression. While the film documents Arenas' homosexuality it does not belabor you with it. Arenas was a complex and contradictory character. You have to admire his enormous courage in demanding to live his life as he wanted by being openly gay and writing poetry and novels that were almost certainly to land him in prison, or even result in death. Yet, he was not superman; he broke down under interrogation and signed a confession denying all he believed in. Ultimately, however, he remained true to his passions: writing, freedom, and sex. He noted that "the splendor of my childhood was unique, because of its absolute poverty and absolute freedom." Toward the end we have Arenas riding in a taxi from a hospital in New York City to his sixth floor walk-up during an awful down period in his suffering with AIDS. As he looks out onto the sights of New York they fade in and out of scenes of a crumbling Cuba while Bardem recites one of Arenas' love poems, a love poem to his typewriter and to writing. Through writing Arenas was able to escape the horrors of his life and achieve a sense of freedom.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Annie Williams 4/27/06 HUM120 Reinaldo's Women and Men In Before Night Falls, director Julianne Schnabel artistically describes the life of Cuban poet and novelist Reinaldo Arenas, taking his biographical information from Arenas's writings. Arenas, played by Javier Bardem, who was born and lived in Cuba during and post Cuban revolution was a homosexual young man and a poet during the era when Castro's government was trying to censor anyone or anything that he deemed perverted or subversive to society. Schnabel, an artist and self-professed critic of Cuban socialism presents a sympathetic and captivating recounting of Arenas's life. From his impoverished beginnings living with his mother's family to the end of his life with his friend Lorenzo, Schnabel presents an array of "characters" ranging from compassionate and nurturing females to sadistic and oppressive men. After returning home as a young child with his unwed mother, played by the director's wife, Arenas lives in poverty on his grandfather's farm. A sensitive child, who idolizes his mother, he begins to write poetry. When the grandfather finds out, he furiously goes to cut down the tree we see Arenas's words carved into, and sells the farm. This is the first male authoritarian figure the audience is introduced to and this theme continues throughout the movie paralleling Reinaldo's torture and repression as he moves to the city and begins writing and experiencing "gay society". We are soon introduced to a variety of homosexual men and Arenas's sexual exploits; he claims to have had over 5,000 encounters. In one scene Reinaldo explains how there are 4 categories of gay men, and only one of the descriptions seem to be non-critical. Most of the men in Reinaldo's life are friends, but we meet Pepe who has a sadistic nature and seems to enjoy abusing his friends and eventually turns Reinaldo in to the authorities. Then there are the accusations, arrests and torture, especially at the hands of the sadistic Lt. Victor, Johnny Depp, who also exploits his power over Reinaldo, getting him to renounce his writings that he had been trying to smuggle out of the prison. Schnabel uses the stories and characters of Arenas's writings to parallel the political scene of Cuba by using machismo to represent the Cuban government. The only really compassionate male figure in the movie is Lorenzo, Oliver Martinez, whom Reinaldo referred to as "the only authentic boy I have ever met" was his friend, never his lover, until the end of his life. On the other hand, the women in the movie are caring and sympathetic and seem to be revered by Arenas. The mother figure is always shown as beautiful and in the beginning he tells, in the haunting narrative that sets the scene many times during the movie, of how his mother only had sex once and renounced it forever after. The prostitute when Reinaldo was a boy and trying to get his courage up to join the revolution almost lovingly takes him to bed the night before he runs away. Then there is the wife who committed suicide after watching her husband publicly denounce his writings. And in a rare amusing portion of the movie, Bon Bon the transvestite, played superbly by Johnny Depp, tries to help Reinaldo smuggle his writings out of prison. The movie has a definite nod toward women and a cynical, distrusting view of the men Arenas remembered which would parallel the government of Cuba at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, doesn't do justice to the book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read Reinaldo Arenas' autobiography, I was enlightened and moved. It was an aspect of Castro's regime with which I was unfamiliar. While I wasn't particularly shocked about the repression of artistry, I was unfamiliar with the hatred for homosexuality prevalent in his regime.I looked forward to seeing this movie a great deal. However, the film does a poor job in capturing Arenas' words. It's snippety, trying to cram far too much information in to the short time frame. It spends way too much time exploring his final days when it would have been better spent developing some of the other characters. It also takes some pretty MASSIVE liberties with the truth - misrepresenting Arenas' work and life! This hardly does justice to his amazing and courageous story.The acting is superb, there can be no fault ascribed to Bardem and the others (including the always magnificent Depp's interesting turns). But the director made so many poor choices that I had to actually go back and read the book again, I was so disappointed in its portrayal on film. It would be nearly impossible to capture all that the book entails in just a two hour film - so don't try!!! He made some very strange choices with regards to what he decided to include and exclude from his story. And why he decided to fabricate some of the story is beyond me; the real life story is strong enough on its own.A final complaint is that they didn't film the entire movie in Spanish. Rather, they flip back and forth between English and Spanish. Unfortunately, while Bardem's performance is wonderful, his accent significantly detracts from the flow of the film. And by choosing only to occasionally provide subtitles for the Spanish, you always feel like you're missing out. Just film it in Spanish - we can all read the subtitles!!! Why make that kind of a concession to Hollywood when it so clearly detracts from the film. And Arenas' words are better heard in Spanish - and I don't even speak the language! If you did enjoy this film, great. But I STRONGLY recommend you read Arenas' original words (albeit translated) if you really want to get a feel for his experiences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whislt there are many interesting conflicts to be pursued the movie tries to, briefly, add them all in ,and ends up by being a series of disjointed 30 second snaps with no depth.At the time it is portrayed homophobia was a global thing, not the result of Castro's Cuba alone, except that in other countries, while being illegal, homosexuals were not tortured. But there was not enough focus on this subject to hold my attention or garner one's sympathy.The huge political upheaval in Cuba whilst integral to movie is just glossed over with more 30 second scenes.The difficulty of writing freely in such an oppressive environment is not explored at all.He magically "just" meets a couple who waltz off to France with one of his manuscripts..The most significant friendship of his life, with a heterosexual man, OM, is glossed to a 30 second meeting on a rock by the sea,and the depth of this friendship is never realised nor explored either.Leaving it to seem superficial.The assisted suicide lacks any empathy whatsoever and is a throw away end of something that could have been emotionally draining.They need to go and look at old Ingamar Bergman movies !!!(eg Cries and Whispers) With a wealth of fascinating subject material to get their teeth into they deliver a scrappy, hop/skip/jump rambling of no consequence as it never stays on any subject long enough to raise empathy let alone connection to Bardem..who put in a flawless performance ..sadly.The real life character deserved better than this mish mash collage.And i realised too that OM is not a very good actor either which would account for his lack of decent roles since Unfaithful( much over hyped in my opinion anyway)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gay Writer born to write &amp; to be gay repressed by the State: maybe hot movie, but bad politics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is indeed a sad truth that the Cuban state repressed gays for many years. And it is also true that that same state has repressed writers. But to make a movie about a gay writer in Cuba that focuses on the repression he has suffered at the hands of the state leads to a very distorted view of the reality of Cuban life and to a kind of cinema of martyrdom. This movie presents as "biographical fact" many things that are questionable, but since the film lurches between sudden splashes of wild fantasy followed by scenes of gritty Cuban state oppression, we are led to accept the latter as the "truth" and the former as just the creative whim of a gay writer. It's just as likely that Arenas was a mediocre talent who used every unpleasant encounter with the Cuban state to promote his work and his own self-apotheosis. What's true, as well as the harsh treatment Arenas received at the hands of the Cuban state, is that that country has been living in a state of siege for more than 40 years at the hands of the most powerful country on earth; that the state has responded in a heavy-handed way to perceived threats of subversion coming from outside but using local malcontents; and that Cuba is the only country in Latin America to have anything resembling a full-employment economy, universal health care, universal access to housing and free education for all at all levels, and universal literacy. (True, there's no repression of writers in Guatemala, but, hell, 50% of the population can't even read; and in the States there's no need to repress writers since it's a foregone conclusion from the outset that their ideas will have no significant impact on the course of events.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie does make you appreciate the importance of living in a free society. The story is tragic, and shows the struggle that Reinaldo Arenas went through to practice his art of writing, and to gain freedom to do so. The movie also used a technique of actually having a voice over read some of the text that he had actually written. The voice overs gave you an insight into the authors wit, and skill as an author, while providing some additional insights into his life.However, for me the story, while memorable and educational, is too sad and slow to be a favorite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bardem's nomination acknowledges the film without endorsing it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film can not approach the communication of real oppression. The acts demonstrated here are, in most cases, less than that I was subjected to as a gay New Yorker of the late 50's/early 60's, let alone the horrendous persecution that must have occurred in early Castro Cuba. Bardem's nomination for a performance that is fine, if unextraordinary, seems to indicate the Academy's nod to the film's message (indeed a recital of an Arenas' poem about his oppression constantly intercuts shots of Havana and New York City), without actually endorsing a film that would certainly alienate the mass audience with its plethora of male frontal nudity and its several scenes of homosexual foreplay.</fullReview>

Although I never grew up in such poverty, there was much I could relate to in this film. Being gay before the revolution in Cuba and after was difficult enough but being born into poverty compounded the situation of a talented writer who only wanted to express himself and not be used by every jerk he happened to meet. This was definitely a "five hankie" movie. Very moving to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A movie about gay Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas and how he dealt with being gay and a writer under Castros regime. First off, Javier Badem gives an excellent performance as Arenas. The actor is not gay in real life, but you could have fooled me. Also there's some excellent direction by Julian Schnabel. But I really can't recommend the film. It's shot in both video and film, going back and forth for (seemingly) no reason--it gets annoying. Also the director is really into surrealism--he just throws in surrealistic moments in the film at random. They don't help, they throw you completely out of the story and drag out the movie longer (it runs over 2 hours). Also the story is fragmented. Half the time I didn't know who the people on screen were and how Arenas knew them. It gets very confusing towards the end. Also, having the actors speak (mostly) English was not a good idea. Bardem especially has a strong accent and I had trouble understanding him at times. So, it's a worthy subject and, again, Bardem is excellent, but the film doesn't match up. Also, there are two great cameos by Johnny Depp. Always good to see him--and he's excellent in both roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Is Getting Dark, So What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over-rated and totally unspectacular biopic about Reinaldo Arenas (portrayed by Oscar nominee Javier Bardem), a noted writer from Cuba who got in loads of trouble when Castro took over because of his musings and his homosexual lifestyle. The life of this dull and uninteresting person (from 1943-1990, when he died in New York of AIDS) is shown through confusing episodes that do little to explain anything about historical significance or the character's complexities. Instead relative new director Julian Schnabel would rather use ugly cinematography and early-1970s style exploitation tactics to get the points across. All seems lost very quickly as I just honestly was turned away almost immediately because of the way the subject matter is handled. This is not a fun picture to sit through; in fact it is an unsavory chore to put it plainly. Bardem might as well have been the only person on the screen as he is the only character that is on film long enough to learn about (and once again I did not care to learn about him in the first place). Distracting cameos by Sean Penn and Johnny Depp (in dual roles!?) add more confusion to this mean-spirited mess. If you want to watch a better picture with a similar story-line, might I suggest "Bitter Sugar" instead. 2.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this movie is like slow death ! I mean it ! The story goes on very slowly and it shows nothing special. The story is about a gay Cuban novelist who is being arrested by the regime of Castro. Yes I get it and totally agree that such like can be tough and a person who lives that life can be a hero, yeah yeah yeah , I get it OK ? But not all real stories or lives are suitable for the silver screen. I'm a broadcasting and film making student so I know exactly what should be look at when one start writing a script or even more basic a storyline! The first thing and the basic thing that the writer should ask himself is that , would the audience watch this ? Would this movie be important for the audience to watch ? This is in fact the first question that audience would ask themselves before or after watching the movie , " What is there for me or What was there for me " ? Honestly , this movie has nothing to offer the audience. The story is painfully slow and boring. Very few interesting things happen , there's no climax in the story and even worse the audience are not given enough details about the character to sympathize with them or even connect with them.Overall , a terrible movie , I give it 1 out of 10. you think I'm being nasty ? well , here's a fact , this movie made only 4 million dollars at the box office , which we all know in Hollywood is a big JOKE! I'm not nasty now , am I ? Make good movies , you get good reviews !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kind and/or pandering reviews treat this film as "fantastical" or "lyrical" account of the life of Cuban writer Reynaldo Arenas, but this merely obscures the film's lack of coherent concept, writing and direction.It might have helped matters if this film about life in Castro Cuba had been made in Spanish. Instead, the audience must struggle to hear and comprehend Latin American actors speaking poorly articulated English. Adding to the confusion, Sean Penn appears in a cameo role of campesino. Here's an American actor trying to play a Cuban actor trying to speak English. Yet, when Arenas' writings are quoted, the soundtrack switches to Spanish, translated into English subtitles.I left before the film ended, just after director Schnabel shifted to the technique of reprising a scene with different outcomes. I'd just seen Stephen Frears do something similar in "High Fidelity", to great comic effect. In "Before Night Falls" the same technique is bumbling and ineffective. Affection and respect for a gay writer who escaped from Castro's Cuba is no guarantee that you'll make a good film.</fullReview>

I haven't read the memoirs of Arenas, nor have I read any of his work, but this movie doesn't play on his artistic views, but on his personal experiences in a time of political and social turmoil, combined with perhaps what hurt him most, gay discrimination. It's hard, watching the kind of personal life he led, to be sympathetic to the character of Arenas, not because he was homosexual, but because judging by this screening of his memoirs, it looks like the only thing on his mind was sex. Kinky, uninhibited sex. Nothing wrong with that, basically, but I believe some aspects of the personal life, like sexual preferences and habits, should remain private. I really didn't understand anything about him as an artist by watching this movie. Instead I saw the sexual frustration that haunted him, and a tad of his political views. I saw great performances by all, especially Bardem, Wincott and Depp, although the latter put himself in a quite tasteless light.

		<fullReview>BEFORE NIGHT FALLS / (2000) ** (out of four)The most I learned from the recent biographical drama "Before Night Falls" was that the Cuban poet Reinaldo Arena was persecuted for being gay. Based on the memoirs of the same named and directed by the painter Julian Schnabel, whose "Basquiat" was innovative and harrowing. Here Schnabel is focused and artful, but cannot really accomplish much from the tedious script co written by Cunningham O'Keefe, Lazaro Gomez Carriles, and himself. Being a member of a screenwriting team of three, one would think Schnabel would have been more insightful and entertaining, but instead he helps construct a film that examines areas of the writer's life that should have been left out, and does not achieve clarity on the issue of Arenas' poetic talent. This production is a major disappointment."Before Night Falls" looks into the entire life of Reinaldo Arenas, but never actually introduces a character whom with the audience can relate. The story portrays the poet and novelist who was driven to homelessness and cruel persecution due to his art and sexual status. As a young man he ran away from home to join Castro's rebels, but was later imprisoned and punished harshly for his work and homosexuality. Javier Bardem portrays Reinaldo Arenas with a believable, convincing edge, but lacks the intensity and energy to bring the notable and potentially intriguing character to life. The supporting cast is not much help, concluding with several American actors, such as Johnny Depp and Sean Penn, with brief cameos.If Julian Schnabel wanted to examine a picture about sexual freedom then he took the wrong path. The film is not suggestive, and does not tease us with the character's quaint homosexuality. Instead we receive various sequences of extended male nudity. There is nothing interesting about watching naked men and viewing genitalia; nothing timely or erotic, just graphic and explicit. There is also nothing edgy or controversial with such nudity; people are not shocked or attracted to films just because they are not afraid to photograph under the belt, literally. Such aggressiveness exploits audacity, but the whole concept of the character being gay is done way over the top."Before Night Falls" does have a few nice elements. The mood and setting of the film appear authentic and honest, although often tranquil and unsettling. The use of grainy archival footage is a successful touch. There are also some wonderful images and cinematography. I also enjoyed how the movie stays focused on one central character, and there are no obvious plot distractions by unnecessary sub-plots. However, those variables are not enough to rescue the awkward story; it is just not very involving. I did not care about any of the characters. A shame, because "Before Night Falls" should have been a real event.</fullReview>
