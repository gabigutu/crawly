		<shortDescription>A rich, haunting, yet demanding work...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Peckinpah's "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" is a rich, haunting, yet demanding work that, above everything else, sees Billy as a creature of his day and age? He is by no means made a wholly sympathetic character, but who was sympathetic in the New Mexico of 1881? Peckinpah has most of his characters dyed with violence and sniffing the prevailing air of corruption?the chief protagonists, their filthy henchmen, even the onlookers? Where and what is the law? No one seems to know or care? Garrett and Billy have seen both sides, like almost everyone else?And among the confusion and violence that is the legacy of range war there is no gleam of purifying light in the efforts we see being made to clean up the territory? The powers that be want Billy out of New Mexico, not for ethical reasons, but rather so that things can be neatly protected for the approaching business exploitation?Garrett is the man made sheriff to hunt him down and thereby the man who compromises . . . 'This country's getting older and I aim to grow old with it ... there's an age in a man's life when he has to consider what's going to happen next.'But Billy can't compromise? It's not his way? "Billy, they don't like you to be so free!" proclaims the Bob Dylan theme song, summing up why the power men find Billy so irritating? Perhaps that's why Garrett who has sold out to power is in some ways a reluctant hunter? He salutes Billy's spirit?his very own personal declaration of independence?but he knows it's not the spirit of the new times?It says much for Peckinpah's way with actors that he gets such admirable performances out of the comparatively inexperienced Kris Kristofferson, as Billy, and Bob Dylan, as Billy's mate? It says just as much for his Westerns perceptiveness that he relies even more heavily on experience? The well-tried James Coburn is both solid and hard to define as Garrett? And then there are the others who know their way around Westerns so well?Katy Jurado, Slim Pickens, R. G. Armstrong, Jason Robards, Jack Elam, Chill Wills? There's not a single performance here that isn't a rounded-off portrait in its own right?It all adds up to a richness in characterization that is matched by the richness of marvelously composed scenes in which interiors and exteriors alike have been put together with loving care and attention to detail, whether it's a big set-piece 'shoot-up' or a close-up of a can of preserves?how such a can looked in 1881?Garrett's hunt for Billy is told mainly in set-pieces and it has to be said that Peckinpah makes little narrative concession to an audience in the way they are strung together? But for the out and out Western fan this is a most memorable movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's final, haunting eulogy to the West and Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, Sam Peckinpah's "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" is one of the last great Westerns ever made. Like most of 'Bloody' Sam's films, "Pat Garrett" was molested and cut by the studio, MGM upon its release. The film would be panned by audiences and critics. It's a shame that Peckinpah never lived to see the longer cut of the film finally released to a wider audience on VHS. It would become a cult hit and is now known as one of the best Westerns and one of Peckinpah's best. The film depicts the final days of Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson) before he was killed by his friend Pat Garrett (James Coburn), the newly appointed sheriff of the territory. Other than the fine performances of Coburn and Kristofferson, the film also features excellent supporting roles from famous Western regulars and members of Peckinpah's stock of actors. The long list of players include Jason Robards, Bob Dylan (also the film's music composer), Slim Pickens, R.G. Armstrong, L.Q. Jones, Katy Jurado, Paul Fix, Chill Wills, Jack Elam, Harry Dean Stanton, Richard Jaeckel, and Dub Taylor. Most of the characters are killed off in the film, violently evoking both the death of the West and Westerns.Peckinpah's two regular themes are here: the death of the West, and men living past their time and deciding whether or not they should accept change. My favorite scene in the film takes place about halfway through the film. Pat Garrett, isolated and alone, is sitting by his fire near a river bank. He sees a man about his age and his family sailing on a raft down the river. The man is shooting bottles for target practice. Garrett takes a shot at a bottle. The man sees Garrett and shoots back. Garrett then takes cover behind the nearby tree. They both are aiming at each, but just lower their guns are stare at each other. The raft continues to flow down the river. The scene, which was the reason why Peckinpah, Coburn, and almost everyone wanted to take part in the film, has so much meaning to it. 1. It references an earlier scene with Garrett and Sheriff Baker (Slim Pickens). Baker was building a boat so he could drift out of territory because of how awful it has become. Tragicaly, Baker does not get a chance to see this dream. 2. The scene also references the shoot-out between Garrett and Black Harris (L.Q. Jones). Before his death, Harris yells to Garrett "Us old boys shouldn't be doing this to each other." The same thing happens between Garrrett and the man on the raft. Other than the performances, the film also features some good musical pieces by Dylan. John Coquillon's cinematography is also very beautiful and haunting at the same time. Peckinpah, as always, was able to get period detail down correctly. Rudy Wurlitzer also did a fine job at the screenplay, despite Peckinpah improving most of it himself. Coburn's performance was possibly his best ever. The idea of Garrett having a lot of inner conflict was good. Garrett knew that he had a job to do, but just could not handle the fact it was his friend that he had to kill. Maybe he was the one who put the gun in the outhouse for Billy to use. It was also great to see the myth and actual facts of the last days of this incident played out.Although this film may have a few faults (some of Dylan's music and a few of his scenes), "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" is really worth the time to view now that a DVD will be released on January 10th, 2006. The Two-Disc set will feature two versions of the film. The first one is a 115 min. version editied by Peckinpah biographers Nick Redman and Paul Seydor. The second disc will feature the 122 min. version assembled in 1988. According to both men, there was no final cut to "Pat Garrett." The version that Peckinpah screeded for the MGM heads was just a rough cut. Either way, the DVD will now a new generation of film lovers to be able to view how costly it is when an artist cannot complete his work. Peckinpah and editiors originally had six months to edit, but the idiots from the studio cut it down to two months. I guess the new 115 minute version of the film is closer to Peckinpah's vision because of notes and interviews with the filmmaker's colleagues. No matter which version you will watch, "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" is a sad but magnificent Western made by one of the last great storytellers of the Western genre.Billy: Old Pat...Sheriff Pat Garrett. Sold out to the Sana Fe ring. How does it feel? Pat: It feels like...that times have changed. Billy: Times maybe. Not me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sporadically brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is a unique western. Parts of it are just brilliant, other moments are bungled, but it is composed and structured like no other movie from the genre.Everyone knows the western legend about these two central characters, who went from being friends to sworn adversaries. The leading performances of James Coburn (Garrett) and Kris Kristofferson (Billy) are rather colourless, but the subsidiary characters are beautifully delineated. There are some pretentious moments. For example, near the start Billy is arrested and as he makes his way towards the lawmen who have come to take him, he adopts a Christ-like pose which is presumably meant to signify that he was some kind of martyr among Wild West outlaws (when, in reality, he was probably just a psychopath).However, there are stunning moments in the film too. In fact, the scene in which Slim Pickens stumbles, wounded and mortally bleeding, to a riverside so that he can die peacefully is arguably the most moving scene ever in a motion picture. The acting, the music and the photography fit together harmoniously to make this a truly magical cinematic moment.One word of warning: beware of the incoherent, chopped-up 106 minute version of the film. If you're planning to watch it, go for the full 122 minute director's cut, which is immeasurably superior.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The death of the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, a film about the doomed friendship between the two title characters, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is really a film about the death of a way of American life. Death is omni-present in this film, and the compelling aspect of it is that so many of the characters are completely prepared to accept it and deal it out. The best and saddest moments in the film involve characters who know they are going to die and accept it. And the performances are all remarkable. Kristofferson's easygoing and charismatic portrayal of Billy is the best work of his career, as is Coburn's sad-eyed interpretation of Pat Garrett. A wonderful film, almost as good as Peckinpah's masterpiece The Wild Bunch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the film that Peckinpah set out to make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally got to see the recent DVD Special Edition, with what probably is the film that Peckinpah set out to make, or close to it. This is definitely not the film I saw in 1973; and, yes, it is much better. The restoration has emphasized the real beauty of much of the cinematography. And it is not only the restored 9 minutes that give the film added power, but a slight but important rearrangement of scenes that manages to convey the all-important development of Pat Garrett's character, which is the real heart of the film.It must be noted that this was a career-defining moment for James Coburn as Pat Garrett. Garrett, a former outlaw getting on the "right side" of the law in order to "live to be old and rich", is a problematic personality: he wants to be noble, but he's too scared of aging; he sets his old colleagues against each other, leading to the deaths of many of them - he becomes an angel of death for the Old West itself, yet (unlike, say, George Steven's Shane) he doesn't represent any civilizing force to replace it with. He can't admit any of this to himself, but he can't avoid it.Consequently, by accepting the role, Coburn accepted an opportunity to set aside his most famous incarnation as the goofy hipster of such films as "President's Analyst" and "Our Man Flint", and to pursue a path closed off with the lost opportunity in Leone's rugged but incomplete "Duck, You Sucker", to play a complex, brooding and violent man haunted by an unforgiving past. Coburn's performance, at once quiet and strong, as complex as the character demands, really makes this film; and that it is Garrett's film, not Billy's, is now clear.Are there weaknesses to the film? Yes. The historic background to the main story is lost; this being Garrett's film, we don't really need as much of Billy as we get from the film; finally, there are moments of self-indulgence on Peckinpah's part that are distracting and unnecessary. Peckinpah uses the film to rid himself of one of his supposed influences: the fourth major scene in the film is a remake of a scene toward's the end of Arthur Penn's "Left-Handed Gun" - by bringing it to the fore, Peckinpah is obviously getting it out of the way as quickly as possible. (Penn, not the Peckinpah of "The Wild Bunch", was the director who introduced the notion of a gunfight ending in a "bullet ballet" in "Bonnie and Clyde" - a fact some critics of the early '70s used to insist that "Wild Bunch" was somehow derivative of that film.) However, as the film goes on, a new influence shows up, and in spades - Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time In the West". From Coburn's dressing in black and smoking a cigar when he firsts captures Billy, to the moment when Garrett and two colleagues approach the house where Billy's staying at the end, Leone's visuals and themes rise to the taste like hot-sauce in a bowl of chili.Peckinpah's film is not really derivative - after all, Peckinpah's West is not that of Leone - Peckinpah's West is rich in color, and surprisingly green; trees don't make any appearance at all in Leone's deserted Monument Valley (and it's Spanish equivalent)location photography; in Peckinpah's West they play a substantial role as reminders of an ever-young nature infested with aging gunmen.Yet the fact that Peckinpah and his crew felt a need to find a reference point in Leone's film hints at the source of weakness in this film, a lack of unifying vision. Although I don't agree that the story is so episodic that its inherent power is lost, there's no denying a lack of clarity at times.Having said all this, I still insist that this is a really good film, and a really fine end-of-an-era farewell to the American "Old West" - or rather, to it's legend - the West never was "shoot-outs on main-street" or anything like that. The reason why directors like Peckinpah and Leone made such films as this was that they and their audiences were at last waking up to that fact, that what they learned as legends were little more than historical anomalies. Yes, there really was a "Billy the Kid" - and he had no more historic importance than the average gangsta on the streets of East L.A. has today. Nonetheless, the biographical evidence is that Peckinpah at one time believed in the myth, and certainly preferred it to the reality. It is therefore a sign of courage and artistic integrity that he chose to make films about the end of the myth, rather than glorifying it. Neither Garrett nor the Kid are really very admirable in this film; if the film feels "distant" - and it does - this is because there is no moral center to the film - and, as it happens, that was true of the real West of the 19th century as well - it was just empty space, scenery, and some misfits of various backgrounds trying to find some ways to make a living in an as-yet inhospitable domain.It is as yet unclear whether they succeeded; certainly films like this suggest they didn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Especially the director's cut, this is one of the finest Westerns ever made. Yes, Bob Dylan didn't make the best soundtrack (with the exception with the beginning music and the river music), and the studio version lacks quality, this is Sam Peckinpah at his finest since "The Wild Bunch". Peckinaph is one of my all time favorite directors because most of his movies are great, and this one is no different. James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson in the title roles are excellent, especially the always great Coburn (R.I.P.). What is also great is most of the Peckinpah regulars and recognizable Western characters making a great support cast, including Chill Wills, L.Q. Jones, R.G. Armstrong, Matt Clark, Slim Pickens, Katy Jurado, Jack Elam, Harry Dean Stanton, Emilio Fernandez, Richard Jaeckel, Barry Sullivan, Dub Taylor, Elisha Cook Jr., and John Beck. Even Peckinaph has a great cameo. Bob Dylan isn't the best actor, but his character plays an important part. He represents the story teller that passes down the legend of this story to all generations. This is a film that all Peckinpah and Western fans can't miss. It's a shame Sam never lived to make another Western like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a laconic, sometimes-great take on iconic Western figures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah really is not the full problem or liability with Pat Garret &amp; Billy the Kid, though he's not totally innocent in what shortcomings come with the film. The story by Rudy Wurlizter provides a mix of extraordinary scenes and some all-too laid-back ones or scenes that don't feel like there is any real dramatic pull or total interest in the dialog. The other great scenes, which make up the most memorable bits of the film, provide Peckinpah with enough to put his distinctive visual style and subversive approach to character dynamics and conventions of the Western genre, but the parts end up becoming greater than the whole. The version I saw, the 2005 cut, doesn't seem like it would do any more or less better with fine tuning, and it does feel like a Peckinpah movie more often than not. The story is simple, and has been told more times than one could try to count unless in historical context of the genre: Billy the Kid is a murderous criminal out on the lam, and Pat Garret, the sheriff, is out to get him by hook or by crook. The twist that Peckinpah provides at the core is that it's not a completely intense thriller with a lot of chases, but more of a journey where the two men- who before becoming Dead-or-Alive Wanted-man and newly appointed Sheriff were sort of on friendly terms (as first scene shows well and clear)- are not in a big rush to meet their fates, even if the whole experience is starting to make things all the more embittered.Pat Garret &amp; Billy the Kid does provide, at the very least, some very great scenes throughout- some of the best I've seen in any Peckinpah film- and is a reminder of why the director was an important figure, and remains as such, in American cinema. Scenes like the river-side bit where Pat Garret shoots at the same bottle floating in the river as the guy with his family on the river-raft does; the astoundingly dead-pan shooting scene between Billy (Kris Kristofferson) and Alamosa (Jack Elam) where they sit down for a peaceful meal and go to it without much of a fuss in front of Alamosa's family; the scene with Garret getting the man to drink in the bar too much as Alias (Bob Dylan) reads off the products on the other side of the room in order to shoot him down; the scenes (in the 2005 cut that seem fairly important) showing Garret and his attitude towards women, either with his wife or with the prostitutes. It's a shame then that after the first twenty minutes or so, which includes that unforgettable shoot-out (one of the best in Peckinpah's Westerns) as Garret first corners Billy at the hide-out and drags him off to a not-quite jail before his escape, it then goes sort of up and down in full interest.It's not that I wouldn't recommend Pat Garret &amp; Billy the Kid, far from it, and especially for fans of the genre looking for a grim turn of the screws on one of those old-time mythic Western stories. The only main issue is that, in an odd way, the other side of the coin that Peckinpah and his writer are working with here- subversion- has the side of almost being too at ease with itself, of being too comfortable just rolling along. This might be in part due to the leads themselves; Coburn, to be sure, is a pro as always and is especially good in the almost anti-climax at the Fort, but Kristofferson is not very well-rounded, and comes off as being sort of all grins and smiles when he should be living up a little more to his reputation. It's so against-the-grain of the old-west that it comes close (though it doesn't, contrary to what Ebert said in his review) to being dull. Luckily, Peckinpah never lets it get too uninteresting, and there's always something to look forward to, like the touching, actually poetic final scene with Slim Pickens, and seeing the likes of Stanton, Elam and Robards in various roles.Dylan, on the other hand, is sort of a double-edged sword here. The music that he provides for the film, which includes guitar segways, lyricism and some classic songs (with 'Knockin' on Heaven's Door' just the right effect when used), is one of the very best things about the movie. But his presence as "Alias" is not as good. He seems to be there more for the sake of being in a Western, or a Peckinpah movie, and taking aside his shtick about feeling like he was a character here in a previous life or whatever, he's almost a non-entity, and alongside the seasoned character actors and old pros at doing this it doesn't feel quite right. This being said, he's not too much of a deterrent, and it's great having the music put to scenes that wouldn't be the same without it all. And, of course, it's Peckinpah all the way, with the men in a sort of damned state of affairs, knowing deep down that the chosen paths are not very easily traveled, and always surrounded by the most distinct, brutal and realistic violence possible. It's the kind of Western I probably wouldn't pass up if it came on TV and I had a good shot of whiskey, though it doesn't reach the level of practical perfection like the Wild Bunch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best contemporary westerns made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Opening with the gunning down of Pat Garrett in 1909, we flash back to 1881 where Garrett has been hired to bring his ex-partner in crime Billy the Kid to justice. The story unfolds against a backdrop of a west that is moving forward, driven by businessmen (represented by Chisum) leaving behind the 'old ways'.Of modern (ie after 50's and 60's) westerns Once Upon a Time in the West stands out as the best. However I feel that this film covers similar themes, of the death of the cowboy way and passing of times. The story is not really a duel between Pat and Billy but more a look at times changing around them ? with Garrett changing with them and Billy trying to remain still. The story is well told with plenty of good characters, great setups and interesting dialogue. The relationships and the look at the old west 'code' easily hold the interest.Peckinpah does plenty of good work here ? for example intercutting the killing of Garrett with the killing of chickens etc, making it visually clever too. However his best move is the use of Bob Dylan's score ? it could have been intrusive and made the film feel tacky and like it tries too hard to be hip. Instead the score works well and gives the film a soulful feel.The cast is not only superb but deep with talent. Coburn is as good as ever as Garrett, struggling to move with times he doesn't approve of. Kristofferson is good, but his character of Billy is not well developed, but he still has a strong role to play. The support cast is full of famous faces from Westerns and a few actors just starting out ? slim Pickens, Chill Wills, Jack Elam, Luke Ashew, Charles Martin Smith, Harry Dean Stanton and a good part for Bob Dylan.If you're watching it ? make sure you've got the restored version that adds 15 minutes and uses the score better. The director's version makes more of the role of Boss Chisum and fills the story out with playful brothel scenes and delivers a few more cameos. It makes a big difference to the film and lifts the story above being Garrett versus Billy the Kid.Overall an excellent western from one of the greats at this type of thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Peckinpah's Finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed the film very much, in part because Peckinpah continues his theme, as he did in "Ballad of Cable Hogue" and "The Wild Bunch", of the illusion of who is "good" and who is "evil." Also, Peckinpah mourns the passing of people such as Garrett and Billy; at one point Garrett says to Poe, "This country's getting old, and I'm to get old with it." Garrett knows that he and Billy, among others, are to disappear from the West as big business and civilization advance, and Garrett tries to avoid this by selling out to Chisum (Barry Sullivan) and the Santa Fe Ring. But Garrett is a torn man; he is trying to avoid the tide of history by avoiding the eventual meeting with Billy, while also trying to avoid the financial forces (e.g., Chisum) that are making individuals such as himself disappear, so that big business will take over. The entire film is really a depiction of Garrett and Billy avoiding each other in order to resist historical forces that they would have a better chance of surviving if both of them left New Mexico or if both of them were on the same side. However, Garrett feels that aligning himself with the ranchers is better for survival, but in the end the hand that fed him, so to speak, is the same hand that destroys him. A truly poetic, and quite elegiac film, one that I feel is underrated among Peckinpah's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over-rated And Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid again tonight after a few decades. What a disappointment. If the story is true that Sam Peckinpah was so angry at the studio cut that he urinated on the screen, I can see why. It suffers from bad casting, bad editing and dull pacing, and is often just plain boring. This is due in part to Bob Dylan's irritating music, which drones on and on in the background like a stuck record. They should have gone with a real score by someone who actually knows how to write music. Imagine "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" without Ennio Morricone. The dramatic tension in this movie could have been seriously improved by an intelligent soundtrack, and not amateur Dylan-whining. At the time it might have been hip, but decades later it's just plain bad. I did like the gritty, dusty sense of reality in the sets and locations. But how come everybody is grizzled and gritty except for Kris Kristofferson, who is totally clean-shaven in every scene. He always looks waxed and buffed, like he just stepped out of the make-up trailer. Wouldn't some stubble and grit look more realistic on a wanted outlaw? He's also too old for the part, can't act worth a damn, and always speaks in his famous patented monotone drawl that he uses for every movie he's ever been in. There's a lot of major flaws in this movie. Casting Bob Dylan was definitely one of them. He's totally out of place with all the famous characters like Jack Elam, Slim Pickens, and Dub Taylor. Putting him beside James Coburn, who is a real actor and very believable, is a joke. Dylan was obviously written in for one reason only--- to sell the soundtrack. One of the most over-rated westerns of all time, and definitely not one of Peckinpah's best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The times they are a'changing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The government has two arms of varying length. The long one is for taking ? it reaches everywhere. The short one is for giving- it reaches only to those nearest." - Ignazio Silone Sam Peckinpah directs "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid", a retelling of the "Billy the Kid" legend. The plot: Kris Kirstofferson plays William Bonney (aka "The Kid"), an outlaw on the run from Pat Garrett (James Coburn), the Lincoln Country sheriff hot on his heels.Like most Westerns, "Pat Garrett" is suffused with nostalgia. It's a supremely elegiac film, all of Peckinpah's characters unnaturally aware of their own mortality, the fading of an era and the apparent "death" of the Wild West. Were men living in the lead-up of the Industrial Revolution so morose and melancholic? Were those who witnessed the decline of frontier life so brooding? Of course not. But Peckinpah's always been a Romantic. Even his central characters, Garrett and Kid, have a near romantic affair. Less predator and prey, they're a couple of one-time lovers who now find themselves at odds. Here, Garrett embodies an era of modernisation, industrialisation, land enclosures, consolidated power, large scale farming and business cartels, whilst Billy becomes the last vestiges of the Wild West, an outlaw who refuses to be tamed by tomorrow. Billy dies, of course, like so many Western heroes steam-rolled by time.Like Leone's "Once Upon A Time In The West" and "Once Upon A Time In America", "Pat Garret and Billy the Kid" is therefore a rather superficial lament, salivating over trinkets of yesteryear (both cinematic and mythological) and pining nostalgically for an idealised past that never quite existed. More interesting is the presence of songwriter Bob Dylan (his acting is atrocious), who plays a mysterious vagabond who witnesses the events between Billy and Garret and, we assume, spins his observances into both Peckinpah's ballad and Dylan's own protest songs of the 1960s. This draws a line directly from the reordering of the West to the cultural and political turmoils of the 1960s. Hence Peckinpah's casting of musicians (Kirstofferson and Dylan) and the film's frequent allusions to Peckinpah's own life; the role of the artist is being implicitly aligned to that of the defiant outlaw."Garret" is notable for its extraordinary cast of secondary character actors, all of whom are given the film's best moments. Jason Robards, Barry Sullivan, Slim Pickens, Katy Jurado, Jack Elam, Harry Dean Stanton, Chill Wills, Elisha Cook Jr, Gene Evans etc all pop up and are given neat little sequences, particularly Pickens, whose affecting death to the tune of Dylan's "Knocking on Heaven's Door" has become one of cinema's classic moments. Nevermind that Pickens' character is introduced only seconds earlier, has no back-story and is virtually unknown to us. Pickens' death, as he is watched by his wife (Katy Jurado), somehow reaches out of the film and conjures up Pickens' own real life demise."Garret" is scored almost exclusively by Bob Dylan, but it's a mediocre score, Dylan's particular brand of music ? verbose, literary and heavy on wordplay ? being ill suited to cinema. Unsurprisingly, the only two songs that work well in the film are the conventional (by Dylan standards) "Knocking on Heaven's Door" and a near wordless song toward the film's end. Everything else comes across as a poor man's version of "McCabe and Mrs Miller's" Leonard Cohen soundtrack.If Peckinpah's narrative is both conventional and unambitious, his aesthetic is nevertheless gorgeous. He composes shots like scuffed up murals, draws decrepit Mexican towns like no other, always gets warm performances out of his actors, always makes good use of extras, and captures the tempo and grime of untamed scrub-lands.As is now well known, "Garret" is episodic and choppy and suffered extensive studio interference. The film was written by Rudolph Wurlitzer, but Peckinpah did significant rewrites, all of which upset Wurlitzer. After much trouble during shooting (disease, budget problems, violence, alcoholism), MGM head James Aubrey took editing duties away from Peckinpah and turned them over to a team of editors who were given 2 months to produce a "final cut". This cut was released in 1973 and became a box office flop. Critics were likewise unkind. Peckinpah supervised a re-editing of the picture in 1974. To date there are several cuts of the film. Unconscionably, the latest DVD release (2005) is largely identical to Aubrey's butchered 1973 cut. Fans rightfully regard a 1988 directors cut as being both superior and definitive.The irony of all Westerns which lament of the "death of the West" (ie, the notion that the steam engine and modernisation killed paradise) is that the "cowboy era" barely lasted one generation. From 1600 to 1790, America was characterised by handicraft/subsistence production alongside elements of a semi-capitalist economy (mostly the commercial production of tobacco). The largest, most commercialised sections of the economy were staffed by enslaved and semi enslaved workers. From 1790 to 1865, several industries began to be organised along capitalist lines and some agriculture sectors lost their subsistence character. With the invention of barbed wire, the era of open ranges and the cowboy then died. By the period's end, agriculture as a whole was being produced exclusively for the market. Every level of government was then structured such that it controlled the distribution and ownership of land (income taxes were then enforced), and politics increasingly revolved around how best to channel the best pieces of land to those closest to the seats of political power. A working class of free and unfree elements then grew rapidly. From the death of Billy the Kid onwards, roughly 1865 to 1920, the American economy then became predominantly capitalist, attaining an exceptional pace as industry and agriculture became subject to market forces. 7.9/10 ? Though muddled, many of Peckinpah's greatest moments are here. Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisionist and exciting Western about the legendary gunmen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an intense and moving Western about a known gunslinger, the most famous outlaw-gunfighter of the South-west. However some moments is slow moving and contains a few flaws and gaps. Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn are cool as the title roles. Furthermore the secondary cast is frankly extraordinary: Chill Wills, Richard Jaeckel, Jack Elam,Rita Coolidge,Emilio Fernandez, L.Q. Jones, and Slim Pickens-Katy Jurado who form an intimate couple . And several cameos, Jason Robards, Jack Elam,Elisha Cook Jr and the same Peckinpah.Good cinematography by John Coquillon and emotive songs by Bob Dylan who sings classics as 'knocking on heaven's door's'; Dylan plays an anachronistic character and is pitifully miscast. This twilight look about Billy and Garrett was well directed by Sam Peckimpah , an expert filmmaker and writer.Sam Peckimpah , after beginning his career as a writer , he was soon involved in TV Westerns . Filming popular television Western as ¨Rifleman¨ , ¨Westener¨ , and ¨Gunsmoke¨ . Moving into pictures in 1961 giving fine impression with ¨Deadly companions¨ starred by Brian Keith and Mauren O'Hara . After that , he did the prestigious ¨Ride the high county¨ that along with ¨Wild Bunch¨ , at the peak of his popularity , remain Sam's best films . Later on , he made ¨Major Dundee¨ that was heavily re-cutting . He subsequently filmed tougher-than-tough action movies , including gushing blood and guts with particular images in slow-moving , such as : ¨The getaway¨ , ¨the killer elite¨, the most popular ¨Straw dogs¨ , Convoy¨, and ¨The Osterman weekend¨ , until his early death . This interesting Western titled ¨Pat Garret and Billy the Kid¨ is correctly based on real events, the deeds happened on the following way : Billy(Kris Kristofferson) became a cowboy in Lincoln County, New Mexico, for cattleman Tunstall. But in 1978 Tunstall was killed by a rival cattle outfit and this began the Lincoln County War, in which Billy played a leading part and was one of the group that shot dead Sheriff Brady. At that time the Lincoln County War was in progress,a range war between rival cattle interests, the Kid was a leading gunman for one faction but Pat Garrett, a former friend of Billy, stayed out of the fighting. When Billy became a rustler, the big ranch owners, especially John Chisum( played by John Wayne in the film with same title), wanted him out of the way and the man they chose to do the job was Pat Garrett. Then Pat Garrett(James Coburn) was elected sheriff of Lincoln County and set out to capture the young outlaw. He caught him and Bill was convicted of killing sheriff Brady and sentenced to be hanged . But Billy although shackled hands and foot,managed to escape from jail by shooting dead the two deputies(Matt Clark and R.G. Armstrong) guarding him. Garrett went after him again and on 15 July 1881 tracked him to the home of Pete Maxwell at Fort Sumner, New Mexico, where Billy was along with his band(Harry Dean Stanton, Bob Dylan) and there shot him dead by surprise in a dark room.Legend says that Billy killed twenty-one men in his twenty-one years of life, the exact figure is not known but is thought to be much less. After Pat Garrett was not reelected sheriff of Lincoln County, however he was commissioned a captain in the Texas Rangers. On 19 February 1908 he was driving his buggy on a lonely desert road, he stepped down to urinate and was shot in the back by a hired killer. A man stood trial for the murder but was acquitted. Controversy still surrounds the end of Pat Garrett.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfocused, Distant, Occasionally Brilliant Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In early 1881, Pat Garrett (James Coburn), an aging outlaw, is elected Sheriff of Lincoln County, New Mexico. He is pressured by Governor Lew Wallace (Jason Robards) and business interests to track down former partner William H. Bonney, alias Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson) and his gang. Bonney is captured but escapes, killing two deputies (Matt Clark and R.G. Armstrong), and Garrett - accompanied by several reluctant and generally short-lived deputies (Slim Pickens, Katy Jurado, Jack Elam, Richard Jaeckel) and one hired to keep an eye on Garrett (John Beck) - is forced to track down his former friend, decimating his gang in the process. Garrett is made to feel guilty over "getting fat" and betraying Billy, and when he finally confronts the Kid, it seems like he's killing himself.Perhaps even more than the infamous "Major Dundee", "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" is touted by Peckinpah fans as a lost masterpiece, ruined by studio interference. One can only hear such an argument so many times before concluding that many Peckinpah fans are, in their own way, just as deluded as the most hardcore Trekkies or "Star Wars" fans. Refusing to face up to the fact their favorite director was a drunken, violent, confrontational, unfocused individual who more often than not had no idea what the hell he was doing, Peckinpah fans attack the studio, blaming them for everything that went wrong with the films. Admittedly, Columbia on "Dundee" and MGM here did seriously hurt the films, to say the least; but they can be hardly blamed for the fact that Peckinpah completely misapprehended what he was doing on the films and was, more often than not, his own worst enemy.The biggest problem with "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid", even in its director's cut form, is that is unfocused and virtually plot less; only a few characters appear for more than one or two scenes, and most scenes play as isolated episodes. It is also a surprisingly distant film, especially compared to "Ride the High Country" and "The Wild Bunch", and it's virtually impossible (for this writer at least) to become deeply involved in. Billy in particular is hard to care much about, as he does little more than drink, kill, and whore throughout the course of the film. And the theme that Garrett and co. are selling out is expounded upon so often that you think Rudy Wurlitzer was getting paid for each time he wrote them.The use of Western icons like Slim Pickens, Jack Elam, Paul Fix, Richard Jaeckal, etc. in various bit parts actually (with a few exceptions) undermines what Peckinpah is trying to achieve; by not letting us get to know these characters, it becomes virtually impossible to sympathize with them. Slim Pickens' famous death scene is allegedly the most poignant and moving scene in the film, but as we just met him two minutes ago when he buys it, it's hard to really care what happens to him; I'm more concerned with L.Q. Jones' death in the same sequence. Some cast members are outright terrible: John Beck is obnoxious as Poe, and while that's appropriate to the character he grates on the viewer's nerves. A very young Charles Martin Smith whines his way through the opening scene as a particularly obnoxious cohort of Billy's. Emilio Fernandez, so effective as General Mapache, has a worthless role as Paco, the Mexican sheep-farmer who befriends Billy, and his scenes are some of the worst Peckinpah ever filmed. Richard Jaeckal gives a wooden performance and his horrible-looking wig doesn't help matters. But most of the cast members simply aren't around long enough to make much impact - Pickens, Jurado, Paul Fix, Dub Taylor, Elisha Cook Jr., Jason Robards, and Barry Sullivan (among many others) are all in the film for five minutes or less. Bob Dylan's bit has little impact on the film; his music, however, is borderline terrible. It might be good outside of the film, but for the most part it distracts from the action.The film does, however, have sporadic moments of brilliance, starting with James Coburn's performance as Garrett. Coburn gives the best performance of his career, as the sarcastic, biting, fatalistic Garrett. He is a nice counterpart to Deke Thornton, but even more compromised. Garrett genuinely regrets most of his actions - many of his confrontations with Billy's gang are outright murder - but does them anyway. Coburn is wonderfully subtle and you believe he IS Garrett, rather than acting the part. Kris Kristofferson is good if unremarkable as Billy, though he can hardly be blamed for the poor interpretation of his character. And there are some members of the supporting cast who are effective: Richard Bright and L.Q. Jones as two of Billy's more colorful gang members, R.G. Armstrong, playing the psychopathic Deputy Ollinger ("Repent, you son of a bitch!"), and Chill Wills as a gutter-mouthed, shotgun-toting bartender.Peckinpah's direction is sporadically brilliant. The shootouts of the film are blunt and violent and lack the visceral thrill of "The Wild Bunch". This is not a criticism; in fact, it is very effective. There are some truly brilliant sequences; the shootout at Billy's hideout and Billy's escape from jail, the chance encounter and duel between Billy and Alamosa Bill (Jack Elam), the murder of Holly (Bright) by Garrett, Peckinpah's own cameo as a coffin maker, Garrett shooting the mirror after killing the Kid."Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" is a difficult and frustrating film to write about. For every good scene there's one that makes you scratch your head and ask "What the hell's going on?" It's a film with occasionally great scenes, but please don't call it a masterpiece. It's a fatally flawed film, plain and simple.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull and plodding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually enjoy Sam Peckinpah films, but this slow paced, meandering meditation on the decline of the West just never sparked my interest. There's an excellent cast, great music, stunning cinematography, terrific production design ... all the ingredients are there, but it never came alive for me.The performances are so understated that the characters have no definition. Kristofferson plays Billy the Kid and James Coburn his friend turned nemesis, Sheriff Pat Garrett. It takes two hours for Garrett and Billy to have their final showdown; in the process they drift languidly through one laconic scene after another. There's a fair amount of gunplay, with the by now banal slow motion deaths, but even the action sequences lack fire.This is ultimately a meditative, brooding film, which is probably the idea; but it's just too plodding for my taste.One trivial gripe: whatever they used for blood in this picture struck me as some of the fakiest I've ever seen. It looks exactly like plain red paint. It's actually a distraction, detracting from the impact of the action scenes. It's the one aspect of the production design that rings a false note.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Peckinpah fans will go to their graves insisting on it's high quality; (invisable only to us non Peckhead morons}; the fact remains right up their on the screen in any version: this is a nicely shot but vapid film, filled with uneven performances, dumb dialog, and pretentiously rehashed ideas from other Peckinpah films. You might not have like Peckinpah's ideas in "Straw Dogs" or even "The Wild Bunch", but they were certainly guided by an original, virtuoso hand. Here characters wonder into a scene, crack a dirty joke, scratch themselves, and shoot somebody, or... maybe not. Peckinpah seems to be blowing vainglorious raspberry's at his critics, there are scenes of pointless cruelty enacted by the film's anti-heroes, animal abuse, and women whores who always seem happily mute in their work. The cast, the photography, and Bob Dylan's good score give it curio value; and the Slim Pickens scene works well. This is, however, tough going and ultimately pretty dull. When you hear the commentators fawning over the film on the commentary, you can't help but thinking some of this sort of stuff played a part in the man's downfall. As Dylan once said of his early rock performances, met with vicious booing: "Well, you can kill somebody with kindness."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With two classic westerns under his belt (Ride the High Country and The Wild Bunch)and a reputation for being a rebellious non-conformist you would think Sam Peckinpah the ideal person to relate the story of the teen prodigy outlaw, Billy the Kid. You would be wrong. From start to finish this western is an aimless mess. Scenes are poorly paced and disjointed. It looks like it was edited on a beach. Kris Kristofferson is clearly too old and limited for Billy. As Garrett, James Coburn fares much better with a stylish and graceful performance that exudes a cool confidence despite being in conflict with himself. Bob Dylan supplies some fine music but his performance is an embarrassment. In minor rolls some of the great old guard (Slim Pickens, Katy Jurado, Chill Wills, Jack Elam, R G Armstrong) steal every scene they are in. There's the requisite slow mo blood spattering scenes of violence and in one scene Chickens replace scorpions (without the symbolism) in a gruesome moment of male bonding but Peckinpah for the most part allows Dylan's score to set the pace in scenes, rendering them sluggish and mawkish. At this point in his career it was clear Peckinpah had nothing left. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is a testament to how far and fast he had fallen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this was on TCM the other night and I recorded it, merely because I knew it was supposed to be good and I hadn't seen a Peckinpah film before. Despite how massive TCM's black screen banners are, and despite how quiet the film was, it still kept me engaged. James Coburns' masterful performance as wrinkly bandit Pat Garret was smouldering, his lawman bubbled with a mix of sadism, violence, and broken honour. He was far and away the best actor in the film. Comparatively, Kris Kristofferson just didn't hold up, I just plain didn't like him, and he didn't come across strongly enough as anything. It seems to me he's grown more expressive and nuanced as he's gotten older, though it may just be that against a giant like Coburn he seemed like little more than a distraction.Though his performance was woeful, Dylan's soundtrack is a thing of beauty and joy, setting the tone of the movie, perfectly complimenting some scenes and brilliantly offsetting others. The scene in which Knocking On Heavens Door is used is possibly one of the most beautiful and moving sequences in any film I've seen, it was utterly breathtaking.Much of that is done by the cinematography, which is frequently fantastic. There are several shots that had my mouth wide open, agape. Peckinpah is also well versed in directing shoot-out's,and building tension before and after. Though the make up and special effects look laughable now, the brutality and voyeurism of the violence haven't faded one iota.The print was very quiet though, so it was often hard to decipher what people were saying. As such, there were various moments when I was just waiting for the next scene, as the one playing was too quiet to enjoy. This is a film that I can't wait to watch again, and will certainly be buying on DVD, along with the soundtrack on CD. A brilliant, moving western from a great director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my God, what a mess! There is no narrative flow; indeed anything resembling typical plot devices to keep the story going has approximately the same role in this as dialog has in porno movies...just marking time until the next payoff (in this case, violence, not sex). The women in this movie are invariably employed in one of three ways. They either 1: Expose their breasts; 2: Scream in terror; or 3: Scream in terror with their breasts exposed. Poor Bob Dylan, who from the looks of him was going through a very bad time in his life, has a few scenes looking very uncomfortable atop a horse, for no apparent reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The decline of the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In his violent 1969 western epic THE WILD BUNCH, director Sam Peckinpah looked at the decline of the Old West through the eyes of outlaws living out their last days in 1913, as World War I loomed on the horizon. But PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID takes an even more cynical view, saying that the decline of the Old West began even sooner than that.Peckinpah's final western movie, shot on location in miserable conditions in Durango, Mexico in late 1972/early 1973, looks at the legend of Pat Garrett and William Bonney (a.k.a. Billy The Kid) as a Greek tragedy of sorts. James Coburn is superb as Garrett, the former outlaw who has been hired on by the so-called "Santa Fe ring" of business tycoons as sheriff to track down his old friend Billy (Kris Kristofferson, also quite good). Coburn takes no pleasure out of having to do this, or killing former friends who have now become enemies. As he tells Billy, "It feels like times have changed" (and not for the better). Kristofferson, however, retains the same attitude he's always had--"Times maybe. Not me." The result is a cynical, dust-choked odyssey across New Mexico between the two former friends, one reluctantly running and the other one very reluctantly pursuing, resulting in the killing of Billy at Fort Sumner that, twenty-eight years later, will also seal Garrett's doom.Though originally mangled to pieces by the MGM studio brass back in 1973, in its Restored Directors Cut, PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID can now be seen as one of the greatest westerns of all times. Surrounding Coburn and Kristofferson are such luminaries as Jason Robards, Barry Sullivan, Matt Clark, Luke Askew, Jack Elam, Harry Dean Stanton, Katy Jurado, and Richard Jaeckel. And even with all the troubles he had making this film, Peckinpah wisely included his cast of Usual Suspects: Emilio Fernandez, Slim Pickens, R.G. Armstrong, L.Q. Jones, John Davis Chandler, Dub Taylor, and Jorge Russek. Bob Dylan, who did the acoustic folk/country score, has a role as the cynical drifter Alias, who sides with Billy but knows all too well what Billy's fate will be.Bleak, cynical, and tragic, and with Peckinpah's traditional slow-motion violence and montage (though not on the extreme level of THE WILD BUNCH), PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID is one of the most memorable films of his career, one that was all too short and, sadly enough, made so by his own excesses.NOTE: The 2005 Special Edition, paired on DVD with the so-called "Restored Director's Cut", while it is five minutes shorter, does contain a crucial scene (left out in the other version) between Garrett and his Mexican-born wife (played by Aurora Clavel) that shows how Garrett is progressively alienating himself from the general populace by aligning himself with the business interests in Santa Fe. The basic structure and spirit of the film, however, are all wisely maintained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very interesting western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film twice with a 20 year gap in between. Seeing the movie a second time, you begin to wonder not about the main characters but about the tertiary ones. For instance, where is Mrs Garrett? Pat Garrett tells someone to inform her that he is coming home. Is this one of the characters chopped off by the studios?The Katy Jurado character of a rifle shooting sheriff's wife seems only half developed, though the actress gets important billing in the credits.The Harry Dean Stanton role is again a short but interesting one getting out of bed to provide room for Billy's sexual needs.The Alias character played by Bob Dylan is mysterious. He watches and is smart and reflects the young generation. Why does Billy ask him to read the list on the wall? What was Pekinpah doing with these characters? He was not a fool--he wanted to develop the characters that were probably chopped off.Would Pekinpah have chosen another actress to play Billy's love interest if Rita Coolidge was not married to Kristofferson at the time the film was made? The kids in the film provide the antidote to the lethal violence--in their angelic responses, visual and aural.I commend the work of Canadian Roger Spottiswoode (editor turned director) in trying to put the film together the way Pekinpah would have preferred it. The version I saw recently has additional scenes but not the one with the death of the Katy Jurado character, which apparently Spottiswoode restored. Now the film's major achievements are photography, screenplay (the growing moustache of Garrett is an example of detail), and somewhat brilliant direction. Evidently cinematographer John Coquillon liked to work for Pekinpah (Straw Dogs). Coquillon's work is superb here but strangely his later works do not show the same spirit behind the camera. Could he only deliver with Pekinpah and not with others?I found this film a fine work, philosophical and aethetically satisfying. From what has been seen, I suspect Pekinpah had a better film in mind that never left the studios. Coburn and Kristofferson did justice to their roles, developing them as an actor could. The film in my view is one of the most interesting westerns I have seen giving importance to the legion of subsidiary characters. I only wish they were fleshed out even more. This film is not mindless--it makes you think. Now that's entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with some lives, there's the sacrifice of waste for value.This is a failure of a movie. It is incoherent, especially in the sense it was originally intended to deliver: as a member of the friend turned hunter genre. It has KristofFerson more inappropriately cast than usual. Its designated watcher Bob Dylan, was ineffective. It lacks any of the binding features of a long form work.This is a success of a movie. It is broken in just the same way its characters are. Their lives make no sense other than as a container for confidence. This is am aimlessly wandering film about aimlessly wandering souls and the minor folks the collect in different ways. It sags in places because you can see that there is no purpose. But it has moments of such pure brilliance that you have to wonder about the miracle of Zen acceptance. The photography, any scene with Coburn and the score are in such harmony they seem to have been created together all the way from the edge of time.The really vexing thing is Dylan. This was during one of his creative valleys, and probably his worst period. The music is meditative but hardly sharp. Its aimless and pastel. He looks dull. Supposedly this was during a heroin addiction and his association with great musicians that were lost (like George Harrison). He by himself in his better days could have snapped this film into importance merely by actually watching, by being in it truly. He's not there.Some of the episodes you will never forget. I count three small masterpieces. One lasts less than 60 seconds and involves a family floating down a small river. Coburn and the apparently mad father point rifles at each other and then in apparent recognition of the other's meanness, put them down, while children expectantly cower.A second is the much mentioned sequence where a sheriff has been enlisted against his will. His tough wife accompanies, an angry killing machine. But he is mortally wounded and as he stumbles to the river to gently die, she follows in an astonished grief. Dylan sings Knocking on Heavens's Door ? apparently removed from one cut. Its a whole life together shown.The third is muffed before its over. Billy and his woman in that town are making love right before his demise. Pat sits outside listening, passion drained from his life. You should be able to see that this is why he wants to kill Billy ? but you cannot because of how it is cut. But before that you see Billy and Maria make love and it is clear that though both are poor actors, they really are deeply in love. Its deep, knowing we are watching too, watching because we seek passion.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A zapata western fantasy based on how Pat Garrett hunted his old compadre William Bonnie down. James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson are great, and the movie is a sumptuous vision of the wild west. There's a problem with the structure, though: as Garrett follows Billy the Kid down to Mexico, they run into new character after new character, and like as not shoot one or all of them. Before long, you lose track of who's who among the cameos by old-school Western standbys like Slim Pickens, Chill Wills and Jack Elam. The atmosphere keeps you watching though.The superfluous character problem is epitomised by Bob Dylan's 'Alias', a knife-throwing geek who works at the barber's. There is absolutely no point to the character; he doesn't do much, he doesn't want anything, and every time he appears on the screen you know it isn't going to lead anywhere - which may have been the point, but that's for a different movie. Maybe Bob's acting might have been better with more character motivation - as it is, he coquettishly flutters his eyelashes at Billy the Kid in a way that suggests plot developments more appropriate to Brokeback Mountain.The music consists of Bob's Nashville sound, which I like, but I'm not sure it works when it just comes out of nowhere in the quiet bits of the movie. 'Alias' might have worked better as a travelling troubador, but I suppose that was considered too obvious.Somewhere in PGABTK there's a great modern western struggling to survive but Peckinpah didn't keep it simple enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After waiting for years for this movie to come out on DVD, I was thrilled when this and three other Peckipah westerns were recently released on DVD. I had seen this movie many times over the years, but recently watched a new version of the movie on the disc that was supposedly edited based upon Peckinpah's original (or final?) notes on the film. I saw this difference immediately and knew that I was in for a fresh ride. This is really a great movie (even with a couple scenes that still feel weird to me) that, like THE WILD BUNCH, really captures a changing time in American history (the end of the Old West) through the eyes of men who have a difficult time changing. The acting is terrific -- especially Coburn -- and features many great little (but memorable) character performances. And Bob Dylan's music really works here (which helps me to overlook his funky jittery performance.) This isn't a fun movie, and it's not on a par with THE WILD BUNCH, but it is an important one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's elegiac western "Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the kid" tells the familiar story of sheriff Pat Garrett (a great performance by James Coburn), forced to track down and kill his friend the outlaw Billy the kid (Kris Kristofferson).As many westerns before, "Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the kid" deals with the end of the West, replaced by a more civilized order. In earlier movies, such as John Ford's "My darling Clementine", civilization would be virtuous pioneers, embodying American values and the American way of life. In 1973, after the Vietnam war, Peckinpah's vision is much more cynic: civilization is the Sante Fe ring, a corrupt cartel of politicians and business men, just as rough less and violent than the outlaws they're trying to get rid of.Faced with this changing world, Garrett and Billy, two figures of the old west, follow different paths. Despite the fact that he despises them and that his sympathy clearly lies with Billy, Garrett joins the Sante Fe ring. Peckinpah makes clear that this puts Garrett on the wrong side of morality, no where stronger than in one of the final scenes, where, after Billy's death, Garrett rides into the sunset, a child following him. The scene echoes the final from "Shane" except that, instead of pleading for the rider's return, the child throws rocks at him. Garrett's choice is also killing him deep down inside: in a scene, after killing Billy, Garrett shoots at his own reflection in the mirror, shattering it to pieces. An awkward scene with his wife shows how unnatural and unfit domestic life is for him.Yet Peckinpah also makes it clear that Garrett made the only viable choice by depicting Billy and his gang as a dying breed, almost like a moribund patient in the last stage of a debilitating decease: lacking motivation and energy, they're always on the fringe of doing something but ultimately just stay there, hanging round, getting drunk, sleeping with women or shooting at chicken. They seem strangely disconnected from reality, playing poker in the middle of a gunfight, not because they're reckless but because they don't seem to compute clearly what's going on around them. In Peckipah's vision, the old west disappears not because it is replaced by civilization but because it is dying its own slow and painful death. In this view, Garrett shooting Billy is almost a mercy killing! (Billy's bunch looks so much like a proto-hippy community with most members of his gang played by rock musicians including Bob Dylan himself that it almost feels like a critic of the counter-culture movement that, by 1973, was just a caricature of the idealism of the sixties). There is no future in this way of life.This refusal to portray Billy as a traditional hero corresponds to the unromantic version of the West shown in the movie. This is not the West of John Ford or Sergio Leone or of "The wild bunch", with its heroes larger than life. This is a dreadful place, dirty, empty, the desolation of the landscape echoing the boredom and the existential void of the life of the characters. No Sergio Leone-like heroic showdown here: people are shot in the back, before they have any chance to reach for their gun. The pace of the movie fits this theme: it is slow, almost contemplative, Bob Dylan's soulful acoustic soundtrack (including the famous song "Knockin' on heaven's door" played during one of the most beautiful and poetic scene in the whole movie) reinforcing the sweet melancholy that runs through the all picture.A final theme of "Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the kid" is the one of fate. The characters believe they are free and in charge of their destiny. During the whole movie, Garrett slowly circles around Billy, hoping to the last moment that he won't have to kill him, that Billy will understand and flee to Mexico. But this is just an illusion: everything is predetermined and nobody can escape his fate. This is illustrated most beautifully in the prologue which cuts back and forth between Garrett's assassination by the Sante Fe ring killers and his last friendly encounter with Billy. Garrett's death, set many years after Billy's killing, clearly establishes that the dice have been cast and nothing can be changed: Garrett killed Billy and no matter what he will do in the movie, this cannot be changed. Emphasizing this, a beautiful scene shows Billy in the flashback sequence shooting at a target with Garrett in the flash-forward segment on the receiving end. Fate is also at the core of the most celebrated raft scene. While resting on the bank of a river, Garrett spies a raft with a whole family on it, drifting along the river without any control over where they're going, the father shooting at bottles thrown in the river. This puts them on a collision course with Garrett and the outcome should be the father being killed by the sheriff. This seems to be exactly what will happen as the two men aimed at each other but they finally lower their guns. For just an moment there, they were able to avoid fate and to escape their fatal destiny.Butchered by MGM at the time of its release, the movie exists in at least 3 forms and we will never have Peckinpah's definitive version of "Pat Garret &amp; Billy the kid". Yet maybe it does not matter. Even in this unfinished form, "Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the kid" is a unique movie, an absolute masterpiece, Sam Peckinpah's greatest achievement, second only to "The wild bunch"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good solid Western but available in several different versions.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid starts in New Mexico 1881 where Sheriff Pat Garrett (James Coburn) catches up with his old outlaw buddy William H. Bonney AKA Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson), since they were friends Pat ask's Billy to leave but in 5 days he'll make him. Billy isn't keen on the idea &amp; eventually Pat arrests him, however Billy escapes the hang man's noose &amp; goes on the run hitching up with his old gang. Pat is assigned the task to take him down which is just what he intends to do...Directed by Sam Peckinpah this is a solid telling of the infamous story about two men who once were friends but ended up enemies, the first thing to say is that Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid is available in several versions &amp; I will be basing my comments on the longer 122 minute restored version from 1988. The script by Rudolph Wurlitzer is pretty good but so many things can happen between finishing a script &amp; it actually appearing in theatres &amp; Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid is a very good example of that with the multiple cuts, who knows which one is closest to his original script? The two central character's make this film what it is, Pat Garrett &amp; Bill the Kid who live in changing times &amp; while Pat accepts it &amp; becomes a Sheriff Billy won't let go of the past where you could shoot a man &amp; claim it was self defence. They are only on screen together for a few minutes &amp; the rest of the time the film follows them as they travel from place to place, I must admit it became a little boring after like a solid 100 odd minutes of it but there was something here that I liked. I thought it was well written although some of the dialogue is hard to make out &amp; understand, it tells a good story &amp; there are some memorable scenes here. The ending is one of the quietest &amp; low key your likely to see &amp; I didn't like the framing of the story where Garrett is shot dead as I thought it was a bit of a downer (having said that I think the 122 minute version is the only cut where this happens).Director Peckinpah does a good job although it's well known that he was drinking heavily when he made this &amp; that the studio interfered with the final cut, there's plenty of stylish scenes here &amp; it's very nice to look at. Animal lovers beware as several chickens have their heads shot off at the start, there's a forward horse fall &amp; a slow motion cock fight as many people seem to get upset whenever an animal is killed. There's not much violence here except for a few shoot-outs, there are some naked female breasts on show too if that sort of thing interests you.According to the IMDb this had an estimated budget of $4,638,783 which sounds a very specific number to be an 'estimate' to me. This is well made with high production values, nice widescreen cinematography, an unusual soundtrack &amp; good period design. The acting is very good with James Coburn standing out for me.Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid in it's 122 minutes version is a good solid entertaining Western but maybe a little slow going at times &amp; I wasn't keen on the ending either. A good film for sure but one you need to be patient with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>By the 1970s, the Hollywood Western had worn itself out with every legitimate twist it could come up with, and by now was reduced to a series of gimmick pictures ? musicals, comedies and assorted oddities ? most of which, while never outstanding, were frankly rather fun. However all attempts at straight Westerns round this period tend towards the tired, verging on pathetic.The Billy the Kid story has been recycled many times for the screen, usually in some kind of allegory for the young generation of whatever age we happen to be living in at the time. This 1973 version is a Billy the Kid for the anti-war, hippy era, a movement that was itself already beginning to loose steam and become a pitiful self-parody. And this picture acknowledges that, making the Kid's story parallel the crushing of youthful idealism by the forces of state, capital, indifference and individualism. And writer Rudy Wurlitzer took the elegiac Western, itself an established subgenre of the previous fifteen years, as a suitable format for this gloomy vision.The allegory is significantly reinforced by the casting of Kris Kristofferson and Bob Dylan, two icons of late-60s rebellion, as the Kid and his fictional sidekick Alias. Such meaningful casting can have a powerful ring to it, but actors need to be befitting to their roles as well. Kristofferson is a pretty good actor, and certainly has the necessary charisma, but at 36 is really too old for the part, and even regardless of his age his looks are not exactly boyish. And Bob Dylan is passable, displaying a kind of cheekiness about him, but in no way does he look like a man of the West, and the fact that "Alias" never existed in real life makes him stick out as a for-the-sake-it add-on. Thank goodness we have James Coburn, who plays Garrett with a suitable air of melancholy.Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is generally referenced in the context of its being one of Sam Peckinpah's directorial efforts, and his contribution is worth a word or two. Peckinpah is known for his snappy editing patterns and chaotic violence, but even in his most mindless scenes of carnage, pacing was always the key. In tune with the tone of this picture, the shots are still not held for long, but camera movements are ponderous, and movement within the frame is sluggish. And this is perhaps what is best about Peckinpah's direction this time round, the way he encourages performances that fit in with the general scheme, and in this case with minor but crucial subversions. The manly gait of the cowboy is here a weary plod. The measured delivery of lines that John Wayne and Clint Eastwood made an art of is now an apathetic mumble.So clearly efforts have been made to bring stylisation into line with story. But where is the story? Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is a jumble of subplots united in theme but in desperate need of some structure. Numerous bit-players pop up without introduction, and more often than not are promptly killed. Dylan's Knockin' on Heaven's Door plays over one of the most poignantly staged and acted scenes in all Peckinpah's career, and yet the emotional pull fails because we are witnessing the death of a character who only walked on to the screen three minutes earlier. Perhaps this pattern of people appearing, then dying a moment later is deliberate and in some way symbolic. Perhaps it was an excuse to pack in lots of cameos. Or perhaps the whole thing was simply a botch job from script to editing suite. Whatever the case, this picture's lethargic sadness, no matter how carefully planned, is simply boring to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kristofferson wrong for Billy the Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1909 New Mexico, Pat Garrett (James Coburn) is shot many times. In 1881, he's riding into Old Fort Sumner to meet his friend Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson). He's taking over as Sheriff of Lincoln County. In five days, he has to follow orders to take on his friend. He and his men follow thru and take Billy the Kid prisoner in a gun fight.Director Sam Peckinpah had difficulties with the studio and the initial cut was received poorly. It's eventually recut into a two hour movie. Kris Kristofferson feels wrong for Billy the Kid. He doesn't have the outlaw murderer feel and he's way too old to play twenty one. It's all wrong. Bob Dylan brings some good music but he sticks out as an actor. I keep thinking that it's Dylan and nothing else. The story is a bit slow and meandering with short bursts of bloody, outrageous violence. I wonder if the Peckinpah name is affecting people's ratings. I don't see this as terrible but it has several problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very odd western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of westerns, but at the same time I am open to a western that tries to do things with another angle. But I must say that "Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid" often left me feeling somewhat bewildered. If you don't know a lot (or even just a little) of the history of the two real life figures, it's likely that you'll feel somewhat lost; the movie doesn't really explore the history or personalities of these two figures. Part of the reason for that is that the movie is mostly directed in an extremely laid back style, which makes the movie feel very slow and lacking in grit. Indeed, the movie has a lot of scenes and elements that don't seem to have much point, such as Bob Dylan's character. But it could be argued that many of these seemingly pointless scenes are, at least individually, are kooky and offbeat enough to be interesting. The movie may be slow, long, and seemingly without point, but I was never bored. While I can't give the movie a general recommendation - it's definitely not for the typical moviegoer - I do think that fans of westerns who are in the mood for something significantly different than usual will probably enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I believe they elected you and paid you good wages for killin' the kid, huh?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only became aware of this film recently from a documentary on Sam Peckinpah's career, and managed to call it up rather quickly via my local library's request system. I'm left with mixed feelings, mostly due to the slow pacing of the story and Kris Kristofferson's casting as The Kid. "Young Guns" gets panned by a lot of folks, but Emilio Estevez's characterization captures a lot more effectively my personal vision of the Wild West's most famous outlaw. James Coburn seems to be adequately cast as Sheriff Pat Garrett, and his quest to bring in Billy seems appropriately conflicted, but in the end he did gun him down. So much for past friendships.You have to say one thing, the supporting cast is a veritable who's who of great Western character actors. There aren't many places you'll find Chill Wills, Slim Pickens, R.G. Armstrong, Katy Jurado and Jack Elam all in one place, and just as you're done taking them all in, you've got some quick but effective cameos by the likes of Dub Taylor and Elisha Cook Jr. And oddly, it actually looks like Bob Dylan belongs in this picture. It would have been cool if Barry Sullivan was given a line that recalled his own portrayal of the Lincoln County lawman from the early '60's TV series "The Tall Man", but his "Glad to be of service Garrett, but don't overuse it" was effective enough.The Slim Pickens river scene seems to be the one most fans find memorable, and I have to admit I got a slight chill when Dylan's "Knockin' On Heaven's Door" faded in and out along with the lawman. I thought the scene was setting us up for the sung version when Billy met his end, I think that would have been a most effective touch.Not nearly as famous as Peckinpah's master work "The Wild Bunch", I can see how the movie will find it's devotees who prefer this picture. The director's trademark touch of violence is ever present, even if some of the graphic bloodletting seems more for effect than realism. Still, Peckinpah was one of the first directors to take the glamor out of Western gun battles and show them for their down and dirty grittiness.Best line of the film, and it's still ringing in my ears as I write this - Deputy Bob Ollinger (R.G. Armstrong) to Billy after he roughs him up while under arrest - "I'll take you for a walk across hell on a spider web". I just love the imagery.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpahs final Western is a jumbled but visually striking experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While not in the same vein as "The Wild Bunch", Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is an ambitious film considering the subject matter. Scripted by Rudolph Wurlitzer of " Two-Lane Black Top" fame, this film contains the same low key mood. The performances are good with a "whose who" list of fine character actors although Kris Kristofferson is a bit one note as Billy. Peckinpah's violence in the film though lack the balletic quality of The Wild Bunch or some of his other films. The movie is more of a character study about the relationship between the two lead characters than a straight forward action/Western narrative much like the Wild Bunch. The cinematography is gorgeous and sun drenched with a good score by Bob Dylan although I think it seemed out of place here. Peckinpah apparently didn't like it and wanted instead a traditional score by his regular composer Jerry Fielding but MGM disagreed and Peckinpah lost one in a series of battles over the film in the course of it's making. My main criticism with the film though was the lack of contrast between the two characters. They are never fleshed out enough and the film just rambles on rather inconclusively. Unlike the Wild Bunch where you understood the depth of the relationship between Pike Bishop and Deke Thornton and why it changed as a result.Overall an interesting if uneven film in the canon of an uneven but sometimes brilliant filmmaker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamlike 70s western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This western has much to admire - cinematography with a dusty autumnal sheen, Dylan soundtrack, some fine performances from regular western actors, most especially James Coburn's as Pat Garrett. It has two typical Peckinpah characteristics - a pervasive air of death and decay throughout and the detached observation by children of scenes of extreme violence, though they do not take part in them. This second characteristic leads one to imagine that the future is likely to be as violent as the present.Interesting western then and one that gives a unique viewpoint rather than retreading someone else's work as lesser westerns often do. However there are some problems with this film that prevent it from being a classic. Historic liberties are taken, no problem, but having Billy the Kid (who died aged 22) played by a 36 year old Kristofferson must be dubious to those who know anything about the history. The part was played as a mature, experienced villain rather charismatic and heroic instead of an immature young thug. Bob Dylan was a great singer and pivotal to the times, to be sure, but his acting talents as Alias were unfortunately not in the same league. The main difficulty I found with this is that it's so clearly of its time of making. I cannot in any way imagine this as the reality of life in 1880s New Mexico when all the actors have early 1970s hairstyles and Maria (Billy's squeeze) is played like a hippy chick by Rita Coolidge with the appropriate sexual mores to that era. This, together with the faded effect cinematography gives a distancing to the viewer's perspective and leaves the impression of an interesting dream rather than a true to life western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The divergent paths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the OK Corral gunfight and the saga of Jesse James, Pat Garrett &amp; Billy The Kid has entered our national mythology and every generation is compelled to have it retold. James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson play the title roles in this epic western from Sam Peckinpah who curiously enough did not turn this into one of his violence ballets like The Wild Bunch.No new facts are uncovered,no new ground is broken here. Former saddlemates Coburn and Kristofferson have parted. In the recent Lincoln County War they were together in the employ of John Chisum played here by Barry Sullivan fighting the Santa Fe Ring. That war is over, for cinematic reference see Chisum and the first Young Guns movie. But Billy won't leave his outlaw ways.Just like soldiers in a war and remember this was the Lincoln County War as the state saw it and the locals called it, when peace breaks out soldiers who've learned violent ways as mercenaries now have those skills and little else. So one either goes into law enforcement or outlawry.Which are the divergent paths that these former friends have taken. Coburn has now the duty to bring in his former saddle pal however, a mandate that comes from Lew Wallace the Territorial Governor of New Mexico and author of Ben-Hur played here by Jason Robards, Jr. It doesn't look good for Kristofferson as a lot of hands are raised against him now.One of my favorite lines from film comes from a John Wayne western Tall In The Saddle where Gabby Hayes says he's all for law and order 'depending on who's dishing it out'. I think there is so much truth to that. In fact it could be Billy The Kid's creed in this film.Sam Peckinpah did a wonderful job in telling this tale once again for the big screen. Also nice to see such stalwart western faces as Chill Wills and Jack Elam. And R.G. Armstrong is wonderful as the self righteous deputy sheriff who Kristofferson blasts into the next world.For western fans an absolute must.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just a scene: Knocking on Heaven Doors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never liked "Pat Garret and Billy the Kid" very much. In fact, there are few 1970s Westerns that I like. I still find ironic that, in the decade of the feminist movement, the heroine's role became expendable, reduced to a sexual object to be used and discarded by the hero (i.e. Pat Garrett in the bathtub with the prostitutes). This said, "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" contains one of the most beautiful love scenes ever made. And yes, I am conscious that this is a Sam Peckinpah film. Yet he has always been capable of tenderness (the flash-forward in "The Getaway", with McGraw and MacQueen jumping into a river, immediately comes to mind).Veterans Katy Jurado and Slim Pickens play a husband-and wife team of guns for hire, brought out of retirement for a last job. Katy Jurado had been a beauty in her earlier films (see her in "High Noon"). Here, her looks had faded, but she retained her serene demeanour. Slim Pickens had never been handsome. He usually played a crook with a mischievous smile, here substituted for a venerable old man expression. While Garret (James Coburn) deals with the last villain standing, Katy realises Slim has been shot. She runs to the river where he agonises, his stomach pierced by a bullet. She kneels opposite him, looking at him with the saddest eyes in the world, trying to absorb every second they have left. He looks back, as if saying sorry for dying. There is no dialogue. They have gone through so much together that words are unnecessary. Then, the sun sets in the background, while "Knockin' on heaven doors" plays. This is not only the death of a character. This is the death of the classic western. Jurado and Pickens had been stock figures of the genre in countless productions during the 1950s. By the late sixties, the formula had worn out. Pure heroes and heroines had no place in the cynical Vietnam era, which advocated shades of grey. Heroes (like Pat Garret) could be morally reprehensible, while it was possible to feel for the villains (like Billy the Kid). Like Jurado and Pickens, the classic western was not youthful or pretty any more, but certainly died with lots of dignity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of an era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's take on the pivotal conflict, which had the infamous Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson) and Pat Garrett (James Coburn) on opposing sides of the law. One an almost Robin Hood-like cowboy, whilst the other a former friend and outlaw turned sheriff. The story ends like it must end, but the relation between the characters build this classic Sam Peckinpah western.The movie is an end of an era in many ways. On the one hand it is almost like a swansong towards the era of westerns and one of the last few old-style classics. On the other it deals with a time, where the lawlessness is coming to pass and a new order is being put in place, where the cowboys of old are no longer welcome (Peckinpah's recurrent theme concerning the death of the west). In this new world Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid are a quickly dying breed with this movie one of their finest eulogies.In parts the movie is brilliant - consisting of multiple layers all complemented by a beautiful score prepped by the legendary Bob Dylan (who has a minor role in the movie as well). The nonexistent duality of good and evil gives the western an additional punch, where the grey areas of the wild west come to the forefront. In some of the strongest scenes (almost entirely focused on death) the story diverges from traditional story-paths and delves into situations, which tear the heart and cause a rethink similar to that of "Unforgiven". In the best scene of the movie Alamosa Bill, a former outlaw deputised by Pat Garrett, and Billy the Kid stumble upon each other. Both sides are unwilling to fulfil what they see are their duty, but are unable to offer solutions that would not end in bloodshed. Absolutely marvellous.The acting and dialogue is always top-notch, even though very dense and at times hard to follow. Nonetheless the way and manner of talking packed a wallop of realism, but at the same time was brisk and brilliantly thought-out. I do however have an issue with parts of the movie, which seem rather pointless and cause the movie to drag on for far too long. There seem to be too many random events that don't add anything to the movie - sequences of small significance, which may be interesting at times, but slow down the narrative to a snail's pace.Nonetheless a beautiful and haunting movie, even if not as powerful and touching as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece still waiting to be edited correctly.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film again, and watched the 88 version this time. Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid is a brave film. It is a western about people who don't want to fight! Pat tries for the longest time to not face Billy, hoping that he runs away to Mexico. This means that there is really not much of an action, except in the beginning and the end. So, how does one fill up the middle part? Sam does it by making a film, not so much about Pat and Billy but more about the dying wild west (a theme you will find in almost all of his films). There is a melancholy which runs through the whole film. Like we are at a funeral of an era and no one really knows what's coming. The mood reminds me of Days of Heaven (Terrence Malick). This is an Autumn film, a twilight film, an evening film or what ever you would want to call it. A film about knowing that the end is drawing near and not wanting to face it. I'm a huge Bob Dylan fan but I don't think he was good in this film and I really don't see why he had to be in it. His character makes little sense. The music is good, though I wish the 88 version had the lyrics to Knockin on Heaven's Door.The trouble with the film is the editing. What Sam was trying here is so delicate, so fragile that it has to be perfectly edited to really fly. Just think Mirror by Tarkovsky. There is really no other way to edit that film. Tarkovsky tried 30 ways (if I remember correctly) before he discovered the right one. He later said that the film would have been a disaster with out that cut. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid has the same poetic heart and it needs the same poetic touch to really make it work. I wish Terrence Malick was hired to cut the film anew. I can't think of a better person to find the film Sam wanted to make. SPOILERS (I guess). I like that Sam does not make too much out of the killing of either Pat or Billy. The film is not really about that, it is about a long funeral that precedes it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but brilliant exercise in pure Romanticism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mad Sam Peckinpah's "Pat Garrett" is quite unlike any Western that I have ever seen. Unlike the violent and cynical treatment he gave the genre with "The Wild Bunch" and the brutal brilliance of "Straw Dogs", my two previous encounters with his work, PG+BK is a much more laconic, relaxed, and in some ways sentimental, look at many of the same themes (specifically the death of the old west).There is very little plot to speak of, we know that erstwhile friends Pat and Billy are heading for conflict and are shown in a series of almost disjointed scenes, Billy's various crimes and Garrett's reluctant role as lawman building up to this conflict. Overall though, the feeling isn't so much one of a coherent whole but of a series of captured instances, like a series of engravings or landscape paintings, depicting a particular moment in time that is now lost forever.The film is quite stunningly beautiful to look at, brilliantly shot and framed, using light and colour like a Turner painting, all red blood and golden sunsets against bleached sands. This isn't a film you are intensely gripped by, you sit back and absorb it, like a painting or a piece of music. It is in a way, a true work of art, where everything is implicit and the key to enjoyment isn't harsh scrutiny, but just letting it wash over you.The performances, while the casting may be unconventional, are excellent. James Coburn is reliably grizzled as the world weary Garrett, but it is Kris Kristofferson as Billy the Kid who is most impressive. Much criticism has been given to the casting of an older actor as the young outlaw, but this is actually beneficial to the film as instead of merely being presented with the reality, a sociopathic young punk who shot all is victims in the back (though there is some of that in the film's portrayal), we also see elements of the legend, with Kristofferson imbuing the character with a kind of battered charisma, of wounded heroism, a pathos which underlies much of his bravado.Bob Dylan, also much attacked at the time of release, is also absolutely fine as the mysterious Alias, and effectively acts as a Greek chorus, his beautiful, lyrical folk soundtrack adding meaning to the sumptuous cinematography. To describe the film as being like a visual Dylan album is entirely justified, the scenes and the music perfectly complimenting each other throughout.The film isn't without it's flaws, as a piece of narrative cinema it doesn't work and it is often an incoherent and disjointed film, but it's shot through with brilliant moments, scenes of tenderness, scenes of pathos, scenes of brutality, and as a purely aesthetic work it is a triumph comparable with the works of Kubrick or Mallick, or, in the Western genre, John Ford. Peckinpah presents an altogether different meditation on the death of the old west to The Wild Bunch, less dark requiem as heartfelt eulogy, an exercise in pure Romanticism, revelling in the quiet and serene beauty of the Western landscape and the simple truths of the natural aesthetic.Breathtakingly beautiful, a flawed but brilliant and completely unique contribution to the genre.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ol' Pat... Sheriff Pat Garrett. Sold out to the Santa Fe ring. How does it feel?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is directed by Sam Peckinpah and written by Rudy Wurlitzer. It stars James Coburn, Kris Kristofferson, Bob Dylan, Slim Pickens, Katy Jurado, Chill Wills and Barry Sullivan. Music is scored by Bob Dylan and cinematography by John Coquillon.One time they were friends, cohorts in crime, but now Pat Garrett is the law and his objective is to bring down Billy the Kid.It seems to be an absolute when writing about a Sam Peckinpah film that it was plagued by studio interference. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is no exception, the back story to which tells of behind the scenes clashes, bizarre cuts and a disownment of the film by cast and crew. Thankfully through the advent of time and technological advancements, it's one of the Peckinpah movies that can now be seen in a true light. A good job, too, since it's one of Bloody Sam's finest movies. My personal preference is for the TCM Preview version, and that is what is reviewed here.Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid finds Peckinpah at his lyrical and elegiacal best, the old west is dying and as it is told through the eyes of aging Pat Garrett (Coburn), it's meticulously played out via an unhurried narrative structure. Time is afforded the key players, helping the story unfold its bitter take on the frontier changes as greed begets violence, Peckinpah wryly observing that the newly appeared good guys are no better than the bad guys, hence The Kid's (Kristofferson) reputation as a dandy likable outlaw becomes assured in spite of his less than honourable traits as a human being, but he at least is honourable to his codes.Film contains many memorable scenes, scenes fit to grace any Western. A shoot-out and aftermath involving Pickens and Jurado has poignancy in abundance, Dylan's Knockin' On Heaven's Door tenderly filtered over the top of it. A duel featuring Jack Elam is another that resonates highly, great character moments are plentiful, performed by a roll call of Western movie legends, Peckinpah knew how to pick a cast and then some. Moments of violence are dotted throughout, Bloody Sam's trademark, as is cross-cuts, sepia tones and slow-mo. The great director even makes a Christ allegory not come off as cheap, and a self loathing mirror sequence strikes a significant chord.This is a film big on characterisations, it's not just a film of visual touches, be it the dual psychological conflict between Pat and Billy, or the ream of peripheral players, everything they do is detailed and designed to capture the period and atmosphere of the changing times, the environment that folk inhabit, on either side of the law, is a big issue. No frame is wasted, MGM and their head honcho James Aubrey in their ignorance failed to see this fact. While the cast turn in damn fine work and Coquillon's burnished photography is striking and perfect for the director's vision.It's undeniably downbeat, and the slow pace isn't to everyone's liking, but this is up with the other Peckinpah Western greats, The Wild Bunch and Ride the High Country. A truly great Western crafted by a truly great director. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Our National Myths Were Being Buried...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the writer and director of countless TV and film westerns, including 1969's iconic eulogy to the genre, The Wild Bunch, few people were better qualified than Sam Peckinpah to deliver the sublime irony of Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid. His signature use of extreme violence, ordinarily a grim and garish spectacle, now raised his creation to the level of art. If you are a fan of gritty macho carnage, there's plenty here to keep you hootin' and hollerin'. If your tastes venture more to the philosophical and the introspective, then there's substantial grist for your cerebral mill. Pervading and underscoring all the gruesome action is a sly skeptical vibe. A substantial clue to Peckinpah's subversive intent is the casting of Bob Dylan in a curiously haunting supporting role, that of a near mute collaborator to the outlaw Billy the Kid. Dylan had by then a well earned reputation as the National Court Jester; his wry, cryptic declarations perhaps our country's most potent expressions of deep cynicism. Dylan was the personification of the complex contradictions that then defined our society. So many of his songs - Masters of War, or Ballad Of A Thin Man, or Blowin' In The Wind, or Chimes Of Freedom, or It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding), and many others - had so well delineated the limits of our national character. He possessed a singular genius for crafting searing tirades delivered via irresistible rhythms. This seemingly impossible union of such opposed impulses - a melding of the Sacred and the Profane - is paradoxically inverted in this film. Where Dylan's ferocious and grim message is carried within alluring infectious melodies, Peckinpah has concealed his tender, melancholic spirit beneath a crust of fierce, intimidating violence. This film, at heart, is a quiet meditation on the failings of our young republic, but wrapped in a macabre cloak of mayhem.Throughout the 1960s so many of our mighty National Myths were evaporating in the intense light of a new found higher consciousness, and many people were eager to replace them with potent alternatives. Materialism was being doubted as a wholesome path, so Mysticism, as embodied in Eastern thought, was gaining popularity, with the more obvious source points being Budhism and Zen philosophy. The irony of this substitution of Western with Eastern modes was well appreciated by our more astute thinkers. This spiritual dilemma reached something of an absurd high point with the early 70s TV series Kung Fu, the story of a Shoalin Monk on the run from his homeland China, wandering the American West with lessons of peace and harmony, but wielding a fearsome defensive skill set. With David Carradine as the Oriental Master the show achieved an outrageous level of camp, seeming to mock itself just as heartily as it did our domestic fairy tales. However, most Americans very seriously still clung to their quaint convictions. As the Vietnam War continued to wreak havoc on the National Spirit, bifurcating the land into Hawks and Doves, artists found their role as cultural commentator being confounded by conflicted sympathies. This testing of the artist's role in society is a point that's just as salient as are the film's insights into our inherently violent natures. If murder and destruction are genuine human impulses, then of what real value is the creative act? How do we reconcile these opposed forces? How best to live in dangerous times, and then what to do with these more extreme, blatantly lethal survival skills once times soften? How do we adjust ourselves, our society to living in a time of peace? Is it through therapy - the measured exploration of the sources &amp; catalysts of our atavistic urges? This approach appealed to the gentler, more docile among us, but was not a likely choice for any self respecting alpha male. Then, is it through sublimation - the willful redirection of our nihilistic desires into more socially tolerated endeavors? This process is the very definition of Culture. Thus Pat Garrett takes a job as a Lawman, hired to enforce the rich, corrupt cattlemen's law, whereby his mayhem is now legally sanctioned. No, that's not hardly a workable solution. Or perhaps we can find a livable philosophy by merely adjusting our intentions, our goals? Can we, by simply redefining our National Ideals live more balanced, more equitable, more sustainable lives? As the USA entered its third century the need for a new dream was becoming clear. This is the quandary that frames this film.At one point James Coburn's Pat Garrett states "There's an age in a man's life when he don't wanna spend time figurin' what comes next." This perhaps summarizes Peckenpah's maturing sensibility, conceding the country's waning appetite for classic westerns, upon which he had built his career. He thereafter made no other. And the film's ultimate paradox - Sam must have found morbid satisfaction in this - is that The Kid, who is the embodiment of the ever young American Myth, is exterminated by Garrett himself, the aging relic of a bygone age. Sam's next film, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia, though set in western, Mexican, locales is a decidedly contemporary story - a tale of a man with nothing left to lose, drifting in a strange land. That film eerily reflects Peckenpah's lost place in American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I am astounded by the rather low rating that this film has so far received on the Internet Movie Database. Personally, I regard "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" to be not only a great Western, but also a cinematic masterpiece. I do not make this claim lightly. The great accomplishment of the film is that it successfully combines a story of personal struggle between two men with an epic narrative chronicling the sad decline of the Old West. The fall of the West and the loss of the American frontier are central themes in many Westerns of the period, including "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," and Peckinpah's own "The Wild Bunch," but few films treat the subject as gracefully or as poignantly as this one. When watching this film, it is essential to understand that (on one level, at least) it is a eulogy for a lost way of life. Some people may complain that the film is too slow, but its pace perfectly befits its eulogistic tone, which is also complimented by Bob Dylan's superb score.Billy the Kid (played by Kris Kristofferson) is the symbol of the frontier, who cannot or will not adapt to the new society that is gradually taking over. When told that times are changing, he replies: "Times maybe, not me." He is more than a mere symbol, however; he is also a real person. His adversary too, acting on behalf of civilization and modernity, is not a nameless, faceless agent of big government or corporate interests, as in "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" or "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," but is instead an equally complex and developed character (Pat Garrett), brilliantly played by James Coburn. In highlighting the nuanced relationship between the two foes who still understand and respect one another, "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" is a much more personal film than most of its contemporaries. It is true that "The Wild Bunch" provides a similar situation with Robert Ryan's character as the former outlaw who must hunt down his old friends, but even it seems one-sided, and lacks the balance of "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid." Simply put, this is a movie worth watching. Watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid is the most lyrical western ever made, its beauty pours off the screen. Sam Peckinpah shot the film with a great traditional feel that counterpoints the modernist dialogue superbly. Basically the story is the usual Pat Garrett Billy the Kid fare, they used to ride together now Garrett is hunting him after he turned sheriff. The picture focuses on the end of their relationship, and it is great credit to both Coburn and Kristofferson that the dying friendship shines throughout. This film is filled with great scenes punctuated by evocative hardboiled dialogue, to name a few: the bar scene where Garrett kills Holly; Slim Pickens death; the trading of shots between Garrett and the Steamer; the first shoot out between Billy and Pat, Billy's escape from jail etc etc. The dialogue is the best in a western outside of Deadwood or perhaps The Outlaw Josey Wales, too illustrate: Pat Garrett: You owe it to me. Kip McKinney: I do? For *what*? Pat Garrett: For not killing at over at rosewater, for getting' you this job, and not seein' run you outta this territory, for pulling' you outta that snow drift up at Shamus, and for cold cockin' you over at Stillwater Saloon last fall, and savin' you from Rabbit Owens from bitin' off your ear, and from just puttin' up with you for a hell of a lot longer than I oughta... Kip McKinney: Yeah... Well I hope they spell my name right in the paper. Genius.What else makes this film great.James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson give there finest performances as the respective title characters. The supporting actors peppered throughout the film are actors of the highest order, most with a history in Westerns' giving the film a feel of one the first "Death of the West" westerns. Plus any film that has Slim Pickens dying to the strains (or vocals depending on the version) of Knockin on Heavens Door has at least one of the great moments in World Cinema. Moving nicely onto Bob Dylan. The soundtrack without question is possibly the greatest ever composed for a Western (pushed close by Ennio Morricone, obviously and Nick Cave for Proposition), however I reckon that his acting is also of the highest quality. It has a chaplinesque playfulness to it that I found very charming. I disagree with many of the reviewers here and believe that Dylan adds inordinately to the film, with exquisite comedy timing and general lightness of touch which adds a great feel to the film.What can be said about Sam Peckinpah that has not already been said. The man made great films about men.To answer my question is it the best Western ever. Any film with the line as good as "Wont some of you people get him up off the ground and into it?" has got to be up there with the best, if not the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Struggles to make sense: figured it out ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nope. Can't say I have. However, I must have watched it some time ago, because I've discovered some notes I made at the time. Those were rather positive. I've changed my mind after watching it again last night.I then described it as being like a modernist poem; reminiscent of something like The Waste Land. Passages of resonance and power, one after another, with no obvious connection or narrative coherence, yet adding up to a sense of loss and sadness. The re-working of a myth, so remote from the reality of its origins that it is almost completely internalized; and works on some impenetrable psychic level set well apart from everyday experience. Who are these people from 1881? They might as well be Ancient Greeks, enacting their fated roles in accordance with incomprehensible forces, speaking an alien language, performing actions dictated by values that no longer apply in our society. What pretentious garbage !My revised thoughts are these. Why is the film titled Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid ? It could be about two completely different people, with different names. It seems hardly to have anything to do with the historical characters. Kristofferson, as repeatedly pointed out on this site, is no "kid" of any kind. He was actually a scholar of Oxford University, England ! I read that the studio forced Peckinpah to cast him. Coburn is OK, but he could be just any sheriff who has switched sides. Bob Dylan is totally extraneous, and I've never been able to appreciate his caterwauling.Who were all those bums who kept turning up in places I didn't recognize ? Some of them supported the self-styled Billy, others didn't. Hard to know which were which, or why, until they got shot. I'll give it five stars, since I admit it was watchable. Mainly thanks to Coburn. Frankly, though, I almost prefer The Outlaw, with Jane Russell. Two years before PGBK, Rudy Wurlitzer had written a brilliant film, called Two Lane Blacktop; worth seeing any number of times. Was there some connection ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah and Brando: saddling the same horse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" has much in common with "One-Eyed Jacks"; Marlon Brando's take on the Billy the Kid story, which was based on Charles Neider's novel, "The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones". Although Neider's book, ridiculously renamed "Guns Up" in a Pan paperback edition (the one I read), is a fictionalised account, it is an unforgettable masterpiece, invoking a unique sense of nostalgia for the Old West. Peckinpah loved the book and was inspired to write what turned out to be the first screenplay for "One-Eyed Jacks", later made by Marlin Brando who changed just about every element. Although Peckinpah dropped out of that project early, when he finally got a chance to make his version, he moved a long way from Neider's book. In fact, the script moved closer to the historical record. However, although Neider's book is not credited, it's obvious that Peckinpah tried to capture its spirit. The story tells how Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid once rode together, but eventually found themselves on opposites sides of the law. When Billy brutally escapes from jail, in one of the film's best sequences, it sets in motion a ruthless hunt by Pat Garrett, which can only have one ending.Peckinpah actually frames the film with the death of Garrett. This sequence along with others have the trademark Peckinpah slow motion deaths with arching blood spray ? techniques that had already become a little hackneyed even by 1973.However, the central problem was in Peckinpah's casting of Kris Kristofferson. Not so much, as many reviewers have suggested, that at 37 he was too old to play Billy the Kid, but more because he just didn't project the necessary sense of danger; he comes across as too affable, too laid back. Brando in "One Eyed Jacks" gave a stunning performance as a man with a dangerous edge, and although it might seem unfair to compare the two, that lack of threat is a key weakness in Peckinpah's film.Bob Dylan is in the movie and also provides a couple of very nasally songs on the soundtrack; his presence isn't just anachronistic, it's bizarre.On the other hand, James Coburn is just about perfect as Pat Garrett, and the rest of the cast is probably the greatest coming together of iconic stars from western movies ever ? Chill Wills, Slim Pickens, Jack Elam, LQ Jones, Katy Jurado, Gene Evans, Paul Fix and others ? one of the joys of the film is in spotting them.Apparently the film was badly cut by the studio. Despite that, and some strange decisions by Peckinpah himself, the film is nothing less than interesting. But because of all the tampering, like Brando's film, it misses out on greatness. As for Neider's book, it still awaits the right filmmaker to give it the definitive treatment on the screen.</fullReview>

What follows is one of the most beautifully haunting scenes evercreated.I will not put in a spoiler by describing all in detail. Needless to say though,the silent,expression acting of Pickens,Bob Dylan at his very best,the face of Baker's wife,the setting and cinematography.You will know this scene when you get to it.Please take time to watch something ,when the very best of all came together for afew brief minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great film (that is, if you get the director's cut)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah was disgusted with the version of PAT GARRET AND BILLY THE KID that was released in 1973. The studio took the movie away from him and recut it. This happened more then once to Peckinpah and it probably contributed to his heavy alcholism which killed him at the age of 59. The original version of the film (that is the one released in 1973) is awkawardly paced, and doesn't fully explain the things that need to be explained. The director's cut, now available on video and I hope soon on DVD, is a great film. The restored material helps to clarify everything that was foggy in the original. Like most of Peckinpag's films, this is a violent story. Like THE WILD BUNCH it has a outlaw (Kris Kristofferson) being pursued by an old member of his gang (James Coburn). What's interesting, is that Peckinpah does not make either of his main characters all that likable. Both are violent men, who will kill without feeling (that is until they have to face each other). Peckinpah offers no easy answers or standard Western moralizing here. It's an honest film. Those who complain about the historical inaccuracies (and I'm sure that some morans do), have missed to point entirely. It's not a film about what really happened between these two men, but a story of what happened between these two characters. In that respect, it is a great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid (1973)** 1/2 (out of 4)Pat Garrett (James Coburn) takes a job as a Sheriff and soon after wards he heads out to arrest his old friend Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofferson). Before they can hang him Billy makes an escape so Garrett sets out to finish the job.Sam Peckinpah's PAT GARRETT &amp; BILLY THE KID was released to mostly negative reviews but the version released wasn't what the director wanted. The studio pretty much took over the film and released their own cut, which was the only version out there until the Z-Channel released a 121-minute cut in the late 80s. Most preferred that version but there were those who felt this wasn't what Peckinpah would have wanted so a third version called the "Special Edition" was released in 2005 and that's the version being reviewed here.There's a lot of great stuff in this movie. In fact, it's easy to see why so many people consider this to be one of the director's greatest films but for my money there are still plenty of flaws. For starters, the biggest flaw is that the film is just downright boring. I'm going to place the majority of the blame on the screenplay, which doesn't seem to know what it's trying to do. Or, perhaps the screenplay was okay and it was Peckinpah that just couldn't get a clear story onto film. I'm going to guess that the main attempt was to show these two men, former friends, and what their falling out was all about. For the most part we see both characters doing their own thing and the movie really doesn't seem all that interested in a clear narrative of having Garrett find Billy. Of course, it eventually happens because that's the only way the movie could end but everything leading up to it just doesn't add up to much.The film is a technical marvel as the director clearly still had an eye for style. The entire film contains some wonderful cinematography and there's no question that the slow motion is perfectly used throughout. Peckinpah certainly knew how to stage a scene and milk everything out of it that he could. Just take a look at the sequence where Billy escape from jail and the destruction that follows. Another great sequence involves the capture of Billy and the remarkable shoot out that happens. The editing is another marvel that really helps move the film along. Then there's the music score and soundtrack from Bob Dylan. The score and soundtrack on their own are excellent but I really think the songs take away from the action on the screen. This is especially true for the "Knockin' on Heaven's Door," which just doesn't have much of an impact.The performances are where the real fun stuff comes from. I thought Coburn was excellent in the role of Garrett and he perfectly captured a rather dark character. Kristopherson is extremely good in the role of Billy the Kid and manages to turn in a very memorable version of the character. Dylan, the actor, is okay in his part even though he isn't given too much dialogue. The supporting cast includes Richard Jaeckel, Cill Willis, Jason Robards, Barry Sullivan, Luke Askew, Jack Elam, Slim Pickens, Harry Dean Stanton and Charles Martin Smith among others.PAT GARRETT &amp; BILLY THE KID is far from a horrible movie but I think a stronger story would have made the technical achievement a lot better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would really like to know/see Sam Peckinpah's vision for what this film should be, but apparently no one knows. It was some of James Coburn's best work, nuance behind the icy stare. Yes, Kris Kristofferson was clearly too old to play the historic William Bonney, but the historic Bonney couldn't possibly have had the charisma, and had time to form such friendships, at his age. So, you just have to accept that it's not a documentary. It was neat to see so many well-known faces in small parts. And Bob Dylan did just fine playing an enigmatic character. So many singers, and lately wrestlers and other athletes have done acceptable acting jobs that it makes me think that acting isn't really that hard. They are not DeNiros, or Streeps, but they frequently get the job done. Anyway, PGABTK, I found, to be well worth the investment of time to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of Peckinpah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider this '73 version of the cycle about the famous outlaw a masterpiece. I can't believe that some think this to be Peckinpah's worst picture. This is one of the few films which remain equally great each time I watch them. It is a sepia-toned picture of the last glory days of Old West and as such a really sad and melancholic film. As Pat Garrett in James Coburn's magnificent incarnation puts it: "This country is getting old and I'm getting old along with it" It is a poignant message.The cast is excellent and the best thing about it is that everyone is so believable in their part. Except for Bob Dylan that is, who really looks out of place, but even he doesn't spoil the pleasure for me. He almost makes it in his part, but just pales in comparison to Coburn and Kristofferson. Kris gives his first strong performance here and is very well matched against Coburn and both are cool in their own way. Jack Elam is another surprise as Alamosa Bill and gives a quite moving performance, especially in his last scene. And last but not least, Slim Pickens and Katy Jurado provide perhaps the most memorable scene with "Knocking at Heaven's Door" playing in the background.I can see why some think this is not an enjoyable film. There is a lot of killing and too little humor in it. But Peckinpah really has turned this old story into an epic wild west picture and for that he deserved to be awarded, which he never did unfortunately. This is a really touching and unforgettable film and everyone should watch it and learn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Peckinpah's tale of two friends on opposite sides of the law doesn't play out like a typical western. In fact, I think it was Biskind who said this film was completely miscast - but still worked. I disagree on that, but I do see some truth in it. The film is quirky to say the least - like a quiet rock and roll elegy to the West.The story is simple enough yet it meanders, through the landscape of America and of the character's minds. We see the violence of America, the sex, the booze and all. It's a great backdrop for a cat and mouse tale, even though that does simplify the film somewhat.Pat Garrett may hunt down Billy, but I often ask myself, why does he do it? It is to satisfy his new-found status as sheriff? Garrett used to be an outlaw, now he finds a need to find an identity, to prove himself on the other side.The music is wonderful, written and performed by Bob Dylan who supports the wonderful Coburn and Kristofferson. There are some scenes which just utterly touch the soul...where "Knockin on Heavens Door" plays. That sounds very soppy of me, but you have to see it to feel it. If you like Westerns, you will really feel the impact of that scene.This is a melancholy western. The dying of traditions. The ageing of a country.This countries getting' old, and it's time we got old with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dylan's contribution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen all three versions so far and even though this might be in the minority, I have to say the original is the best. It is for the very reason many knock it, the use of Bob Dylan's excellent soundtrack. To think the other two versions gave short shift to the wonderful Slim Pickens haunting death, with the visual of a widows grief set against a sunset sky with Dylan's Knocking on Heavens Door being allowed to play out more fully gives the movie it's vivid emotional counterpoint. Slim's character dies with the tears of a heart broken wife; Pat and Billy die essentially alone. Bob's music sets the proper mood right from the start when Billy finishes saying "He's my friend," and continues to add depth with it's minimalistic tones and underplayed delivery. It is the perfect counterpoint to the exceptional photography and embracing dialog found thru ought. The studio was right to highlight it, and the other versions are poorer for not continuing in that vein.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>best of the west</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my personal favorites. Where do I begin? There's the beautiful Bob Dylan score (especially "Knocking on Heaven's Door"), great performances by Kris Kristofferson and James Coburn, a supporting cast of western veterans, a literate script, and the direction of Sam Peckinpah in his last great film. Though not the masterpiece "The Wild Bunch" is, it's still a beautiful film; aside from "El Topo," it's the best of the revisionist westerns of the 1970s, a time when old myths and values were being questioned. Peckinpah, at heart a romantic conservative, somehow caught the Zeitgeist of the era. "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" gives us a grainier, more realistic view of the Old West than we're used to seeing; it predated Clint Eastwood's "The Unforgiven" by twenty years in its unflinching portrait of frontier violence. There are no good guys or bad guys, rather two morally ambiguous men, friends in an earlier life, who find themselves on the opposite side of what's basically a political argument. James Coburn is appropriately gruff as Sheriff Pat Garrett, a man who just wants to settle down and who knows the time for guns is over; Kristofferson makes a charismatic Billy, the embodiment of lawless individualism. The excellent supporting cast includes such old pros as Jack Elam, Slim Pickens, Katy Jurado, Richard Jaekel and (in some prints) Elisha Cook Jr.; but the best performance comes from the late Jason Robards Jr. as the tragically muddle-headed Governor Lew Wallace (best known for writing "Ben Hur.") For those wanting a different perspective on some of the same characters I recommend the 1970 John Wayne vehicle "Chisum," with Glenn Corbett as Pat Garrett and Geoffrey Deuel (Peter Deuel's younger brother) as a young William Bonney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the film when first released in 1973, and it was a disappointment. I expected more I guess when I was younger. As the years wore on, and the years wear on you, the film gathers more meaning especially when you look from Pat Garrett's viewpoint. I finally found a director's cut and the film suddenly made more sense. Peckinpah disavowed the film as released and the cutting was certainly jerky in the original release. If you enjoy seeing a platoon of the old character actors, this film is for you, and the director's cut adds even more characters that add to enjoyment. This film has no heroes, however, and good and evil is blurred. Pat Garrett is the most interesting and ambiguous man in the film, and Coburn's interpretation is worth the watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the movies of the Billy the Kid legend he has been portrayed by an assortment of actors as a misguided hothead like in Robert Taylor's and Audie Murphy's versions in which they both shared the same costume; black hat,black leather jacket,maybe even black leather pants, to Paul Newman's portrayal of a guy looking for a home and daddy's love. So in that time frame whether in a B or A film a pattern was set,young man,fast with a gun,in over his head heroic western tragedy figure. Mr. Peckinpah looked at the famous picture and saw a stone cold killer having the time of his life. Some have said Kristofferson played as a one note character I say it was a perfect match he played it just like the real Bonney looked like in the photograph with more intelligence and a bit of a jaded rock star quality. He borrowed his Christ on a Cross pose from Paul Newman's The Left Handed Gun everything else was his. He attracted not led a band of rowdies to him and was perfectly happy committing random acts of mayhem the Lincoln County range war just a cover. Pat Garret and even the character Randolph Scott played in Ride the High Country would've been hard pressed to control him. But the master outlaws Pike Bishop and Deke Thorton- after a good pistol whupping and a strong lecture, and Kris' Billy swifter on the uptake than the Gorches and not as idealistic as Angel,could've rode with the Wild Bunch into their Mexican Ragnorok happily.=---------------------------------------------------------------------------</fullReview>

Elegiac, wistful, philosophical, beautifully photographed, and with some of the coolest, funniest elliptical dialogue ever committed to celluloid. Check out Billy's monologue about the old man they call US Christmas, which he delivers as the preamble to the gunfight in which Alias is introduced to the film. And Dylan's performance is just great. A true classic from the late, great Uncle Sam himself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID - (1973) - TCM - Well, I must admit Sam Peckinpah can make one humdinger of a western. That said, this certainly isn't a favorite of mine, but it's worth a watch for serious western fans. It's infinitely more realistic than a John Ford western...to a fault. However, I much prefer to be in a semi-make-believe John Ford world versus this one mainly because I prefer the Hays Code westerns any day over this style. The unkempt and kept women with bare breasts displayed at any possible chance turned my stomach. It was all a bit too realistic.Conversely, I was pleasantly surprised by the Bob Dylan soundtrack. I absolutely love the song "Knocking on Heaven's Door" and the bittersweet scene where it was playing was very profound. It's my favorite part of the movie...period. Also, I loved seeing a fresh-faced Kris Kristofferson who has such a great speaking voic and excelled in this role. James Coburn is even cooler than Kristofferson. Frankly, who is cooler than James Coburn in that era? In the final scene with Billy (Kristofferson), Coburn actually loses his cool. I saw his raw vulnerability wonderfully shot in the mirror...great acting and directing. This scene is very telling as to the relationship between Garrett and Billy and to Peckinpah's vision as a filmmaker. Additionally, the cinematography was stunning. In one scene in particular, Billy rides along the shore of a lake. The pinks of the sky were reflected with the shadow of horse and rider on land and water. That was a beautiful and memorable shot and it's this attention to detail that makes it worth a watch. This film has a diverse supporting cast and the same great story of the Old West tale told in a unique way. It was very gritty, but these guys were meant to play grit. I doubt I'll ever watch it again, but I do recommend it to anyone who appreciates the stark reality of the revisionist western told in Peckinpah's unique style. It's just not to my taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Damn you Bob Dylan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the longer 2005 directors cut at 122 minutes after hearing how chopped up this film was in its theatrical release. The film stars James Coburn as Pat Garrett and Kris Kristofferson as Billy the Kid. There were a few notable supporting actors including Bob Dylan who also did the soundtrack, and western stalwarts, Chill Wills, Slim Pickens, Harry Dean Stanton and Jason Robards. The film was directed by the notorious Sam Peckinpah.The film is based on the historical rumors surrounding the relationship between Sheriff Pat Garrett and the wanted outlaw Billy the Kid. The setting is 1881 New Mexico in the rough and tumble old west. The film shows a reluctant Garrett arresting and then searching again for the escaped Billy. Peckinpah's familiar themes of man vs. society and his characters struggle to be honest and true to themselves in the face of adversity are well represented.The film has several outstanding scenes, the shootout in the beginning at Billy's arrest, Billy's escape and shotgun blast full of dimes, and of course the scene critics love to drool over the riverboat scene. As an aside I thought that Slim Pickens was awesome in this film and his riverside scene has more emotion and gravitas than the entire twilight franchise. Despite some great scenes and acting on the part of steady and intense Coburn and several of the supporting actors the films narrative drifts all over the place. I could probably cut the film down to about 40 minutes and have a masterpiece. There were simply not enough quality scenes in this film. This is probably attributed to the fact that 6 different editors were involved and eventually led to Peckinpah asking for his name to be removed as director. Similarly, I found the addition of Bob Dylan extremely annoying. He seems like he feels awkward in every frame he is in and I couldn't get past the hey that's Bob Dylan every time I saw him. I also was not a big fan of Kristofferson in this film. I realize Billy the Kid was supposed to be a laid back easy going fella but Kristofferson seems to think an awe shucks grin and laconic attitude is a substitute for acting.In summation if you are a fan of the western genre or a fan of the work of Sam Peckinpah I would encourage you to see the film. However, I would be hesitant to suggest the film over some of Peckinpah's other work including Straw Dogs, The Wild Bunch and the Getaway. I am sad to report I was disappointed in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too Smart For It's Own Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah's free-spirited take on the legend of Billy the kid starts well, with the final arrest, incarceration, and breakout of Billy Bonney. After that, it's a bit languid, though fairly interesting throughout.However, the thing that keeps Pat Garrett &amp; Billy The Kid from becoming a truly great film (to me anyway), is that Peckinpah didn't seem to want to sacrifice any of the rich character development or atmosphere for pacing purposes.The familiar Peckinpah theme of unchanged men in changing times, best exemplified in Ride The High Country and The Wild Bunch, is repeated here, with a heavy emphasis on the drifting apart of old friendships, that happen when one grows up and the other wants to remain young forever, a point driven home in L.Q. Jones' speech to Garrett as he staggers around with Pat's bullets in him.In the title roles, James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson are okay, though they both give low-key performances, so there isn't enough contrast between them. I would have liked to see Coburn a bit more animated here. It would have been interesting to see.The rest of the all-star cast is great, with a nice mixture of old western stars and younger character actors. R.G. Armstrong is a standout, making good use of his limited screen-time as Billy's bible-thumping jailer.Bob Dylan's music score is excellent, though as an actor his movements and speech are strangely robotic! It's good to see though, that he apparently took a break from intentionally (according to Dylan himself!) recording bad albums in the early-seventies, in order to do some really great songs.Between this, The Wild Bunch, and Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia, it seems as if Sam Peckinpah had a "thing" for Mexican women's breasts!Interestingly enough, co-star Richard Jaeckel appeared in 1970's Chisum, another Billy Bonney related film, where he acted alongside John Wayne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seydor's 2005 Cut is a Travesty and a Bitter Disappointment!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10/10 fro the '88 Turner Cut. 01/10 for Seydor's 2005 version.There is absolutely NO WAY Seydor's '05 cut is better than the '88 Turner version. Seydor has ****ed this up big time. His version is essentially a fan-boy edit of the film, and shouldn't even have Peckinpah's name on it. Basically he did exactly the same thing as Aubrey did. Notice he "didn't bother" restoring the picture and sound of the Turner cut on disc 2 so his cut would look sooo much better.As PG&amp;BTK is possibly my all-time favourite film, this was the biggest DVD disappointment of my life. All he had to do was put back into the Turner cut the two deleted scenes (the one with Garrett and his wife and the one with Ruthie Lee) and give it the full restoration works and it was perfect. Check out Mike Sutton's excellent review at DVDTimes and you'll see what I mean.PG&amp;BTK is truly one of the greatest westerns ever made, possibly Peckinpah's masterpiece, and definitely deserves better than this. Seydor's cut is just that: Seydor's version of a Sam Peckinpah film, NOT Peckinpah's version of a Sam Peckinpah film. The sad thing is that casual fans who watch this will come away thinking 'Peckinpah's Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid is crap' when its not Peckinpah's version at all. And anyone who actually prefers Seydor's '05 cut won't even realise that they HAVEN'T BEEN WATCHING a Peckinpah film! They've been watching Seydor's INTERPRETATION of one. Never mind all the baloney on the commentary tracks pointing out how "this is how Sam would've done it". Seydor was hardly going to criticise his own work. Why Weddle and Simmons didn't say something is anybody's guess.I think its a terrible injustice and a great crime against art if a proper restoration of this magnificent film isn't done soon. They (Warners) actually have ALL the footage, it just needs to be assembled correctly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Coburn is Pat Garrett and hes looking for Kris Kristofferson as Billy the Kid. And this time its personal! The problem with this film however is that it doesn't get that personal. As much as I like Kristofferson as an actor, we follow Billy around just acting up all the time. Likewise with Garrett. And I don't feel any per se interest in any of the characters as such. They are both a couple of hard-asses with a criminal past. Garrett is succumbing to the status quo whilst Billy is still the rebel. The land owners are in the background and supportive of Garrett. Billy has sold himself to them before. People are dropping like flies from various shoot-outs. So we are offered a bland kind of nihilism. Bob Dylan pops up as the enigmatic Alias, but that does not really lead anywhere either now does it? Still, I can appreciate the whole nihilism thing on some level also. Whats good about this movie is the overall ambiance, the dirty wild west thing, and the Pekinpah machismo, though some type of hint as to why we are offered only quiet female roles, laying in bed or cooking, and with women being beaten, would have been good. I also appreciate the genuine 70s film-making kinda vibe that this film has. And Dylans soundtrack, that very well could have gotten to shine some more, as it is, including the over-played 'Knocking on Heavens Door', pretty sweet.If I could somehow have remade this film I would have brought Dylans music even more to the fore, and would have made the beginning of the film such that we got more of a feeling for what the characters are about. Now, still, what we do get is not half bad, I reckon. Pekinpah at his half-best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a beautiful film by Sam Peckinpah starring Kris Kristofferson (Billy the Kid) and James Coburn (Pat Garrett). Bob Dylan created a masterpiece of a soundtrack as well as co-starring as Alias in the movie. He's not a good actor but probably the most influential song writer of our (all?) time. Buy this soundtrack!I think the first 10 or 15 minutes are great. Absolutely terrific. Kristofferson puts in a great performance here. So does James Coburn. It was interesting to see Dylan as well even though his talent when it comes to acting must be limited. He's always a joy watching anyway.Nevertheless, the film sort of faded sometimes and could get a little distant but it was never boring, mainly because it had a great dialogue and it was pleasing to watch the good and true acting.It was so nice to not have a lot of all these new hollywood effects that steers you up out of your couch. You could just sit down, enjoy and concentrate on this great flick and it's characters. Beautiful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great journey in a world of legends and myths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I believe you know of me" says Alamosa Bill (Jack Elam) to Pat Garret (James Coburn) at the beginning of the film "Pat Garret and Billy the Kid". Garret agrees, he has heard about him, Alamosa killed G.B. Denning one year ago at Silver City for calling him a cheat at Monte. Alamosa is proud Pat has heard about him, proud of his reputation, and image and reputation seem to be what drives most of the characters in this great western. In a certain way they are saying to you: "OK, we all know this is a movie and we are all playing we are legend, And it sure works well! Besides Alamosa, there is Eben who drowned on the Rio Grande trying to escape a posse, U.S. Christmas who died in a duel with John Jones who stepped on his new boots, the horse thief Jace Sommers killed by a rattle-snake. All these men are legends. And there is Bob Dylan who is a legend nowadays, but was not a legend at those old times. And certainly the deeds of Chisum and governor Lewis Wallace to impose their power is no legend. They do not seem to belong only here in this mythical West, same as Bob Dylan. Dylan is on the opposite side of Wallace and Chisum, they are fighting in the present, they are fighting it now...Before I Saw Pat Garret and Billy the Kid, my idea of Billy was Audie Murphy. Neither Johnny McBrown, Robert Taylor, Jack Buetel, Paul Newman and some others I can't remember could fit as well as Audie. When I saw Kristofferson as Billy, I thought he was cast against type. There is a scene where by "a simple twist of fate" Alamosa and Billy are at the same dinner table. Slowly they realize there is no way out, they are going to have to face each other in a deathly duel. They do a ten stepper where Alamosa cheats and turns at eight, but Billy is already waiting for him because he turned at three. Looking at Billy at that moment, I realized there was no better Billy than Kristofferson. As the film goes along Billy and Kristofferson merge, we can imagine Billy saying "freedom is just another word for nothing else to lose" to Janis and so many others?.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Least Favorite Peckinpah</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider myself a Peckinpah fan, but this film doesn't cut it.It doesn't have any real structure apart from the opening/closing scene of Garrett getting shot, which frames the narrative from decades earlier. Maybe the desultory aimlessness of Garrett and Billy just going here and there without particular motivation was Peckinpah's point about a worn-out Western experience; but it didn't do it for me. I couldn't feel the characters, except superficially. You want to FEEL a Peckinpah character, try Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia.The opening scene and credits are great, with wonderful freeze frames of the characters' faces that would be museum-worthy photographs in their own right. And I love the rifle shot taken in the later time period that seems to end up in the earlier one. Nice Peckinpah touches.Coburn, awesome in Peckinpah's Cross of Iron, seems to just be doing what he has to; it's like he isn't trying hard. Kristofferson puts on a certain look for this film - a smile that says `I'm SO good at this risk-my-life outlaw stuff that I can do it and be relaxed at the same time.' The problem is that it's a `look' like Zoolander has a `look'; Kristofferson never offers any emotional variety, he's just always sporting his smile. Now Dylan, that's a different story. He's such a mousey anti-presence, it left me wondering if, god forbid, I (and all the other non-actors out there) would look that pathetic up on the big screen.The Dylan soundtrack was good for the most part, conveyed a flavor I liked, but sometimes it just seemed mistaken, particularly in the last half of the film.</fullReview>

An aimless and uninteresting Western, showing Peckinpah's continued decline after the peak of "The Wild Bunch." Every now and then some breasts are bared to perk things up but a better script would have been more helpful. Bland Kristofferson uses two facial expressions in playing Billy: Smiley Face and Not Smiley Face. Dylan's role seems to be an afterthought; he mumbles only a handful of lines, the most significant being the reading of food can labels. The only good thing about this clunker is cameo appearances by a Who's Who cast of character actors.</fullReview>

Also, there's nothing wrong with Sam getting Rita Coolidge to taking her blouse off. This movie was made during the era when all cowboys had long hair, scruffy beards and wicked tight leather pants. For some reason, there's always a couple of scenes in these cowboy movies where the girls take their blouses off.I just wish this film was on DVD.

		<fullReview>I have no idea whether this film portrays the story of these two legends with anything resembling historical accuracy (though I'm reasonably certain it is closer to what may have happened than latter-day efforts like "Young Guns"). However, as an artistic evocation of two larger-than-life figures blown up to serious pop-culture proportions, it is nearly unassailable. Kris Kristofferson (who has had a spotty acting career, to say the least) turns in a witty and nuanced performance as Billy the Kid. Likewise, Coburn has rarely been in such fine form, completely inhabiting the character of Garrett. As Paul Williams has pointed out, the rest of the characters are more or less cameo roles, though Bob Dylan is on screen more than the others, giving a truly peculiar and intriguing performance (he also contributed the spectacularly evocative soundtrack). The film has a few problems, some of which are typical for Peckinpah. The opening turkey shoot sequence goes on far too long and becomes almost impossible to stomach after awhile. The pacing is occasionally problematic (though nowhere near as awful as the butchered 103 minute version that initially played theaters), though this rarely detracts from the overall enjoyment. While I'm on that subject, I might as well note that all comments above pertain strictly to the full 122 minute version that Peckinpah intended to release. I give this version 8 out of 10, while the studio cut merits about a 4. In fact, the superiority of this version is so widely recognized at this point that the studio cut has virtually disappeared (though it does turn up here and there on TV).If you enjoy Westerns, or Peckinpah, or are at all intrigued by these two characters, this is a most thoughtful and enjoyable way to spend two hours.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The scene where Harris (Pickens) tells Pat Garrett (Coburn) that he'll work for him to bring in the Kid, but Garrett will have to pay him in advance. They both know their world is coming to an end, that there's no way money can ever mean that much anymore now that they're hunting their own kind for an evil cattle baron. The look they exchange when Garrett (in a beautiful gesture) flips Harris a single shiny gold coin says it all -- loss, shame, a tragedy already unfolding that they can't do anything about.Other scenes could easily take the prize, and surely do for other viewers: Peckinpah himself as the coffin builder, Pickens looking at the river after his wife (Katy Jurado) has been killed, and of course, the opening credits as a much older Coburn pulls his wagon to a halt to face the corporate killers he always knew would come for him.Just a gorgeous movie. That it was butchered by MGM and dumped into second-run theaters, and was not restored so we could see it as it should have been until after its creator died, is a crime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An historically accurate, socially relevant, and simply beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Regarded as an accurate as well as artistic re-telling of Billy's life and times (from about the time of the Lincoln County Jail bust-out onward), Peckinpah's masterwork also presents a rich allegory about the encroachment of the Establishment into 1880s New Mexico and 1960s America. Bob Dylan's "Alias" role serves as a manifestation of Billy's "inner voice," the spirit of unspoiled New Mexico, and as well the personification of the rebellious youth of the 60s and 70s; all three personae are destined for a broken heart. Until Eastwood's "Unforgiven," this film was the only important western since 1966's "The Last Gunfighter." Watch this film and you will love it. At its end, you will probably have an unjustifiable admiration for the real William Bonney. However, your nostalgia for New Mexico, untouched by money and the hooves of cattle, will stand on solid ground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah's flawed masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It should be stated up front that we will never get to see the version of PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID that Sam Peckinpah intended for the public; the movie was rushed into release after a truly torturous production in Durango, Mexico, highlighted by a battle between the stubborn director and MGM head James Aubrey. The studio was only interested in a product to pump up the cash flow as it prepared to build The MGM Grand in Las Vegas and thought a Peckinpah western-his biggest since THE WILD BUNCH-would be a huge hit, During the production, Peckinpah, having a distinctive and abiding dislike of the studio brass, often proved to be his own worst enemy when he made no attempt to humor MGM and had the editing taken away from him and his crew. The result, released to theaters in the summer of 1973, was a butchered work that only sporadically hinted at the greatness that could have been. Now thanks to the miracle of DVD, we have two restored versions: the 1988 TCM version and the 2005 Special Edition. Both of them contain scenes slashed out of the original and give a fuller glimpse of the epic Peckinpah wanted and intended to make.These restored "Director's Cuts" make some things very clear:Peckinpah wanted PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID to be another look at his favorite theme of the passing of the Old West and the price that was paid for leaving it behind. The day of the open range is passing for New Mexico, statehood beckons and the veterans of the range wars, Garrett, the Kid and the men that road with them, have to go according to the powers that be (the Santa Fe ring). The older Garrett decides to throw in with the Ring, becomes Sheriff of Lincoln County and agrees to do the dirty work of getting rid of the Kid and the others. But Garrett clearly does not reckon with the guilt that comes with the job and the blood that will ultimately stain his hands. But Peckinpah rewrote much of Rudy Wurlitzer's original script to work in a very contemporary political angle; looking at it another way, PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID is all about the clash between the counter culture of the late 60's and the Establishment. The casting of songwriter and singer Kris Kristofferson only underscored this theme, along with the addition of Bob Dylan to the cast while contributing to one of the all time great soundtracks. The Santa Fe ring that buys off James Coburn's Garrett could easily stand for Richard Nixon and all the reactionary millionaires that poured tons of money into his campaign. In this way Peckinpah was quit ahead of the curve in that when he touched up Wurlitzer's script, the crimes of Watergate were still being covered up successfully. Either way, the movie becomes a sad dirge for not only the passing of the Old West, but for what was best about America itself-a land where a man could be free to live as he pleased. The script, even with Peckinpah's contributions, lacks coherence and is mainly a collection of great set piece scenes, some of them dominated by great veterans of westerns, both of the screen and TV. For no other reason alone, PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID is worth seeing for the cast, which includes: Jason Robards, Jack Elam, Slim PIckens, L.Q. Jones, Katy Jurado, Richard Jaeckel, Paul Fix, Dub Taylor, Elisha Cook Jr., Barry Sullivan, Luke Askew, Harry Dean Stanton, Chill Wills, Richard Bright, Emilio Fernandez, Matt Clark, and R.G. Armstrong. Where was Strother Martin? The shootout with Jones's Black Harris, which culminates with Pickens's death, is one of the most unique things in any western-watch for the expressions on Jurado's face as Pickens faces his last moments. Simply unforgettable; so too is Wills's obscene monologue and Billy's escape from the jail in Lincoln, where he has a final confrontation with Armstrong's fanatical deputy Bob Ollinger. There are also many others like Garrett's confrontation with the man on the raft that are rightly legendary. All of it livened up with some of the most memorable dialogue in any western.It is also clear that Peckinpah's considerable talent was starting to wane by the time he made this film-there is some clunky symbolism, such as Billy taking an open armed Christ on the cross stance when arrested by Garrett, and other scenes (Paco's death) are just badly written in a way that the Peckinpah at the top of his game would never have filmed.Still, PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID is the great master's last western, a genre he loved dearly, and if it is not perfect (and non Peckinpah fans can find many faults), he still managed to say what he meant and get what he wanted up on the screen. It really does hold up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most stylized yet effective movie rendition of Billy the Kid western lore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Patented Peckinpah violence opens the film, transporting the viewer immediately to a past time and place where target practice with live targets would not have been at all far-fetched. The movie then proceeds in portraying a chronologically and more worldly sophisticated Billy than the real character most likely was, and a Pat Garrett who is best amplified and probably portrayed more accurately in the Director's Cut edition of the movie (otherwise, Pat's too patently one-dimensional). Look for Peckinpah grittiness to be at it's best with the Bob Dylan and Chill Wills characters, and the most emotionally provocative scene in the entire film as "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" with classic film character actors Slim Pickens and Katy Jurado.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Letdown but Not Without Merit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of Sam Peckinpah and Fans of the Movie Western seem to give this Meandering Semi-Incoherent Film a Pass because it is a Sam Peckinpah Western. There are Moments in this Troubled Production that are Poignant and Beautifully Gritty. There are just as Many Others that are Clunky and Awkward.Much Controversy Arises Concerning this Movie the Least of Which is the Casting and Utilization of Bob Dylan as an Actor and His Songs. At Times the Inclusion of the Musical Numbers can be Heartfelt and Effective and at Other Stages not so much. But Using the Dylan (Lyrics or not) Material doesn't do too much to Diminish the Overall Effectiveness. As an Actor in a Smallish Role Mildly Detracts but Again not to the Detriment of the Whole.James Coburn and Kris Kristofferson as the Title Characters, it can be Argued, are Good Enough and along with the Slew of Familiar Faces and Odd Ball Stalwarts the same can be Said. So just what is the Major Malfunction that Keeps this from Becoming a Great Peckinpah, like say The Wild Bunch (1969) or Ride the High Country (1962) or to a Lesser Extent, Fine Films like Straw Dogs (1972) or the Getaway (1974)?The Answer My Friend is the Gloomy, Sombre, Lethargic, Motionless Pace and the Stumbling Editing. Add to that a Few Scenes of some Stiff and Unnecessary Nudity and a Couple of Other Ill-Advised Excesses and Underdeveloped Important Characters. The Studio Interference and the Director's Personal Detachment from Alcohol Abuse and General Belligerence around the Set are most Likely Contributions.Overall it is Worth a Watch and which Version is not that Important because as a Complete Peckinpah Picture it Works more than it Doesn't and is not one of His Worst and not one of His Best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't 'the Wild Bunch' it has a few similarities. Friends become reluctant foes for one. Bu it is much more melancholy and thoughtful. We are trying to understand the characters instead of watching them go through a series of events.There are different versions. The original theatrical version, the 1988 preview version (the best version, despite Knocking on heavens door becoming an instrumental) and the 2005 special edition, which lacks all the poetry of the 1988 version.Coburn gives the role of Garrett real weight and depth. This is the most interesting character in the film. He alone makes the movie interesting enough. but there are other aspects of the film that are great as well. Kristofferson gives Billy the Kid a real believability. He seems like he is out of his time. A dying breed aged only 21 (Kristofferson was 36 though).A beautiful film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not at home on the range</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Somewhat rambling and only occasionally effective re-telling of the Billy The Kid legend, concentrating mostly on his last days as newly made sheriff, erstwhile friend and colleague Pat Garrett takes the government shilling to enforce the law and hunt the Kid down.Working it's way backward from the introductory scene when Garrett's borrowed time existence is brought to a treacherous and brutal end by those with a long memory, we're taken back to Garrett's 5 day ultimatum to Billy, which ends in the latter's slaughter at Garrett's hands.Early on in the piece, as the two principals are having a conflab, Billy effectively states "Times change, people don't", as close to a central "man out of time" motif as the film gets. Subtexts like the price of loyalty, aspects of heroism and hero-worship and the well-worn thin line between good guy and bad guy also get a look in, but the film rambles and tambles all over the place and despite a fair smattering of dialogue, their words convey little real insight into the motivations of the characters. Nowhere is this more evident than in the part no doubt created as a sop for Bob Dylan for producing the admittedly effective soundtrack, particularly the classic "Knockin' on Heaven's Door" which too obviously gets aired every time someone's about to die. Dylan's "Alias" floats around the periphery almost like a one-man Greek chorus but his completely inept acting (every line he speaks looks like it was take 79 or 80) makes his non-sequitur pronouncements sound faintly ridiculous.Far better are the what I'll call proper actors, a clean-shaven Kristoffersson (no doubt to accentuate his character's youth) and particularly Coburn who flesh out their pseudo-complex characterisations just enough without making you ever really think they fully equate to their true-life counterparts. The supporting acting is also strong - there's little doubt that Peckinpah is at home out in the west directing his largely male cast.And herein for me lies one of the movie's main faults - its offhand treatment of women who are mostly required (bar brief scenes involving one middle-aged rifle-toting Belle Starr type and Coburn's neglected wife) to say nothing, strip off and get bedded, no questions asked, by seemingly anyone wearing a stetson.The film is beautifully shot mostly in clear daylight and as ever with Peckinpah we get to count off the numerous trademark slow-motion gun-shooting scenes - all as bloody as you'd expect, the one exception, probably deliberate, being the Kid's own execution, bare-chested like a latter-day St Sebastian.In the end everybody of note in the film dies violently but I reckon there are just too many such scenes in the movie, over-punctuating the narrative. A modern western, then, overloaded with psychological pretensions which in the end drag the action to a snail's pace and just about lost my interest along the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peck's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a relentless western, Peckinpah's best, in my opinion. It took some time for me to enjoy it. I had it kicking around for a few weeks on an old VHS tape, and the poor quality of the soundtrack had me blasting it just to hear Dylan's score. The third time trying, I stuck it out, and wow, was it worth it. As a huge Dylan fan, I think I was a little skeptical about him performing in a western. I'd read different articles and books that had referenced the picture, mostly negative reviews, and had seen Masked and Anonymous, so I knew that not everything he touched turned to gold. But this movie is powerful, with or without Dylan. Coburn couldn't be better - his portrayal of Pat Garrett is filled with subtle brush strokes and broad characterizations that you instantly trust this man and fear him at the same time. Kris Kristofferson isn't the best actor - really not the best singer, either, but he gives an air of youthful defiance, a glow of sexual danger that really works for Billy the Kid. The movie left me thinking hard about the nature of Garrett's hunt. Is the Kid just naive? Does Garrett want the Kid to get away with it? If you like Westerns, especially of the Peckinpah variety, you'd better find this one and watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The films of Sam Peckinpah. A near classic western masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973) follows the last days of the notorious Billy the Kid (Kris Kristofersen) and his former running buddy Pat Garrett's (James Coburn) attempts to bring him to justice. A film that show's how true friendship and honor can blur the lines of justice. Despite his outlaw status, Billy the Kid was well liked by the common folk whilst Pat Garrett was widely viewed as a traitor and back stabbing turncoat by his peers. Many people don't know that they were once the best of friends until the local and state government made him an offer he couldn't refuse.To describe the movie would be an injustice. Simply out, Sam Peckinpah poured a lot of himself into this film. Many of his regulars appear in the movie. The studios made him take on Bob Dylan (to bring in the young folks) and to cast Kris Kristofersen in the lead as Billy the Kid (despite being too old for the part). That's the main reason for this film not receiving a ten. But to my surprise Mr. Kristofersen did a decent job in bringing the mythical outlaw to life. If you enjoyed THE WILD BUNCH, you'll love PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID. Unofficially remade as YOUNG GUNS II.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being friends is sometimes dangerous.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not only is being former friends dangerous, but also pretty damn deadly. The legendary Sam Peckinpah directs this story of Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. You can taste the dust; feel the spurious flying bullets and smell the free flowing essence of non-prejudiced manhood. Garrett(James Coburn)is hired by a group of Santa Fe businessmen to take on the job of sheriff and dedicating his time to tracking down and killing his former riding partner William 'Billy the Kid' Bonney(Kris Kristofferson). Peckinpah makes you feel as if you rode to Mexico and back. The gunfights are so violent and real. And this rendition of the saga of the Kid's relationship with Garrett is very debatable at least. But the characters, the scenery and dialogue keep you involved. The soundtrack by Bob Dylan, who also plays an active small role as "Alias", is sometimes monotonous, but produces the legendary tune "Knockin' on Heaven's Door".The director's cut was released on video fleshing out and filling gaps of the original release. The supporting cast reads like a who's who featuring: Slim Pickens, Chill Wills, L.Q. Jones, Jack Elam, Harry Dean Stanton, Katy Jurado, R.G. Armstrong, Jason Robards and Rita Coolidge aka Mrs. Kristofferson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plays too fast and loose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can understand why western fans might like this film. I love westerns, but this one doesn't work for me. It's so full of posturing and attitude that I just roll my eyes. Someone forgot to mention that Billy was 21 when he died. Most twenty one year old men don't look like they're in their thirties (which Kristofferson was). He was also slightly built and tended not to drink. He also didn't tend to wear a cowboy hat, his favorite hat being a sombrero (this is what Pat Garrett noted). Most importantly, many recent biographies note that the Kid wasn't a killer with a grin. Of the four main killings attributed to him, two were in self defense, another was the result of a bullet ricocheting off the wall during his final escape. Only the killing of the deputy with the shotgun (during that same escape) was intentional (it should be noted that very same deputy had been pretty mean to The Kid). He may also have killed five more men as a result of shootouts between The Regulators (of which he was one) and The House, during the Lincoln County War. Also, Pat Garrett wasn't some guy who tumbled into bed with three hookers. He didn't saunter off at the end like it's "mission accomplished". In real life, after shooting Billy the Kid, he and his two deputies spent the night in the house of Pete Maxwell, frightened that the townspeople, many of whom were The Kid's friends and genuinely loved him, would try to kill them. It should be noted that in the film they're good buddies where as in real life, according to historians, Pat and Henry McCarty weren't generally seen to be friends, just acquaintances.This movie reminds me of Bonnie and Clyde with the way it plays so fast and loose with many of the facts that the characters are Bonnie and Clyde in name only. The difference, tho, is that Bonnie and Clyde is a genuinely good film. Pat Garrett and Billy The Kid could have been a great film, but it just isn't. It's a typical western that wastes a legendary time in history.</fullReview>

Then I see the "director's cut," only to find that the butchered version that played theaters in 1973 and on television ever since is far superior. Either version leaves a lot to be desired, but the studio cut at least includes Dylan's great "Knockin' on Heaven's Door," while the director's cut only features an instrumental version. I'm sorry, but the Dylan song, and Dylan's oddball performance, are the only things that made this movie worthwhile. This isn't "The Wild Bunch." Heck, it isn't even "The Getaway."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plodding 1970's Western Dumb As The Decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a decade when grown white men wore Afros, purple bell-bottom trousers, and beads, women opened conversations with "What's your sign, Man?", and decor was dominated by dark, faux wood grain on every surface, even phonographs and air conditioners, would you really expect the public to have good taste in movies? They didn't, as Pat Garret And Billy The Kid, directed by the grossly over-rated Sam Peckinpah, demonstrates. Too much profanity, too much posturing, too much gratuitous nudity, too much violence, too much socio-political drum beating, too many shots of the sunset, just too aimless and slow moving. Too little character development, too little story, too little discipline of the director. A general mess, saved only by good cinematography and a good performance by leading man James Coburn. And what I hate to tell you, if you're new to watching movies from the 'seventies, is that it was one of the better ones of that dreary era.With all the characters this ambling picture had, any depth of character development would have been neigh impossible, unless it was twice as long as the 122 minutes of the so-called director's cut. It may be that this bloated oat-burner has more characters than War And Peace. And what a waste of a sterling cast of old Western-identified character actors, including Slim Pickens, Chill Wills, R. G. Amstrong, Jack Elam, Paul Fix, and Katy Jurado. Most of these fine players are given only a few minutes or even a few seconds of screen time before being shot down or simply forgotten. Far too much time is given to Kris Kristofferson, as Billy the Kid, and Bob Dylan, as his nameless and useless-to-the-plot pal. Some people obviously liked their singing, but neither could out-act a wooden cigar store Indian with a microphone implant. Another singer who should have stuck to the disks and stayed off the film was Rita Coolidge, as Billy's main squeeze. As much of an empty envelope as Kristofferson, but at least she has few lines with which to be boring.If you are the decadent type who likes looking at nude babes in movies, this picture, like most 'seventies flicks, will give them to you. This was the first generation to give in to voyeurism. But I must warn you that most of the average to homely dames they rounded up to take 'em off in this turkey aren't much worth looking at -- though the "some kind of an octoroon from Texas" (as described by her pimp) wasn't bad. For Pete's sake, if you're going to make a point of having women take their laundry off in a movie, at least get some that look good in the buff! Forty-nine year-old Katy Jurado, even in a floppy cowboy hat, was the best-looking female in the picture. Though be assured she stayed dressed. Only the hat came off.To yours truly Bob Dylan's country-rock music and singing, passed off as the score, is simply grating. This dull hay-burner could have been considerably improved by a rousing, old time, grand operatic score, folded into the editing in a way to enhance the dramatic and psychological impact. Such as Dimitri Tiomkin or Max Steiner could churn out in Hollywood's Golden Era. But those balmy days were gone by 1973. The lack of movie-makers' and their public's taste in music engendered generally awful scores, which was one of the signs that Hollywood had sunk into the pits.Still Pat Garret And Billy The Kid has some good points. A big plus is John Coquillon's soft focus, wide-screen cinematography in Metrocolor (MGM's name for the German Agfacolor), the sepia-drenched, low-key tones of which set a nostalgic mood for this tale of 19th century gunmen. Sets and costumes were likewise well turned out. The key interest is in Coburn's performance as an introspective Pat Garrett, probably the best of his not particularly distinguished career. Peckinpah handles actions scenes well as always, though as always, the violence is grossly overdone, and there is so much of it you get numb to it after a while. Peckinpah continually railed against the studio system, and his groupies continue the rant today. But unfortunately for him, the old studio systems were actually moribund by his time. He was exactly the kind of talented but sloppy, self-indulgent director who would have benefited by having a tough, old time big studio producer such as Hal B. Wallis ride herd on him.As it is, Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid is a typical Peckinpah picture, well filmed with many interesting scenes, but ultimately pretentious, empty, and unsatisfying. Neither the worst nor the best of the umpteen movies on the Billy the Kid story. Better than Left-Handed Gun (1958) but not as good as the Audi Murphy version, The Kid From Texas (1950), which surprisingly may be the best of a not very inspired bunch. At least it is not pretentious, which was one of Peckinpah's repeat sins, and a chronic infection of 1970's cinema.Nevertheless, Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid is a watchable Western. And some of us will watch any of that genre above the Hoot Gibson level and not encrusted with spaghetti.P.S. (July 2016) Since posting this review, oldblackandwhite has decided he is not too good for Hoot Gibson westerns, and apologizes for insulting the memory of Hoot and his various producers and directors by implying that their neat little oaters were in any way inferior to this mess of a movie Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A film about a man who doesn't want to run being chased by a man who doesn't want to catch him" is a much-noted synopsis regarding "Pat Garrett &amp; Billy The Kid". You could also say it's a film starring actors who couldn't act directed by a director without direction.That may be unfair, ignoring as it does the sterling work of James Coburn, who plays the first half of the title pair. But Kris Kristofferson, as Billy, and Bob Dylan, as his pal "Alias", look very much like rock stars on holiday in a film that tries to be both elegiac and unsentimental and winds up slack.Of course, with Sam Peckinpah directing what amounted to his final western, "Pat Garrett" has its champions. It's about the death of the West, they say; a fair point, though not a fresh theme in Peckinpah's oeuvre. Or it's about the problem of a lawman upholding a corrupt law, though as with so many other things about this movie there's more subtext than text to deal with there.What "Pat Garrett" isn't is an exciting, visceral entertainment on par with any of Peckinpah's other major films. Even "Major Dundee", though rambling in its own right, has a bounce and energy this movie lacks. Too many tequila sunrises were adding up for this director, and though he still had bullets in his gun, he wasn't placing them as well as before.Take the scene many bring up in "Pat Garrett's" favor, when Slim Pickens and Katy Jurado face mortality on a riverbank to the strains of Dylan's "Knockin' On Heaven's Door". A great visual image, Jurado both crying and smiling against the dying sunlight, but neither Peckinpah nor the script by Rudy Wurlitzer do enough to prepare us for the scene, the aftermath of a silly-looking gunfight featuring Jurado's shotgun-wielding antics. We hadn't even met the couple ten minutes ago; so how wrapped up in their fates can we really be?Coburn makes for a superb boozy center, playing very much against his hipster image and giving the film a gravitas it sorely needs. "Comes an age in a man's life when he doesn't want to spend time thinking' about what comes next," he says, a contrast from the forever-young come-what-may Billy. As the commentators on the DVD Special Edition noted, there's a strange lack of incident involving Billy, a criminal we see committing no crime, except resisting arrest and one cattle robbery which goes awry. It's not exactly Kristofferson's fault he comes off as such a cipher; just that he doesn't do enough to fill the void with any kind of personality.Count me as one who prefers the 2005 Paul Seydor edit to the longer version released in 1988. Seydor's version lends a focus by tightening some rambling sections and restoring a useful episode involving Pat Garrett's wife. No doubt Peckinpah's 1973 release would have been definitive if he had been given enough time to craft it properly; the editing room was where his true genius emerged time and again. Yet one wonders how much blood and sweat it would have been worth given the dreary, inert material he seems to have shot here.The nice thing about "Pat Garrett", apart from the inspired visuals from John Coquillon, is the chance to revisit recognizable faces from Peckinpah's other films offering what would be for most of them a final bow. Some really shine, too, like R.G. Armstrong as a dangerously zealous deputy, Richard Bright as a surly member of the Kid's gang, and Donnie Fritts as another, more easy-going member. A rock musician in real life, Fritts could have taught Kristofferson and Dylan something about looking natural on screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very eager to see this classical Western for which I'd heard so many recommendations.To my big disappointment it turned out to be a completely boring movie about men trying to be as "masculine" as possible, i.e. drinking whiskey, looking fierce, dirty and cynical, using women, shooting each other for no reason and leading non-content conversations. Come on, that's not enough to turn a film into a legend! In the 70s all this might have gone through as an innovative look on the Western genre; today it just looks completely dated and offers a distinctive hippie interpretation of what life in the "good old West" meant, and which is all but convincing. James Coburn does what he is expected to do, the rest of the acting is quite poor, including Kris Kristofferson's.And then, there is Bob Dylan himself -- what the hell is his appearance good for other than simply promoting the film? His character is almost as embarrassing as Madonna in most of her movies.This film would have deserved a '4' but I give it a '6' for the slight but unlikely chance that I might have missed something important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like "Major Dundee", Sam Peckinpah's Western "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" was a film that the director and the studio were clashing with during production. The studio decided to hire an editor and chop the film up much to the director's dismay. For what reason, I cannot imagine. I am aware of the fact that Peckinpah's original version of the film is available, but I am yet to see it.I am, unfortunately, only familiar with the butchered, chopped-cut studio's cut.And to be blunt, it's not worth writing home about. It contains some of the fantastic elements that I know are Peckinpah's traits. Several scenes reminded me of the fantastic moments of his classic "The Wild Bunch" (1969), yet there were not as complete and weren't thorough enough to be considered classic moments in film history. The studio version is one word: boring. It is uneven, slow, dodgy, is missing a lot of characterization and plot development, and in short, is a disaster. Many of the major characters, such as the one played by Bob Dylan, are way out of place and seem to have no point in even being there. Same thing goes for the character played by Slim Pickens and his symbolism in the story, which falls short and just seems to waste our time. I can tell from looking at it that there is a symbolism of the character of Pat Garrett feeling like he is killing the youthful version of himself by hunting down Billy the Kid. That is obvious even through the butchered takes, and I can only wonder what a complete version would look like.I am positive the original version is many times better, for that is often the case with director's cuts. Especially when they refer to Sam Peckinpah. I hope to one day get a chance to see the director's cut and experience what I have been told is yet another Sam Peckinpah masterpiece. But as for the theatrical version, I advise audiences to steer clear away from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Billy the Kid film, with some GREAT acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring some old school actors like Coburn and Kristofferson, you can't go wrong. Both turn in the kind of performance people have come to expect of them. The story line is great, following the Billy the Kid legends fairly honestly, but taking some creative freedoms where they work best (and they do). Cinematography and atmosphere are wonderfully sinister. Also of note is a magnificent performance by Bob Dylan as a knife throwing quiet-guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good movie, but Peckinpah can do better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, Sam Peckinpah has the talent of a baroque artist. When he checks his temper, we have a sequence of masterpieces: "Major Dundee", "The Wild Bunch", "The Getaway". Otherwise, he is inclined to overdo, and his works present discontinuities of level. In "Pat Garret and Billy the Kid" we find some magnificent scenes. A justly celebrated one: the old marshall, wounded to death, sitting by the side of a river, and, close-by, his wife, a brave, tough woman, silently weeping. Action is masterly filmed: here Peckinpah is always unparalleled. Bob Dylan's soundtrack is outstanding. Peckinpah shapes his Billy the Kid as a cruel, treacherous murderer, as well as a nasty hooligan: most likely, the way the actual Billy was. Nonetheless, the director tries to stick him a sort of romantic aura: he seemingly prefers death either to live in a new world he doesn't recognize himself in, or to abandon his mates, or something like that. Unfortunately, the problem of giving likelihood to this side of Billy's personality is not solved in the movie. I don't want to blame Kristofferson's performance, but his Billy is so annoying that I find myself rooting for his fiends. A remarkable difference with the "Wild Bunch" outlaws, whose personalities we can understand and even sympathize with, ruthless killers as they are. Also James Coburn as Pat Garret is not wholly convincing. His perpetual grudge shows that he regrets to have sold himself and to be committed to kill his old friend. Yet we ask: after all, who compelled him to do that? Despite its defects, "Pat Garret and Billy the Kid" is a beautiful movie, a must-see for everybody fond of great cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Peckinpah Mood Piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis: It's 1881 in New Mexico, and the times they are a'changing. Pat Garrett, erstwhile travelling companion of the outlaw Billy the Kid has become a sheriff, tasked by cattle interests with ridding the territory of Billy. After Billy escapes, Pat assembles a posse and chases him through the territory, culminating in a final confrontation at Fort Sumner. Review This is a very slow moving mood piece from Sam Peckinpah.. I enjoyed every minute of it. A seven out of 10 on the IMDb rating and 15 points in my ranking system, placing it just outside of my top twenty all time, along with movies like "Hondo" and "Broken Arrow". Here are the positives: - Unlike more accessible movies like "The Getaway" or "The Wild Bunch", I think you have to be a true Peckinpah fan to like "Pat Garrett". I just love this guy's whole idiosyncratic, weird vibe, from the anti- authoritarianism, to the obsession with guns and violence, to the super macho outlaws/gangsters, to the alcoholism, to the seedy bars, to the Mexican whores, to the misogyny. For its purest expression, watch his semi-autobiographical "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia". What I like about Peckinpah is that he was a true original. For me, he's the opposite of Quentin Tarintino, whose work I find completely derivative. - This movie is commonly criticized as boring. I wasn't bored for a second. I was completely drawn into its stately, sentimental atmosphere. This was a good choice of story for this type of mood piece, because we know the beginning, middle and end of the plot before we buy a ticket. - A fabulous looking Western. The costumes are brilliant. You're not going to find a more grizzled collection of low life saddle tramps anywhere. For the opposite look, watch the laughably well groomed Alan Ladd in "Shane". . - The cinematography is gorgeous. This is quite an accomplishment considering little effort was made to film against stunning landscapes. I don't think simple sky, clouds, dirt and sagebrush has ever looked so good. - This may be the best role of James Coburn's career. - Like Duke, Peckinpah was a lifelong Mexico-phile, so his excellent use of Mexican characters and themes is not surprising. - This is probably the best original soundtrack in the history of Westerns. Besides the theme for "The Magnificent Seven", "Knockin' on Heavens Door" is the only song from a Western that has enjoyed an extended popular life outside of the movie. (I'm not counting the completely uncool "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head" from "Butch Cassidy"). - Usually in a strong buddy, or in this case "frenemy", movie, the co- lead relationship prevents the development of a strong supporting cast. Peckinpah solves this by bombarding us with a multitude of cameos by many veteran Western character actors like Jack Elam, Slim Pickens, Chill Wills, Katie Jurado etc. Very effective. Now here are the negatives: - It's obvious the stories are true that Peckinpah had this movie taken away from him and altered severely by a number of studio editors. We'll never know what the original film would have looked like, but we can assume it would have been longer and better. As it was released, the plot is too disjointed. - Peckinpah had an extremely disturbed relationship with women. This guy was in serious need of professional help. An effective romantic relationship would have fit this movie like a glove. - Many critics seem to have a problem with Bob Dylan. I thought he was fine. Peckinpah gave him a very appropriate role given his limited acting experience. - Another common criticism is that Kristofferson was too old to play Billy the Kid. This usually comes from fans who insist on historical accuracy. I don't get this. Guys like Jesse James and Wild Bill Hickock were wildly inflated media creations in their own time. At this point they are completely mythological characters and filmmakers have an artistic license to present them as they choose. Beside, "the Kid" as a nickname could easily have stuck to a guy who is now a little older. "Don't die, Blondie. don't die. I'll get you water. Don't move. Don't die until later".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great performance by Bob Dylan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bob Dylan, despite what some others have asserted is actually great in this movie. He provides the moral force and the charisma to the movie as well as some simple down home music. It is one of only two or three really good movies he has been in. Some, like Hearts of Fire, have been disastrous. Billy the Kid is an unconventional performance- only clichéd thinkers equate unconventional with bad. In this movie Dylan is great and he makes it a great movie. His turkey chase scene is really well acted and filmed. The scene of the dying man to the song Knocking on Heaven's Door is unpretentious but moving and the knife throwing scene is electric. Alias kneeling beside the dead man and checking the body is very original; nothing like that have I seen in any other western. Alias makes the other cowboys look gauche. That's why I think this is a great performance from Dylan. His is the only likable character in a veritable gallery of desperate rogues.He makes Brad Pitt look soul-less and charisma-less. In 50 years, when Pitt is forgotten, people will still watch this movie to see Dylan, because he is a genuine historical figure where Pitt's shallowness oozes out of him. In real life though I am sure Brad is a nice fellow. He just can't act. Dylan is a great actor because people don't know exactly when he is acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film for the first time shortly after it cam out at the cinema. To this day I am struck by the movie as a whole - the leads were great; the story was supplemented and made so moving by the way in which the music worked with the film. Dylan's line "to be hunted by the man that was your friend" says it all. Through out the movie the music, a lot of it just acoustic guitar, all of it Dylan, echos and sometimes, leads the emotional aspects of the piece. The direction of the action was typical, the story with great action, but at heart a story of the emotions between two who had been the closest of friends, but were now on opposite sides of the law...... but still the feelings remain.One of the best 5 films - for me.</fullReview>

The Director's Cut sucks and cut out the best part. Obviously, Peckinpah didn't know what he had. See the TV version, instead. I hope when it shows up on DVD, the scene is put back in.

		<shortDescription>Slow...dirty...and bloody.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie begins with a very cruel opening scene. For kicks, Billy the Kid, his friends and Pat Garrett are shooting the heads off chickens. Unfortunately, it appears as if the scene is 100% real. Now the blood and headless chickens didn't sicken me, but killing any animal for entertainment's sake seems sick--and is one of the few cases where I'd agree with the PETA folks. At least in other Sam Peckinhaph films where you see killing, it's all fake and it involves people who have a choice in the matter."Pat Garrett &amp; Billy the Kid" is a revisionist film. Instead of all the old clichés of westerns, it keeps a few and introduces some new ones. In some ways it appears more realistic than earlier westerns, but to a retired history teacher like me, it's still a real mess. First for the good. Most of the folks in this film DON'T wear cowboy hats, they are often pretty filthy and some of the killing is far from glorious--such as shooting your enemy in the back. You certainly didn't see this in Roy Rogers' films and it's nice to see SOME attempt at realism. Now for the bad. Although the film looks more like the real West, it promotes a stupid stereotype of the bandit as a hero. The real-life Billy the Kid was a pretty ugly guy (based on the one surviving picture of him) and a murderer. He was NOT a hero of the people who fought against the evil cattle barons--he was just a cheap hood. But, here in "Pat Garrett...", he's handsome Kris Kristofferson and he is a force of good in a West filled with evil. He murders, but the men are enemies of the people and rapists. Instead, the lawman Pat Garrett is the nasty bully--the creep given a gun and told to kill for corporate America. If you think about it, this is a western for the Occupy Wall Street folks...but not history teachers! Apart from all the inaccuracy, is it a good film? Maybe. It all depends on what you are looking for in a film. If you want the usual Peckinpah slow-motion violence with lots of unrealistic blood, swearing and occasional nudity, then you'll probably like the film very much. If this sort of stuff turns you off, then the film may be tough going--even with some nice performances. As for me, I found it all to be slow...very slow. And, since I'm not particularly a Peckinpah fan, I felt like it was a decent time-passer and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a Bob Dylan fan, the novelty of seeing Bob Dylan in the film, as well as seeing some very nicely photographed vistas put to Bob Dylan music is far more than enough to recommend seeing this for pure curiosity.But its also a pretty good western, with a real sense of fate, if a little meandering.Sam Peckinpah's triumph is making us feel the dirt and sand of the west more than anyone else. Although Leone invented the gritty western with Fistful of Dollars, Peckinpah eclipsed his use of dirt by far.So here we have outdoor photography, faded-looking film and dirt, sand and wind blowing through and covering everything - making it not exactly easy on the eyes, but a very visceral experience.3/5. Any Bob Dylan fan will want a permanant copy of this! Includes a very nice title song and the famous Knockin' on Heaven's Door, which Dylan wrote for the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bob Dylan in a western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skip it ? This is a filthy, shameless, porno western with more sex scenes than gunfights. James Coburn stars as Pat Garrett, and isn't half bad as a cowboy. But director Sam Peckinpah butchered this classic story by trying to push the envelope with nudity and violence every chance he gets. The only reason, and I mean the only reason, I would see this subpar western is to see Bob Dylan as Billy the Kid's knife-wielding side kick. Dylan isn't a good actor by any stretch of the imagination, but it's just such a strange choice for a role that it's worth a look. Dylan also does all the music in the movie. Consensus: Dylan should stick with what he does best. The music is great, albeit a little out of place for a western. 3 out of 5 action rating</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate Rock n Roll Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the 70's the most talked about western according to my dad, was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. After watching Wild Bunch, Once upon a time in the West and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, sundance kid was abosoulte crap, I hated that film with more passion than you'll ever believe, because it has nothing on these films, however some of these westerns were from the sixties, Pat Garret and Billy the Kid is the ultimate rock n roll western by far. It doesn't lack a single thing that I look for in films especially westerns, and with Bob Dylan's soundtrack and the man himself in the film where do you go wrong, if you want classic 70's westerns then watch this one, Soldier Blue, My name is Nobody, A Fistful of Dynamite, Outlaw Josey Wales, Hang em High and High Plains Drifter, not sundance kid or any John Wayne western because they are just as bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historically ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those "realistic" 70's movies that just creates a new myth to replace that of older films. Very few details of Peckinpah's story have anything to do with even the little we know about the real Billy the Kid. Why film directors can't come up with original stories, instead of screwing around with history, has always puzzled me. If Peckinpah's film had had anything truthful to say about life in the west or in general, the fictionalizing might have been worth it, but the film mainly has a great time showing lots of slow-motion blood, whitewashing Billy the Kid--who was a thug in the first degree, not to mention 21 years old at the time of his death--and giving women like Rita Coolidge thankless parts in which they have sex with the male characters, but have hardly any lines. (In Coolidge's case the part could also be construed as a racist stereotype of the "dark-skinned loose woman".) Buy the soundtrack, and skip the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the Wild Bunch, Straw Dogs, Ballad of Cable Hogue, and this stinker, I've come to the conclusion that Peckinpah must have spent his talent on the first of the four.Part of the appeal of Wild Bunch to me is the fact that it is a real, old fashioned, Saturday afternoon TV western. The blood, the editing, and a few half-glimpsed breasts are all that really separates the movie from its older cousins. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid takes the modernity and the breasts and runs with them (all to the accompaniment of 1970s pop music).I like Sam, and I wouldn't even bother to complain if there weren't so many unwarranted positive reviews of this movie. Nothing much really happens here. Billy and Pat wander around and that's about it. The only thing that (barely) held my attention was Dylan; I thought he had only a bit part, and I was happy to see him pop up throughout the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that has several versions . The version I saw was the 2005 cut which I'm led to believe isn't highly rated . Nevertheless I can't help thinking if any version is all that great a film . It could argued how ever that Peckinpah was messed around so much by Hollywood studios he'd actually stopped making narrative movies and - as has been suggested by Pauline Kael - had started making movies about his own experiences at the hands of the studio . Ironically the director's dislike for the studio system might have had a lot to do with the fact he wanted Bo Hopkins as the eponymous Kid while the studio wanted Kris Kristofferson and the studio won Certainly it contains all the hallmarks of a Peckinpah film . Real men who have an amoral outlook on life with their own twisted values .For example Billy only shoots people in the back if they deserved it. Rapid cross cutting editing . There's also the visual style of what Judy Grahn describes as " menstrual envy " which is where bleed buckets of blood , a sort of inversion of penis envy The film also contains the flaws of Peckinpah . His interest isn't so much narrative story telling , it's more to do with style and themes and he is undoubtedly an auteur . The problem is like say CROSS OF IRON there's no central plot and has an episodic feel . CROSS OF IRON however was an outstanding war film where as PAT GARRETT &amp; BILLY THE KID feels like an average addition to the anti-western sub genre . In fact the gentleman who loaned me his copy of the film considers it his favourite anti-western so I thanked him for his kindness but recommended THE CULPEPPER CATTLE CO as a much better film . I also recommend it to anyone reading this review</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch, Straw Dogs), before seeing this film I saw the famous duo of the title played by Emilio Esteves and Patrick Wayne in The Young Guns, I was looking forward to this 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book recommended film. Basically it is 1881 in New Mexico, Pat Garrett (James Coburn) has become a town sheriff, he was formerly the travelling companion of outlaw Billy The Kid (BAFTA nominated Kris Kristofferson), and now his duties are stopping the stealing of cattle. Specifically he wants to catch Billy, abandoning whatever personal experiences they went through together and sticking to the law and path of righteousness. Billy manages to escape any attempts at capture, so Pat arranges a posses to chase him through the territory and bring justice to the town, and after some get together moments and the individual character situations the action culminates in a final confrontation at Fort Summer. Also starring singer Bob Dylan as Alias, Jason Robards as Governor Wallace, Richard Jaeckel as Sheriff Kip McKinney, Katy Jurado as Mrs. Baker, Slim Pickens as Sheriff Baker, singer Rita Coolidge as Maria, Harry Dean Stanton as Luke, Charles Martin Smith as Bowdre, Bruce Dern as Deputy and Sam Peckinpah as Will. Coburn is great as the famous former criminal turned law abiding citizen and lawmaker, Kristofferson is also very good as the famous gunman at the frontier of the crimes, the story was a little tricky for me to understand at times, but I will be honest and say that I was mainly watching to see the blood in the various gun fights, and there was terrific music by Bob Dylan, including the song "Knockin' on Heaven's Door", which I recognised for being sampled by singer Gabrielle in her number one song "Rise", anyway, the acting was good, the action was good and the violence was good, it was a terrific western film. It was nominated the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Bob Dylan. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In his review of this movie below, Andrew Horsfield gives a wonderful synopsis of the time period of this Western and of the historical forces which were coming into play. Unfortunately, one has to bring this knowledge INTO the movie, for the film does very little to spell it out, or to make clear the differences between the two title characters. Ok, sure, they used to ride together but now are on opposite sides of the law. But why? What caused the split? Horsfield's essay understands why, and so I guess he was able to enjoy the movie. But if you are somewhat less than an Old West scholar, I predict that you will more likely be confused and bored by this rather aimless, ponderous tale.Film's only redeeming features are its richly burnished cinematography and the brooding and haunting score by Bob Dylan. Actually, for Dylan fans, his presence in the movie - as Alias - would be the other reason to see it (it certainly was mine). His "performance" here is enigmatic and can not exactly be called acting, but it is wryly humorous and wierdly compelling all the same.</fullReview>

Seriously people, this is probably, next to Heavens Gate, the worst western of all time. And the director's attempt at an existential journey does nothing but leave you laughing. That's the only response I have to this thing. The absolutely worst cast film I have ever seen. And even Coburn in his prime sleepwalks through this dog. And they even miscast two of the great character actors of all time, Chill Wills and Jack Elam, and it is painful to watch them struggle through lines and scenes that they have no desire to be in. Kristopherson is just awful-I can't describe it any better. But he does have the best line in the movie when he shoots a deputy with his own shotgun full of dimes and says "Keep the change Bob." OK, that was the highlight of the film. Now you know. If you buy this movie you are insane. If you watch this movie you will be forever regretful of the two hours that you could have spent working in the yard. 3/10 Just pathetic, and Peckinpah sucks-Wild Bunch included.</fullReview>
