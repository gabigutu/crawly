		<shortDescription>Oh Thank God...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember that feeling i had when watching the first Saw movie. At first i walked in with the notion from the trailer that it was going to be some lame "torture" movie... I then remember walking out afterwards going "OMG...OMG....OMG..." When i first heard they were making a second one, i was extremely happy. Then i walked out of Saw 2 feeling empty.. like i had just watched a lame cash in sequel. For whatever reason i kept coming back.. Premiere day... I'd be there to watch the next one. Saw 3 i left feeling way better then the 2nd one.. The 4th one i remember walking out going "Wtf.. what a lame new jigsaw..". The 5th one i had the distinct thought "Omg.. that was just a total filler movie and nothing was gained from it..." Six i didn't exactly have high hopes for...But Thank... GOD... Saw 6 is not only just a good sequel but its actual a great movie on its own. The moral dilemma William faces as part of "his" game throughout the movie... real powerful choices. The traps (as always..) gory as all hell.. but the emotion behind the decisions and ending of all the traps.. sends a shiver down my spine. And the ending twist AND scene... I wont spoil it but my GOD.. You thought agent Straham had a powerful will to live in that intro scene to 5, You ain't seen nothing yet.Mainly though.. The story.. One thing this chronicle of the series does nicely as well, is tie up SO many questions that have been still hanging from way back to even Saw 3 (with a couple of new ones added just for the next ones..). I found that even though i thought 4 and 5 were average on their own... After seeing this one, it amplified and made them.. i don't know.. make sense.Just like a jigsaw.. as each piece is layed down... the entire picture starts to make sense. Bring on Saw 7!!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jigsaw says "Vote Yes on Healthcare Reform"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saw" was never a franchise that was designed to last. The first film made a point of killing off every main character save one who was already dying of an inoperable brain tumor. But, when a movie grosses 100 times its budget filmmakers tend to find untapped wells of ingenuity. "Saw VI" tells a story that is almost certainly incomprehensible to those who have not seen the previous five films. The entire plot hinges on the reveal of an element first introduced in "Saw III" and details the rise of a character who made his debut as a glorified extra. The entire twist ending is predicated upon one's memory of a secondary character who is never even on screen during this feature except during a brief flashback. It's some straight up "Star Trek" level minutia. Because of this, a plot summary is useless. You either know what to expect, in which case it is best to see the movie completely cold, or you've already determined that you don't care. Suffice it to say, John "Jigsaw" Kramer and Amanda Young are still dead, (as they have been since part three) and Agent Hoffman is still on the loose, trying to teach more people to appreciate life. Then things get complicated."Saw" has always worked under a strange moral code, espousing a bizarre brand of carpe diem philosophy spoken by serial killer who seems to think that he is saving people by throwing them in pits of used needles or forcing them to cut off their feet. This philosophy has long been an albatross for the series because Jigsaw's ideas are, to put it bluntly, completely idiotic. The result of these tests would likely be a crippling case of post-traumatic stress disorder, not a moment of truth. "Saw VI" works hard to solve this problem. For the first time in series history Jigsaw is shown to be maybe the slightest bit mentally unsound. This is a small but important step as the series makes infinitely more sense and is far more chilling if Jigsaw is taken as a David Berkowitz type instead of some sort of blood and guts Buddha. Simultaneous to this, the filmmakers have finally created a cast of victims who might well deserve their fate. Thinking back, it's actually quite surprising that it took five sequels to get to a trap where loan sharks are forced to contend with Shylock's infamous demand of "A pound of Flesh". While many have anticipated a jump to the supernatural for several entries, few if any guessed that Saw would ever become a political story. You see, "Saw VI" is just as much about the current healthcare reform debate as it is about soap opera plot twists. In one scene Jigsaw literally says the words "Medical decisions should be made by Doctors and patients" before going on to equate HMO's with murderous thugs. And while the political polemic elements are perhaps a bit overcooked, they do imply a level of effort on the part of the filmmakers that goes beyond the call of duty. The social consciousness of Jason Voorhees' sixth outing began and ended with a happy face symbol made of blood.Longtime series editor Kevin Greutert moves to the director's chair for this entry and his experience with the franchise shines through. He has clearly been planning for this opportunity for quite some time, and he makes the most of it, combining the indie grunge of the original with the flashy scene transitions of the sequels all while expanding the color palette, steadying the ADHD afflicted cinematography and toning down the ultra-violence.. This is almost certainly the best looking part six the horror genre has ever seen. Keeping pace with the direction is a slick, fast, and occasionally inventive screenplay by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton, who handedly outdo their work on the previous two films.Everything that was wrong with the five previous films is still wrong here. The sets still look like those of a movie made for about a million dollars, the actors are mostly second rate and the logic is tenuous within a real world scenario. The dialogue is occasionally as cringe inducing as the gory set pieces and the script makes excessive use of expository tape recordings in place of legitimate character development. And yet, I had a damn good time. This film is easily the best since part two, and somehow actually made me want to see part seven. For those already invested in the series "Saw VI" is a Halloween treat. It's smarter than the previous three and it features some of the series most interesting traps. It even gives you a little something to talk about after the credits roll. Most will hate it sight unseen, but those who show up to watch, "Saw VI" is better than it has any right to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am going to say it up front. The Saw series is a guilty pleasure of mine. That being said the last couple have not really engaged me all that much. After this one though, consider me back in the fold. Longtime series editor turned first time director Kevin Greutert has recharged the series and injected something these films have lacked since the beginning: humor.Saw VI starts with a bang. You know right off the bat that this isn't the same dead serious almost somber type of Saw film you're used to. I'm going to give Greutert and company the benefit of the doubt here and assume that this is by design. You know when Jigsaw is putting people in traps for smoking too much that your tongue should be firmly planted in cheek. This film is also much more open and colorful than previous films. After the claustrophobic Saw V that seemed to take place in only three different rooms this is a welcome change of pace. Also the traps here are much more inventive than V and maybe even IV (nothing will best III in my mind for sheer over the top-ness). The amount of twists and surprises is also plentiful and really do help bring the game full circle. This is definitely not the transition film that the last one was and it really left me to wonder where exactly they can go from here. The twists and turns of the plot are not something I want to give away as its part of the fun but suffice to say if you've stuck with the series up until now you won't feel gipped as you walk out of the theater. The film follows Hoffman as he tries to stay one step ahead of the FBI while conducting a game involving John Kramer's insurance broker William who is put through a series of tests involving his co-workers. The film moves at a breakneck pace cutting back and forth between the two main plot threads while also throwing in the now famous Saw flashbacks to fill in the gaps of all the past movies. I was never bored and special mention has to be given to Greutert for really keeping this thing from getting bogged down in the procedural aspects that really plagued the last few films. This is balls to the wall entertainment and it delivers while also winking and nodding along the way. Saw also gets extremely topical here for the first time and the main thrust and theme of this film will hit home to anyone who even has a passing knowledge of current affairs in this country. The only negatives I can really point out in the film is some of the suspect acting but again this might be done on purpose through the director's eyes to inject some humor without resorting to having Jigsaw or Hoffman crack jokes Freddy Krueger style while they dispense moral justice. We haven't gotten there yet, maybe Saw X. The other problem I had was that some of the back story really pushed the suspension of disbelief but I guess I shouldn't nit-pick because that has been a problem as far back as Saw II and is needed to stretch out this far anyway. All in all this is easily the best Saw since the 2nd one and I am glad to see the series get back on track after the CSI elements of the last two films. This is Saw how I like it: down and dirty and over the top. Bring on Saw VII!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't really enjoy Saw V. I found it had too many flashbacks and the movie itself just felt like an excuse to make another Saw film.However, Saw VI was a huge improvement over the last. The story was more interesting and the twists and turns were quite intriguing. One little problem i have with this film is that they went way too overboard with the blood and gore in this one, but i suppose that nowadays, thats what the Saw films are all about, which is a shame, considering the first film started off as a psychological thriller.Apart from that, the film was quite enjoyable and there's definitely some little secrets that they will be able to use for more sequels. Bring on Saw VII i say!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAW finally redeems itself.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Coming back from the midnight viewing, I am seriously shocked. I remember this time last year writing a review for SAW V, and from first impressions, I enjoyed it. Digging deeper though after-wards, I realized how much was wrong. This time however, several friends came along, avid fans of disliking the newer installments. Well, I am happy to say, they finally did something right.The very first thing I noticed that was different was the pacing of the movie. The opening scene is a trap. I will not reveal who, or why for that matter, you pay good money to find out after all. Though after that, the movie takes a very different tone. While everyone probably is used to the nature of SAW not wasting any time, they took a different approach for the sixth installment. We begin to follow where SAW V left off, Hoffman emerging victorious, or so it may seem. And soon enough, the introduction of our newest test subject, William. It's hard to get into the character without spoiling anything, so if I seem vague, you know why. William is an insurance agent, the vice president of his company as a matter of fact. In that, he made a formula on how to determine who should be eligible for health insurance. Needless to say, John Kramer was a former associate of his.Jill, the ex-wife of the infamous Jigsaw Killer was also presented a box. The box plays a large role this time around and again, I will not spoil it. Her role in the grand scheme of things is further explained and finally understood. Everything between her past with John, her present with Hoffman, and if she truly is part of the scheme, or just another person wanting to escape it all.The story is nice refresher from the original pace and nicely executed. Acting this time around as well was great.My only complaint is how even though the ending will surprise you, there has been so much exposed through previous installments, you feel less than shocked. Those who remember previous SAW's will understand what I mean by shock. There is a lot answered this time around, near everything actually. Be it the letter from SAW III, Hoffman's true intentions, Jill's involvement, and Jigsaw's grand scheme, everything will be fully explained this time around. I highly recommenced this SAW, especially if you want to give it that one last chance to see if it can be saved. Personally, I find it redeeming and if they continue with refreshing courses such as this, SAW could go on forever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Game Finally Comes Full Circle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember walking out of Saw V last year, and I hate to say it...but I was pretty disappointed. The film just didn't deliver the goods. It's narrative and so called twist made the walk to my car a living hell, and I thought to myself: "They're going to mess up Saw VI". In my review for Saw V, I stated that the Saw blade was getting rusty and dull. It just wasn't the same as it used to be, and the shock factor that made the films so suspenseful was absolutely gone.Here I am a year later. After waiting for what seems to be decades, I finally got out of the midnight opening of Saw VI. It's difficult to give a sentence that accurately describes what I'm feeling right now, so I'll just say this: HOLY F***ING S**T!!! It seems as if the year-wait paid off, because Saw VI is easily the best of the 'second trilogy' in the Saw series.What makes Saw VI such a smarter film is it's ability to play off the strengths of its predecessors. The film knows its destination, so we get a much more solid story this time around. There has been a lot of build-up in the previous installments, and it's happened for a reason: The pay-off is in this one. It's really incredible how everything in the plot came together so perfectly. All of the events that have occurred thus far have demonstrated a "Domino Effect" -- every character in the series is relevant, and one character's actions can change the entire course of the story and lead to something else. Any questions brought up in the previous installments are cleared up in VI, so we finally get a solid conclusion (I really don't know what the hell they're going to do for Saw VII). When you look up the plot for Saw VI, it seems so simple: Special Agent Strahm is dead, and Detective Hoffman has emerged as the unchallenged successor to Jigsaw's legacy. However, when the FBI draws closer to Hoffman, he is forced to set a game into motion, and Jigsaw's grand scheme is finally understood.Trust me, there's a lot more going on in this film than this. But one thing's for sure: Jigsaw's grand scheme is finally understood, and that's what mattered most. All of the pieces of the puzzle come together, and you remain on the edge of your seat because you have no idea what's going to happen to these characters. The plot takes dramatic twists and turns that will have your jaw hit the floor. If you're like me and you're a fan of these films because of the stories, then Saw VI will go beyond your expectations.As for the hard-core Saw fans who are in it for the traps, don't worry: Saw VI is without a doubt the most gruesome of them all. They really raised the bar with this one in terms of the amount of violence shown on the screen. I'm amazed the MPAA didn't give this film an NC-17 rating, because the traps (along with the cinematography) really bring out the gore. The film received an 'X' rating in Spain though, so I'll let you imagine how violent this one is.Overall, Saw VI was incredibly well done. The story and pacing was perfect. The acting from the main cast (Tobin Bell, Betsy Russell, Costas Mandylor, Shawnee Smith, and Peter Outerbridge) was great. The traps were disturbing as hell. And, most importantly: a hard-core Saw fan left the theater with a smile on his face. Saw VI Director Kevin Greutert (editor of the first five installments) really did an astounding job, and while I don't like the fact the series is continuing next year, I hope he's involved with the future installments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen a lot of negativity about the Saw series, with many people saying it should end and that each film is worse than the last. I, however, find this not to be true, and have always been a fan. To me, each film that comes out is an improvement on the last, and this latest installment did not disappoint me.The deaths are gore- filled, the story full of revelations and twists. The traps are still amazingly sadistic, and somehow the writers are able to constantly give us new insight into situations we thought we already had figured out. Everything fits in beautifully in the Saw universe,and just when you think they can't possibly explain any more, they surprise us yet again. I won't give away any spoilers, but suffice it to say the ending had me on the edge of my seat. I always cringe when the credits roll- I want more! more! more!...especially with this one. I daresay this surpasses Saw V by miles. I'm left breathless, hating the critics, and wondering what will come next, waiting for yet dreading the end of the series. This is a big thing, considering I'm usually of the mindset that sequels should never pass 3- if that. As far as I'm concerned, they can just keep making Saw, as I'll always be there, watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally, the Saw series has regained some of it's previous credibility. Saw VI proved to be a very bloody, but clever mainstream romp.There were a couple of great twists and turns, the gore was jacked up to a fantastic level of brutal extremity (easily beating the rather tame 5th installment), and most importantly, I, plus everyone in the theatre had a ball with it.As well as being a valid continuation of the 'Saw' story, it worked well as a standalone film. The main twist actually had nothing do to with the previous movies... but don't get me wrong, you'll get plenty of answers for questions left open from the other films at the same time.As you'd expect, the acting and production values weren't to flash, but the good screenplay and balls-out sadistic torture made this a vast improvement over the last couple of sequels. Apart from the first, I'm happy to say this is definitely one of my favorites from the series. 7.5/10.Check it out. I found it to be a pleasant surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 6 - What we have been waiting for!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the first showing at my local movie complex and let me say it was outstanding. Since Saw 3 I have always walked out the movie feeling satisfied but at the same time let down, let me tell you, this is not the case with Saw 6.The story is compelling, original and really pulls you in for the whole ride. The traps are great, the gore is at the right level (not in your face, but enough to make anyone look away at times) and the writing and acting was the best I have since in a Saw film in a very long time. This is everything we wanted Saw 5 to be and more.We were all let down by Saw 5 and believe me as a huge fan of the Saw series I was nervous going to see this, I knew if they did not pull it off the series would be as good as dead. However they did pull it off and how! I wont spoil anything but this film is a must see, definitely one of the best Saw's and an ending which will leave you satisfied. The twists don't match up to saw 1 or 2 but I don't think thats possible considering how much information and mini twists have been revealed since then.Go and see this film! You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 6 Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly can say the Saw VI has restored my faith back into the series. I remember leaving the theater after Saw V in utter disappointment. I thought V was terrible, and the twist was...well, non existent. As far as VI goes, there are SEVERAL twists and turns, and its exciting to see the spirit of the first trilogy back in the last film of the second trilogy.The acting was pretty good except for a few parts, (although I still maintain that Betsy Russell can't act...sorry) and the main character was more fleshed out than most of the other players from past films...Which brings me to a new point..I think this was the most mature saw film since the first one...This one, with the exception of opening with a gruesome trap, spent more time with the characters, and allowed them time to develop better than in the previous installments. I really hope they decide to have Kevin Gretuert (sP) do Saw VII, instead of Hackl (no offense). I don't know if it was Hackl's fault or the screenwriter's for Saw V being such a weak entry, but all I know is Gretuert knows what he's doing, and is a much more decisive and talented director. I hope he does more than Saw films in the future! The only thing that disappointed me was no mentioning of the events (with the exception of Hoffman as the new Jigsaw, and Strahm's death) from Saw V...For instance, what was the point of the people in the traps in V? I know that was more than likely intentional to keep the suspense going for future sequels, but DAMNIT, I want to know what happened to Julie Benz's character, and why that game was so important.Overall, I give saw 9.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6 - not the right number next to a movie title. There are exceptions of course, but the Saw series is not it. In the sixth part it shows on all fronts. While watching the movie I found myself comparing it to the episode of ordinary TV show. Flashbacks from previous episodes, cheap effects (by the way worse than some of the TV series), weak performance by actors and the plot line that no longer can surprise you. All that brings down the movie value to almost a bare minimum, saving that last star or two for the next Saw movie in 2010. Next year's Halloween again. Say...commerce? Speaking of which, the future is pretty grim for the Jigsaw according to the interest that has been shown to the Saw 6. The message is clear: cow is dry and the glue factory awaits. There's only Lionsgate left to understand this simple truth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Merely an exercise in torture porn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm quite dubious of some of the very enthusiastic 10/10 reviews this title has received? Something is not quite right there. I've seen the rest of the franchise - Saw I was excellent, goes without saying, a very clever and enjoyable scary movie with something to say about society. The rest in the sequence paled with varying degrees, but this - Saw VI - is quite horrendous for all the wrong reasons. It plays out like a soap opera - multiple ridiculous and convenient story threads, wooden acting, lingering reaction close ups, lazy art direction, poor lighting, never ending catch-up montage. But the biggest horror movie sin committed was that it started at the gore and worked backwards. As we all know, the idea of 'Saw' is that the torture the victims endured was inspired by the wrongs they had done to themselves and others, and the consequences were somehow just rewards, with the audience left to ponder a moral dilemma. That's now gone. We are left with - How can we kill off as many characters as possible, make it as gross as possible, then make the story fit around it? I suppose for some that wouldn't be too bad of a movie, but even the gore is a bit below par, and the setups are a bit ridiculous. In my opinion, this franchise has (unsurprisingly) become a lazy, silly, money-spinner with very little to offer. I would only recommend seeing this if you have seen the rest and want to see what happens, but perhaps wait until it's out to rent before wasting too much of your cash on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fresh injection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was an uncommonly warm autumn day in London on the afternoon of Friday 23rd of October 2009: the sun was out, the birds were tweeting, and in screen 3 of the Cineworld Fulham Road, a young woman was graphically hacking off her own arm to save her head from being mashed in by a skull-cracking harness.The gulf between director James Wan's first Saw film, and where we've ended up, is immense. Over the past five years, a tricksy, critically acclaimed crime thriller has morphed into a sprawling daytime soap with added gloop; a guaranteed annual cash cow for bargain-basement distributors Lionsgate, who cattily insist that film critics shell out for their own screenings. Oddly, these films don't tend to pick up very good reviews.The biggest surprise, then, is that Saw VI isn't totally terrible. I mean, it's still a load of number 2's, obviously. Just not enough to block the toilet. This has been achieved in one very simple stroke. Understanding that some of the best horror films utilise contemporary events to add a powerful frisson of credibility, director and former series editor Kevin Greutert has decided to lend the hermitically-sealed franchise some immediate, and wonderfully mischievous relevancy.Saw's gamers have never exactly been sympathetic (that's why they've been forced to crawl though those fiendish, flesh-flaying traps in the first place). But for Saw IV, the filmmakers have made them universal objects of scorn and loathing from the outset; nobody's going to mourn these guys. For this time round, the hapless game players-cum-victims are insurance executives and lenders. Hooray! Thus, by ensuring its executions are almost cheerfully retributive, and by jettisoning the tedious police procedurals that have recently capsized the series, this one gives the audience more of what it really wants: lowlifes being dispatched in ingeniously sick and over-the-top ways, such as being forced to hack out their own body fat, or being injected with hydrofluoric acid; melted from the inside out.Even better, it sets them on each other: after health insurance man William (Peter Outerbridge) turns the cancer-ridden John Kramer / Jigsaw's coverage down, he's abducted and forced to kill off his fellow Noughties whipping-boys and girls in a mockery of the mathematical system he uses to determine who's paid out and who isn't. "In a sense, you get to choose who lives and who dies..." muses an appalled John / Jiggy (Tobin Bell) in flashback, making the lender = 'monster' analogy explicit.The best and funniest scene sees a bunch of William's fellow insurers strapped around a revolving playground carousel. William must shoot them in turn to save his own skin - though two are allowed to live. What follows is essentially satire, as the horrid little mercenaries alternately plead with him to spare their lives, while verbally ripping each other to shreds, accusing one another of being worthless liars.Satire suits Saw. It's not like we're asking for yet another sequel exactly (and Saw VII ? in 3D! - is already in the works, in any case), but this definitely hints at some interesting new directions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rarely listen to my own advice when I am in Vegas and generally I lose because of it. (Side note: I am in Vegas right now, on the 29th floor of the Palazzo and I didn't listen to my own wise gambling advice. I've been broke for 2 days now.)Well, the same comes to movies. I keep stating, writing and promising to give up on bad films/series and especially stop supporting them (financially, that is,) so Hollywood finally gets back on track with better made films. (The more people see trash like 2012, for example, the more cr*p we'll be subjected to.)That all being said, surprisingly enough, 'Saw VI' was better than the previous entry. Of course, that's not saying much. This latest installment was trash, of course, with horrid acting, a zillion flashbacks, and as a series trend, flashbacks within flashbacks and a million crossovers from previous chapters. When I finished watching this, knowing this is probably geared towards the young male audience, I laughed thinking they've been duped into watching a soap opera.Yep, the Saw series is now a soap opera, albeit an extremely gory one ? probably what Dark Shadows wanted to be, but in no way could attempt decades ago. I haven't even seen too many soaps in my time to know the transition scenes from one flashback or plot twist to the next is the exact techniques they use in the daytime dramas. They even have (spoiler) the blond be the back-stabbing b*tch in one of probably 37 subplots.Though it's old-school now (by part VI,) they bring back Jigsaw again, through, yep you guessed it, more flashbacks and videos he made prior to death. (Side Note: I guess by using this method, they think they're clever on spinning the old Friday the 13th or Halloween psycho "rebirths" in their opening segments, but in reality, it's just stale by now.)Does this guy have more recorded videos than Blockbuster? Does this guy have about $1 billion dollars and enough real estate to pull off about 16 dozen "traps"? I'm guessing they "explain" everything, but you begin to wonder by now if this guy owned half the city and no one ever wondered why he was always converting old, disgusting warehouses into death traps.It's really irrelevant to describe the plot this time, but here goes: the "new" ideas they came up with: two companies, one financial, one insurance apparently p*ssed off Jigsaw when he was alive and from the grave, Jigsaw uses his newest accomplice (one of many in the series) to set the traps of the employees in motion. Only this time a lot of people need to decide on who lives and who dies. This is a change from the original traps where people only had their own fate to worry about.While the previous two Saw movies toned down the gore, mercifully (what originally made the movies good in the beginning was them focusing on the story over gore,) again, they stepped it back up again, almost from minute one. Now, Saw III still is the leader in gore in the series, and the #1 goriest movie I have ever seen, this one breaks in the top 5. Sincerely, I've got to listen to myself and avoid the next two in the franchise, supposedly the final two.Honestly, by this point, I just don't care how the series pans out. I've said this before: they should've ended with #3 with the death of Jigsaw. What possible conclusion could there be? Jigsaw never died, it was his slightly less evil twin? It was all a dream but when Jigsaw wakes up he smiles indicating the series is getting a reboot? Or best yet, no one truly died, a la April Fool's Day, and everyone turns to the audience, says "Thank you all for coming, and remember to appreciate life!" while holding hands and bowing?I see the torture p*rn movies are finally dying out (while the reboots of the 1980/70s slashers increase) and hopefully, this series will as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. Best Saw yet, but not by much!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost everyone looks for a 6th sequel(if there is one) to flop miserably, but this sequel defied all odds. In order to appreciate the full value of Saw 6 you must have followed and payed attention to all previous Saws. Saw 6 answers lots of questions from previous Saws in style and Saw 6 has an awesome story on its own. Hoffman becomes an incredible character, as he was shaky in both Saw 4 and in Saw 5. Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) gives a performance Oscar worthy. Some of the acting was poor, but for the most part a lot better than other Saw films. The Traps were good and there was a lot of suspense while they were taking place. The Traps also took time and creativity to come up with and were unlike any other traps in previous films, which was really hard to do!(except in the end trap which reverts to Saw 1!!). Go see Saw 6, you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great series goes in to the crapper because someone decided to inject their own politics and their own misinformed view of capitalism. Now that aggressive loan officers and obnoxious insurance agents are capital criminals, we all have to fear Jigsaw. Sad!!!!Also, couldn't the casting agents have done a better job and found actors that didn't look exactly he same. It is hard to follow who is who sometimes. Even in the fight between the good guy FBI agent, and the bad guy cop, they look so much the same that you wonder, "now which guy is in the box?". And, the time line juggling has always been out of control. Certainly a movie that you can't watch without paying full attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw VI - let the games end.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst i was looking forward to the latest edition of the Saw vest, i was left feeling disappointed and unfulfilled. I wondered why i even looked forward to viewing this film.Being an avid 70's horror fan, when Saw first came to our screens in 2004, it was like a breath of fresh air to the horror genre. It was original, tantalising and quite frankly clever. However, the more the games continue, the more the concept of Jigsaw and Saw becomes lost.There are some minor highlights in the narrative eg. death by injections of acid. Nevertheless, there is less focus on the gore content and more focus on flashbacks from the previous films. Although this could be seen as genius film-making, with all Saw films being integrated into one another, i feel that the producers are running out of ideas to continue and are clutching onto what was seen previously. Nevermind the amount of continuity errors that have come to light because of the flashbacks. To be quite frank, there are only so many tests that can be set up beyond Jigsaw's grave, (Be it his will or not)after-all he did die at the end of the third edition.Perhaps this time around, it should be GAME OVER!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hugely disappointing, this franchise needs to stop now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After rather disappointing submissions for #4 and #5, I was hoping for a new injection of life and creativity for #6. Alas, what a bitter disappointment this was, just a series of tortures, that's all, and quite dull at that imho. I'm afraid it is now time, because the creative minds have run of of ideas and we're being subjected to the law of diminishing returns, to stop this franchise. Even the traps and tortures are repeats, much of the "sameness", especially with head grabbers. Let's see some NEW ideas in the horror genre. Jigsaw is dead, so let's now put this franchise to sleep! The first remains easily the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first came into Saw VI with fairly low expectations. By the fifth one, I was thinking "how many more can they really do?" The traps were getting old, there wasn't as much fear factor, and it was more gore than plot. At one point you're thinking 'why'? But, in true Saw style, they leave just enough to keep it going and you guessing. Saw VI was absolutely amazing! The traps are new and brilliantly sick and twisted (who thinks up this stuff?) It's especially good because it takes the whole health care issue front and center in the plot. It's also a great look at assumptions and judgments. The questions are finally answered (like what was in Jill's box and the letter that upset Amanda) and the twist at the end leaves you jaw-dropped OMG and wanting more. Well done!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The body of Agent Strahm is completely smashed and destroyed and Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) frames him. Strahm is accused of being Jigsaw's apprentice and the FBI chases him. Dan Erickson (Mark Rolston) calls Hoffman and he leans that Agent Lindsey Perez (Athena Karkanis) has not died. When Dan finds a tape with the voice of the killer, he invites Hoffman and Perez to go with him to the laboratory to see the progress with the identification of the real voice.John's widow Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) receives a box from his lawyer with six envelops with instructions and she gives the first five to Hoffman. The unethical CEO of the Umbrella Health, William Easton (Peter Outerbridge), and his team are abducted and William is forced to play a game and choose who will live or die to save his family and him. "Saw VI" is another violent film of torture with the legacy of Jigsaw. However, it is better developed than the previous story, and has a surprising conclusion. As I have mentioned before, I really do not like this franchise, but at least this time the plot works. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): "Jogos Mortais VI" ("Mortal Games VI")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I'll admit that this was indeed better than Saw V, I still did not like this movie at all. Ever since Saw IV, the series has become a total "Let's-try-to-come-up-with-as-many-gory-deaths-as-possible" game. I'm betting that a lot of the positive reviewers are either:A)Easily pleased B)People who have not seen the movie and are giving it good reviews because they love the Saw movies C)A.D.D. teenagers who have not seen very many moviesHere, we've got Kevin Greutert in the director's chair. Now direction wise, he does a much better job than David HACKl. (I capitalized the first four letters for a reason- that's what HACKl is when it comes to directing). That said, this movie still sucked. It suffers from the same issues as Saw V- Too many flashbacks, rushed pacing, too many ideas with not enough time to pay attention to one specific detail.However, where this is an improvement over Saw V is in many things. Tobin always delivers as Jigsaw and here he gives his best performance as Jigsaw. Jill is great too. I liked the overall look of the movie, and the gore was realistic looking too- not the CG crap like in Saw IV and V. That is unfortunately where it stops. None of the traps are creative at all (the janitor trap? WTF). The movie was 75% flashbacks, which bored the hell out of me. The acting was bad as usual- but then again, with the exception of Jigsaw,when has the acting ever been good in a Saw movie. And that ending.Total bullshit! The second it was over, I thought "What the hell was that????".In short, will I see Saw VII? Yes, but only because I just wanna see how the series will end up. It's impossible for one to think this would be a Freddy/Jason series, but it has turned out that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to decide what's more surprising here. The fact that the Saw franchise has found the legs for so many sequels or the fact that the sixth entry in the series (coming, as it does, after the worst of the series to date) turns out to be one of the very best and almost on a par with the original.Fans already know what to expect - a twisted killer setting some grisly, appropriate traps for his/her victims and a final reel packed with revelations, blood and payoffs.What they probably didn't expect was an outing quite as good as this one. Not only does Saw VI, like the third instalment of the series, make you appreciate some little touches in the previous movies but it also does what no other Saw movie has so far managed to do and leave you wanting the next instalment ASAP. As the credits rolled I honestly found myself thinking, for the first time in this franchise, that I can't wait for the next movie and more resolution for certain characters.A lot of familiar faces show up (though I will try not to mention anyone in particular and to keep things spoiler-free), the script is clever in it's way of moving the movie along and also weaving throughout it the strands of the overarching storyline, and the acting is actually an improvement on past entries too, with Peter Outerbridge standing out thanks to what he's put through as people have their eyes opened.Kevin Greutert may thank his lucky stars that he had the benefit of working from a much better script than some of the previous directors but he should also not detract from his own ability to handle things capably and deliver the gory goods while also getting the whole franchise back on an even keel.A surprisingly good horror movie and a startlingly good Saw sequel. I just hope the next one continues to buck the laziness that had set in before this one.See this if you like: Saw, Saw II, Saw III.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can I say? Yes it may be another sequel to the now infamous franchise, but it is a great sequel. I saw this film back on opening weekend in October of last year, and I watched it again recently. I really did enjoy this film a lot more than its predecessor. The plot is better than the last film, it carries well, and it doesn't stray away from the formulas that the past few films have upheld. The plot is a little difficult to follow at first, but once you get into it, you will understand it pretty easily. The traps in this one are refreshing a in genius compared Saw V traps. To be honest, I feel that V was lacking in a lot of areas and it doesn't really seem to make a lot of sense. The ending of this one really does come together well and you understand further the master plan of Jigsaw. I know people are saying that there is a political undertone to this film, but I don't believe it's true. I must heed a warning, this film from start to finish is a lot more brutal than the last movie, but if you can stomach some gore, then you will be able to enjoy this film.</fullReview>

And it's charming to see Jigsaw take on our crappy health care system and provide reform in the best way. The writers have once again found a way to make Tobin Bell's character make reappearances via flashback still believable in a sort of way.Again to touch back on the health care "reform" touched upon in this film, I think it's justice. These companies are run by people who view human life with a dollar sign and that's it. Even though this is the fifth sequel it's almost as good as the original film!

		<shortDescription>"Saw VI" - So that's what a crushed body looks like...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Saw VI," there will be blood... lots of blood. Yes, Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is back in the latest "Saw" entry, despite us seeing his demise way back in "Saw III" (2006), but his legacy continues in this series that does not seem to have a logical end in sight. Really. The "Saw" franchise is one movie franchise that can literally just go on and on without the slightest hint of some movie exec getting the brilliant idea to pull the plug. Each new film fills in the gaps of the last film while continuing on with a new story; that is really the biggest plus about this film series, rather than falling into the trap of just repeating the same story over and over again.For those unacquainted with Jigsaw's legacy, he is a serial killer who places his victims into highly sophisticated tricks &amp; traps designed to teach them the meaning of life, because that is the reward for escaping intact, or alive but horribly mutilated: life. (Who said horror movies could no longer have a philosophical bent?) Technically, of course, Jigsaw is not a serial killer because he's never actually killed anyone; his victims usually end up killing themselves trying to escape his elaborate systems of tricks &amp; traps. And of course if they fail their "test," then there will be one hell of a mess to clean up.Since the original Jigsaw is long dead, taking his place was Agent Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), a vengeful F.B.I. who designed a trick &amp; trap of his own to exact vengeance upon the man responsible for killing his sister, thus becoming Jigsaw's apprentice. Since taking care of the nosy colleague at the Bureau who was on to his trail at the end of the last film, Agent Hoffman is now the unchallenged successor to Jigsaw's legacy. But a new team of F.B.I. agents are hot on his trail, and he must find a way to deal with them. At the same time, Agent Hoffman has his hands full with a new tricks &amp; traps setup involving a greedy insurance executive who must navigate his way through a series of "tests" designed to, of course, teach him the meaning of life. And so let the games begin..."Saw VI" is an impressive new entry. It was certainly better than the last film that came out in 2008; it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. "Saw VI" firmly establishes itself as an improvement in a series that seemed to be losing its steam, despite its apparent ability to never die. I guess it's to the credit of director Kevin Greutert and screenwriters Patrickt Melton &amp; Marcus Dunstan to fill his movie with gore and more gore delight, and an ending that promises yet another sequel later on this year.Did I mention that this movie was hella-gory (perhaps even more so in the unrated director's cut)? I have to say that this is probably the goriest "Saw" film to date, with severed limbs, disembowelment, and acid-injecting syringes aplenty. This is also the first movie in the series since "Saw" (2004) to really wear its morality on its sleeve: the greedy insurance executive comes to be representative of all greedy insurance executives (greedy insurance execs, look out!) when he is forced to come face-to-face with his moral repugnance in the deciding of who lives and who dies, and the lives of those his decisions will surely ruin, least of which is his own."Saw VI" proves that the human body is a remarkable piece of machinery, all right, able to withstand the greatest amount of destruction and still find a way to heal itself. Not after Jigsaw gets through with you...7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's play some more!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no horror franchise quite like the Saw movies: whereas the likes of Halloween, Friday 13th and Hellraiser let a few years pass between installments (usually because the original writer/director has little, if any, involvement), James Wan's 2004 hit has spawned one follow-up every year, with a new one already behind the corner despite dips in quality and the distinct feeling that the writers have run out of ideas (case in point: the main attraction of the upcoming Saw VII is that it will be shot in 3D). Expectations were particularly low following the disappointing Saw V, but then came a surprise: as preposterous as it may sound, Saw VI is in fact the best of the sequels.You know the drill by now: although he died three installments ago, John "Jigsaw" Kramer (Tobin Bell, still a creepy presence in the convenient flashbacks) isn't finished with certain people he wants to test, and so a new deadly game is set in motion. This time, the main victim works in health insurance, and it's his questionable method for choosing clients (basically, anyone with short life expectancy is ignored) that will be tested. In the meantime, the killer's apprentice, Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor), must keep covering his tracks, having successfully eliminated (and framed) Peter Strahm (Scott Patterson). Also, Jigsaw's widow Jill (Betsy Russell) must deal with the late psychopath's last wishes...This time, the directorial job has been handed to the franchise's editor, Kevin Greutert, who uses his skills in the best way possible when it comes to creating a claustrophobic, tense atmosphere, something that was severely absent (along with a healthy dose of gore for genre fans) in the previous chapter. Another improved aspect is the writing: even if the announcement of a seventh entry sort of took away credibility from the tag-line "In the end, all the pieces will come together", Saw VI does act as a perfect closure for the series, tying up all the loose ends, granting every character (including the deceased Amanda) a moment in the spotlight and delivering two final twists that are, for once, genuinely surprising and refreshingly nasty.But that's not the only reason this installment is worth seeing: while previous entries have been analyzed because of Jigsaw's use of torture as a way to understand people, this episode follows the blueprint of Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell by sticking it to people whose jobs aren't very popular in the US nowadays: the first two victims, seen in the pre-credits sequence, are loan-sharks (cue a neat Shakespeare reference), and the main target, as said earlier, works in health insurance. This isn't just torture porn (though there is plenty of it), it's also a genre spin on Michael Moore's work.Smarter-than-usual writing, interesting social commentary, enough blood to keep gore-hounds happy: Saw VI is the ideal conclusion of the series, having the right elements to satisfy almost everyone. Of course, one question remains to be answered: aside from the 3D, will there be any real reason to watch Saw VII?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I'm a year late in reviewing this one, but having seen it in the theatre twice, and many more times than that on computers and DVD, my verdict on this one is that it has one of the most intellectual plot lines in the whole series.I think as it is one of the most grotesque ones (if not THE most grotesque, and yes, already watched the 7th installment for clarification) as well as one of the most clever. The characters introduced in Saw IV and beyond take it a few steps further and unravel some of the most interesting flashbacks/surprises that couldn't disappoint fans that still followed the installments past the third one. Aside from it's further explanation of characters like Detective Hoffman and Jigsaw's wife, Jill Tuck, the 6th one offers a cast of new characters that are very relevant to the whole series and don't just seem like mere fillers.The traps are probably more graphic in this one than any of the others, but it still has the sort of mysterious undertones that the first one offered, making the gore not just "Friday the 13th" sort-of entertainment, but violence that is still placed upon the real morally corrupt (unjust health insurance folks, bankers, etc.) and not just teenagers having ravenous drunk sex in a cabin on Camp Crystal Lake...It might be intimidating to those unfamiliar or sick of the first five installments, but I think it is more accessible than some of the prior ones as it is truly nauseating at times and does kind of leave you at the edge of your seat, guessing what will happen next...9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the viewing of Saw VI, you get a sense that the film is very political in nature and an attack on the American Insurance Industry. The reason I say this is because the main storyline is about an insurance agent who destroys the lives of those he touches, his employees and his clients. The reason that Jigsaw attacks this insurance agent is because of his new system of insuring his clients and choosing which ones "live and die", which ironically is the way Jigsaw chooses his victims.The film not only satirizes the American Insurance Industry, it gives a whole new meaning and view of the American Insurance Industry as a whole. Some of the material used for the film though about insurance and how it works makes less sense after Barack Obama passed his health-care bill. Much of the info is for now, obsolete, again, ironically like the insurance companies will soon be.Saw VI was a better installment than some of its predecessors, except for Saw V, which is equal in story and cast, but Saw VI was so far the most gory of the series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of the replies here haven't even touched the storyline regarding people getting screwed over by the insurance industry in the states. I gave the movie a 7 for the simple fact it brings to light in a vivid way a subject that should be very close to home for many people who live in the states and have to deal with health insurance companies and their policies, loopholes, and shady insurance agents. Not all insurance agents are shady - I used to be one for almost 10 years and it was my job to help people select the lessor of the evils out there and I told them that up front. Anyway, any person involved in the industry should be made to watch this movie if not for the mere fact it hopefully could wake some of the crooked people up. Now, the movie from a story-telling point of view is average, but watchable. If you are just out to see another movie with people getting killed in a cruel and unusual way as opposed to looking for some meat in the storyline (pun intended?) then I'm sure many were disappointed. Maybe watch it again when it comes out on DVD as a rental and think about the millions of people every year getting messed over by an insurance company that is trying to take in only healthy people so they can turn a profit as opposed to helping people who need it.</fullReview>

Also I liked how it started off quickly with the opening scene not even giving you a chance to sit back and relax. The movie seemed to go by fast because there were no dull moments in the entire thing, the suspense and action just continued throughout the entire movie, which made it very good. Some have said the Saw series started off good with the original and has gone downhill ever since, I agree with that until now. This movie was either just as good as the original if not better. This is a must see in my opinion, if you don't see it your missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw back on top.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always get excited for each new Saw movie... every year since the first even though I wasn't old enough to see them until the 5th one. The 5th one knocked my confidence in the series i thought it was dead and couldn't be picked up, I will admit I was wrong. The film begins very promising even though its extremely gory but what do you expect from saw. This film is a lot more easy to follow as its not jumping back and forward as much as the 5th. It flows well. The characters are met, the main character is captured and thrust into his game. There is a bit of jumping back and forward but this is where its great... they finally reveal a lot of the stories minor but annoying stories, this makes this film great because you finally realise that these films were going to be made and they had a point. The ending was good even if a bit predictable. The only bad point i would pick is why make a 7th i don't understand where else the series can go. The creativity of the traps seem to get worse with every film and when you see the ending of 6 you will probably also be like why another one just leave it alone now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Piece of the Puzzle Yet!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jigsaw's 6th puzzle piece was awesome and one of the best in the Saw franchise! It was a lot better than the previous film. There are a bunch of new and terrifying traps and twists. They tie up a lot of loose ends like what was in Jill's box, what Amanda's letter from Hoffman was about, and much more. Tobin Bell does another amazing job as Jigsaw who's legacy continues long after his death. Hoffman sets up a new game for William Easton, an executive at a health insurance company. He decides who to cover based strictly on probabilities of health or illness, which turned down Jigsaw when he had cancer. William must make impossible decisions such as who should live and die in the Carousel Trap, and who is more worthy of living. The game comes full circle! I highly recommend SAW VI!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The end of the second trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a SAW fan since the second instalment. All that I can say is that I was amazed by this one ! In my country (Romania), only the third instalment had a world premiere. The fourth appeared after 6 months and the fifth after three and a half months. But today I was amazed... I saw SAW VI before the Americans, along the australians, greeks and new zeelanders. Kevin Greutert directed this movie. In his special way. He did the cuts on every SAW movie and I think he helped a lot on this one. The movie is bloodier than the first 5 movies. Even from the first scene (the usual game before the "SAW x" screen). You will find a lot of answers here. I was watching the boards here. Some of you, guys, were right. You'll find answers on questions from SAW 3 and SAW 5, and also from the hole series (there is a question remaining about the medical care... and no, this don't have anything in common with Dr. Gordon - although he appears in a discussion only named by someone). By the way... all the critics from the board must ask appologies from the SAW fans... the real fans... As in SAW 5 we have two twists. Both at the end... There is a fine remake of the "Hello Zep" Theme by Charles Clouser at the beginning of the first twist and the unforgettable "Hello Zep" at the end (God, I love this song !!!). Some of you will say that the ending was to be expected. I tell you that it isn't so, but 50%. The last image before de credits roll over the screen just blew me away... A perfect ending for the second trilogy. Also, the second favorite part in the series - you'll see that is better than the rest of them. I just can't wait for the seventh part... And I'm only a year away from it !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How am I feeling? Shocked. I walked into this movie with the lowest of expectations because I really wasn't satisfied or impressed by any of the sequels and I was not expecting to be impressed by this one either. Well.....I stand corrected. I personally am not a fan of the Saw series but this movie alone despite the failure in in the past has made me a fan.All the unanswered questions were all brought together with a twist through each one. The violence and gore that Saw has brought to us continues but this time a well thought plot with meaning and character development is attached. The way everything comes together is mind-blowing and yes......my mind is literally blown. This movie was so outstanding that it has redeemed this failing series.If your not a fan of Saw do NOT let that turn you away because you will NOT be disappointed. This is nothing like the others. It takes a completely different approach for the good. Wow.......just wow was this ever good. While I would not give most of the other sequels over a 5 I give this movie 10 because of the fact of how I could not think of any way this movie could have been better. It was literally perfection.</fullReview>

Im a pretty big fan of the Saw series and have liked every one but this one may take the cake along with the original. This Saw was actually a movie and had a plot behind it and also revealed a lot of unanswered questions from the other Saw's. It wasn't just a filler type movie like I thought the other ones were. There are a lot of good twists and turns but without giving anything away just play close attention and you will be able to figure the stuff out on your own before it happens.

		<shortDescription>A return to form for the franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a string of disappointments, the Saw series finally gets back on its feet with Saw VI, since it returns to the suspense and interesting moral themes that made the first 2 movies successful. That doesn't mean for a moment that it's a perfect movie though. The performances remain dodgy and the synopsis talks about Jigsaw's grand scheme finally being revealed. What scheme?! The plot is still weighed down by endless flashbacks and it's all still pretty confusing. With gore galore and the usual torture porn, this is another nasty movie which gets pretty difficult to sit through. However, it's definitely an improvement on the appalling Saw V. At least something actually happens. This functions both as a suspenseful, gritty and at times brutally tense horror film and an interesting and intelligent (If somewhat superficial) critique of the American healthcare system. It's pretty tedious some of the time, but it definitely has its moments and connects to the other movies in an interesting way. It's not that great or anything, but it's a pleasant, and underrated, surprise.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw VI is definitely a step up from 2010's Saw 3D: the final chapter. This film had better acting, still not great though. The storyline is pretty entertaining, not academy award winning, but it's somewhat entertaining. Now I still cannot approve or say that I'm a fan of the EXTREME gore that runs rampant through this film and the whole series really. The gore in the movie is extremely graphic and unsettling, I mean I know that it's meant to be, but it's still just too much for my taste. Jill Tuck is one of my favorite parts of this installment, her role was very active in this movie and contributed a lot to it. The "game" was better here than the next final movie, and the game is well constructed here, again, too graphic, but never the less, well constructed. I liked seeing the friction between Jill and the detective. Their complicated and hectic relationship takes a very interesting turn here, and I kinda like where it went. I will be reviewing the previous saw films as I see them, I know it's weird, I'm going backwards, but I catch what I can on TV lol. 6/10 for Saw VI.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh look, all you need to know about this film is that Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) runs around with the severed hand of the late Agent Strahm trying to leave Strahm's fingerprints everywhere. Look, I lost it when he pulled out the hand. I was sitting in the theatre and burst out laughing. And he doesn't stop using it! he just keeps going. This is the film where they let go of any pretensions of being some serious gritty horror film, and it is all the better for it, as the past two have been about as torturous to watch as some of the traps have been. In this one you will actually have some fun watching it.What else happens? Who cares! Well all right, we have some douchey people (insurance assessors, predatory lenders) put into traps, who we are supposed to want to see die. We have Hoffmam taking out some agents who have worked out who he is and we have some more crap about Amanda and Jigsaw that I stopped caring about 2 or 3 films back.Look, if you must keep making these movies, please make silly ones like this with a genuine cliff hanger and some fun to be had. Jigsaw died in Part 3. I don't want to know what was written in a letter Amanda read in Part 3. I don't want to see Saw trying to channel Fight Club by "making people feel free," and I really don't want to have a whole movie wasted by trying to explain Hoffman's back story while a group of people not even connected to the main story kill each other in a trap. I want to see Hoffman use a severed hand to leave fingerprints (think about how stupid that really is) and kill some people who've found him out. I want to see a predatory lender cut their arm off with a meat cleaver. I want to see an insurance assessor get pumped full of acid. And at film's end I really want to see what Hoffman does next after escaping from that Bear Trap Jill put him in.It's better than the last two, more than incrementally, and that's the main thing you can ask for. Well, on my score sheet, that's three good, one boring and two bad. Looks like this series is going all the way down to the last installment to see if it works as a whole.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 6 (2009): Dir: Kevin Greutert / Cast: Peter Outerbridge, Tobin Bell, Betsy Russell, Costas Mandyler, Shawnee Smith: Yet another disgusting outing of guts, gore and booby traps. This time an insurance lawyer awakens in shackles to the grim voice that sends him from one torture test to another that will either propel him or kill other victims subjected to the traps. Directed by Kevin Greutert with no story to mention. Peter Outerbridge stands out as the greedy lawyer tested for his past deceits. It reveals his conduct with Jigsaw and how he came to find himself in his vile circumstance. Unfortunately revenge seems uplifted as Outerbridge pleads for his life in a graphic send off. Tobin Bell appears in flashbacks as killer Jigsaw who ends up on the negative end of greed in flashbacks. He response by making the agency suffer for his disservice. Betsy Russell plays Jill, Jigsaw's wife who opens an ominous box to carry out the rest of Jigsaw's tasks. One such task will involve a double cross where someone's trail of blood doubles back on him. Costas Mandyler is unfortunately limited as Hoffman who mainly prevents police from getting too close until he finds himself the victim in a twisted climax. Shawnee Smith also makes brief appearances to uphold previous story points. This is another puke fest horror film that is not for the squeamish or the highly intellect. Score: 3 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So where were we at now then? Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is still continuing to do the bloody work of the dead John Kramer/Jigsaw (Tobin Bell). In his sights is William Easton (Peter Outerbridge), an unfeeling insurance head who turned down claims by Kramer and a myriad of others on pathetic technicalities. Cue more elaborate traps, painful decisions and some twisty devilment. Yep! It's another Saw movie.Somewhat surprisingly, part 6 is a step up in quality of writing and ingenuity of gore/trap factors from the previous two installments. It's still very much old hat as a formula, and once again the sequences of Bell used in flashback show him to be the franchise's strength. However, the makers put at the core an insurance issue that everyone can identify with, whilst piling on mystery and suspense by way of Jigsaw's left envelopes and the FBI closing in on an increasingly overt confident Hoffman. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Superior Redemption!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SAW VI really puts the franchise back on track. As some of you can agree, SAW IV, and V weren't really as good as their predecessors. Though SAW V did have another clever twist as SAW films tend to do, it lacked new material, and it was around this film where we got tired of the same stuff over and over. It sort of became predictable, and the films were beginning to recycle themselves. However, that is not the case in SAW VI. Of course in this film, our main character is "William" (Portrayed by Peter Outerbridge) who must face a series of tests similar to "Jeff" (SAW III) and "Rigg" (SAW IV) But it's this film that is perhaps the most meaningful to us. Although, I know some of you reading this probably haven't seen "SAW 3D / SAW: The Final Chapter / SAW VII" which is why I won't reveal anything there either. I will say however, that this film SAW VI should have been the last film. If they had just found a way to combine the two films, keeping the most part of SAW VI and using the beginning and ending of SAW 3D, this probably would have been the second best SAW film ever. (I know a lot of you may think it is already) You'll know once you see the beginning and end of SAW 3D what I mean. Honestly, SAW 3D was terrible. The only good parts are the start and end, and it's the only thing that kept us watching until the end. The most part of that film was awful, bad acting, stupid plot, and just overall not a good film. Saw VI however was a great film, respected by the fan base, and like I stated "A superior redemption!" The last film was just a totally unnecessary cash-grab. So do I like SAW VI? Yes, I love it. Great film, I still do believe that the ending of SAW 3D should have been the ending of SAW VI, and that the franchise should have ended there. Overall, I give SAW VI an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better entries in this series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Number six in the saw series and it is quite surprising. Another new director, it seems at this point the producers were thinking that people will want to see a new saw film no matter who directs it, but this is not a bad thing.Saw 6 continues where five left off. The investigation team from the previous films is now close to uncovering the new jigsaw (whose identity I will continue to keep secret in case of spoiling it for anyone). Meanwhile the plot focuses on a game revolving around some unfinished business the original jigsaw had with the CEO of a health insurance company. But not all is as it seems.Surprisingly saw 6 has a solid script with a few neat twists in it. The dialogue is strong, the characters well developed and it even manages to convey a strong political/moral message concerning the state of the American healthcare system.The stars from the previous saw movies are once again back and play their parts as well as ever. This time the actors have a better script to work with and their performance is noticeably improved.The direction is also top notch. There is solid nail biting suspense, especially during the games. There are some good shock moments throughout the film. The editing is well paced and the cinematography is flawless. Bringing a new director on board is definitely what the series needed.My only real objection is that the later saw movies don't really qualify as horror. Horror comes from suspense and mystery. It is the unknown that scares us, and it works in the original as Jigsaw's identity is kept secret until the very end. In the later films we know who the killer is and we get the basic gist of the games, they just try to shock us with superfluous amounts of gore. I'd define saws 2 through 6 as thrillers, not horror.Aside from that, saw 6 is definitely the best saw since the original. Some fresh new ideas combined with solid writing, directing and acting while continuing the story from where it's predecessors left off make this film quite exceptional. I can definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And so it continues. Mandylor's arrogance in this film leads to him wanting to be seen as more of a hero. Meanwhile Jigsaw's ex-wife is becoming more involved and a new game has begun. The latest game takes on a bit of satirical social commentary, as we see a man from a health insurance company forced to face his evils. I can imagine this being pleasant viewing for many wronged by the health service in America. Outerbridge does a good job at conveying a man with difficult, and sometimes cruel, decisions to make, without ever being a completely hateable scoundrel. More gore and gruesome traps, perhaps some of the worst. Luckily, the Saw franchise is coming to an end, but it was a jolly good run.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continuity can be a killer...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw VI is definitely a step up from the going-through-the-motions Saw V. It stands with Saw III as the best sequel, over the disjointed Saw II and the tangent that was Saw IV. If VII continues the upswing, we could be in for a much more pleasant surprise. This installment ends the second trilogy of the series, wrapping up Hoffman's arc and Jigsaw's last will and testament. The Saw series has always been good with continuity and that's probably because the entire franchise's editor, Kevin Greutert, is the director of this one. The traps and deaths are much more creative this time around and the ending feels worlds more satisfying than the last few sequels. The health care issue in the film actually doesn't feel as tacked on and phony as many hypocritical critics are groaning it is. As long as they keep Tobin Bell around, the series should continue to be at least somewhat tolerable. Its definitely worth a watch and might spark your interest in the series again.</fullReview>

So he sends a fat cat on a game (the same fat cat who denied him something earlier) and all the while Hoffman has something to do with something, and there are flashbacks galore, but it does it's job with keeping up with the main narrative throughout.there was a time not more than a couple of years ago when seeing the saw movies were becoming a bit of a chore. The public must of recognised this because of diminishing returns. But the trouble is, this is the kind of franchise that once you start watching it, you cannot ignore further instalments, regardless of how baffling or bizarre they have become.Thankfully for once, the focus isn't on the traps (although they are good) the focus is on people again, and not how much they value their life, but how much they put a value on others (very topical).For a fifth sequel in a horror franchise, the acting is good, and production values even better, and like i have said before, the story is an integral part to everything, and really makes it more enjoyable, as the flow is smooth.Roll on Saw-3D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For many months, I've watched the Saw movies with anticipation with every one of them coming out in theaters then soon on DVD.Each movie has given some sort of feeling towards the audience whether that would be suspense, pain, anger, fear, or one of those moments when you simply yell to the characters "Don't go through that door!" like in Saw 4.Saw 5 had so far been the winner for me for its ability to turn twisted events into a whole new story. In gives the new characters an in-depth personality and the traps are gorier than ever before.In Saw 6, this movie won my liking and favoritism by a landslide, merely for the deep feeling of anxiety I felt through the entire movie. I felt the pressure building through the entire movie. It was a magnanimous feeling the directors would have been proud to hear from a fan.</fullReview>

I wasn't impressed then and AM NOT IMPRESSED NOW! I like how the main victim in this movie is an insurance claims manager. He is forced to choose who lives and dies just as he decides which claims to deny and which ones to pay. That was a little bit on the creative side. Interesting cameo by Zakk Wylde toward the end. I hope this saga ends with this movie. I do not want to see another SAW ever again after seeing this. I saw enough of SAW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this sixth film in the SAW franchise. JIGSAW'S legacy lives on as Det. Hoffman captures a slimy insurance salesmen &amp; forces him to play a series of games, where the fate of his equally crooked employees are at stake. Not only that, but a seemingly innocent mother &amp; son &amp; a nosey reporter are also captured that will play a bigger part in the game than they ever imagined. But when Hoffman's police colleagues come close to unravelling his involvement with Jigsaw's twisted games &amp; captures, he may have to plain flat out kill them in order to keep his secrets safe, while Jigsaw's wife learns of her late husbands plans for her. After seeing the okay but none to great fifth film, I felt the SAW series had, had it's day, each instalment (with the exception of the fourth, which I actually thought was pretty decent &amp; better than parts 3 &amp; 5) was seemingly less interesting than the last. Thankfully this film is an exception! SAW VI, is if anything, the best SAW film since the original! The film has many interesting kills, torture gadgets, great gore, great character development &amp; acting &amp; very good direction. There is plenty of interesting plot twists happening &amp; the film ends with a great cliffhanger ending that will make you all the more eager for the next instalment in the series. Highly recommended to all SAW fans! Sadly, due to the declining interest in the franchise, this one drew in the least amount of money on opening night. Hopefully the sequel will be just as good!

		<shortDescription>Still confusing or brilliantly complex and still going strong for better or for worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw...what can I say. After the first one I said "ALMOST the best horror film I had ever seen." Much to my glee they decided to stretch this into a ridiculously long franchise which still promises two more instalments. Much can be said about the series. They are never easy to watch simply because of their intense complexity. The films have jumped around in time, and always add in characters and keep the ball rolling but so far this hasn't really been an out and out con to the series. Why should the film makers be chastised for trying to create a gory, blood soaked, intelligent horror film. If you watch the films straight through 1-6 you are able to follow it but it takes a lot of intense attention. Then you have the fact that they created one of the greatest horror characters I've ever seen in Jigsaw by the brilliant performance of Tobin Bell and his killer has been literally dead, has not returned, since the third instalment and yet they keep the ball rolling. Blood, gore, and extreme death is not short in the sixth instalment and somehow they still manage to keep coming up with fresh ideas for traps and deaths in one way or another.Tobin Bell has probably made himself a force to be reckoned with playing Jigsaw/John. I know I became an enormous fan. This is no exception as we delve even more into his mind prior to his death in the third film. Although this is really the first film where I think Jigsaw definitely takes a back seat to start to show far more for the "new" Jigsaw (Hoffman.) At first I wasn't pleased to have Bell's Jigsaw replaced and didn't think I was a big fan of Costas Mandylor portrayal of the twisted cop Hoffman but I've changed my mind. Mandylor's equally twisted, dark, and brooding character is done very well and we really get a taste for his character in the sixth instalment. Betsy Russell returns as Jill. She gets a bigger role in this part as well and she does a great job. I think I would rather see her pick up Jigsaw's work as her character really unravels throughout the series. Peter Outerbridge joins the cast as the player in the latest Jigsaw game. He makes his way through numerous traps and 'tests' to finally get to the end which of course is a complete twist from what you think is going on. Outerbridge is okay but he doesn't really stand compared to past players of the game.The problem with the Saw franchise is that it is likely becoming too complicated for its own good. I mean you can't expect people to remember all the small details and intense twists and turns each year and follow the series and still enjoy it. Sometimes simplicity is key and they just keep getting more confusing. I think a return to slightly more simple ideas might do wonders for this series which fans seem to be steering away from. Director Kevin Greutert has been involved with this series since the very first instalment and I think that is a great thing. However his directing experience is slim. I would love to see them bring back James Wan to really reboot this franchise back to greatness. Until then this instalment keeps some of the dark, dank, creepy aspects with plenty of gory kills but is starting to slip when it comes to keeping the story together. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>since the very first saw, each one keeps getting better and better. the twists and surprise endings in the previous ones were great, but this one definitely tops the rest. oh my god! the twists in this one were incredible! and the ending, a real surprise! what i love about the saw movies is unlike other horror movies, the saw movies keep to the plots and stories of the previous ones, continuing with each one. in this 6th one, a lot of questions will be answered, what is in jill's box and what was in amanda's envelope, plus a few extra surprises. so far this has been the best yet! anyone who is reluctant to see this movie, don't be! go! even if your only a fan of just a couple of the movies, this one will not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the worst.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Certainly not the worst the franchise has seen but still not as good as part 3 but it did come close especially more than the last two. The acting wasn't as by the numbers this time and I was pretty impressed with newcomer from vh1's scream queens Tanedra Howard's small but serviceable first performance as Simone, not half bad. I have to say this might be the bloodiest one yet in the series and they're getting better with the story adding a few twist here and there but it's still annoying going back and forth between scenes because it just makes it confusing but they're getting better, slowly in a way. I still think this is an overrated franchise and pointless on making more and it's just violence in the sake of violence and it's just not scary, suspenseful or rewarding and it's very tiresome now but it'll be interesting what they will do come this October when it'll be in 3D but probably just a rehash with the story going nowhere. Overall it's an improvement over the last two but not a huge one and it'll definitely satisfy gorehounds but anyone else might find this to be too gruesome and pointless to get into but I say add it to your queue if you are fans of the long lived franchise, to me though it's way past its due and I think they should wrap things up with part 7 this year and why not go out with a bang in the glorious 3D. Watch it or not it really doesn't matter if you lost your interest in this series with the last two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The franchise has come full circle.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who disliked "Saw V" are going to be asking many questions about "Saw VI".Is it better than "Saw V"? Is it any good at all? Should the franchise continue? My answers to these questions are: Yes, Yes, and Yes."Saw VI" is a whole lot better then "Saw V". I'll admit that "Saw V" was a decent film.But it really didn't bring anything new to the table.It was just an OK 6.5/10 slasher film.I do believe that the franchise should continue.Luckily for me and everybody else who loved this movie, there will be a "Saw VII".It's also going to be in 3D.Can't wait for that one.My suggestions: If your shopping for dvds and you see "Saw VI" on the shelf.Unrated or not, it's definitely a movie that you should put on your list.If you were liked the previous movies, then you'll be in for a nice surprise when you see... "Saw VI".Bloody good movie.</fullReview>

The movie was pretty good (is it suitable to use the word pretty when reviewing a SAW movie?!!), well it WAS really good, with a lot of new revelations. but the thing I wanna ask the people who saw this movie is: did you watch to the end? I mean the VERY end? See, there is a scene after the credits in the end of the movie, I won't give it away so people who hadn't seen it could check it out, but for those of you who saw it, who's this girl? and how you think this is going to affect SAW VII? Finally, GREAT movie, horrifically SADISTIC traps, GRIPPING ending, worth an 8/10 easily.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best since the first saw...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I simply cannot put it into other words. Saw VI opens up with one of the goriest opening sequences since the autopsy scene from saw IV and just continues. While this felt a lot like any of the first Saw films, the traps felt a lot cooler and the story felt a lot more elaborated: of course there are a lot of flashbacks, and I don't expect a new Saw fan who just joined the series to enjoy this film as he/she will clearly not understand anything, but for the others who have followed Saw since 2004, this is clearly a treat for us, considering the fact that Saw V had mostly been a disappointment. Saw VI tells the story of William, an insurance worker who is put to test by Jigsaw. William had refused two insurance by two different clients, one of them being John Kramer himself, and both refusals lead to the client's deaths. What I liked is that through the numerous tortures, we still follow the story. The traps are as gory as ever, those who watch Saw for blood and guts won't be disappointed with the opening sequence and the mysterious carousel trap that I will not spoil but that kept me to the edge of my seat. The acting was pretty good as well, Costas Mandylor is better than in Saw V. All in all, Saw VI might not be the conclusion to the Saw series but if the series were to end with this one, I'd feel satisfied. The ending is good and I like the open-minded ending. 9.8/10, TWO THUMBS UP!</fullReview>

LOL. when this movies keep going in his sequels, i can see some of the plot are becoming weak and they increase the brutality to cover the storyline, not smart enough for a long-term franchise. so i am personally hope SAW VII will sale more in the story line and balance the brutality. with out some brutal-actions it wasn't SAW enough, but too much brutality on the movie will swallow the essence. and i just watched it four days ago. i gave 6.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the different between John and Hoffman is, John did gave victims a choice, to save everyone;but Hoffman didn't. Just like John said before, he didn't gave victim's a chance. In the 1st trap, is either 1 of the party die, to make the trap stop. 2nd Trap, he has to release one of the handle, to save one that he choose. 3rd Trap, he can save the one and only lawyer, if he can tolerate the pain and take out the key from his own body; but the chainsaw left by Hoffman to the lawyer didn't give him time, and chance. 4th Trap, he can save everyone by putting his hand into the box for 6 times, if he can bear the pain for 6 times. This is a traditional one and it may come from an idea from John because it did let you save everybody by sacrifice a part of your body; if only you make the decision. Last trap, a decision by others, has led him to death.It can consider a not a chance to survive trap to him because one of the victim is youngster, and it's too early for him to make a mature decision. Just wonder what is the trap that put in his sister stand for, for her to place righteousness above family royalty? This might need to figure it out with the director. Anyway, John is really brilliant behind for all this. I have to said it is beyond Hannibal works. What he did for is to let people cherish their own precious life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Say what you will about "Saw" and its myriad of sequels. One simply cannot deny how resilient and durable this series has been throughout the better half of the decade. One could say this is the "Friday the 13th" or "A Nightmare on Elm Street" franchise of our time, and they wouldn't be wrong. Like such films, the sequels of "Saw" are made on a shoe-string budget, featuring virtually unknown actors, which in turns makes its studio a whole boat-load of money each year, which in turn greenlights the next sequel, narrative logic be damned. Lather, rinse, repeat. You get the idea.In the latest installment, "Saw VI," John Kramer, a.k.a. Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is still teaching his lessons to the morally corrupt from beyond the grave. With some careful pre-planning and the aid of a mentor or two, new traps are rolled out designed to test the will of its subjects. This time around, the plot takes a page from current events, as we find irresponsible lenders and negligent healthcare companies at the receiving end. No doubt, Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan's script requires a grain of salt to take down. For the first time, a "Saw" film gets topical and in turn, it's probably one of the easiest of the six to sit through, barring a rather gruesome opening scene that will have even the most seasoned horror fans squirming in their seat a bit. Fact of the matter is, the film is designed as pure escapism.Now, having said that, there are definitely a few key issues that make this one of the dullest saws in the toolbox. First off, the left-over plot from "Saw V" is handled in an almost rushed, haphazard sort of way. It's like they wanted to get the Hoffman saga out of the way in order to focus on the carnage candy. The overall narrative suffers for it, as there are plot-holes abound and many questions still left in the air. Conversely, new twists and turns in the game are unearthed, but for the most part, feel forced and convoluted. The sad fact is that this franchise is running out of steam and is truly starting to show its age.As it stands, though, "Saw VI" is about as good as a sixth installment in any horror franchise has any right to be. It's not perfect, but the fans who have piled into the theaters in the past to see what Jigsaw had in store for them will more than likely walk away satisfied with this latest affair. It has the brains not to take itself as heavily as its predecessors, but at the same time, sacrifices much of the intelligence and intricacies this franchise has become known for. Enjoy it for what it is, and look out for Eddie Winslow of "Family Matters" fame himself, Darius McCrary in a minor role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As decadent as its predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Up front, you should realize that if you haven&#x2019;t seen any of the Saw films &#x2013; or even if you haven&#x2019;t seen all five to date &#x2013; you&#x2019;re going to be more than a little lost if you sit down to watch Saw VI. So much of the plot depends on things that happened in previous films; in fact, even if you&#x2019;ve obsessively followed the series, you&#x2019;re going to have to work hard to keep up. Having said that, though, Saw VI is a disgusting treat that&#x2019;s fairly tightly plotted but isn&#x2019;t overly complicated. It&#x2019;s not as great as the first couple in the series, but it does manage to continue the mayhem of the fifth movie while concurrently showing a couple of new &#x201c;games.&#x201d; By the end of the fifth film, Jigsaw is dead. But that doesn&#x2019;t stop him from making further appearances; the writers simply tell stories in a more nonlinear fashion, as some of the events take place before the events of the original Saw. In any case, someone new &#x2013; Agent Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is helping Jigsaw with his morality plays, but the cops are now looking into the murder of Seth Baxter, and they&#x2019;ve figured out that the murder wasn&#x2019;t perpetrated by Jigsaw himself. Seems only a matter of time before they figure out who the accomplice is.Meanwhile, an insurance-company executive has his own series of tests. As with most of the previous tests, William Easton must make some painful decisions about who lives and who dies, much as he does on a daily basis when he rejects medical claims for so-called preexisting conditions. Easton has explosives on each of his four limbs, and once he completes a test he will be able to unlock one device. Trouble is, each of the tests involves other people &#x2013; his underlings, a reporter, a lawyer &#x2013; who have connections to his line of work.So there&#x2019;s a lot going on, with the investigation and Easton&#x2019;s predicament basically running concurrently. Everything seems to interlock into everything else &#x2013; including many events and situations from earlier movies &#x2013; rather seamlessly. This means that we get clarifying details that color in John Kramer&#x2019;s intentions and motivations, not to mention further clues as to how the accomplices are connected to each other &#x2013; and how much each knows.As with the rest of the movies in the series, the underlying theme is one of morality and the choices that are made in life. Easton rejects claimants based on their ability to pay, which marks him as an immoral predator on the sick, in Jigsaw&#x2019;s eyes. Now that he has to make these decisions in the heat of the moment, without using his probability formulas, while making physical sacrifices of his own, what will he choose? The moral of this story, as always, is that those who make callous decisions that destroy lives must be held accountable, must learn their lessons somehow.In case you&#x2019;re still not sure if this is your cup of tea, let me be clear: this is not for the faint of heart. There&#x2019;s plenty of blood, there&#x2019;s bones breaking, there&#x2019;s eviscerations, there&#x2019;s trepanation. It&#x2019;s not a feel-good film. Even so, Saw VI is a lot of fun: its success is in moving forward simultaneous new plots and coloring in segments of previous plots while still offering up more than the recommended daily allowance of gore and terror.

		<fullReview>After the series suffers its worst with "Saw V", the sixth installment lifts the franchise back up to its peak with a slam dunk of a film, this round about settling the score with a shady health insurance company. Useful reprising characters back for more than just a cameo to be killed off, and new characters that seem to be somewhat likable even though the audience just met them. Mandylor finally shows us some talent with Detective Hoffman, who actually has expression in this one! Hoffman has now come to be a memorable villain of his own rather than just a cheap copycat following in Jigsaw's footsteps. Characters and story are terrifically developed in this outing, including John Kramer's (Bell) flashback storyline despite being dead for three films.***? (out of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again Jigsaw/Tobin Bell executing murders full of scares , chills and suspense . John Kramer (Tobin Bell) still lives from beyond the tomb , thanks to tape dug out of his autopsied stomach and by means of various flashbacks with the puppet-master Jigsaw. Conscious, throughout , Kramer entertains himself by monitoring the tests against his victims, he's devised. Thus the machinations begin again and the story tries to spark life into a disembowelled body. The picture starts with an unknown man and a woman under the torture of a machine and tied into a room of pain . Later on , it happens inside a store the vice president a medical insurance company named "Umbrella Health(Peter Outerbridge) attempts to figure out cryptic video tracks and getaway fiendishly body-trapped places . The challenging is how to get out of Kramer's imprisonment of new unfortunates in a single looked room . Meantime, Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell), Jigsaw's wife from the former movies , is shown opening the Box that left her husband containing six envelopes . One time dead Jigsaw, now Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandaylor) is the last person who can follow the legacy of the strange series killer . The twisted imagination Jigsaw and his pupil lavish upon their engines of pain with thrills and chills. Although the perverse master/protg is explored to some effect , the flashback edition structure is more complex and confusing than the previous films , though is packed with some flaws and gaps.This exciting denouement details astonishing murders at the hands of the dead deviser who is planning again gruesome and complex killing set-pieces. This sixth sequel from original by James Wan, contains grisly terror, tension, suspense and lots of blood and gore . The film takes accent as suspense as well as terror with creepy use of images-shock and slick edition. Provides an imaginative and well-knit screenplay plenty of twists and surprises , though develops the mythology of Jigsaw in an ambitious but ultimately predictable manner . Like David Fincher's Seven and Dario Argento's Tenebre, Suspiria, Deep red, it packs inventively twisted murders , this fuses an intricate chiller argument with horrible sensibility and relentless tension. This frightening movie was rated by Secretary of Spanish Culture as X and the production company to be obligated cut scenes in the only one case of censorship in several years. Sinister and mysterious atmosphere , has been made by cameraman David Armstrong and eerie musical score adequate for mystery and horror by Charlie Clousier, both of them usual of franchise. This sequel employs the same brutal puzzle logic as its predecessors toying the viewer in much the same manner that cruel murderer , well performed by the soft-voiced , pale Tobin Bell . He's a secondary actor working from the 80s in TV series (Walker Texas Rager, Stargate SG1, Alias, 24) and occasionally for cinema (Goodfellas, The firm, Ruby, Black mask 2), achieving success with Jigsaw character . The motion picture is professionally directed by Kevin Greutert . It's followed by Saw 7 ,3D , in production .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FINALLY it got better instead of worse....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been hooked on the Saw franchise ever since I saw the first one in the theater. They're my bloody-soap operas so to speak. Although I love the series, and always look forward to the next installment every Halloween, there really hasn't been a good addition to the series for some time now. Saw 2 was good but was really predictable and Saw 3 was the beginning of the decline. Personally, Saw 4 and 5 were pretty awful, lol, and I was afraid that the franchise would just continue to spiral downward instead of upward. This is why it was desperately needed for Saw 6 to be good...and it is..and it delivers.Saw 6 is such a MAJOR step up from the previous installments. A lot of questions get answered (although not all...not yet). The traps take on that more "primitive" feel as in the first one instead of the more highly unrealistic and high tech contraptions (ie: the closing walls in 5). As always, there is a twist in the ending...and it's just delightful.Saw 6 is not perfect, but it succeeds by returning to the original roots of Saw and is a huge glimmer of hope for the end of the series and sets up Saw 7 nicely. I CAN'T WAIT!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More traps and bloodshed but isn't this why we watch the Saw franchise in the first place. The movie starts off with two individuals who have worked in an insurance firm and have made a living pretty much screwing people out of what's coming to them. You know the story two strangers wake up not knowing where the hell they are and are attached to some atrocious contraption that will more then likely make their head separate from their body. Well these two after playing their individual tape recorded messages find out that after taking peoples money in place for their flesh that they now have to give some flesh of their own...the first person who cuts off a pound of flesh from their bodies gets to go free. As they look on the tables there are two knives and a clock on the wall.....let the gore ensue! Evil Detective Hoffman returns as jigsaw's predecessor to continue the serial killer's work to those who are taking their own lives for granted. miraculous even more is the fact that we get to see Tobin Bell (Jigsaw) even though he was killed way back in part 3 return and which as far as I'm concerned my only flaw with this excellent series if the fact you don't know if you are watching past or present? Anyhoo its another sequel of a franchise that you pretty much have to watch from part 1 to get the jist of whats going on. And for the record if you haven't yet heard this Halloween we are getting what i heard is the last and final instalment only this time its...surprise surprise in 3d.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw VI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the looks of things, the Saw series is going to last up to ten (or X) films, that is certainly good for the gore factor, but the same can't quite be said for the plots anymore, but the makers still try their best, from director Kevin Greutert (editor for the whole series). Basically, from where it left off, Agent Strahm (Scott Patterson) is dead and Jigsaw's apprentice Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is trying to make sure the authorities think Strahm has been carrying out the continuing Jigsaw murders, now that John Kramer (Tobin Bell) is dead. Meanwhile, the film focuses on the world of bankers and health insurers, and main victim William Easton (Peter Outerbridge) must journey through the maze of traps and decide victims' fates while the clock is ticking. While all this is going on, we see through the series of flashbacks how Hoffman and Jigsaw worked together, with Amanda (Shawnee Smith) there too, and how Easton met Jigsaw while he was still living. Hoffman is slowly realising that the cops are on his case, and it all comes a head with his voice being identified on the Jigsaw tapes, so he just lets rip with his blade, and burns all the evidence. In the end, after Easton reaches the main victims of the piece, Hoffman is tested after all, like Jigsaw said on the tape in his stomach, Jigsaw's ex-wife Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) carries out the task with the contents of the box he left in his will, I'm guessing she'll be the new killer should Hoffman die. Also starring Mark Rolston as Dan Erickson and Athena Karkanis as Agent Lindsey Perez. The gore in this one is almost instant with scene after scene containing body parts coming off and the red stuff gushing, and Bell still creates a buzz in the flashbacks. Traps include: the man and woman who have have to create a weight of flesh to stop their heads being drilled, the two men with clamps by their sides that move when they breathe, the game where Easton must choose who gets hung and their platform slowly slides, the steam maze where Easton must gets sprayed and let the victim out or get sprayed herself, the Russian Roulette game where Easton must pick two of sex people on a carousel to live while the others are shot, and the room where it looks like the victims would have hydrofluoric acid poured over them but it is actually needles to go into Easton's back killing him. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jigsaw has not retired the clown, yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that 6 of the 7 parts are now done, we can nearly put away our clowns of death for good. But which ones would you actually want to revisit just to get the thrill of witnessing brutal death scenes again and again? SAW VI is not without this feeling. The contrived games of the new Jigsaw may prove that the student surpassed the teacher, almost. While the traps in SAW 1-3 were suspenseful and left you cheering in disgust, now some are more predictable so you know what await the soon-to-be bloody mess on the floor and walls. That does not deter from the fact that this particular film will leave you thirsty for more. Not only do the traps kill the victims in this one, but the individual who set them up does some unforeseen acts of simple murder outside of the games as well. Of course, he is not the "likable(to some)" old man with cancer whom is far too mellow to suspect as a killer, but he gets the job done. The purpose of the past few movies was to continue setting up who will continue Jigsaws intended purpose. Were done with that and now were putting pieces together to a bigger puzzle and were left wondering what is possibly next. Being a bit slow, it is not the bloodbath people are used to. Rather, it is the police solving the jigsaw murders once and for all. That does not mean people are not blown to bits, impaled, slashed, amputated, and burned. John may be gone, but the traps are not without their teeth churning moments, especially the very first scene. While the story is slow in development, this one makes up for it by providing one of the most intense saw moments ever filmed. This goes without saying that Saw fans will not be disappointed by this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best "Saw" film in the second trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly this was actually a pretty good film, much better than the previous 2 installments. Although the cinematography is the same as ever like from the first "Saw" movie with it's crappy camera. This is a smarter sequel in the second trilogy, which really ain't saying much but it is actually pretty engaging this time around. There were plenty of good twist and turn and game the unwilling contestants had to play in order to survive was creative and yet sometimes pretty difficult to watch, even if you might really dislike the victims. So basically this time around it's about the health care industry and Jigsaw trying to take care of the problem, even if it's a small step in his own way. And the main victim this time is the head of the health care company and all the year of him choosing who lives and who dies comes back to haunt him. There are a lot more flashbacks this time around, since the film is the sixth installment and not everyone that see this film have watched the other five installments. Which was fine since the flashbacks didn't get to the point of getting really annoying. If your a horror fan and especially if your a "Saw" fan go check this movie out.7.5/10</fullReview>

The pace of the flick was effortless, it just zoomed by, Jigsaw (another top notch showcase by Tobin Bell) was better used here (via flashbacks that were more Jig intimate) then he was in Part 4 and 5 and there was a humanity to this sequel (brought by the somewhat preachy theme at hand/the WHY behind the game) that wasn't there in the two previous sequels. So liked that the most.Also the traps are much better this time round and there seems to be a lot more effort put on them but that whole thing where it's just one guy going through a building and choosing who lives and who dies was well kinda tired as it's all been done before with Part 3 and 4. But it was also great to see Shawnee Smith back again as the crazed Amanda. Costas Mandlyor was great yet again, becoming more and more ruthless this time round.All in all a recent entry but doesn't rank as high as the first 3, and looking forward to part 7 which has to be the last for sure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was once told that Saw 1 was a rubbish film with a weak plot held together by extreme violence. I disagreed with this review for parts 1 and 2. These films held their own with interesting twists and fun traps. From there on the films have slowly but surely gone down hill.Saw VI is a good example of a movie held together by extreme violence which i now find boring rather than shocking. The traps have become predictable rather than interesting and the acting is pretty much none existent.Saw is now a franchise suffering from killing off their lead actor too early. Tobin Bell has the ability of acting but is restricted to yet more dull flashback sequences. The plot is better than that of the last entry in Saw V, but only marginally.This film is a mere shadow of it's former self but most Saw fans will watch it due to the earlier entries. They need to try much harder with the seventh instalment.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, the series gets back on its feet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been a major fan of this series ever since I saw Saw, and Saw II back to back. After that, the installments have been 'Decent' for me. Saw V I initially disliked because I had many problems with it. I have to give it credit though, because it set up Saw VI. Saw VI takes place about two weeks after Saw V. Agent Strahm is framed and Detective Hoffman is free to continue the Jigsaw legacy. They introduce the character of 'William Easton' who is probably one of the best developed characters in the series. I thought after Saw V, 'How could they kill off Strahm'! I didn't think there was going to be another good character after that, but William sure proved me wrong. They make you think of him as an ass, but later feel bad for him as the movie goes on because he's not a 'Bad guy' he just didn't realize how flawed his healthcare policy was. The stab at healthcare company's is very creative. This movie has the best plot twist since Saw II, and it has a satisfying conclusion. Now there is a Saw VII coming next year, which is supposed to tie everything up. All in all this is the best installment since the first, and a great horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the teaser trailers started preceding our late summer entertainment last august, the fact that yet another installment in the ever popular franchise would be hitting theaters this Halloween, was met with groans and phrases like "are you kidding me" or "these films have overstayed their welcome." However do not count the sixth chapter in the Saw series out just yet, as it definitely tops the previous two installments, and may even goes as far as to maybe join the original as the best in the series. Saw VI takes on a visually enticing plot and brings back past occurrences, while explaining plot holes from its processors. The action on screen is sprinkled with plenty of the allegorically significant traps we have all come to love in these films. In addition to the non-stop thrill the picture offers, Saw VI places a touch of political charge involving our nation's health care system, something always popular in governmental opinionated arguments. If you are a fan of the Saw films, or just a horror fan in general Saw VI will not disappoint you, and I implore anyone who has given up on the series to please take a closer look, because SAW VI has not only redeemed any mistakes the past films have made, it may have just reborn the series for a whole new era of twisted, yet cleaver entertainment,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sexiness of horror against evil, it makes a lot of sense as a symbol of "Justice Enforcement Intelligence" which adds unprecedented dimension to horror movie climate. I hope this phenomenon "Justice Enforcement by super intelligence" be better sharpened in future versions since it is eligible to be a long living idea. This is especially if it can - indirectly - linked to current human wide spread evil. Perhaps a good target for a game by Jigsaw is some evil ex-president of a major country who killed millions of people ;). Personally I wish they do some reference against the cruelty of some criminal Israeli leaders specifically. Starting form here, the list of target characters can get long and each can be referred to symbolically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am big fan of the saw series.I have always waited for the last theme music where there are lots twists and turns with high drama. this time saw 6 disappoint in that sense because you didn't get anything unexpected at the end.But what i liked about saw 6 is that the film is engaging, fast paced and there are unexpected twists to the film at every corner. What saw 6 does is that it gives answers to so many unanswered questions that we had in saw 3 and 4.I think this is the only film that has a complete ending.Rest of the films provide unexplained loose ends.I really wonder how they are going to make a seventh part after this. if you are a fan of saw series because of the violence and death scenes shown in the film then you will come out disappointing. The first saw film is the best since it did not want a second part. After they have been giving loose ends in each film so that they can make another part from it.Watch it only if you like other saw films otherwise its not for you.Let the game begin!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best since original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching original SAW almost year after it was released. I thought it was torture porn movie so I always avoid it, no matter how many of my friends told me it's good. After watching it, I realize I was wrong, since it was easily one of the best horror movies to be made in all that Scream\Remake era. It was original, refreshing and different approach to slasher genre (c'mon it's a slasher flick, don't tell me it's "psychological thriller"... You have a serial killer killing people in a gory way, only this time it's not usual Jason-killing-style). Sequels were classic cash in, some were good, some bad, but not one single manage to be good as original. While original had great plot and keep you guessing who the killer is, sequels were more like "Look how many ways we can kill people" and I didn't like them very much.after dreadful part V I wasn't very exited to watch part 6... but I was wrong ... AGAIN. Part VI was everything that other sequels weren't. It was slower in pace, keep switching back between two main story lines, filled with some usual "saw flashback scenes".This one takes place immediately where part V left off. It's the same old story, someone is captured by Jigsaw and put to test. In SAW VI traps were much much better then the last few sequels and way of "getting out" of them is much better filled with some moral and dramatic tone. You'll know what I am talking about once you see this movie.but what really made SAW VI such a good movie for me are the last two minutes. I don't want to spoil it, but it shows that human will to live (by one of the characters being tested) is unmatched. Ending was nearly good as one from original SAW, now already infamous, when "dead man" from the center of the room rises and Adam's (main character in original) look on his face was "WTF?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure the Saw circle is coming full circle but although it lacks the style of some of it's counterparts this entry feels more polished and features a lot more believable creativity than the last few. Actually amping up the carnage and smartly the suspense quotient this entry proves far more successful than any since the second. It would be tedious and a little insulting to go over the film's plot logistics. But it's inclusion of the health care system is both clever and satisfying. The macabre death sequences are squirm worthy as people cut off appendages, are burnt by acid and are wheeled around on a cleverly rigged Merrie go round of death. the film's set design is a bit more impressive this time around than in all of the entries. this however brings up the question how is their electricity in these places and are these death traps condemned. It's all in good fun though. The performances are also more effective this time around. Costas Mandalor is better in this film than the joke he was in the last few as is Betsy Russell. And as for VH1 Scream Queen winner Tanedra Howard she's not bad but don't be expecting her to reap many benefits for this role if anything she should get her straight to DVD career off the ground. First Time Saw director Kevin Greutert and the Feast team have done the fans a solid. Sadly audiences don't seem to be showing up for this installment. Maybe there just tired of the mediocre fecal matter this series has to offer but for those with any interest it's actually worth a watch. Disturbingly fun...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big step forward from Saw V</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is truly impressive the longevity of the Saw franchise.The sixth part of any saga in horror cinema (or better said, on every genre) would probably be a cheap and forced sequel made straight-to-DVD.But the release in cinemas of Saw VI shows the confidence the studio Lionsgate has to this saga.However, many people (including me) put the validity of that confidence in doubt, because Saw V had been pretty bad (even worse than Saw III) and it damaged the saga because of its forced twists, uninteresting characters and an excessively confusing story.So, I honestly went to see Saw VI with very little enthusiasm, expecting that it would definitely mark the end of my interest in this franchise.However, Saw VI ended up being better than I expected, and although it has various forced elements on its screenplay, screenwriters Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton made the good decision of returning the formula to its origins, with a new cruel and bloody "game", but endorsed by the villain's intention, avoiding the movie to become hollow.At the difference of Saw IV and V, I think this time it is not necessary to have a PhD on Jigsaw in order to completely understand the story, and that's definitely a good point, because the story results more comprehensible.Besides, Saw VI is much more entertaining than part V.To start with, there is not any manipulation of time or tricks which cheat to our perception.The story is easy to follow and most of the scenes happen on real time.Of course, there are two twists at near the end of the movie; one of them is a bit predictable, and the other one is kinda ingenious, but it feels irrelevant in the context of the movie.The performances are properly intense and the special effects are grotesque and creative, as always.As I said before, Saw VI ended up being better than I expected, and I think it is the second best movie from this franchise (the first position still belongs to the brilliant first part).I recommend this film, because although the final experience may not be highly memorable, it made me have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong entry into the Saw series!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the Saw films. Every single one of them has something for me to enjoy. I love how every sequel in the Saw series really IS a Saw sequel- they involve past story lines and explain more about the past outcomes. Saw VI seems to give the most satisfying twist ending in the series since Saw II. While I am actually one of the few who really likes Saw V, and did think it was better than IV, the series was in a quality decline. I very much enjoyed the traps in V and IV, but not the overall story-arc of Jigsaw. The first three Saw films focused more on the present traps, but since IV, we have had more and more of Jigsaw's life revealed. I did not have a problem with it, but it never seemed entirely plausible. However, Saw VI really makes sense of it all. The traps are the most clever, twisted, and entertaining yet (although not the most horrifying. Saw III seems to still be the goriest and most disturbing to me). The spinning wheel and the acid maze were really tense, and I think Kevin Greutert has a lot to do with it. Since he has edited all of the Saw films, he knows what it is like. His editing in this film is the most impressive, especially in the in twist. He directs this Saw film with more tension, more thrills than the last Saw films. Overall, I was more than happy with Saw VI. I do love all of the Saw films, flaws and all, but this is a step in the right direction, and it seems like the writers might never run out of ideas. It is a shame this Saw film is disappointing at the box office, because it really is in the better half of the Saw series. Tied with III, right after the original Saw of course.</fullReview>

Although, the sixth installment has really regained my support of the "Saw" franchise. This movie finally did a couple things the others haven't. It spent more time on the main character, and even supporting characters.The deaths and traps are better than ever, even with Jigsaw gone and Hoffman taking over. Many of the questions we have had have been answered, and the twist at the end, as usual, surprised everyone. Go see it, what a Halloween treat!</fullReview>

I found out that people rate it less than the origin movie no matter which better... The problem is that a lot of people know nothing about movies...Before you rate any movie...watch it at least twice...think too much and then rate....If u want to know...I gave it 9/10 even though I'm more interested in touching Drama movies than horrors...but I think some horror movies may be great...SAW VI is a brilliant achievement..and It's right to say that SAW sequel can continue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see Saw VI opening night. Of course I could not stay away from my beloved series, despite its decline.First thing I noticed were a lot of people asking each other questions very early in the movie. "Who's that guy?", "wait, what happened in the last one?", "what was his game?", etc. If you haven't watch all the saw movies, mainly 3, 4 and 5 consecutively (over a short period of time, say a week) three or four different times, then you don't know Saw, and it's not wonder you don't like each new movie. It's impossible to take in all the different things that happen. It's impossible to remember all the dozens of different characters, past and present, especially with half of them having very similar appearances. For those of you who say the last 3 movies have been terrible, I say to you watch them again and again. They get better every time. Took me several viewings, even as a biased die hard Saw fan, to start to like them and eventually love them. I'm not saying they are the masterpiece that is the first Saw, but they are great in their own way and add the franchise well, mainly with character development and background.Back to Saw VI. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so lets just say? it was great. The twists were great, it tied up the loose ends and wrapped everything up amazingly, the death traps were good, and the ending was a very Saw-like ending that the series has not had since Saw II. The overall audience seemed to love it as well. Saw is the only movies series I know of where people will cheer and clap in between scenes. They really ate it up. The Saw movies sure have changed a bit since the first one, but its not necessarily a bad thing. It's just doing what is has to do to evolve the storyline.I've been reading the reviews on IMDb.com and so far it looks like I'm not alone. Ratings are up from the last couple, and the series may very well be revived. That being said? I still cringe at the idea of a Saw 7, and 8 and so on.. Where can they take the series? They left it open to some possibilities but.. it would be a great resting point, as good as it gets. Guess we'll see?.</fullReview>

You knew what they were gonna be about, but they still delivered. I would say from 4 and on though, they have been going downhill. Saw IV is the bottom of the barrel.Quick recap: Same old concept. People caught in traps and "ultimatum" situations. Yawn. A few brutal and somewhat inventive deaths (but they were better and more creative in the past). Yawn some more. The end.I hope this is the last one in the series. I mean, they made 8 movies out of Police Academy for Christ's sake, haha.

Whilst the first Saw will always be the most original and has the most surprising ending, SAW VI is definitely my favourite so far.The best Saw twists have been I, IV and VI, but Saw VI is the most complete, and leaves you feeling satisfied but you can't wait for the next one. The writing was impressive and acting good (despite comments from some reviews).The ending makes you root for William hoping things go his way and not the usual gory SAW ending. While at the same time Hoffman in the bear trap was fitting, however it was a relief to see him escape.Overall Saw VI was the best Saw yet and Saw VII is only months away, yet it feels like it is too long a wait...

		<fullReview>The sixth Saw is a damn good movie. Go see it.That is all.Still here? Need more to convince you, huh? Well, this is the best Saw since the 2nd, or perhaps since the first. Once again, it fills gaps in the story, works like a smooth, well oiled machine, &amp; has clever, deadly traps. Surprises here are numerous, opening up twists in the middle of the story, not just the end. Less crime scene investigation, and more character based dilemma, which is good, because it was getting a bit grating watching a cop show with Saw 4 and 5. And yes, the gore is still there, still quite bloody, but somehow never overdoing it.The story? What can I say that won't ruin the movie? How about that this is the first Saw to really stick it to what's happening with current events? Health care companies be damned.Saw has managed to create some copies, such as 2008's Untraceable, &amp; this year's Law Abiding Citizen. None of these movies applied logic. Implausibility is the word of the day. If anything in Saw happened in real life, it would have ended with none of the victims learning anything, winding up going to therapy for the rest of their lives. But seriously, if you go to watch a movie with that in mind, you're never going to enjoy yourself. Saw 6 can stand on it's own, requires a little knowledge of the past, sure, but not completely necessary. It took me by surprise because sequels aren't supposed to be good at all.Oh yeah, before I forget, Tobin Bell has the absolute best lines here regarding health, patients and insurance. Don't miss that scene with him at the HMO office. Take a good look at the name of the company, too, for a good laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SAW VI is one hell of a thrill-ride for us SAW fans. Possibly the best one yet! Everything was tight and 100% flawless. The acting, the storyline, props, special effects, everything! After the death of Agent Strahm, Detective Hoffman is still on the loose doing Jigsaw's duties. But does he know more than he think he does? After the death of John Kramer, Jill Tuck, John's wife, retrieves a box of notes for the next six unlucky victims including William, John's health insurance agent, in Jigsaw's reign of terror. Will Jigsaw's work continue or will it crumble by the hands of Detective Hoffman?Overall, the movie is just great! So many twist and turns, it'll make your head spin. Plenty of questions have been answered about the previous films and plenty of new cliffhangers for the next film. In conclusion, SAW VI is triumphant and flawless comparing it to III, IV, and V. It's a must-see for all SAW fans. Let the games begin!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw VI opens with one of the goriest traps I've ever seen, taken straight outta Merchant of Venice, but after that the blood spills with a little more purpose and makes for a very quick and amazingly fun movie.To sum up the plot of this movie would be a complete waste of your time...if you've seen any of these you know that things are far more complicated than a few sentences could describe. There is a main plot involving an insurance agent but also within 90 minutes about 6 or 7 different plots crash together and produce some of the best twists I've ever seen in any movie...not just SAW movies, if you're a fan of the series I'm talking 6th Sense twists, twists that will have you wanting to talk about this film over and over. Keep in mind my ranking went from IV,III,I,V,II before this movie so you can base ur opinions accordingly..after ONE viewing I'd easily put this in 2nd place...after my next viewing I may let this take the throne as best SAW movie yet...fun, fast-paced, and very refreshing...I hope they bring this director back for 8 to fix what I'm assuming will be trash- 3D SAW with V's boring director...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Let the Beginning Scare You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first, I sat in the theater, die hard Saw fan (this includes my owning every DVD, in standard and director cuts, and having watched all the commentaries on both), wondering how bad this movie was going to be. The beginning made me think this film would let me down. No, I did not think it'd be a letdown like 5, cause to me, 5 was never intended to be a regular 'Saw' movie. It was necessary to set up a story that could be used for the next few movies. So stop bashing it. End Saw 5 Rant.Saw VI started off seemingly weak to me, but by the end had me on the edge of my seat wondering where the series is going to go. The ending is different than what we've seen in Saw movies before, leaving the viewer questioning what will now become of Jigsaw's legacy. Throughout the film, more things from the past were revealed, and they both contribute further to Hoffman and why he MUST be tested, and to Amanda, and why she was corrupt beyond saving. The story in this one is pretty intricate and allows for the future of Saw to head in a slightly different direction. The story will appease all the fans of the plot twist aspects, and will leave them guessing where Saw 7 will go, as there are multiple outlets it can tap in to.As far as the traps, some hit, and some miss. There are some amazing traps, and there are some forgettable ones. Overall, though, I'd say this film did the 'violence' fans justice.Overall, this film was good. Hate it if you want, but to me, I liked the story better than 2, 3, and 5. But that's mainly because the ending leaves a door open for a new world of Saw...revenge and jealousy. We'll see where Saw goes from here, but fans will love this flick, and newbies will be shunned for watching the sixth entry without giving the first 5 fair viewing. They will be lost, and they will ruin the twists of all the previous movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible choice of characters to demonize in this installment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hope others have noted the following, but I have to repeat it because it bugs me so much.The film starts off demonizing unscrupulous mortgage lenders. Somewhere along the way in scripting or casting they chose a fat kid and black girl. Both barely look old enough to have just graduated from college. We're expected to hate two lowly pawns who have pretty much zero impact on the slimy scheme. Really?! A fat kid and black girl? Was that some weird idea of PC casting? Why not a fat, black girl in a wheelchair? Should have been an old dude in a suit to be believable or even remotely realistic. And it would have added the extra layer or complexity that we're to hate people who very likely resemble our fathers, uncles, grandfathers.An then Peter Outerbridge who is supposed to be the evil insurance exec is way too young in my opinion and disturbingly reminds me of beloved and good guy Ed (Tom Cavanagh) from the eponymously titled TV series. They really couldn't get some more Madoff looking actor? Someone who could be believable as a politician or soulless and conniving lobbyist?Oh well. This franchise started off incredibly well as a surprise indie and has devolved into an awful big budget, studio monstrosity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>2nd Best of the Series...Most Emotional Yet!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Saw 6 last night and went in actually with very high expectations. I am ashamed to say I have have been a bit of a Saw junkie ever since the first came out, and I have been reading about all the hype online for 2-3 months now, mostly by the writers, director and anyone else involved with the making of the film. I was NOT let down. There are 2 big surprises, one some may see coming but probably not completely, and the other NO ONE expected! I could not believe all the suspense from the actual traps, as these were the best and most gruesome traps yet. But, in the previous films I have not gotten "in to" the traps emotionally like I did at times last night. This movie brought back the excitement and satisfaction from the original Saw trilogy that I have not felt since I was watching Saw 3 in 2006 in the theater. This director (Kevin Greutert) reminds me of James Wan in his passion and his interest in diving DEEP into the characters and the story. It seemed David Hackyl was just doing the bare minimum in 5, and the results showed and may have permenantly hurt the franchise, but I emplore you to see 6 because it really brings back the original Saw feelings that made the series. Kevin really seemed to want this one to be an all out satisfier of the fan base and he went above and beyond in his work. Before seeing this movie I was thinking: Okay, they have enough story to make a big finale (saw 6) for the second trilogy, but what on earth could they have for Saw 7? And after the film is over, (and btw, the twist is a shocker and not predictable) you will be left thinking the same as me: Wow! They have so much more to tell, they could easily make another trilogy and, if done correctly, it could be just as good, if not better, as the 4,5, and 6 trilogy. I think it will seem a bit different from the rest of the films but they could still use Tobin Bell and all the rest of the actors in films 1-6 for Saw 7,8,9 and it would work, be interesting and ORIGINAL! Many questions were answered, and unlike Saw 5, which was a bit of a letdown, they were questions the Saw fan base has actually been craving to know for years now. Last year did not feel like a Saw film but this year was a good mix. The editing and color style was my favorite since the first movie and though the movie had a slightly different feel in the first 15 minutes than most Saw movies, it felt more like a combination of Saw 3 and Saw 4, but was much better than 4 and slightly better than 3. The formula remains pretty much the same throughout all the Saw movies, but the story has definitely moved on and has become interesting and SATISFYING in itself without holding on to the past too much that interrupts actual enjoyment of the film being presented. As stated before by others, this movie is the first that I can say could have been a stand alone movie in many ways just because it was such a complete story in itself without relying on the rest of the series. The writers and director really hit the nail on the head in their interviews describing the movie. I will see it again in theaters, but not because of confusion because this one, while fast paced, was not confusing. Finally, here are a few things i took away from the film: 1. Pure emotion and tough choices made this one the most intense and gripping of the WHOLE series. 2. The story and the series did come full-circle, and plenty was resolved while there is still plenty not resolved. Hopefully we will find out more next year. 3. The issues in this movie really hit home for pretty much all of the American public and there are good valid points made throughout. 4. The style, music, and editing are all at the top in ranking in the series. 5. The flashbacks ARE actually very organic and original. They WERE NOT forced and the story would not have worked and flowed without them.Go see the movie, you won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a rather disappointing fifth installment, I was hoping Saw VI would put the series back together again. A promising trailer put me back in the "Saw" mood; my expectations were high. Now that I've seen the big V-I, I can safely say my expectations have been succeeded.The plot outline seems very similar to that of Saw V, but that's probably because the makers of these films want to keep everything underground until the film is released. The story actually follows a character named William in a large game with tons of decision-making.We also learn more on the Hoffman/Amanda relationship, as well as a ton of background info on Jill Tuck. Many things you'd never guess are shown, including info on Timothy Young and Jigsaw's opinion on Dr. Gordon. This is the best and the scariest Saw since the first. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is for the die hard fans of the SAW series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It feels to me that the SAW 4, 5, and 6 have nothing to do with the original trilogy. This movie proves my point quite clearly.I liked in the original trilogy the fact you had to see them all to understand what was happening. SAW 4, 5 and 6 each introduce new characters that have nothing to do with Jigsaw, and they suddenly become the protagonist. In each film of the new trilogy, you are slammed with flashbacks, so every time there is an "OMG" moment, its more like a "heh, that makes sense." kind of moment. In the first 3, there were plenty of "OMG"s, especially at the ends.These movies are all about the gore and the "What would I do?" thoughts that come to your head. In my opinion, don't give us a stupid plot in SAW 7, all we want is blood</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've watched all of the Saw movies before this and although they weren't the greatest movies ever, they were entertaining and quite serious, and at least passable. The latest installment of the Saw series: Saw VI was something different and seemed kind of like a spoof of the previous ones.The first scene of the movie had me laughing because of how unconvincing the acting was, and I was already thinking "this is not a good sign" since I've never laughed in a Saw movie before. The movie continues from Saw V and follows Hoffman carrying on with Jigsaw's plans by setting up another game with a health insurance guy and some other members, and Jill from the previous Saw movies is revealed to be helping setting up the previous traps and who would have guessed that right?I don't know, it just seems that knowing that there's already a Saw VII in the works already, I kind of predicted the end correctly on who was going to die and survive. The traps themselves are not that good either, the only one I liked was the roulette roundabout one and the others were either rehashes or fairly lame. The plot twists were kind of predictable too, and there were a few unintentionally funny scenes in it which is not a good sign. So how much further can the series go? Well, maybe a movie more at best, but it could have ended here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into the theaters with some friends tonight expecting yet another saw disappointment. I only went to this see this film because i went and saw the first saw in theaters with the same friend as i did this one and we made a pact to see all future saw releases together on the day they came out. I sat through the 4th and 5th installment of this series and was extremely disappointed in the movies. As i was saying though, I went in expecting just another disappointment, but halfway through the movie my mind had been changed, the story had a point to it, it wasn't just another installment with the flashbacks and random killing with the saw title that the 5th one was, the killings were not only in taste but were great, the writers did a tremendous job on this installment.In my opinion everyone should see this movie if your a saw fan or not. It is the best in the series, yes even better than the first!!!! I planned on sleeping through this movie, I am glad I didn't. If your opinion on the saw franchise is that it is played out and they need to stop making them, such as mine was going into this movie, then just watch the film it will change your opinion, that's a GUARANTEE. I hope the next installment is just as good as this one. Keep them coming.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanna see how this all ends.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I came out of the cinema with my friend after we watched Saw VI, I said "That was amazing. Right, if there are gonna be any negative reviews on IMDb, I'm going to throw a loopy". There's always been a stereotype with a crowd watching a scary film in a cinema where people cringe and recoil in horror at what's happening on the screen - thought I was missing out when I realised that a film has never made me do anything of the sort. This is the first ever film that has actually had me breathing heavily and twitching on the edge of my seat almost all of the way through.The main plot concerning detective Hoffman has twists that you never would have expected. Things that date back to the first and third films. Even if you tried to figure it out as hard as you could, it hits you brilliantly, just like the majority of the other films. The subplot is well thought out and displays a sense of 'irony vs resolution' similar to Jeff's game in Saw III. Things tend to lack a little creativity, especially the carousel trap that you might have seen in the trailers...still, the other traps within the film compensate in terms of originality...and anatomy.Very nasty things happen in the film. The amount of blood and gut-wrenching violence puts this film up to the same standard of Saw 3, 4 and 5. More than enough to satisfy any gore junkies. The amount of thought put into some of these traps make you think that the writers are psychopaths for thinking of them...and you start to think you're a psychopath for loving them.I've read reviews here about the previous films, and people said they were looking forward to the film with high expectations that were not met. I couldn't help but get excited about Saw VI about three weeks before it came out - and was a little conscious about whether or not the expectations were going to be met.They were met. If you haven't seen it yet, and you feel the same way, you will be far from disappointed. Looking forward to Saw VII already, I wanna see how this all ends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No "grand scheme" was finally understood, but I think we all expected that in order to leave way for further sequels. As a huge fan of the character of Hoffman, the final few minutes had me on the edge of my seat. Seeing him overcome the Reverse Bear Trap (which Jill had intended to execute him with) was all kinds of awesome, and many loose ends (contents of the box John gave Jill, Amanada's letter, etc) were all tied together and finally understood.A lot of relevant social commentary permeated throughout, and it didn't feel like a "filler" installment like Saw V did (although I thoroughly enjoyed that one as well, particularly the scenes involving Hoffman and John Kramer).Despite there being no *huge* twist at the end, I think it will leave a lot of fans satisfied. The extremely picky ones, maybe not so much, but I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to whatever comes next. Hoffman is certainly on a role now - surviving four films now! Many kudos to Kevin Greutert and the crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Saw VI' is a return to form for an excellent horror series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For five consecutive Halloweens, the Saw series had been steadily released from a small budget and gained a good amount of box office returns. After the events of the previous films, mostly dealing with Jigsaw's death and the rise of his successor, Mark Hoffman. A new director was introduced, taking over from Saw V's David Hackl, and the film was created. Surprisingly (though not really, because of the release of Paranormal Activity), the film underperformed at the box office, compared to previous installments, and only made about 5x it's 11 million dollar budget. This led to the proposed Saw VII and VIII becoming one film (which was a problem all of it's own, but we're not there yet). People say that Saw VI is the best film in the series since the first three. Is that true? Is Saw VI the savior of the franchise? Or is it just as bad as some of the previous films? Let's find out.Saw VI follows an insurance executive named William Easton who has to deal with a set of tests played with his employees that attempt to show Easton the error of his ways. Meanwhile, the FBI investigates into Strahm's supposed involvement as a Jigsaw accomplice, and Hoffman has to go to surprising lengths to keep his secret.So, Saw VI. Hmm. This is an interesting film, and in my opinion, it's at the same level as the first Saw (meaning I'm giving it the same grade that I did to Saw). It manages to create a fascinating story and connect it rather well to the previous films. Unlike most of the films, the traps are very much entwined with the overarching story, and just overall, it's a great movie.The acting is great from both returning cast members and new cast members. Peter Outerbridge does a stellar job as William Easton, and really portrays the conflicted man who has to be judge, jury, and executioner all in one go. The funny thing is though, all of the decisions are basically handed to him, he just has to be the hardass who chooses what happens. Devon Bostick and Shauna MacDonald as son and mother do a great job as well. Easton's character did something to their family (not gonna spoil it), and at the end of the film, they have to decide something to do with him. They both play their parts very well. The other actors and actresses, even in their limited roles, turn in great performances.The music is just as good, if not better, than most of the previous installments. One of the reasons I really like these films is because of the music and the overlying music score that continues throughout. Charlie Clouser does a stellar job, as usual, in this department. The cinematography is on point, even if the color palette does look a little bit more washed out than usual. I did read that for the last film, and this one, they tried to make the colors less pronounced and in your face, like the colors in III and IV. I guess they succeeded.Like I said before, the storyline is very well done. It manages to tie together what happens in the past into the future and creates a rather well-tightened narrative. The script works as well. All of the dialogue seems pretty well done, and the early scenes with Easton before his trap actually begins works very well, and all sound like something someone as scummy as he was would say. The gore is also lessened a lot in this film, even if there are some grueling parts to it, it's a lot more classier, I suppose you could say.All in all, Saw VI is an exceptional sequel. It manages to recapture what made the first film so great, while also adding its own twists and turns to the overarching story. The acting, music, cinematography, storyline, and lessened gore all work in the movie's favor. If you've given up on the Saw franchise in the last few films, power through them so you can get to this worthwhile sequel.9/10. | Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Saw VI' was a shock to many fans, myself included. A film that managed to surpass its predecessors, with the exception of the original, whilst still maintaining the gore, the franchise is famous for. The story is not doze inducing, the acting a substantial improvement over 'Saw V' and the traps the most inventive of the series. It even has relevance to the current day health care scheme and that makes 'Saw VI' all the more compelling to watch.'Saw VI' continues minutes after the end of 'Saw V'. Agent Strahm was crushed by two walls, Detective Hoffman (an aggressively angry Costas Mandylor), the new Jigsaw killer leaves the scene Scott free. Jill (Jigsaw's wife) accepted her husband's actions by the start of 'Saw V', she provides Hoffman with several numbered envelopes. Jigsaw's possibly final test for members of a healthcare company is outlined within them. Whilst Hoffman starts the new game, he must avoid arousing the suspicions of Agents Perez and Erickson who have acquired a Jigsaw tape from a test. They are analysing a distorted voice in the hope of finding out the identity of Jigsaw's accomplice. The victim of the game is William; he is the CEO of a health care company with unfair policies. In his four tests he must help members of the firm, whilst reaching his family before he runs out of time.'Saw VI' is surprisingly very entertaining, this garners further merit as this is of course the sixth instalment in a Horror franchise. Because there is so much variety and little lapses of time where nothing intriguing happens, we remain for the majority of the runtime transfixed and glued to the screen. If you never liked the 'Saw' films, then I would not advise you to see this for numerous reasons. Firstly, the gore will be too much to handle, although it is not in repugnant excess like 'Saw V' and this film's successor. Secondly, you will not have the faintest idea of what is going on. The 'Saw' saga has interconnecting story threads running through all of the films. It is therefore essential to watch the first five 'Saw' films before viewing this one. Therein lays Saw VI's biggest problem which cannot be helped. As many of the sequels are ponderous affairs of little value.The traps that William faces are my absolute favourite of the series. That's because they do not provide easy challenges and do not rely on gore, but quick thinking and an abundance of skill. Did I mention pain? There's that too. The first trap excels because of its simplicity. Jigsaw puts William face to face with the Janitor from the company. William is healthy, the Janitor not so. According to the policy of the company, the Janitor's will to live is less than that of William's; as Jigsaw puts it "when faced with death, who should live, versus who will live are two entirely separate things". Without the need for Rube Goldberg style torture devices, when one thing leads to another chain reaction, the franchise finds its footing at last. It is the simple consequences that have the highest effect and overall lasting impact on the audience. The gore is toned down, so you are in no danger of fainting here. Other traps focus on simple harsh decisions such as helping a friend out through the sacrifice of blood and coming face to face with the person you are effectively killing. It's an interesting choice, made all the more potent by the political undertones of the picture.The acting this time around is great, or as great as any Horror will ever be. Peter Outerbridge as William brings overconfidence and bigheadedness. It is impressive to see him smarmy in the first act and all of his power and influence on the people surrounding him diminished by the third. The film's colour palette is mainly formed from cold blues and industrial browns, each location giving off distinctiveness from the last. It makes you feel untrustworthy of the characters. With 'Saw VI' they use the tension to their advantage and by somewhat withholding the guts, they delve deeper into the film and hint at healthcare policies. This makes 'Saw VI' a truly memorable entry and return to form for the franchise.The film's pacing is succinct and edited for maximum impact. I never felt disengaged and would have gladly watched the film run over two hours in length. Charlie Clouser makes key use of his underplayed score. You feel on edge and the score knows when to be noticed. Listen to how it seamlessly blends when characters are engaging in the traps. This is a close to perfect Horror soundtrack. The camera work is solid and allows for complex movements, you always pick up on something you missed the previous time; providing a new experience every time you revisit 'Saw VI'.If you wanted something else to be happy about then you are in luck. We see the return of Jigsaw and Amanda; this is because there are many flashbacks showing how they devised the traps for the previous instalments. Although not essential to the story we get character development and 'Saw VI' utilises this to its fullest potential.'Saw VI' is the high point of the sequels. By withholding the excess levels of blood found in the other instalments, the filmmakers delve deeper into economic issues and ask posing questions about society. Don't worry though, there are plenty of traps, suspense and surprises to make even part time fans enthralled from beginning to its killer twist at the end. 'Saw VI' proves there is plenty of blood left in its veins yet.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when I expected the Saw franchise to turn for the worst, Saw VI surpassed any expectations I once had about a decrease in quality. First off, there are some political motives behind this movie, although I don't really agree with, it was actually a nice touch. With past films I was all about the continuity of the storyline; however my all-time favorite trap scene appeared in this film, the shotgun carousel. In my opinion it is by far the most ballsy and unsettling trap yet. Also, the flow and process going behind the background of Jigsaw was way more complex and thought provoking than any other film. Finally, the addition of the new characters meshed excellently with the returning cast. This ending, unlike Saw V, absolutely threw me for a loop on what was going to happen. It isn't at all the most shocking of endings but it did give me the chills. Not a bad horror flick and a surprisingly good sequel in Saw VI (7/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Saw since the first Saw.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Parts II, III and IV of the Saw series increasingly tedious, so much so that I left it six years before watching Part V. I was pleasantly surprised, then, to (eventually) find that the fifth instalment marked a turning point, the plot-line becoming a bit more interesting with Agent Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) taking on the mantle of Jigsaw, the gore being even more graphic, and the makers clearly taking matters with a welcome pinch of salt (the extreme nature of some of the gruesome traps bordering on self-parody). I was having fun at last.The series continues to improve with Part VI, which develops the Hoffman character further, ladles on even more revolting splatter, and steadfastly refuses to get bogged down with trifling matters such as the cash, time, and skill required to build such amazing methods of torture. Part VI simply gets on with entertaining the fans, with a twisty-turny narrative and bucket-loads of the red stuff.This time around, Jigsaw has assembled a group of despicable life-insurance business-people, and proceeds to teach them that choosing between life and death should not be an easy decision to make. As a result, bodies are blasted, crushed, hung, and, in the film's most revolting scene, melted from the inside with a highly corrosive acid. Meanwhile, the F.B.I. are closing in on Hoffman, although Kramer's wife Jill Tuck (Betsy Russell) also has a surprise in store for the deviant agent. Rather surprisingly, this satisfyingly sick chapter has left me looking forward to more Saw.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was great in all but I was disappointed when the last bit of the film was played out(Jill putting trap on Hoffman then left him for dead)because I really thought that that small version of the original reverse bear trap would not kill Hoffman and he would run off to kill Jill once and for all. I was shocked when Hoffman got out of that traps and tried to get the locked door open to go off and catch Jill and kill her. I had not suspected Jill to be an accomplice to Jigsaw I knew she was married to him then had a miscarriage and then things went downhill from there, but gosh she had really surprised me because she is a quiet woman who doesn't do much and not really in front of news media but when that truth came out about him everyone suspected her of helping him or causing him to suffer more than usual. But I have a feeling that Jigsaw will get his revenge on Hoffman but not Jill because he still has feelings for her and doesn't want her to get hurt under his watch. And that Jill and Hoffman may have a brawl near the next film hopefully. But we will all just have to sit and wait for something to happen to her and then something bad could happen to Hoffman.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its not a game, its a lesson -- I saw SAW I to SAW VII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Masterpiece fabulous story told in 7 years. Some movies are made to tell us Why the movies are made and give us a good reason to watch movies. Marvelously written and brilliantly filmed, Very Interesting and Intriguing. The message of the Saw series movies are clear -- don't abuse yourself, don't abuse others, control your emotions, and be fair. Do not take drugs, do not smoke, do not cheat or lie, do not frame others, try to forgive, do not keep vengeance, control the obsessions, do not make profits on others death -- Follow the Rules, and you will win in the end. Do not sin from the tiniest to the gruesome/ heinous. There are many gore and horrible scenes when the victims are TESTED. But I think its a glimpse of hell, what we can expect as the wrong doers will be punished in the after life, because they did not followed the rules or had not got the clues. Its not a game -- Make Your Choices! Cherish Your Life!When the Legacy was handed over from John to Detective Hoffman, it all started going in the wrong direction. He tried to fulfill John's Will, but as he had lesser human side, and was going himself against the rules. He became a Victim to be Tested by himself. The Final Chapter is also more interesting with more gore and gruesome scenes and more people getting killed now, mostly innocent and police officers. Before it is Game Over!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had to put the Saw III tagline in there. Saw VI is the 6th out of 7 movies in the Saw series. Or you could call it the 2nd to last Saw movie. Saw VI is a very good Saw movie, it has really good traps. Even though I pay attention to the story and watch it for the story more then the gore, I feel like this movie was the best movie for gore fans. This movie isn't the goriest movie in the series, but it has funniest gore to watch. It could be a movie to watch with your friends, but you should explain to them Jigsaw, Stramn, Hoffman, all the other charters, and show pictures of them so they know who they are when they see the movie. Okay, for a Saw story fan, this movie is enjoyable, it does answer some questions, like "What happened to Agent Perez?" It answers that. "What was in the note left for Amanda in Saw III?" It answers that. Saw VI is a great Saw movie and add to the Saw series, but I think it is the most fun to watch. I give Saw VI a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good Saw movie? Never!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before i get to part VI I want to talk about the other Saw films. There was a time when i was a fan of the Saw series but by part 4 i was kinda of tired of the gore, TBH i have never seen any Saw movie more than once. Besides the gore (and Jigsaw who is awesome) there isn't much else, plot twists and Jigsaws motivations aren't always clear or possible. I saw.... Saw V in theaters and it was a let down for me, thats when i kind of turned on the series and didn't see Saw VI in theaters even though it was receiving the best reviews out all the movies. That out of the way i watched this on cable and i wish i would have seen it on the big screen, as fast as i dropped the series i am interested again. I mean first of all the story for this movie makes sense and gives Jigsaw motive (Can't believe i can say that!). I'm not big on gore sometimes but this movie was really good and tied (really) all the movies together beautifully. The other films and V made a mess of a story that wasn't to good to begin with and made it great somehow. IDK if i can see it again because of the gore but its still the best movie in the series!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a fan of the Saw series i was very pleased with Saw 6 i thought that traps were well thought out and that it answered a lot of the previous questions the franchise threw out at us the gore and blood were descent and the entire plot outline was well crafted my only complaint was of course they never explained what happened to Dr. Gordon but that is just a minor set back. Overall Saw is my favorite horror movie of all time I had to watch the 1st 1 twice in order to really get sucked into it and im glad i did this franchise to me could go on until tobin bell(jigsaw) passes away in real life but alas it most likely will not I highly recommend this 1 even if your not a true fan as i am still give it a chance and you wont be disappointed as you probably were in saw 5 everyone Saw 6 the game comes full circle</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw VI- "The Game Has Come Full Circle"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Kevin Greuter and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan deliver "Saw VI", the newest entry in one of the biggest horror franchises of all time. After the arguable successive downfall in quality over the past few sequels (mainly starting with "Saw IV"), this film finally hoists the series back up to its feet, delivering us a entry that is possibly the greatest "Saw" film since the original! Fear not fans, "Saw" has returned to its original glory...The film features two parallel story lines. In one, Detective Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is maintaining his reign over Jigsaw's legacy. However, FBI agents Erickson (Mark Rolston) and Perez (Athena Karkanis) seem to be drawing closer to discovering his secret. We also discover more of Jill Tuck's backstory, and how she connects with the overall plot.The other storyline is that of William Easton (Peter Outerbridge), the Senior Vice President of a medical insurance company. As Jigsaw's games continue, William is captured and thrust into his own game, due to a prior relationship with John Kramer, aka "Jigsaw". Now, William has but one hour to complete four deadly games that will test the fabric of his being, and of his work philosophy.This film, true to previous entries, is very heavy on flashbacks, and continues to tell the story of Jigsaw before and during his transformation. And series star Tobin Bell once again shines in his chilling portrayal.Also surprising and amazing is the return of Amanda Young (Shawnee Smith), in several new flashbacks that further explore her connection with John, and now with Hoffman.Kevin Greutert serves as director in this installment. For those who don't know, Greutert was the editor of the previous five "Saw" films. And his experience in piecing together stories proves to be most beneficial- his direction for "Saw VI" is perhaps the best across the entire series. Greutert's visual style is quite stunning. Similar to James Wan (director of the original), Greutert is able to really get inside of your skin, and make you question what you'd do in the situations presented, something that the previous sequels somewhat failed to do. He is also more grand in his portrayal of the film, which makes it serve as both a nice compliment and a nice contrast to prior entries. Overall, I truly look forward to Kevin's future endeavors in the field of directing.The script by Melton and Dunstan is also much smoother and tighter than before. For once, we actually do get some resolution for the many open sub-plots and cliffhangers. The characters also feel more real in this entry.Finally, the acting is surprisingly good for a horror film. Peter Outerbridge is fantastic as the new lead character William, and returning actors, such as Bell, Mandylor and Smith, are all outstanding. There are a few chinks in the chain, but for the most part, I can't complain.Also, one final note: This film is arguably the goriest and zaniest out of all six films, in terms of traps. It is also the most imaginative film in terms of traps since "Saw III". There were instances where even I, a horror and gore-hound, was a little queasy. Just saying...I am truly ecstatic with how well "Saw VI" turned out. The franchise seemed to be slipping away, but this entry proved that there is still some serious life left in it. I'd highly recommend this film, and think that all fans of horror, "Saw"-fan or not, should see it. I give it, as a fan, a 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw I, II, III, IV, V, VI.....keep 'em coming!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though the Saw franchise has seen four different directors and multiple different writers, it has maintained its own style through six full motion pictures. Only the producers Burg and Koules have remained the same during the Saw saga.Saw VI hits the screen with the same familiar recipe than its predecessors; blood spilling-bone crushing-gut ripping-violence, that turns the heads of thin-skinned people 180 degrees the other way. While the horrible violence is the crucial element in the Saw movies, they have also accomplished to create a descent story around all the blood and gore, for the sixth time now.For me, the Saw saga hasn't been that much about the story, even if it has been surprisingly good thus far. It's more about the different diabolical games that the Jigsaw and his successors have come up with.If you have liked the previous installments of the Saw franchise, you are most probably going to like this one as well. Saw VI is the perfect leave-your-brains-behind-movie that will certainly keep you entertained for 1 hour and 26 minutes on a rainy Saturday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was great. It beats out all of the other Saw sequels, it's right on par with the first Saw. Everything about it was great. The traps, the pacing, the ending, and the acting. In particular, Peter Outerbridge was phenomenal, and of course the always great Tobin Bell. The music was top-notch from Charlie Clouser. Saw VI is a major improvement over V, and when we finally found out what's in Jill's box and Amanda's letter was amazing. It definitely made me love Saw III even more. The twists were amazing as always and completely unexpected. Overall, Saw VI was amazing and was a huge improvement over V, and this goes major to Kevin Greutert who saved the Saw franchise.9.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw 6 is no doubt the best in the series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge saw fan, and I was very disappointed with saw 5. I felt that the sequel curse had been taken to a new rock bottom of the saw series. Then came Saw 6 and all I can saw is "I love this movie!" Saw 6 picks up directly where saw 5 left off. Hoffman tricks everyone into believing that Strahm is Jigsaw's accomplice, but things take a turn when (spoiler!) Det. Erikson reveals to Hoffman that Agent Perez is still alive. Perez is convinced that Hoffman is the accomplice and is quick on the hunt to prove it. (spoiler!) Jill finds the info on the victims of the next big game inside the box that John left her. After giving the info to Hoffman, the game is set into play. William Easton, a health insurance owner that cheats his customers, is the main victim of the game. He had cheated John out of his coverage when he was diagnosed with cancer. Everyone in this series of games is connected to William in some way.Like all the Saw films, this one has many flashbacks. The film never gets slow. So many unsolved secrets are revealed. If you just go for the traps, this will be your favorite in the series. If you go for the insane plot, this will be your favorite in the series. There are multiple jaw-dropping twists in the end that gave me the chills. The moment the film was over I wanted to see it again. Yes, the game has come full circle, and the games have never been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>i want to play a game..... again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last two instalments have left me feeling empty. The arrival of the new jigsaw left me frustrated because all it meant was that we'll be seeing the latest SAW being advertised on every double decker bus in September . But when this happens, you rememberer how great the first SAW was and think to yourself " can this SAW be at least on Par" well, it March meaning that the latest film in the series is now finally available to buy on DVD. If there anything that need to be change then it has to be the pace and the way the story is told . Imagine re watching every film in the series in one sitting, it would be torture. You'll literally be watching the same layout five times but with different characters and twists. But unfortunately, you'll be watching it six times as the latest one ain't no difference. The saying " if it ain't broke, don't fix it " must be the production team's motto. Of course they'll be playing it safe. everyone has gotten use to the layout and always come back for more including me but to me the story telling is just getting repetitive and i think a whole new layout would do justice to the series. Even the traps require the same old quick cuts and crazy camera work.After the last two films , the series has fallen downhill and the arrival of SAW 6 just means another mediocre film being released only to make cash. But surprisingly, this film is not half bad. It felt to me that the producers wanted the story to be the main focus as this time around, the traps aren't the things that you generally care about . For example, this film contains a lot less gore. The first trap is the most horrific while the rest kinds of plays with your minds rather than spitting it in your face. Also, the story is not all about the person who trapped in one of jigsaw games instead the film takes a primary focus on the newest jigsaw and how it all came to be while at the same time, the detectives are closing in on the killer. all this is much interesting than going through all the pain with the protagonist to only watch him getting killed.Overall, this film is a mix of the original SAW and saw 3 and 4 . It safe to say it a improvement from the last instalment and for once, the ending left me wanting more , more of the story that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never watched any of the previous SAW movies in the series and so I watched 6 with an open mind, if that is possible. Big on blood and gore and there appeared to be a storyline working on a moral code of doing good against society baddies but where did they get the people from and who was delivering the message to society? Didn't really get the flashback part of things or John Hoffman, leave that to the cult followers. Must say that the movie was entertaining but not sure it will make me want to go and watch the previous 5, though i will be curious if there is a SAW 7. Acting is good enough and there is plenty of horror for pleasing horror fans. Overall I would say this film delivers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wring every drop left of the SAW franchise. The series perpetuates with Detective Mark Hoffman(Costas Mandylor)taking over the reins of Jigsaw's(Tobin Bell)legacy after Special Agent Strahm meeting his demise. Hoffman managed to escape the Crushing Room to keep the diabolical traps in the ready. When the FBI puts some tell-tail clues together they come closer to discovering Hoffman's real involvement. The detective has no choice but to put in motion another gruesome and grisly game.This is about like a stroll down memory lane. If you haven't invested time in the previous five episodes you don't get the full purpose of SAW VI. Torturous agony comes before the blood and guts. Also in the cast: Mark Rolston, Athena Karkanis, Betsy Russell, Peter Outerbridge and Shawnee Smith.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not the end of the Saw series, that is, but the actual end of part 6. It's I think the best ending since part 1. And it really promises quite a few things in the future. I do have my own idea, how this could be continued, especially with that great ending ... although I have to admit, that I was a bit sad to see that the end of Part 5 (which was also good), got a bit redundant during the part 6 ... well it's a minor thing of course.Actually I should have started with the fact, that I'm a big Saw fan. So my voting with Saw are slightly exaggerated, but that's just how it is. But while some movies don't care to have a storyline that builds up through a series, Saw is quite different. I see that as a good thing, but of course, the downside is, that you can be excused, if you'd ask, why they couldn't put more story in every installment, instead of putting so much gore into it ...One thing is for sure, if you liked Saw up til now, you ain't seen nothing yet ... Part 7 will probably top part 6, especially if they go the way I expect them to go. Although I'm looking forward to that, I have to admit, that I'm also looking forward to a final conclusion, or at least something that would be reminiscent of that ... Another good reason to look forward to an end would be, so I could buy a complete Box Set of the movies/series ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guilty pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Saw 1, 2 and 3 around the time they came out and I enjoyed them...well, I don't know if enjoyment is the right word considering the horror and twisted events involved but lets say I was entertained. It's kind of a guilty pleasure. I didn't watch the sequels, 4 &amp; 5, because honestly I had seen enough.. When a movie turns into a franchise that is constantly being extended, usually the quality starts to decrease and it becomes repetitive.This is proved by the fact that the 4th and 5th sequels have a lower rating then the initial trilogy and are commonly perceived as very inferior to the previous films. Now, this is the 6th installment of this franchise so by now people obviously know what Saw is all about, this is not for the faint of the heart, this is entertainment trough shock so if you're having second thoughts about watching this, do yourself a favor and skip it. Onto the story...Saw VI picks up the story right where Saw V left it, needless to say that I had a hard time putting all the pieces together since I didn't watch the prequel. I was still able to enjoy the flick though. Basically, Detective Mark Hoffman and Jill Tuck are carrying out Jigsaw last wishes which translates into a new "game" with new victims. This film reminded me of the very first Saw; down, dirty and over the top which is exactly what is expected from this kind of film. Also there are a couple of twists and turns that keep things interesting. Saw VI isn't perfect, its far from being a great movie and the acting is atrocious, however, if you watch this late at night with a couple of friends, it's going to be a really fun ride.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those sadistic producers are at it again, this time bringing interested viewers the sixth installment of the grisly series. The annual games have begun and center around Detective Hoffman who believes his tracks are covered after the death of a federal agent who happened to be his most dogged pursuer. Unfortunately for Hoffman, the agent left behind some pivotal clues that may allow his colleagues to discover the killer's true identity. Meanwhile, viewers are offered further insight into the mind and motivation of the deceased Jigsaw, and just what it was that drove him to do the things that he did. The amount of violence and gore is actually toned down a bit this one, and there are a few interesting twists here and there so as to avoid the sheer boredom of a slasher exercise. Clearly nothing special, but not bad by the standards of this series. **</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is in one word - great.Definitely the viewer should be aware, that this movie isn't fit for everyone - you have to be familiar with gore violence in movies before. But the same goes for the prequels and since Saw is quite a well-known franchise, this should already be known.On the other hand, explicit violence isn't what the movie is about. As well as the prequels, it caries an important message, it's just in violent context. But an observant viewer will see and be astonished by the way how everything fits. The movie does some explaining of the past, mostly with scenes from its predecessors, but you still have to be somewhat familiar with the story. And the story just gets clearer and clearer, with a lot of threads closing, but opening up new ones - the end is quite a cliffhanger. It's really amazing, how everything can be controlled by just one intelligent man and for such a long time. To some it may seem very fictitious, but it is really logical when you know all aspects of the story.It's really quite hard to write about the movie. Yes, I'm a fan, I just love the franchise in general. But I believe that it can offer an unfamiliar viewer something of real value. One just needs to accept that violence is just the movie's way of showing the importance of the message.So, I really recommend it, I really doubt you will regret seeing the movie, you just have to observe the story carefully."The choice is yours."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Saw VI</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's pretty amazing how a small film with essentially a two-man cast set predominantly in a stank toilet, could eventually spawn a franchise lasting 6 movies long now, and a contemporary cult anti-hero with Jigsaw and Tobin Bell the actor joining the hall of horror infamy. And what more too with the villain quite clearly not doing any killing himself, but does so indirectly through some mad scientist manner in creating ingenious contraptions that get audiences lapping up for more.One may add that Saw VI does feel like flogging a dead horse, since we know what happened to Jigsaw already in the past few films, but this installment pretty much showed that there's still one last fight left in ol' Jigsaw, which I hope will be its last outing because it pretty much wrapped up everything nicely. Unless of course you choose to interpret its finale as an open one.What I thoroughly enjoyed about Saw VI, is how it steered clear of being a parody of itself, or a flick out to exploit with a weak story. Here, the screenplay by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton infused some contemporariness in having a social aspect inserted. Instead of bumping off corrupt cops, drug addicts or folks who seem to live life for granted, they've added the unscrupulous characters from the healthcare insurance workers, whose flawed reasoning of probability turned away folks who are in need of help, and are in dire straits of treatment being denied unto them.Hiding behind "policy", they disengage without empathy and for selfish, personal gains, just like the protagonist in Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell. So it was somewhat a guilt trip in watching how these folks get their just deserts, and not to mention those lawyers who are lacking in morales of course, lending their expertise to ensure maximum profits. Amongst the victims here, while most show their true colours when faced with death, the lawyer is probably the one who will get your utter most attention, and chuckle too, and the behaviour exhibited.Granted there are less bizarre killings and contraptions here compared to its predecessors, but that doesn't mean that as a standalone film, your goosebumps won't stand. Starting with a bang, the simplest device involving a carousel, ended up the most gripping of the lot, where hard decisions have to be made in a race against time and pain, amidst plenty of accusations and revelations flying. Probably one of the less flashy Jigsaw designed death method, but one clearly the most horrendous of the lot.Saw VI follows the usual formula in explaining Jigsaw's rationale and methods, and the valuation of life which tie in pretty well with most of the earlier films, with the given twists at the end that helped to elevate this worthy as a "Saw" film, complete with double crossings that just beg for you to re-watch the earlier films. As I mentioned, it's a fitting finale to a long-running series, and I'd wish they stop now before the idea gets too stale, and subsequent effort really coming off as too trying and contrived. In other words, retire gracefully now while at the top of its game as the mother of all torture porn franchises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK story as a reason for deaths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to find a vehicle on which to hang a number of gory and contrived killings, I would be quite pleased if I came up with something as good as Saw VI.Although the deaths are, perhaps, not quite as grisly or elaborate as in some earlier offerings, the story is stronger, centring around a health insurance company which specialises in turning down claims made when people are most in need.And, for someone who actually died several episodes ago, the Jigsaw killer himself (Tobin Bell) puts in an extensive and surprisingly robust appearance. In fact, previous entries in the series are elaborated on and clarified - this is good from the point of view of plot strength, but not so good if you aren't always entirely clear who you're watching in the flashbacks, though: there is an assumption that you are completely au fait with everything which has happened in all five previous films.There is a pleasing plot wrinkle near the end, where an assumption you made earlier without realising it turns out to be completely wrong.Given that it delivers exactly what you expect, this isn't a bad entry in the series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly, the worst one ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So every review that I have read so far has said that this movie is the best and totally awesome. If you think this movie was so wonderful, then you're just gore fans and trap fanatics. I truly enjoyed the traps, but they had no moral concept. Only 3 people (besides the the 3 at the end) lived and that was based off of what on person chose. Completely stupid. The acting was somewhat good, but still could have been better. What I really didn't like was Hoffman. He is just a brutal killer and just heartless and lost sight of what John was teaching him. He went on a killing rampage during the movie and yeah it may seem bad-ass, but completely shows why he is tested in the end and should have died then. Also, the traps were stupid. I hate it when they make one stupid person choose who lives of some pretty deserving people. The Breathing Room was poorly chosen on John's part. He had no way for both people to redeem themselves. The Hanging Room was also poorly thought out. Neither of the 2 victims deserved to die and one had to die to William could learn? Total B.S. The Steam Room was the only acceptable one because she had a chance to live, but went crazy and tried to kill William and died. The Carousel Trap is my favorite and I don't know why, I just like it. Yeah, each person was working for a corrupt company, but no one could redeem themselves. The Acid Room was awesome. I loved it just because it was unexpected and gory. But William did redeem himself (in some way) and stupid Brent killed him. Anyways, this movie is by far the worst, story-wise and acting, but the gore was the only thing that kept me hooked.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw VI gave me something I didn't expect, it revived the series a little bit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the average entry that was number 5, I was about to say enough already because the formula was starting to become tiresome. I rented this with very low expectations, expecting a mediocre sequel, but what I got was something on par with the 4th sequel and managed to make me think and entertain me in the process. Saw VI is heavy in its detail which is a quality that I loved about the Saw films, and you can tell that the effort is back, I also loved the fact that Amanda had some bit scenes here as I loved her character. The only question I have now is where do they go from here?. Each time there is seemingly a new apprentice, a new twist but how much longer are they gonna be able to keep pulling these before it starts to bore the audience?. Besty Russel's added twist in her character was fun to watch, no doubt but they are obviously aiming to continue making money with these movies and if they aren't careful they are gonna tarnish some of the fond memories that the 1st few Saw Movies have given us.Performances. Tobin Bell is very effective as John and Jigsaw once again, I enjoyed the fact that he had more time as John here. Costas Mandylor intensity and his intimidating presence is top-notch, but his character is becoming increasingly dis likable. Betsy Russell's beauty is undeniable and her part is more expanded here and she rolled with it beautifully. Shawnee Smith does great in her flashback scenes. Peter Outerbridge is a likable weasel, he did great in his role. Athena Karkanis will be recognizable as Agent Perez from part 4, she did OK.Bottom line. It's still got a bit of life to it, but I still say they should stop before they tarnish its legacy. Its entertaining so I'm not gonna bitch much here. Recommended for a watch.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A huge improvement!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, did anyone have any other expectations for this movie than that it would suck? I didn't...but I was proved wrong! Yay! The movie starts with a bang and with a scene that will let you know what the Saw films are about: people having to make difficult choices and to experience extreme pain and suffering to survive. People fighting for their lives. The audience getting a run for their money. This is what we have come to see; blood, limbs getting cut off, disgusting trap and people screaming in pain.About 50% of this movie was flashbacks, ones that are familiar to us and ones that aren't. and that's what makes this film good. it doesn't sink to the level where it just another gross Saw-film. it's more, it tells you more about the characters, you get answers and you really get inside the story.About the traps. good. I think there has been better but I think these traps aren't as bloody as some of the earlier traps in the other films. and I like it, these traps are gross and scary and disgusting, but they also have a phychological effect on me. I almost threw up just thinking how it would feel like to get burned or to have barb wire around you neck. and those scenes weren't even that bloody! but they made me sick.Jigsaw... possibly the most interesting character in the history of film. Is he truly the twisted Robin Hood he seems to believe he is? Or is he just another individual, blinded by his own bitterness and desire to get revenge? I'm not sure I like Hoffman as a character, he doesn't have as much edge and that humanity Jigsaw had, but he is sure becoming more and more interesting.So overall, this is one of the best Saw-films. I'm a big fan of I and III. II, IV and V just pretty much sucked in my opinion. I'm hoping they don't mess up the next, because this movie made the Saw-world interesting again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Game Comes Full Circle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Special Agent Strahm is dead, and Detective Hoffman has emerged as the unchallenged successor to Jigsaw's legacy. However, when the FBI draws closer to Hoffman, he is forced to set a game into motion, and Jigsaw's grand scheme is finally understood.SAW VI is the point in the series where I'm starting to second think myself if I should continue with the series anymore. I have to admit, the movie is better than SAW V, but the set up in here is oh-so-familiar: A guy wakes up and finds himself in a grimmy old room where he has however many minutes to complete however many tasks to survive or whatnot. I've never been bothered by this set up until now.While watching the film, I found myself bored and slightly uninterested in what's going on on screen. The funny thing is that the film is less about the infamous traps and more about attacking on the issues of the health care and economy, which makes SAW VI the most relevant in its series. And yes, I think the addition of these issues puts a fresh spin to the series, along with the fact that I find these issues interesting.But what I hope for SAW VII is for it to do something different than a person awaking in a room to do a series of tasks. Saying that, I do like that this film did tie a lot of the plot lines made since the third film. I also liked seeing the returning of some old faces. However, the best thing of all is the last ten minutes of the film. It's truly jaw dropping and the ending is one of the best cliffhangers I've ever seen in this series in a long time.So yes, I probably will be seeing SAW VII next year not only because of the cliffhanger ending but because the filmmakers fixed their mistakes since the fifth film. The series is headed toward the right direction yet this is me being completely generous because I wasn't all "wow'ed" by it until the last ten minutes of the film. It's a decent addition to the series and the fans of the series will definitely like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mother of all the Saw Movies!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I begin to watch a SAW movie,there are a lot of expectations from it which to an extent were fulfilled by SAW 2-4,SAW 5 disappointed a lot,hence the director had a huge responsibility of executing SAW 6 with perfection inducing twists and more bloody traps,and I must say he did a fantastic job. This is what you call a real SAW movie, many questions which baffled us in the previous SAW movies are answered to perfection here. The Tagline is so perfect"The game comes full circle".The connection and interlocking with the SAW series is justified to the maximum extent here.We as viewers could not ask for anything more. I cannot wait for SAW 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the very best horror films for a long time, Saw VI really delivers on all fronts. It serves up victims we want to see punished, more history to Jigsaw, more intrigue as Hoffman runs the risk of being found out, and best of all (and I don't apologise for saying this), some fantastic visual horror. The opening sequence had me turning away from the cinema screen, its an achievement that the sixth instalment still has the ability to shock. Midway through, there is a torture carousel scene, which had me glued to the screen, its one of the most effective sequences in the entire series. When the film switched from gore to backstory, it held my attention as more and more pieces of the jigsaw (pun fully intended!) are put into place. Critics will moan that the continued inclusion of Tobin Bell's character is a sign of desperation, but the makers go to great lengths, for the fans, to ground it into the story and I found it compelling.Roll on many more sequels, if they can match this standard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Saw VI. A few twists, just as in the other installments Saw IV is is a little "heavy handed" with its politics, however. It certainly feels that film maker Michael Moore wasn't secretly a "special adviser" to Kevin Greutert and the producers... LOL! By the way, I am a Michael Moore fan so that wasn't a dig on him! I really enjoyed seeing Betsy Russell in this installment and the series. Where has she been hiding? I've had a thing for her since the 1983 film Private School came out. I would love to see her in a film that would bring out the true "cougar" in her! What a babe! Now back to Saw VI. I recommend seeing this film. It's true to the series and a worthy sequel in its own right. Just don't see it with anyone who is an Insurance Claims Adjudicator. LOL!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Halloween again and another round of Saw. Leaving Saw 6 was a very satisfying for the franchise and good way if the series is leading up to the end of the series.Of course as always Saw 6 opens with another Jigsaw trap. But what makes this Saw so much better than then the previous ones is the storytelling and the story of the Saw 6 itself. If you missed Saw 5 the ending of Saw 5 will be showed again in Saw 6.The story for Saw 6 is continuing Jigsaw's legacy and finishing his work. The story revolves around Health care and the big boss choosing who lives and who dies. Big boss of Health care eventually finds himself in his own trap set by Jigsaw. The interesting thing about this storyline is that Healthcare keeps being talked about in our news right now. I think this was a good storyline for the series.The ending for Saw 6 was descent and gives no indication on what will happen next. The series has come a long way. The biggest problem with the series it's not expanding the story to other areas of the country.If Saw 6 doesn't do well this year it's clear that it's because of "Paranormal Activity" being so successful and speculated for the last few weeks. Is the series really over if it fails this year? The answer is no. With Saw 7 already being made and in 3-D that just might help the series be on top again. We will see how this weekend fairs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In This Episode of The Jigsaw Show...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To my surprise this was not nearly as bad as I thought it was going to be. After SAW V, my hope for the series was much more minuscule. Now, it is somewhat renewed with SAW VI. While this entry didn't play a huge part in the overall scheme of things, it did provide plenty of entertainment with some fantastic Jigsaw flashbacks, some gnarly traps, and an overall theme to Jigsaw's latest game that had been missing.We find ourselves immediately following the death of Agent Strahm, with Hoffman now holding all the cards. However, he finds himself in danger when his fellow agents get dangerously close to the truth. In the meantime, a new game has been set up for another unfortunate victim who must face yet another of Jigsaw's intricate traps. While the films doesn't really elaborate on any grand scheme that Jigsaw has, which is a big disappointment, it does put back some of the things that were missed in the last couple of films. The film is basically the equivalent of an episode of television that throws in a few new Revelations, while dishing out a new, major test for some a-hole who probably deserves it.What shined here was, once again, Tobin Bell's fantastic portrayal of Jigsaw. Despite the character having died three movies ago, he still remains a fascinating character to watch through the flashbacks that show his life and fill in the gaps of the things we didn't see behind the scenes. He even has one of the best monologues of any SAW movie, which made my favorite scene. As long as Jigsaw continues to remain a part of the series, even in flashback, this series will continue to be worth watching. We also saw the return of the series of tests that were left out of the last two movies. And these are some of the best in the series. Just as well, for anyone who is looking for some gore and wince-inducing pain, you'll get plenty of that. It's good to see good traps return to SAW once again. Fans of the series won't be disappointed.One thing I found quite surprising, especially at this stage in the game (no pun intended), is the strength of the message this time around. While many will find some of what Jigsaw does contradicting to his overall philosophy, I found William's plight to be quite endearing. Some of the choices he is forced to make and the tests he must face actually pull you in and make you think and feel. It's surprising, indeed, but you can't help but ponder his dilemma when he has to stand there and watch the consequences of his actions, particularly at the end of the carousel test. I applaud the new director for taking the time to create this focus and it's nice to see this kind of though go into the film after two sequels devoid of anything of the like.Unfortunately, while this is all well and good, the rest is almost completely useless and disappointing. All of Hoffman's scenes are once again yawn inducing and he continues to be a terrible protg of Jigsaw. I have to question Jigsaw's judgment with using Hoffman to carry out his orders. Costas Mandylor continues to play Hoffman with a constant brood, and here we have a character who seems to have no real purpose in what he's doing besides making people suffer. Maybe that's his character, maybe he's supposed to be that way, however, even if Jigsaw isn't replaceable, Hoffman continues to confirm that he is a terrible replacement in any way. We also once again have useless Amanda flashbacks, with useless twists, and a useless connection to Jigsaw that makes me wonder why the writers bother to continue her story. Amanda served her purpose, and yet, she continues to haunt us with her stupidity. Most of the scenes involving Jigsaw's ex-wife, Jill, were decent. But, once again, they were fairly pointless. As I said, there is nothing here that adds to the overall grand scheme of things.This was my biggest pet peeve about this film. It's merely an episode, not another chapter, in the on going SAW saga. V added nothing as well, and it is starting to appear that we, as fans, are being strung along. Unless some pertinent information is divulged, such as clues as to how the games will end, if they will end, or the grand scope of who is involved, are answered, there won't be much of a point in seeing these films.With all that said, SAW VI should please fans. There's plenty of entertainment to be had, and what's good in the film is real good. It brings back what the series has needed for a while, while keeping all the same bad shite. Basically, it's still a nasty cake, but it's getting tastier. Hopefully, the filmmakers on this series can give us a bigger chunk of meat next time. Until then, enjoy SAW VI.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sixth Stab at "Saw"; Alas, More Puzzle Pieces Remain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is, perhaps, a testament to the fatigue of the "Saw" franchise that of all the narrative wrinkles that emerge in "Saw VI," the movie's biggest surprise (and maybe the most welcome one) is that it's not in 3D. (That's being saved for "Saw VII," according to current production rumors.) Alas, the creaking story lines and extraneous flashbacks remain stubbornly in place, threatening to suffocate even the movie's characteristic avalanches of spurting blood and flying chunks of flesh. The blood does spurt ? and liberally, as do the chunks of flesh fly ? but they seem like little more than afterthoughts this time around, racing across the screen in the usual whirligig, rapid-fire edits, though, at a slimmed-down 91 minutes, in record time. That any sense can still be made of the clutter this far into the proceedings is the sole triumph of this moderately clever, ludicrously protracted franchise. As resilient as cockroaches and just as repulsive (and disposable), these movies trade on the seemingly abhorrent idea that humans will pay to watch other humans suffer, which might be depressing if the filmmakers were actually attempting to stake a claim on seriousness here. Instead the bloodshed is dispensed smoothly, remorselessly, leaving little time for tears or even shivers of guilty pleasure. It doesn't help that the director, Kevin Greutert (previously the series' editor), scarcely seems to know what he's doing behind the camera, though at least he feels possessory enough to adorn the opening titles with the credit "A Kevin Greutert Film," an adjunct that really just makes it that much easier to shift the blame. There's really no point in discussing what's new in "Saw VI," largely because what's most interesting about its story is also not at all new. Roman numerals notwithstanding, this latest bloodbath offers up the same old masochistic butchery as its predecessors, if perhaps slightly more of it (it certainly stretches its R rating). The sobering paradox of the franchise is that while the producers have collectively honed their penchants for bloodletting, showing us more than ever before in extreme close-up and excruciating detail, they have also as a result seriously blunted the effectiveness of their own tactics and, in the process, lost sight of the sole reason we devoured these movies in the first place. Namely the human need to experience suffering beyond our own comfortable world, the need to be moved and shaken in ways that make us squirm and shudder and peer through our fingers at the screen, afraid to witness something that is now no longer there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent return to form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret that I love the initial two Saw movies. I've never denied the weaknesses of the films (particularly in the acting department), but have also never hid the fact that I hold the first two entries in extremely high regard. Providing a grueling sense of tension, as well as jaw-dropping plot twists, they're definitely among my most beloved horror/thriller films of all time. The three installments that followed, while not horrible, were significantly less enjoyable than the first two. I consider myself a fan of the series overall, however, and went into Saw VI with feelings of both excitement and apprehension. Fortunately, the sixth entry proves to be a return to form for the series, and an excellent film in its own right.One of the primary issues that many fans had with the previous two Saw films was that they delivered more questions than answers, to the point where ? perhaps ? there was too much build-up. Thankfully, however, the payoff is in this movie. The way in which writers Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton tie up such a multitude of loose ends in just a single film is far better than I ever could've hoped. If you're a fan of these movies because of the stories (as I am), then you'll be more than pleased with what Part VI has to offer. My only question now, though, is this: what the hell are they going to do for Saw VII? For those of you who are in it for the traps, rest assured that this is easily the most gruesome film in the series. The gore in entries IV and, especially, V didn't really phase me, and for the most part, the traps themselves really weren't all that inventive. The bar has definitely been raised this time around, though, with several scenes in particular that nearly had me turning away from the screen. And unlike Saw III, this film never feels like an exercise in gore just for the sake of gore.What really makes this film a step up from its last few predecessors, though, is that the main Jigsaw victim is actually relatively likable. Peter Outerbridge definitely surprised me with his performance as William, creating a flawed, yet compelling character. Even though this man does what he does, you sympathize with him as the film progresses, and you hope that, by the end, he'll have overcome these trials. Overall, Saw VI is a twistedly clever film that went well beyond my expectations, to the point where it may just usurp Saw II as my second favorite installment in the series. Virtually my only problem with the film is that, as in any Saw film, some of the acting is a bit suspect. If you're one of the many that absolutely despise this series, this film certainly isn't going to change your perspective. However, for those of you who are fans, Saw VI is an excellent return to form.</fullReview>

This is the sixth installment of the series and now they're just plan old slaughter movies. Like the first 3 movies were fantastic and the plot was on track but after the fourth one with the main killer dead and having two more apprentices, they have to stop making these god awful movies.If you're planning on being entertained by Saw VI, don't get your hopes up. Because I was just bored with this. Saw V was very similar as this and it's just plan torture watching this. I don't recommend watching this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While a long time Saw fan,the last 2 entries,(the vastly complicated part 4 and the flashback heavy part 5) in my opinion, really weakened what was a consistent franchise.For the new installment, long time Saw editor Kevin Greutert takes over for Saw V helmer David Hackl to inject a new perspective on the long standing torture franchise.In this entry, if you have read the synopsis by now you know that Detective Hoffman stands alone as Jigsaws successor and that Peter Strahm is dead.That pretty much is the most I can say about the plot since anything else that is said will ruin the movie.All i can say though is that this entry really put my excitement back in the franchise that was quickly dying. The acting is still quite flimsy,as per usual for the Saw series, but Tobin Bell lifts every scene he's in and has probably one of his greatest scenes in the series midway into the movie that without a doubt will make you realize that this series is nothing without Mr.bell.But of course the traps is what the Saw fans come for and there are the most inventive traps since Saw III,and once again nothing will be said of them until you watch the movie.To all interested Saw fans,most of the series unanswered questions pretty much get answered and brings a bit of finality to it,but its disappointing 2 more sequels got announced since i felt this was a good way to put the final nail in the series but we will see what the future holds</fullReview>

Nothing scary about these movies, and in my opinion not even close to being gross, but they are entertaining. And this one, Saw 6, is probably one of the most entertaining of the bunch. Tobin Bell kills it as always, terrific performance. The score from Charlie Clouser, amazing as always. And it's nice to see a few returning faces in this.

		<shortDescription>Another excruciating sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SAW VI is another fairly indistinguishable entry in the popular torture series that adds nothing more than a novel series of grisly deaths. The back story now is so complicated and caught up in itself that it's become highly boring ? there's barely enough plotting in these to sustain a week's worth of soap episodes, let alone six instalments of a film series. I couldn't help but chuckle as the scriptwriters think of more flashbacks just so they can bring back the long-dead Jigsaw and his accomplices for more screen time.As for the traps, there seems to be a genuine deficit of imagination this time around. The opening scene is the most gruesome and the most gratuitous, a re-run of the old Shakespearian 'pound of flesh' gag that Vincent Price performed so well in schlock-horror THEATRE OF BLOOD back in the day. Needless to say, this version is far more explicit and far more soulless. Later, there are hangings, shootings and stabbings, but they all seem routine and as if the writers struggled to bring anything new to the table. The acid trap is the only element displaying any level of imagination.So-called twists end up becoming pretty laughable and the usual settings of grim cell blocks and disused, run down buildings are by now all too familiar. Peter Outerbridge makes for a fairly interesting protagonist in this one, playing the head of a dodgy insurance company who does everything in his power to avoid paying out on claims. In our modern era of corrupt bankers and ruthless businessmen, he's a guy you love to hate as he undergoes his trial by ordeals. Certainly more interesting than the usual bland teenage types who populate these sorts of films.Still, SAW VI hardly makes for groundbreaking cinema: fans of this series will lap it up, and everyone else will wonder why they keep churning them out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A LOT better than #5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a review of the unrated directors cut. It picks up right where #5 lets off. SPOILERS Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is now carrying on Jigsaw's legacy. He has to punish an insurance executive named William Easton who is denying people their claims and killing them (sort of). He is set up to go through an elaborate (and deadly) series of tests where he has to choose who lives and dies...among his friends and family. Also Hoffman discovers they may discover he's taken over Jigsaw's "job" and might have to kill to stop them.Like the previous ones this starts right off with a gruesome test set up by Hoffman...and never stops. Like all the others this is grim and strong--no humor or lightness show through. The gore is exceptionally strong and brutal---even I had trouble watching it and I've seen some VERY gory movies! The carousel sequence is almost impossible to watch. To make it worse the acting is very good (with the sole exception of Mandylor) making it harder to watch. Also (unlike #5)this has a coherent story and is much easier to watch and figure out. It all leads up to a disturbing conclusion.VERY grim, dark and gory...but it does its job. It scares the hell out of you. An 8 all the way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SAW is back, let's hope the quality of this movie keeps up in SAW VII</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think this really needs an introduction as every Halloween, you know there'll be yet another Saw movie in the cinemas but have they finally stopped writing mediocre stories and uninteresting characters? Maybe?just maybe. The story is so much better than the last two movies and makes a lot more sense. Also, it clears up any confusion that you might have had watching the previous movies and doesn't ask many questions for Saw VII. The acting is so much better in this one too and Tobin Bell, once again, is fantastic as the twisted Jigsaw and VH1's Scream Queen winner Tanedra Howard was a delight to watch. The characters are better written as you actually cared for them and their situation. There isn't much character development but there is enough to keep you intrigued and interested in the characters. The direction has improved since Saw IV and the special effects and gore scenes are still very much realistic and shocking. The traps are quite clever and it makes you wonder how someone could come up with something so twisted. It worries you a little but it makes for a great horror movie.Saw VI puts the Saw series back on track, which I'm quite glad about because as a series, it's not bad. Everything about the movie has improved from the dire movies Saw IV and V. The best thing is the ending wasn't predictable which I loved. The end to the trap was truly shocking and probably the worst scene for blood and gore in the Saw movies since the third. The end of the story I didn't see coming so I'm glad it's got it's unpredictability back and I'm glad Saw VI put the series back on track, however the first remains the best movies in the series for me but this is a close second. Let's hope the next movie keeps it at this level of quality.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>well son far i haven't really been disappointed by any of the SAW movies so i really doubted that this one would.Tobin Bell did awesome as usual, Costas Mandylor has never been better in my opinion, Betsy Russell was great as ever as well.now for the negative, the traps where'nt as gruesome though still very entertaining and painful all the same, and (i don't know if i'm the only one who noticed this or not but) it seemed kinda sexist.though still a good installment and very very entertaining, also i love the unfolding music at the end.and thats why i give SAW VI 8/10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose there is nothing wrong with the Saw franchise deciding to use their annual release as a way of elaborating on their more and more and more and more and more and more contrived backstory by addressing newsworthy matters of concern like the grimy capitalistic disregard for human life by insurance companies and mortgage loan sharks. There is no way Jigsaw and his soulless apprentices, people responsible for arbitrarily abducting people and forcing them to subject themselves to self-mutilation and letting fellow victims die in order to survive unthinkably horrific deaths, could possibly assume any moral compass over people whose misdeeds are unjustified risk-based pricing and single-premium credit insurance. But that's not why we enjoy Saw VI. We enjoy it because we get to watch as predatory lenders are forced to desperately dismember their own flesh in a race to survive at one another's expense, because we get front row seats to see a health insurance executive and his company's callous lawyer left to engage in mortal combat, one struggling perilously to rip the other open with a circular saw for a key lodged inside of him, the other running out of time before a device on her chest is to fire a spike point blank through her head. Indeed what fun it is.But at that, I see that even though the story is finally showing some sense of finality---though I know that we won't be given a resolution until another billion dollars later when they get to Saw 10---and it's not losing steam in the department of coming up with devious booby traps and deadly games, the films are no longer about being creepy or frightening. The first Saw truly scared the daylights out of me. It wasn't that it was gory or high in body count but that it was claustrophobic even when the plot stretched outside of its main setting, a bleak dungeon bathroom. Saw never came up for a breath of sunny fresh air, even by its horrifying close, an ending that makes even the most audacious or arm's-length viewers sleep with the light on. The subsequent series has been unusually and admirably faithful to its more psychologically driven gimmick, each film climbing the limits of narrative intricacy and formidable scenarios, but now that everything that remained obscure to great effect in the first, and even second, Saws is now debunked and elaborated on to the umpteenth degree, I am never at any time scared by even the most gruesome contraption concocted here.Between a power struggle for Jigsaw's legacy, a police investigation running around in circles much like the iconic Saw pinwheel, and annexed instigators for Jigsaw's initial doings, this sixth installment contains the most characters in any Saw film to date including a plethora of new characters. It remains faithful to preceding story tiers, eschewing as many breaches of sense-making and chronology as possible for a film about the most improbable and overelaborate serial killing spree in the history of the world. Again, the claustrophobia has completely evaporated. Yes, the visual palette is drained of all but the steeliest of color shades and doused in shadow and rust, but effective cinematography was not all that made the beginning of the franchise as scary as it was. It was that two people awakened to find themselves trapped in a room with no choice but to follow rules that would result in the death of at least one of them. The mastermind was so evasive that even when we realized who was the true brain behind it all in the final thirty seconds, we were left in the same state of shock and bewilderment as the final, mortified victim. Now, watching Saw VI, I am surrounded by a cast of Robert Altman proportions populating a plot of Guy Ritchie clockwork intricacy.At any rate, I do enjoy Saw VI for the story it offers me. It isn't merely a streamline of vindication against the instigators of our recent economic downturn. Well, it definitely is, but they aren't all purely pop-ups for Jigsaw to squash for us; some are confronted with moral dilemmas they with their power to look down on all other human beings have been avoiding their entire greed-fueled careers. The devices and quagmires in Saw VI are more personal to the victims. They have to make emotional choices about people they see and work with every day. This is not to say they all take the higher ground rather than snarling against each other to save themselves, but in Saw's finest tradition, the victims are forced to confront their own demons, by a demon.Directed by the editor of the first five Saws, a snug, solid, terse thicket of shock and brutality is manufactured about as well as it can be with the obese content it has to work with. This is as much as we can ask for, I suppose, from what is essentially a slasher sequel, a product of modern Hollywood compulsion. And it won't stop till the money stops. And Saw VI made a nice, juicy $51 million profit stateside.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still not a good movie, but it's one of the best in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This franchise has been shot down, ran over, stab repeatedly, but still somehow find away to release a new instalment every year. The first Saw was a revelation to the genre, 2 and 3 didn't compare but still watch able, 4 grew tedious, 5 was a cinematic middle finger and now 6. Although Saw 6 isn't particularly a good movie, it's still is one of the best in the series. First off, this movie actually has somewhat of a plot and introduces a bigger and more political side to Saw. Everything in this movie that wasn't about the health care industry was just s**t. The main character who has been in the past 3 movies is one of the weakest leads ever in a horror franchise and he adds nothing here. Unlike it's proceeder's, this is actually a really entertaining and interesting addition to the series. Even though we still can't forgive Saw V, this was actually quite an improvement.The gore here is brutal as ever and really delivers the sadistic appetite, but every time the movie becomes slightly interesting, it just cuts away from the action to a less engaging so the tension never sticks. Also, again, it is a saw film so we do get below par direction, weak script and the 'OH NO' acting, so nothing new here. And the signature Saw plot twist really feel forced in and they didn't fit with the on going plot that has been carried through out the series. The writers will just f**k your head up, just to shock you, and honestly just fail to convince us that these weak characters are worthy of such cruelty. Surprise, the ending leaves us with an unfinished climax, and even though this was quite satisfying, we are still not rooting for Saw 7.Overall. Still, not a good movie, but Saw Iv is one of the best in the series. As bad as it is, it really does deliver on the guts and surprisingly a better story. Fun for some, but please, stop this machine.5/102/12 out of 5Simpson Reviews</fullReview>

You see the crazyness??Completely non-sensical waste of time. Some people may enjoy/humour the gore in the movie, some may be afraid of it.

		<shortDescription>Saw's Sick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The series reached its undisputed lowest ebb with the boring, unbearable Saw V. With appropriately-named director David Hackl out and series editor Kevin Greutert in it was a chance for a fresh approach. With better lighting, less aggressive editing and sound, and a far superior script Saw VI manages to be the best sequel. What a difference these small changes make.As I write this review the US government is currently shutdown because, in essence, the Republican's want poor people to die. The healthcare and insurance racket that US citizens are unfortunately stuck with is the end result of corporate greed and human evil. It's a situation wide open for satire and Saw VI nails it to the wall, however unsubtle.Picking up right after Agent Strahm has been crushed to death at the end of Saw V, the movie follows Detective Hoffman as he attempts to pull off Jiggy's last plan and distract the Feds from finding out who he really is. Flashbacks (a little more tastefully done this time, even though some of them have their own flashbacks) reveal that John Kramer was turned down by the Umbrella Insurance Corporation (er...do Capcom know about this?) for funding of experimental cancer treatment thanks to the small print.With Jiggy dead, Umbrella CEO William Easton thinks that he has been spared from his wrath. Wrong! Easton is kidnapped by Hoffman and thrown into a nerve-wracking gauntlet in which faces four tests to decide who from his team can live and who will die. It's a dilemma that he should be familiar with. So it shouldn't be too much trouble. Right? Of all Jiggy's victims William Easton is the best since Doctor Gordon, and his journey through an abandoned zoo, as he faces guilt and shame while saving his colleagues is very effective. A shame it is spoiled by the arrogant, teenage brat at the end. Even Detective Hoffman becomes a better character. By this point, in October 2009, I had written off the Saw series as V was really that bad. I only returned out of curiosity to see if we would finally find out what happened to Doctor Gordon. While that didn't happen Hoffman really takes over as a twisted, conflicted antagonist. I hated him in V. He's awesome in VI.This sixth installment really does get the series back on track. The usual faults are still in there, but they are thankfully dialed down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the worst one yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once one of my favorite movie franchises the saw films have finally been reduced to this. These movies kept getting worse and worse and I knew this one would likely be the same but I was interested in the story line and I was hoping it might be different. I was terribly wrong...the acting was appalling almost offensive to the hearing. The story line even when it wrapped up was very disappointing for a six film build up.This movie is about more twists and turns as yet another predecessor of jigsaw is apparently around setting up ridiculously impossible scenariors for people to kill them selves in.This movie just sucks as you can tell by my description. If you are a fan of the series you might as well watch this just to see how all the lose ends are tied up( not well at all) but other then that movie goers skip this one I warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>story about jigsaw is okay, the traps are becoming stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kevin Greutert, the editor of previous Saw entries was asked to direct part 6. He did and did well but this time I saw for the first time a fault. On the eleventh minute you can see a sound boom reflecting in a window, it even moves and it takes a whole minute before it disappears. It's strange that a million seller afford such mistakes. What this part does is going deeper into the problems John Kramer had with his insurance once he knew he was sick. The revenge towards the boss/friend of the insurance is what this flick is about. Of course we still go deeper into the box that John's wife had been given after John died. A thing that wasn't explained in part 5. Sadly for me this was the worst entry. The torture porn is left for just a big game with steam and acid. The gore is still available but we are so far away from Jigsaw's traps. And it showed, on the forums people were tired of Saw. Still, if you really could follow the story so far you wanted to know what is going on. So we still go deeper into Hoffman. By now we know who is Jigsaw, and who Amanda really was and why Hoffman is involved in Jigsaw's traps. Overall the story is okay but again we are moving further away from the traps, the traps are just a maze full of steam or a gun shooting some innocents. Really one for the Saw geeks.

		<shortDescription>Miss ye old Saw films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I confess I WAS a big fan of the Saw saga (though I should call it "Saw franchise" as others did). I am telling you this, so that you realize that my analysis is objective enough when criticizing the people from Lionsgate.Luckily for me, didn't pay the ticket for this one. Internet is a huge place and, given time, you get to find what you need for free.Although Saw 6 was better than Saw 5 (because saw 5 was way TOO predictable and stupid), it looks that they are still running downhill. What happened to the style of the four first movies? I mean, Hoffman sucks dicks.There are no twists in the movie, there is no tension. Hoffman kills people with out sending a message to society, and when he's discovered his just shoots the police officers. Would Jigsaw kill someone with a gun? NEVER! I think Lionsgate had the chance to end the saga with style and a golden clip on this one, but instead they chose profits. Such a shame, since what might have been a cult classic is about to become horse crap.Oh, by the way they are planning to do (AT LEAST) two more movies. It's more than I can take. Guess i had to much Saw.One final thing. I find to be quite suspicious some of the reviews posted here. Lots of "brilliant, superb, amazing, aweome, best movie so far!!!" in the reviews. mmmmm.... someone paying for good reviews for this movie on IMDb?PS: the acting is sometimes SO BAD that near the end you see that Hoffman doesn't even touch the neck of the FBI agent with his knife (next time, hire better FX specialists).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though its the best of the recent films in the series, this will confuse anyone not very familiar with all the other films in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to get into the whys and wheres of this film. Just know that its better than most of the previous entries in the series. While it does have the numerous torture devices that have made the series a hit (And I won't get into the whole question about the time to do these things), its less a torture porn film then before. There is plot and character development. Which brings me to the real problem with the film, namely that unless you are fluent in the series the film is impenetrable. I've seen all the films when they were released to theaters, but with the exception of the first film, I've only seen them once. The upshot of this was that I don't have a working knowledge of the plot intricacies of the series so by half way into this film I felt hopelessly lost. In all honesty I walked half way into the film not because it was bad, rather because I had no idea what was going on and didn't care. As far as I'm concerned the series is done and should be put on the shelf. Anytime you make series that requires intimate knowledge of every previous film you're automatically shrinking your audience, and this series has done that. Regrettably they've announced a new film for next year, which I will probably suffer through simply because the 3D effects (yes the sequel will be 3D) will probably be gory fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm afraid it just doesn't feel like Saw anymore...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the Saw franchise and have not failed to see each film over and over again. I couldn't wait to see the sixth film, and when I finally did, I felt like I had wasted those days of getting hyped about it.I had high hopes for this film, seeing as the first four were amazing, and that the crew had said that they had learnt from their mistakes from the fifth film.I'll give it that it was better than the fifth, the acting was better, the action was better, a better twist at the end. But whilst I was watching I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a fractured movie, a movie that had parts missing, or sometimes even watching a different movie entirely.I didn't feel like I was watching Saw. The presence of Jigsaw looming over the film I feel is gone. Even though they brought Tobin Bell back for a lot of flashbacks, I didn't feel like the writers have connected with Jigsaw, or understand who he was. Similarly with Amanda, Jill etc. The presence of those characters is no longer the same. They seemed to have changed the characters just to fit the story that they want to tell.The twists at the end, not the major ones, but the ones that linked back to previous movies didn't work for me, simply because it's obvious that when Saw 3 and 4 was written, the writing of Saw 6 hadn't been planned. For example *spoilers* we find out what was in Amanda's envelope, but it is clear in Saw 3 from her reaction that it was never planned to be what Hoffman supposedly wrote in Saw 6. This is the case for the other links too in my opinion.Also, seeing as the film was said to be the best in the franchise, that Jigsaw's game was finally going to be understood, that all questions would be answered, I have to say that to me none of this was met. I am none the wiser about Jigsaw's overall plan than I was when I was watching the fifth. None of my questions from the previous films were answered unfortunately, and things I were hoping for, such as maybe getting a glimpse of the infamous bathroom, were nowhere in sight. But no, it didn't feel like Saw, the atmosphere that was created with the first three movies has well and truly gone. Even when Hello Zepp started up, it felt like it shouldn't be there, and that's what usually gets My heart racing during a Saw movie.All this said, I wouldn't have missed it, I'm glad I saw it just so I know the next part of the story, but the only problem was it felt like I was being told a different story than I was with the other films. Overall, I have not fallen out of love with the Saw franchise, I'll still watch the seventh, I'll still watch my DVDs, I'll even buy the DVD of the sixth, but something was missing from this movie and it's definitely near the bottom of the scale of my favourite Saw movies.</fullReview>

Thats it? iv got a 100 to choose from for that matter. Im beyond,maybe behind wht u r trying to show now. OK, maybe I'm being too harsh, but I'm evaluating Saw, so i set the standards accordingly. With Saw, i'm used to watching a gore flick with that level of intensity and a commensurate plot and plot twist. And all i get for the last 2 years is gore (not surprised, its a part of the film) and buildup. Either i am too harsh or maybe the new director should just watch the first 4 parts and compare them with what hes been dishing out over the recent period. If u have any consideration for the audience show something in line with what we expect or just stop it. V have seen enough. U tell the audience the legacy is understood and bla bla, but face it, the movie starts and ends just where the last part took off. I mean come on any1 could say if Jill hid the extra envelope, she had no1 else but Hauffman in mind, else who would go thru all the trouble of capturing 1 victim when u have a cop doing all the dirty work for u? Wht happened to the twist in the Saw movies? Is this aspect over? R u just selling gore? The story is fine, not good not bad but come on guys we are talking jigsaw here,I need better. Just sequel after sequel every year for commercial reasons isn't good enough. For all those who have not seen this, its just the last part reproduced a couple of steps and a few loose ends tied up. A years wait for nothing special. Either give us commensurate to Saw or just stop it, enough. Jigsaws legacy understood by whom? What legacy? Just pull in the audience and show them something? Thats all u got? If so i fathom games really over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step in the right direction that fans will love, even if it still has a lot of problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite watching them when they hit DVD, I somehow got dragged into seeing Saw VI theatrically. I have never been overly impressed by the series, but I always enjoyed watching the films anyway. Going in with low expectations made Saw V more than tolerable, so I did the same with Saw VI.With virtually no one left to test him, Agent Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is fairly certain he has gotten away with continuing Jigsaw's (Tobin Bell) work well after he had passed away. As a new game is ready to begin, and the FBI continuing their investigation into a possible apprentice, Hoffman realizes it may not be as easy as he thinks it is.Saw VI is not a great movie by any means. But if you are a fan of the series, or you have just stuck by it from the beginning, it is a very worthwhile experience. While previous films only nodded at the appearance and importance of Jigsaw's ex-wife Jill (Betsy Russell), she becomes a main player here and her entire crux and reason in the series is explained. We learn more about Hoffman, and his work as an apprentice while Jigsaw was still alive, and we even get to learn a bit more about Amanda (Shawnee Smith), an interesting character who had been forgotten since Saw III. And what would a Saw movie be without more material to add to the Jigsaw mythos? Saw VI delivers story elements by the dozen. Sure, it offers the same typical questions that every Saw film does, but it answers more than they usually do. The series has always been one for the next film to build off the films before it, and offer more tantalizing details explaining everyone's actions and reactions. But in previous films (specifically parts four and five), a lot of the story elements are enigmatic and littered with throwaway plot elements that are next to useless in the grand scheme of things. Here, the details are important. There is actual development going on, and it only took three years to get it! Of course, not everything is wrapped up nicely, but it was a welcome change to having to sit through agonizingly badly written scenes that force you to see the next movie to get answers.What I also appreciated were the traps and games being played throughout Saw VI. While the imaginative design is starting to fall apart, reality is beginning to sink in a little more. The limits on graphic violence continue to be pushed, but the traps now seem more real, more creative to fit the confines of human design. Sure, there are still the ridiculously nightmarish traps, but the majority here are simple and straight-to-the-point. They feel proper, without seeming like they are going over the top. They looked and felt more mature in a way, like the filmmakers were going for a different feel and look this time around. We still get the gritty, disturbing viewpoint that David Hackl introduced in Saw V, but Kevin Greutert's installment manages to manipulate the viewpoint to feel different and like the series has begun to learn that it needs to evolve or be dismissed by the audience. It may have come a bit too late, but as said, it was a welcome change that really made the movie feel a lot stronger.But of course, there are problems that continue to plague the series. Although very few new characters are introduced (and even less that we have to pay attention to), the filmmakers still try to shove in as much emphasis on each as they can. It is nice to see everyone getting a chance to shine here, but some of the characters really did not need to have more than a few lines. Why bring people back only to do away with them moments later? I could have done with a little less of Peter Outerbridge's William, and more Jigsaw, Jill or the frequently underwritten Hoffman (although he finally gets enough screen time to fulfill his goal of being the primary live villain). And bad dialogue abounds through most of the film when we are not listening to person after person screaming their heads off. After six films, you would imagine they would have learned how to adapt the dialogue better, but alas, it continues to be a problem.While I did praise how realistic a lot more of the film seemed to be, the film still managed to have absurdly ridiculous over-the-top sequences. I imagine they were meant to terrify the audience, but I did nothing but laugh my head off. An early scene involving two players and their pounds of flesh should have been horrifying. Instead, it comes off as laughably bad. And while these scenes are sprinkled throughout the movie (alongside much better written and filmed sequences), they stick out as feeling improperly placed. It is clear from the offset the tone has changed for Saw VI, so why include ludicrous scenes that belong in an earlier film or another film altogether? I imagine the filmmakers did not think that fans would get their intentions, and they were forced to add these silly scenes in. It feels careless, and it chips away at one of the few good things about the film.Saw VI is an enjoyable entry in the popular franchise, and a good step in the right direction after Saw IV and Saw V nearly derailed the entire series. It has its share of problems that do not seem to go away, but it manages to improve on issues I never thought it would even consider. It just seems like it may have been a little too little too late for the filmmakers. Maybe 3D will help next year? 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Halloween - that means, it's time for Saw. The yearly outing that has now become a cult trip to the cinema keeps going strong. By the 5th sequel in a horror series, many will think 'Let's keep milking it for the sake of it'. But the Saw series is very different.However, going to see this film without seeing the previous 5 films isn't advised. As a fan, even I struggled with the plot and flashbacks in parts, but the film didn't disappoint. Loose ends were wrapped up, the traps were ever present, and director Kevin Greutert keeps to the grainy, industrialised feel we have grown accustomed to since James Wan's Saw I, and as ever, the elaborate and sadistic glee remains - an example of this is the introduction sequence, enough to make anyone leave the cinema with their hands over their mouths.Tobin Bell's fiendishly clever serial killer Jigsaw may well be long dead, but the games keep coming, right to the very end.Taking all this into account, the franchise should really end next year, as there are still a few plot holes that need covering, and its rationale got too tangled somewhere between the sadistic Saw III and Saw IV, and unfortunately, its target audience are only those who can handle pure gore and violence, or the fans who have stuck with this since Saw I.The film is without a doubt better than Saw V, and, as ever, the intertwining plot twists will keep you on the edge of your seat, wanting more. So, if you are a fan and have seen all the previous entries, this won't disappoint, and leads to an ending that'll leave you ready for Saw VII next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>deeply flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a huge fan of the SAW franchise. I love the convoluted story lines, the premise of a flawed morality and the twists and reveals that characterise each episode. I eagerly watched all 5 films (again) in preparation for this with a friend, sharing the complexity so we could both enjoy the installment. But I have to say I felt quite let down. The story barely functioned in its own right at all. So many flashbacks that are levered in rather than occurring naturally as previously. The editing was prosaic and rudimentary. Plot-wise, many of the victims had no business being there. They simply served as choices for the the protagonist, who in turn was a choice himself ("It's not my game!") for the REAL test subjects , who seem to have not done anything at all to elicit Jigsaw's ire at all. (Sure Hoffman has set the traps but to Jigsaw's instructions). I can't believe Jill's involvement, there seems no justification at all bearing in mind her history. Amanda and Hoffman's childish exchanges seems out of character (for him at least), in fact why Hoffman is continuing at all considering his question of "how many more of these are there?", is a mystery in itself. The set pieces such as Hoffman's being caught out and his escape is trite and clichd beyond acceptability. I simply don't expect such hack writing from the SAW series. In fact, Hoffman himself is a poor substitute for Jigsaw, with little insight given into his motivation, a pale and lacklustre opponent for the standout Straum in the first place. The ending is rushed and unbelievable and is telegraphed pretty much from the beginning of the film. As I mentioned I am a huge fan, and I can understand fans loving it as well just for the fact the series is continuing. But leaving aside fandom, this is a badly written story that breaks away from the series. I don't even recall any in-camera cuts from the first viewing, a previous signifier of the unique style. I feel apologetic to my friend who had also come to expect a great film only to find a deeply flawed one, one that has a jigsaw piece missing, itself.Fingers crossed for SAW 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Franchise on the decline....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the series, I felt compelled to turn up for the latest instalment. This weekend, "Paranormal Activity" has beaten it to the number one spot, and maybe the bubble has finally burst. Saw VI is just downright silly, yet enjoyable enough if you don't think too hard about it. The new villain, a working police officer, somehow finds the time ? and resources ? to construct massive torture labyrinths. I liked the line of thinking behind the selection of victims in this film, there seemed to be much more consideration and back story. On the other hand, the impenetrable chamber they are trapped in, and the lengths to which the new villain goes to, to snare and set up each victim, is so implausible and contrived, as to be laughable. It just isn't realistic anymore. Well, alright, it was never realistic, but as we come to the sixth film, all pretence has gone. For the film to be scary, there should be some element of realism, as was the case in the first couple of films. Now, the new "jigsaw" is somehow able to build these inescapable dungeons, and plant his victims in it, while holding down a full time police officer's job, who's main case seems to be investigating his own crimes ! Maybe the Saw series jumped the shark in film 4, once Tobin Bell's character had died. Anyway, good things about Saw VI ? some inventive torture devices, some gruesome deaths, and generally solid action and effects. The negatives ? Too many flashbacks, a main storyline that is too implausible, and confusing subplots involving Jigsaw's widow, and a former female helper. Just how many people has Tobin Bell's character got running around slaughtering each other ?! Lionsgate will flog the series to death and fair enough, this is a commercial world we live in, but the end is clearly in sight. Saw 7 is going to be 3D, a gimmick which might help revive the franchises' flagging momentum, and while I sort of admire Lionsgate for their sheer tenacity in keeping the series going year after year, the demise is inevitable and perhaps the film maker's failure to take things in another direction (prequels maybe?) is partly to blame. Each new instalment seems to be cluttered with more back story and flashbacks, as they seek to justify the new developments with a plausibility that, this far into the series, has long since gone down the pan. Enjoyable enough, compared to most horror films released these days, but the Saw series has seen better days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Have Left It At Three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're just dying to see how the Saw saga ends, then go ahead. See Saw VI, I can't say that you won't be satisfied, but in my opinion, Saw III would have definitely been where I'd have ended the series.While SAW VI does it's best to tie up the entire thing, it's severely lacking in some areas that are key to making a Saw movie more than just some random torture-porn. One is characters we care about. Sure, it's all nice to see these people running about, but especially in this movie and in the past couple, the characters are all new and are so wrapped up in all the other story arcs that they get no development, they have no feelings, and therefore we just don't care. THe reason Saw I-III worked was that we actually had characters that meant something to us. If you're going to wrap up something as huge as Saw, then by the sixth installment we want some familiarity, at least character-wise, so that it actually means something to us.The second piece missing was a good twist. Sure, there was a little bit of a eye-widener at the end, but the intended shocker was something that was way too foreshadowed and way too predictable. It's like the makers of the Saw movies have decided that audiences are too stupid and so they lay out the pieces of the puzzle plainly and even then they enter flashbacks from previous movies or memories that seem unnecessary. I longed for an ending reminiscent of the first two (the only real shockers) or even close to the third (which was alright, but still wasn't as great as the first), but there was none. It was just something they put there hoping to satisfy audiences.Lastly, and what was perhaps most missed and the biggest flaw of the second trilogy of the saga, was that Jigsaw is not present. Hoffman has never garnered any interest of mine, I have never cared for him. Even Amanda was interesting, but Hoffman, he's whatever. And that right there is why it doesn't work.Overall, the gore and the traps were pleasing eye-candy (although i still long for the more creative methods of the first two where there were no giant machines that, when they had to have been brought into place, probably would have caused some suspicion). If anything, that's what saved this movie from a horrible downfall. I found Saw VI to be the ending I expected from the direction the movies were headed, and I'm glad to see Jigsaw finally, and truly at rest. Hopefully, he stays that way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you think it's possible that Jigsaw is really Professor Peabody, and all these last second revelations that have become the hallmark of the Saw franchise are more the outcome of some fancy work with his time machine than any actual brilliant sequence of planning? Okay, I admit, it's a long shot, and I'm not actually serious: however is it even possible to take these movies seriously anymore, given how they've gone from being ground breaking to being formula?In this episode of "Saw," we learn the following lessons: - Subprime mortgage brokers BAD! - Health Insurance people BAD! - Lawyers BAD! - Journalists mostly BAD! - Psychopathic, stupid, corrupt cops BAD!Of course enter in the obligatory gore, more victims, and a methodical logic that completely fails to live up to it's own preachy rhetoric, and it should be said that not only has Saw betrayed it's own vision, but in fact it has obscured it to the point that it has become little more than a director impersonating a psychopath, playing a head game with all of us!After all, the lesson that memories of Jigsaw continue to elude to is the inability to comprehend just how the meaning of life becomes most apparent to those about to lose it- so what lesson does it really teach when the victims, for the most part, are living and dying at the whim of a hamster in a cage?Oh, for those looking for a more through review, complete with spoilers, here it is:Two sub-prime mortgage brokers square off in the first game: who will give up the most flesh to save themselves from having screws drill through their head and into their skulls?Then, a health insurance executive and a journalist are kidnapped. The journalist, along with a woman and her son, have just been locked away: however the executive is set through paces where he is supposed to help a lawyer run a maze to survive, decide whether his single file clerk or his elderly secretary deserve to live, and then which four of his six hardworking underlings will die of gunshot wounds.Throw in a role for the family of a man who died of a denial of coverage decision, a past revealed between the executive and Jigsaw, more dead FBI agents, and the role Jigsaw's wife played in his misdeeds, and what you have is a ridiculous movie which will yield yet another ridiculous, formula written sequel next October unless the box office kills it this year!Don't waste your time or money on this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well... It's become a bit of a soap opera by this point, with all the increasingly convoluted flashbacks and scenes from previous films revisited from a new angle. But I enjoy that aspect (despite the trashy dialogue and acting) more than the traps, which have to get sillier and more disgusting with each go around in order to outdo the previous sequel. This time we also get some social commentary on the subject of health insurance, which leads to some blackly comic moments but not much else; the movie is 90% misery and that gets wearing after a while. Still, at least they're trying. And the cliffhanger is a corker.</fullReview>

The worst case in Saw VI, is the final trap for William. Let's just say, that the director and writer did not contact a chemist, and neither seemed to have a clue about what would happen. There's a fine line between utterly cool and unrealistically silly. Saw VI is crossing this line way too often and that is a bad thing.I do like the storyline, and the characters are fairly three dimensional. Very nice to see Shawnee Smith back again. Amanda Young is a fairly complex and interesting character.Pretty good, but by no means on the level of Saw, Saw II and Saw III.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw 1, THE original "SAW" was definitely a masterpiece. Intelligent, smart, tricky, amazing atmosphere. Like pretty much all the continuation franchises first part is the best. Saw VI can be best described as NOT Saw. Franchise is dying especially due to extensive use of torture, sadism, disclosure of leading roles .... It has all the negative points that original "Saw" was not having. It is not intelligent, it is predictable, it is straightforward, it is way too "sadist" movie. Movies like this one (pure bloody nonsense) and Hostel could be categorized in special section, far from being horror. I suggest "S/M". To avoid just negative critics it has some good points like an attempt of description of real human nature and characters. Why someone lives and why the other one dies is purely in the hand of god - ups, the director. It really makes no sense. You can find a reasonable explanation of the choice, however you would have been able to find it also if the choice would be different. Otherwise it is technically correctly done movie with few goofs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Delivers the goods for fans of the SAW series, and it's amazing how the writers still manage to conjure up new ways of featuring Tobin Bell as Jigsaw, via some very interesting flashback sequences. This time Detective Hoffman is carrying on Jigsaw's legacy of setting deadly games of death for selected victims, and he's trying to blame the murders on Agent Strahm. The main pawn this time is an unscrupulous health insurance provider who denies claims to chronically sick people when they need coverage most. That's a target most audience members can jeer against. On a side note, I think it's very impressive that a new chapter in this series has managed to make it to theaters in time for Halloween, every year like clockwork. Even the extensive Friday THE 13TH saga never managed to pull that off. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I say it was too politically charged, what I mean is, is that there was clear message that Insurance people are just a bunch of evil parasites who are nothing less than murderers.I mean if you believe that, I don't know what to tell you but the message was portrayed in such an over the top manner as to be quite annoying. It was hammered into you in nearly every scene. John brings up the clich'd yet flawed logic that other countries have significantly better healthcare systems by identifying that some eastern countries have you pay when you're healthy, instead of when you're sick. I failed to see the point because either way you have to pay correct? Regardless it hardly seemed worthy that this man should die due to the system in place here.And the portrayal that all insurers have in place a team whose sole mission it is to deny your coverage based on any little picky discrpancy on your application is paranoid at best and quite unbelievable.Likewise the criticism of the insurance formala is ridiculous. Does John realize the goal of an insurance company is to make money? It's a business afterall. They aren't going to pay him $300,000 for his treatment if they only expect to recover $30,000 over his life in premiums. Would you take a $270,000 loss? Insurers aren't charities. They aren't morally bound to pay for everything you need just because you want them to.So all in all the whole demonization of this guy as an insurance provider is laughable. I love my insurance, it's been great. Now when they make a saw about trapping my politician who voted for higher taxes and trying terrorists in US civilian courts, then I'll take a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First up, Saw 6 is better that 5, 4 and 3, and probably on par with 2. While this movie definitely redeemed itself over the terror that was Saw 5, there are still things about the franchise that annoy the hell out of me. In the original Saw, it was about "Saving Yourself". Now, it is always one person saving others (Jeff in Saw 3, Rigg in Saw 4 -Kind Of- and now William in Saw 6). It just seems strange and kind of annoying.Another thing that gets me is that while the traps are imaginative, it is ALWAYS "sixty seconds before you die". It has become redundant and it gets really annoying to watch. The original trap in Saw took 6 hours, and that movie was by far the best movie - why change a winning formula? Now that I've ranted, I will say that Saw 6 had a good number of twists including the characters of Hoffman, Cecil, Amanda AND a certain detective we all thought dead. I will say this however; I don't like Jill Tuck.All in all, Saw 6 was bearable but after 6 films you kind of wonder where they can take the franchise from here. With 7 and 8 confirmed, you have to wonder if these movies are ever going to match up to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Bad As Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, the first Saw was good, as much as I hate it, I admit it. It was something interesting with a good ending. But dear God, five more movies?! Oh, damn, the seventh one is coming... And of course, each one worse than the previous one. Saw VI was as bad as I expected. Firstly, it started as all other parts. Nothing new, nothing extraordinary, nothing INTERESTING. Secondly, I believe that the majority of people have the gift of logic, but the director (or who the hell...) of Saw VI - let's make an exception. For example: if you had 90 seconds to live and you had to escape, would you stand 30 seconds in one place and scream while doing nothing? Thought so. Also, the first scene where the girl tries to cut off her hand (to the musical rhythm of course, oh, let's make a "Saw Infinity - the Musical") was so poor it hurts. You can actually see that the hand is made from low quality rubber (economical crisis?). Thirdly, the acting was a huge embarrassment not only to professional actors, but also for the public. It seems that the actors were payed not in money, but in bottles of beer, so there was no motivation to try harder. And all those flashbacks were annoying. Simply annoying. The absurd part (just one from many) was that the poor janitor got into that mess because... he was smoking. How low on imagination can you be to think this up? Rhetorical question. But the saddest part is that the movie SO predictable. You could predict the words, the movements, the decisions, even the killing devices (which had a LOT of drawbacks, oh, right, it's logic again)... I guess that was the reason why FOR THE FIFTH TIME (not counting the first time), it was boring to watch. And I bet the psychopathic maniac (or should I say, a devoted woman) in part NO.7 will be John's wife. Now that's unexpected... If there will be a part NO.8, 9, 10 maybe their unborn baby will fulfill "John's will" ? So in conclusion, dearest public: Go and see how NOT to make a movie. It's a perfect example of lack of imagination, logic and, of course, a thing called dignity. Or at least knowing where to stop...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's that time again, no, not for chocolate cake. No, not for another George W. joke. That's right, Saw 6! Wow, who would think that back in 2003, these movies would just keep going and going and going? Not just like every couple of years, but every year we have a Saw sequel. I'm not going to lie, it's not a strong series, but it always keeps me coming back for more. Yeah, I'm sick of torture porn, but I'm always curious where they're going to take the story next. We've had a slope in the Saw films, ever since 3, they've lost it. Saw 5 picked up a little, but was nothing special. I'm glad to say that Saw 6 was a major pick up. While I wish they would improve the quality of these films, you'd think with all the money they have they would, it's still a little too dingy for my tastes. But the story really took a good look at today's major problem with health care and the uninsured folks of America finally got what they've been craving, to see an insurance agent go through the jigsaw puzzle.Dan Erickson heads up the FBI's investigation into another jigsaw death, with fingerprints of Peter Strahm being found at the scene. He shares this information with Lieutenant Mark Hoffman and also reveals that Lindsey Perez, who was thought to have been killed by the exploding Billy doll, is alive and still on the case. Hoffman secretly meets with Jill Tuck, who hands him five envelopes from the box given to her by John Kramer's lawyer, and he takes control of a Jigsaw game the two have been planning. This game focuses on William Easton, an executive at a health insurance company. He and his subordinates decide whom to cover based strictly on probabilities of health or illness, and he turned down one of John's claims for this very reason. Flashbacks during the course of these tests reveal that William and John first met when Jill opened her drug clinic, and that John introduced Amanda Young to Jill as proof that his method of rehabilitation could really work. In addition, Hoffman and Amanda knew about each other's work as a Jigsaw apprentice, and John had already made advance plans for Jill to avoid suspicion after his death. Erickson and Perez continue their investigation and obtain the videotape from the death of Seth Baxter, causing Hoffman to grow increasingly nervous that his secret is about to be revealed. Costas Mandylor is the only thing that was really bad about the film, I wish this guy would get killed off because his acting is like making me be put through a jigsaw puzzle. He's just not right for the role nor does he have the acting chops for it. But I always do my best to give an honest review and Saw 6 isn't a bad movie. It's one of the better in the series. I do think that Jigsaw is one of the most clever serial killers that have been created for film. He's the new Hannibal Lecter, with more gore, but he always has us questioning our morals on those who really deserve life and take it for granted or those who maybe should just learn a good lesson in what they have done to others in life. I think Saw 6 is worth a matine, it's good for the Halloween season. Plus it's just tradition if you wanna see the sequels, have fun and just go with it, this isn't Oscar worthy, it's just good for gore.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After walking out of the theater, i said to myself, 'I'm never going to another saw movie again'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just flat out stupid. The script is laughable, the acting f**king sucks, it relies on flashbacks, the plot is so disjointed that it leaves the viewer like 'eh...whatver.'. Saw 6 is pretty much a joke and the entire theater cracked up at its sheer utter failure. Saw 6 has the same feeling as a movie you'd find on the sci-fi channel at midnight, everything about it sucks. It's boring and isn't really scary or gory.It does start out, completely awesome though. I have to give it points for that, the first 10 minutes are so absurd its beautiful. I'll just tell you what happens because i seriously don't encourage paying for a ticket. Basically it starts out with the tiresome 'opening' saw trap, we have two people, they have to cut pieces from their bodies and put them onto this scale, the most weight sacrificed survives. It's this fat guy and normal sized girl, the fat guy stabs open his stomach and just starts ripping out his intenstes out and while screaming, the girl struggles to do anything but eventually cut's her arm off with a clever and puts it on the scale. She wins with a arm over a fat guy's innards(he pulls out quite a lot), how realistic. Then immediately after that we have a flashback from another movie of someone getting mutilated, then it shows the doorknob abortion from saw 4(they actually show this clip in flashback form around 4 times.). So at a first glance this movie is completely violent and random and could be a good laugh riot, unfortunately the realization sets in, this movie is so stupid that it fails to be entertaining. We follow Hoffman, who is played by Costas Mandylor, as he goes through life as a two face, detective/jigsaw-guy. This guy is pretty much a completely unlikable character, and mandylor gives a pretty bssic performance. Between all the predictable madness to come, we have constant flashbacks of Tobin bell. Seriously, you've been dead for 3 movies, go away. He give's a half a**ed performance, he says a few lines than disappears, repeat about 5 times.Oh yeah the saw scenario in this installment is a f**cking joke.Basically this insurance agent who refused coverage for jigsaw in the past (we see flashbacks of this, usually repeating each other, for probably about 6 minutes total) is picked as main contestant. He wakes up in a trap with some random civilian you never hear about ever (or even know if he deserves to die), that crush's the trapped's ribs every time they breath, whoever outlives the other wins. Then he just goes looking around and nothings happening, we are cut too this mom/son in a cage, and this girl the agent had a affair with in a cage. What's the purpose of this? well i wont spoil it for you, but they're pretty much entirely useless until the very last 3 minutes of the movie. He eventually gets ahold of two chains in one hand each, if he lets one go a person will die and the other will be safe, so he chooses between a old lady with a family and some random no name with no background... Seriously, when did they just start killing random people as part of the traps, they aren't part of any game, they depend on another's actions, where's the justice in that. The agent just continues to go on this path of traps deciding other's lives, and usually nothing happens.I hated this movie, In the seat i was extremely dumbfounded to the point where my mouth was open. Do not see this movie, it's easily the worst saw to date. Nothing happens, barely any plot is forwarded, its EXTREMELY predictable, actings absolute rubbish, dialog/script's just a downright broken, the editing is UWYHURHUNEHJUERUGHJUERGJUERGER, and it could have been gorier. I was severely disappointed with this movie and wished i had not spent the money and time for it. The opening 10 minutes are classic, but the rest of the film is just stupid. All the characters are unlikable, the victims in the game are annoying as ****, i'm just going to stop now. This movie is ****ing terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After finding himself involved in the latest version of Jigsaw's game, a man tries to complete the challenges in front of him as the surviving members of the inner circle try to stay ahead of the authorities on their trail for the last round of the game.This one really didn't have a whole lot going for it overall. The fact that there's just not a whole lot of time here on the traps is a huge mistake, as the needless series of flashbacks from everyone involved makes for way too many drawn-out scenes of boredom, especially with the types of flashbacks given where they concentrate on the personas of the people that are trapped and how they got there or on the different connections to the other entries in the series that just foul up the storyline continuity simply to have a twist in the film. Neither of those provide many interesting options to hold the excitement level up, and the lame attempts to make it a horror film by showing the stalking scenes with the hooded figures showing up makes it all the worse off. While the traps are bloodier than expected and several out-and-out inventive, including one where he must guide a fellow prisoner through a torturous maze in sweltering conditions, none of them give off a distinctly consistent tone with the past traps and really just don't have that flavor that makes them feel as though they were created through the same intentions and thought-process. As none of the other story lines including the detectives' investigation angle or the legacy of the will really have that much going for them, this one wasn't all that enjoyable.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw VI (2009) ** 1/2 (out of 4) The latest in the seemingly never ending series has Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) dead but that's not stopping him and his "workers" from torturing more people. This time out they're going ofter the insurance company, their man main (Peter Outerbridge) and anyone who might get to pick who lives or dies based on insurance. I keep going into these new films really with no expectations as the series has produced some good, some fair and some horrendous entries so you never really can tell what you're going to get. On one hand, I find it rather laughable at how many ways they're keeping this series going and keeping Jigsaw in business. On another hand, I also find that some of the games being played are getting rather tiresome. One would think that means it's time to give up but this sixth entry turned out to be the third best in the series because of a fairly good story and one masterful game. The story in the last couple entries really wasn't too believable but I thought what we had here worked quite well and they could also bring back Jigsaw in the flashbacks and it would fit the story well. I think going after the insurance companies was a smart move as having someone force to pick who lives or who dies made for some interesting moments and there's no doubt that the film got a tad bit political in terms of who and what should control health care. For the first hour of the film I really wasn't digging any of the games and I thought the opening game was extremely weak but then we got to one, which might be my second favorite in the series. I won't totally ruin the scene but it involves a shotgun and had quite a bit of imagination behind it. Bell is his typical good self but the real surprise for me was Outerbridge who really gave a good performance as the man the games are wrapped around. I believed him as the snake insurance guy but also during his more dramatic moments of having to spare lives while killing others. In the end I really can't say this is a masterpiece or anything close to that but I think it's one of the better films in the series. Who knows where part seven goes from here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I was counting down my time to leave work and go check out SAW 6, i have been a huge fan of the series since part 1 and sad to say since part 1 it has gone down hill really. Each movie seems to be a collection of flashbacks to other parts and very little new things add on to the story aside from the traps. Now we have SAW 6...To start SAW 6 you go back to part 5 and that gap if you even want to consider it that gets filled and now we have a collection of the most gruesome traps to date. I have to say the creator of these traps, whoever thought them up is sick but i loved it. As far as the movie very little NEW is brought to the table other then the fact that we now know why Jigsaw was never insured for the cancer treatment and thats pretty much it with little very little plot holes fixed. Well if you want to see tons of blood, gore then this is for you but if your not a fan of the series you won't really enjoy it. Now we have SAW 7 in 2010 which i understand will be in 3D... They are destroying this franchise but as a fan ill go see it and as a fan if you are go see SAW 6, not great but good to catch up on the plot holes from the other 5 movies and again I have to add the TRAPS were GREAT!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the disastrous parts 3 and 4, "Saw 5" finally brought back a bit of hope and revival in the franchise. At least according to me, the fifth entry was a decent and worthwhile suspense movie again, thanks to the change in director and a plot that thankfully orbited a lot less around the persona of that nagging wisdom prophet John "Jigsaw" Kramer. Number five introduced potentially interesting new characters and even boosted a series of highly imaginative murder set pieces, so it made me anticipate the future sequels with more hope. The sixth installment, however, is a derivative and uninspired bunch of nonsense again. The character of Mark Hoffman, the apprentice killer, is pushed to the background and it's once again a pure Jigsaw showcase. I realize Tobin Bell represents the face and popularity of the "Saw" series, but how plausible is a killer when he's supposed to be dead for two full movies already? Do they really expect us to believe that John Kramer carefully planned all his future murder sprees months, or maybe even years in advance, and even recorded his tapes and videos with speeches for new victims for his successors to use? His brand new game of teaching valuable lessons to people who take life for granted is aimed at the CEO and employees of an insurance company. William Easton is a sly and emotionless big shot who specializes in rejecting insurance policies to loyal customers when they really need them. His company also denied financial support to John Kramer when he needed treatment for his malignant cancer. Easton wakes up one day in a giant death trap and has to take four inhumanly cruel decisions to safeguard his own life. All of the ordeals sacrifice the lives of his employees, however, and you just know that he will get in the end after all. Meanwhile, Mark Hoffman's colleagues at the FBI come close to unmasking him as a killer and Jigsaw's old apprentice Amanda returns from the dead as well. Together with part IV, this sixth entry is probably the least original sequel in the "Saw" franchise to date. Absolutely nothing about this film is worth mentioning and even the murder devices are boring and lackluster. It's extremely gory, as usual, with repulsive highlights like an obese man sacrificing his own flesh to remain alive and someone being injected with a whole barrel of burning acid. The direction by Kevin Greutert, the regular editor of all the previous "Saw" movies, is completely spiritless and dire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can We Finally Put A Nail In This Coffin?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Special Agent Strahm dead, Hoffman can continue Jigsaw's work and make more people stare death in the face for a chance at redemption. Although, not everything goes according to his plans, as two agents are hot on his tracks. Okay, so you know the gist of what the film is about. It's exactly the same as every other SAW film. A killer puts someone in a trap, twists and turns and boom, leave room for another film. This one is no different. First being tagged as the final SAW film. The one to complete Jigsaw's true game, it leaves the viewer with an emptiness and false promises. Once you get into a number as high as 6, in a horror franchise, you know the film can't be that good. It seemed that SAW somehow broke that trend and gave it's fans what they wanted. Sure, the quality has dropped with every new entry, but it's not like the films are horribly bad. Saw V was the worst of the bunch, I dreaded the next one. Yet to my surprise, this one is a step up. What this series has manage to do is keep a continuous mystery throughout every film. Each new film would add another piece to a puzzle that fans just ate up. What's on the tape, what's in the box, what's in the letter, etc. Keeping an audience interested in a series this long, I give them props. Making a new SAW film every year in time for Halloween and not having them be excessively bad. I also give props to. In the end, the SAW series is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.I love the first one, the rest have gone from mediocre to bad. This one falls into the mediocre category. It has all the gore, all the elaborate traps all the confusion the others have, yet I didn't come away as ticked off or as dirty as I did with V. I still find Hoffman to be a poor substitute for Jigsaw. I'm not a fan of their explanation for his final, true game. I'm not even a fan of the traps in this one, yet the film managed to be entertaining. I laughed at parts I shouldn't have, I cheered for scenes that involved mutilation of body parts. For an average movie goer, I'd tell them to avoid this one, but for a fan of the series, I say enjoy. It tidies up a lot of unanswered questions and yes, leaves the door open for the next installment. One I hope I don't have to see, but will obviously end up watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What to say about this film. These films always got by on the skin of their teeth because there was a detective story in the mix, but I don't think that is enough to make this franchise a worthy thing. It has the after effect of watching some video posted on You Tube that shows someone imploding for no reason whatsoever on a fashion runway. The word gross just doesn't cover it. I think folk who dig the thesis of a person being forced to dig a key out of their eye sockets or face being crushed by a 9000 pound weight over the space of the afternoon need to see a psychiatrist. Probably the most twisted material ever to hit the big screen, it is nothing more than a gore fest with little in the way of a plausible story keeping the whole thing together. The morality the killer character uses to justify his killings is not the most original thing I have ever heard-I prefer the reasoning of 'he wore black shirts' or 'she had a red car', but that's just me. Maybe what is repugnant is the seeking to make a logical reason for an abhorant and disgusting level of criminality. I always thought that time in jail was a more powerful crime deterent than execution. Maybe the film peddles the idea that executions are better than jail time. Maybe watching grass grow is better than this crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saw V was one of 2008's worst films, no question about it. So it wasn't going to be hard for Kevin Greutert's sixth instalment to mark an improvement on that film, but how does his inaugural directorial effort in the series (he edited all five previous Saw flicks) compare to the first four? It's not as good as 1, 3 or 4 however surpasses the very ordinary second part, which is a step in the right direction after last year's shambles.Dare I say that this time round the story was given more attention than the overly elaborate death traps that have become synonymous with the franchise? This doesn't mean the storyline is particularly great, it's not, the guff in between the violence is silly and the flashbacks featuring past characters are completely unnecessary. Yet screenwriters Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton thankfully put some effort into ensuring the twists and turns are unpredictable and relatively reasonable, something lacking in their Saw V script. Not to mention that old threads are tied up nicely, a small pleasure for those who have seen the entire series.The main issue here is that new leading man Costas Mandylor is simply no match for Tobin Bell (now only featured in flashbacks and voice-overs) who provided Saw 1 through 4 with a sophisticated menace. Bell's presence - which is so very important for the Jigsaw killer ? was creepy and spine-tingling whereas Mandylor is boring and as threatening as Mother Theresa. Unfortunately his gallant attempts at taking the reins as the main man is an epic failure.Die-hard fans will enjoy as they always do. Those who have never liked the franchise won't find anything to change their minds. All others will just be glad it's better than the last one.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Year. Another Halloween. Same Old Typically Below Par Saw Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To give Kevin Greutert's 'Saw 6' it's dues, it is a lot more coherent structurally than the previous two instalments, however that does not salvage it being yet another typically below par addition to the seemingly never-ending Saw franchise. Detective Hoffman is back after squashing Detective Strahm out of the equation in the previous 'Saw' film, and he now finds a potentially new obstacle to his destiny in the form of John Kramer's wife Jill Tuck. While Hoffman is contending with Jill and his FBI colleagues closing closer and closer everyday on his web of lies, a new game of death, destruction and plenty of inventive gore starts again with an insurance firm and its workers.Now I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Nothing is new, nothing is inventive, and nothing is engaging about this film. While I have already admitted that it is seemingly more coherent structurally than the previous two films as it concerns itself with focusing on a linear narrative rather than flashbacks and memory segments, the acting is still incredibly stale and cringe worthy, the characters again appear cardboard cut-outs with no development or motivation applied to anybody's personality within the filmic world (just imagine they're killing everybody because they are bored...) and the films lacks any tension or suspense what-so-ever. Instead of maybe becoming engrossed in the moralistic-will-they-won't-they death sequences I found myself willing the characters to die quickly and end this abomination as soon as possible! The worst part for me was the typical open-ending (which I won't spoil) that guarantees that next Halloween will be, unfortunately, another time for Saw again. Oh the joy. It is a terrible film, but then again I wasn't exactly expecting a masterpiece from the sixth film in the Saw film franchise, but I was hoping that Mr Greutert would have a little self-respect and finally put the film in its ideal resting place; the Cinematic grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Saw series has become a "what we could have done the last time" event. Every movie feels like it is geared more towards over explaining past events rather than focusing on the new events that are unfolding. This instalment, which will not be the the last, is worse than the previous for this. The story is DUMB, the structure is BORING and you find yourself thinking "did I just come to see the crazy brutal ways the vics are going to die?" To me the answer was yes. I am not saying you will or should hate this movie, but the original Saw was a masterful piece of horror/suspense/thriller cinema and somewhere around Saw 4 the wheels just totally fell off.So my final verdict is 2/10....BOO</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>would have been a great movie if not for some major flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK this movie started off as something i was really excited for. it was almost like everything would have been just as great as the last few saws, but i was way wrong. in this movie it seemed almost like they abandoned all of jigsaws rules and just made him a mindless killer. the tests use people that have nothing to be punished for. the only reason at least two of the people are punished is because they work in the same building as the man that the test is being given to. lets kill the janitor because he has nothing to do with anything. now the second flaw was the concept of time now many people probably think who cares its not a big deal but i will tell you that it is. this girl gets 90 seconds to do a maze, but the scene was at least 10 minutes. the failure to get a realistic time for the test made me go wow this is the longest minute and a half of all time. oh wait she has 20 more seconds to stand there and do nothing. thats really cool. well i will say that the movie was good if you don't really care about the story or the details but if you are a saw fan you will be like wtf</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So very disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge SAW fan, I can honestly say that I was very disappointed. This, in my opinion, was the worst of the bunch. For a 90 minute movie, it seemed like it dragged on forever.The Saw series has always had 1 of 2 things going for it, suspense or gore. This one had neither. Predictable from the on set. The gore, with the exception of the first scene (I'm being generous), was no gore at all. You could see the jumps coming from a mile away. The twist, if you can call it that was meaningless. The moral dilemma that someone else referred to had zero effect. The acting was terrible. I was just so very disappointed leaving the theatre.All this having been said though, the hypocrite in me will probably still buy it on blu-ray. Who am I to break the collection up? Anyhow, I hope people do enjoy it. I'm just part of the group that did not. Looking forward to Saw VII in 3D. Let's hope they right the ship. I want my torture porn back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At least it's better than "Saw V"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Saw VI" opens when "Saw V" ended.Special Agent Strahm is dead and Detective Hoffman has emerged as the unchallenged successor to Jigsaw's legacy.However,when the FBI draws closer to Hoffman,he is forced to set a game into motion,and Jigsaw's grand scheme is finally understood.I saw "Saw VI" during its premiere on Horror Festival in Poland.I am not a big fan of "Saw" series,but Part VI is a slight improvement over disappointing Part V.There are some gruesome gore-filled traps like the one in which two people are in a device that has their heads trapped in a box like item,and has two bolts going into their temples and they are required to cut off their own flesh to weigh out the scales.The main person who is playing Jigsaw's game is William,who denies a sick man an insurance.There is also carousel room trap and the trap with oxygen masks in which two players are breathing and the death comes to the person,who breathes more.The melting scene is admittedly gruesome.Overall,the film is worth watching for solid acting and the gore,but epileptic editing and the lack of suspense are disappointing.Still if you are a rabid fan of "Saw" series or have 85 minutes to kill give this one a look.</fullReview>
