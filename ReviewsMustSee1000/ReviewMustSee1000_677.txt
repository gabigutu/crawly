		<shortDescription>Make absolutely certain you do not miss this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is by far the most unusual movie I have ever seen. I am a die hard Sci-Fi buff and found myself wondering why no one has released a movie like this before. I was totally engrossed... the story pulled me in like a Black Hole, I found myself wanting more and more.This film is tantalizing, not to your eyes, not to your ears, but rather where it counts the most...your brain. What a breath of fresh air, I felt satisfied in the end and invigorated. If I had paid 50 dollars to see this film I would not have been disappointed.For anyone who has an intellect, is open minded and ready for an adventure born of thought, Ideas and possibilities, make absolutely certain you do not miss this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most thoughtful and well written scripts put to film in ages.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot speak about the depth and art put forth in this film without giving away details that will rob enjoyment from you if you have not seen this film. Suffice it to say that I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoys a film that reaches to the stars and does not depend on CGI.This is a film without pretense or smoke and mirrors.It is so nice to see a film that depends solely on story and dialogue. I highly recommend this to SF readers before viewers. A true masterpiece.A true shame this film never got any publicity to speak of. All though it did not cost tens of millions to put to film, it is a winner in any category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie for people who aren't afraid to use their brains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, too, saw this movie at San Diego Comic-Con 2007, and was incredibly happy that I did. I would, however, in no way consider this a thriller, as another reviewer did. This is a movie to provoke deep thought and conversation and that dares to challenge mainstream beliefs. It is one of the most intensely engaging dramas that I have had the pleasure to see. Excellent ensemble performances created believably real characters, each with his or her own fallibilities, personal credo, and enthusiasms.The movie is basically a conversation amongst college professors. So if you are looking for serial murders, chase scenes, or shoot-outs, you won't find it here. If you enjoy thought experiments and intelligent discourse, and appreciate what it means to accept your friends for who they are, see this.I will buy several copies to give to friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A seriously engaging film with a small twist at the end. Lots of small inputs of educational facts and figures but stay alert as they come quick and fast. I thought the mix of characters was excellent and the tale outstanding, but that is down to Bixby the writer. The acting was a little wooden but the story-line was fast enough (after a slightly slow start) to save dwelling on this. A sci-fi film with absolutely no special effects, relying solely on the story and a room-full of actors.A highly recommended film that needs some concentration and thought to fully appreciate, and that might even cause a tear if you become fully immersed. A nice change from the usual no-brainer special effects charged tear-aways.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Grandfather and Father did very well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My grandfather started this when I was a little boy. All I remember at that time was my grandfather sitting in his room all day everyday. He was so creative. When he and my father (Emerson Bixby)would talk about It, I could see A glow in both their eyes and knew something special was coming. This movie represents the true art of science fiction and I believe It will surprise allot of people on how many different ways entertainment can form itself. It Is well put together and scripted. Great cast...(GREAT) cast. Directer was great and most off all. The man who made sure my grandfather's story never died, Mr Emerson Bixby who I'm positive will bring us fun and interesting films for years to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The epitome of good science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerome Bixby's "The Man from Earth" stands proudly among the best science fiction films ever made. However, unlike "2001", "CE3K" and "Blade Runner," this little movie relies not on outstanding set design and mind-blowing visual effects, but rather on ideas; the very foundation of science fiction.I've been a fan of Mr. Bixby's ever since "Star Trek", and I must say this equals if not surpasses "Mirror, "Mirror". I agree that some of the acting was stilted, and the music partially drowned out dialogue in one scene, but my family and I were mesmerized throughout. As to my personal beliefs regarding God and faith; "Man from Earth" in no way offended me, but rather challenged me. Challenged me with historical facts (several of which I've since checked online, and thus far, all of which appear 100% accurate.) This is a chess game of a film, forcing the viewer not only to listen and to think, but to understand.I highly recommend "Man from Earth" to any and all who love intelligent science fiction. A friend downloaded the film, illegally no doubt. I've watched it three times thus far, and I'll be the first in line to buy the DVD (legally =) this coming Tuesday.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...every so often you will see a film or hear a story that will take your breath away and leave you wondering...this is one of those stories.That said it is probably not for everyone. If you don't want your believes challenged you should probably stay away from this one. The film is all about the characters and their dialog, it is what makes or breaks the film, and I must say they did an excellent job, it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, wanting to hear more. All this topped with great acting makes this a film really worth seeing.It goes to show that you can make great films these days without explosions and killings...so simple yet so effective. Great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If not the "best" science-fiction film ever made, Jerome Bixby's Man From Earth is certainly one of the most thoughtful. This movie reminds me of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Not with spaceships and effects, but with intelligent characters and exceptional dialogue, and that it left me with a sense of true wonder and joy, long after the credits ended. If the movie had been two hours longer I still would not have been bored, even though most of the film takes place in one small room. It's like watching a ninety minute Twilight Zone, with a perfect surprise ending. John Billingsly stands out, as does David Lee Smith, who may or may not be a caveman. The rest of the cast is good, but the script is the true star. And to anyone claiming this film is boring because we never leave the one room; Some of the very best Twilight Zones were just that. Good actors, good scripts, one or two locations. To anyone who's fed up with spaceships and explosions and Jar-Jar Binks, see this movie as a reminder of what science fiction has always been about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a brilliant tale and a writers triumph over the thirst of hearing a good story! At first i was not sure of what a was to expect from the movie but like the characters i was drawn into the story. As the film goes on it shorter to the end, i don't under stand why it is necessary to write ten lines about the film, i just wanted to say a few words about it. I don't think it will do very well in the cinema because most people don't appreciate a good story for just that. They want to see some action in the film, but this film does not have much of that in the physical sense,but maybe in the intellectual :) grate movie....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hi this is my first comment on any movie but i was compelled to write this. The man from earth was the best film i have seen this year in the terms of originality. It may not be action packed but it makes up for this in intrigue,it kept me watching and is a must see for genuine movie buffs.The acting at the first couple of minutes had me a little worried but after that i thought the film flowed and it soon eased my worries i am notorious to friends for giving up on movies before they begin.I would not recommend this film for kids it would be more suited to anyone over the age of 25 but hey what do i know you can make up your own mind by watching it in the cinemasOverall i rated this film 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A minimalist sci-fi drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it premiered at the Rhode Island International film festival. It was the main attraction of a sci-fi block that I went to without any knowledge of what the file was about, save the IMDb plot summary. What I saw was much different than what I expected, and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.The film starts very simply with the main character John packing his truck, and then joined by colleagues of his who have come to wish him farewell. His colleagues, however, cannot help but express how puzzled they are about him leaving, since he has established himself very well as a professor and is well liked. Each time he is asked, John either avoids the question or gives an evasive answer. He eventually responds to them by posing a hypothetical question to the group (which by now have been established as Ph.D.s in fields including anthropology, biology, and history) about what a man would be like if he had lived since prehistoric times and had the appearance of the same age for sixteen-thousand years. This question starts an innocent discussion, but changes in tone as John implies more and more that the situation is not hypothetical. The group all have diverse reactions that become more intense as they pose questions to John regarding the story he has put forth.One of the producers who was in attendance described the film as a science fiction Twelve Angry Men, and I found that statement to be very apropos. The focus of the story was the interaction of the people in the situation, rather than the situation itself. You will find that as an audience member you are put in a similar position as John's colleagues in thinking about the logistical aspects of living for such a long time and what you would say if a friend came to you with the same story. The writer, the late Jerome Bixby, did this well by presenting people that could analyze the finer points of the hypothetical situation by being experts in many relevant fields. I highly recommend this film if you enjoy the more human side of science fiction, or if you like pondering what-ifs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Amazing Sci-Fi Fantasy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently had the opportunity to view Man From Earth at the Comic-Con Film Festival, and it was amazing. The Sci-Fi thriller goes places I've never dreamed of. The movie places the viewer in the backseat for a wild ride through history connecting it to the present. I was shocked at the ideal of a Cro-Magnum surviving until present day, and even more shocked how each professional almost validated the possibilities as the story unfolded. The most unique thing about the movie is who John Oldman has met, and has been (don't want to give it away, but he's been the most well known person alive) in his centuries of living, or who he could be in the future! This film is great for anyone who likes movies that challenges the norm! The movie bewilders the mind yet challenges the heart of our beliefs! This amazing Sci-Fi film pays great homage to the late and great Jerome Bixby! Anyone who is a fan most go see this film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fossilize this, deep in the Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read the summary: A college professor reveals that he is really a 14,000 year old cave man. Outlandish premise, but we are told that as this movie unfolds, we may find it is so thought provoking that it may even seem plausible. Sounds like good film-making to me.Well, I knew within 5 minutes that this movie was in trouble. In the first scene, Cave Man's colleague offhandedly notices a signed Van Gogh painting stuffed between some boxes in the back of his truck. How convenient that he just happened to travel in the same circles as a famous historic figure. Okay, I can suspend my disbelief, surely a 14,000 year old would have had some opportunities to meet some well known characters.You really begin to feel where this movie is heading when Cave Man's decision to reveal himself happens on the spur of the moment. One minute he's about to head out the door and the next he's telling them his secret. How do his friends react? After a few chuckles most of them become angry, even enraged. Odd, why don't they just laugh it off and leave? Apparently they're already so transfixed by his story, which he's been telling for all of two minutes, that they're almost convinced of its truth and are hoping for him to just say it ain't so and release them from this new upside-down reality! Personally, I would feel some sadness that a guy I'd known for years had come to believe in this delusion and I don't know many people that would feel different.But the story progresses and he begins to reveal more absurdities. Not only did he know Van Gogh, he was on a first name basis with Hamurrabi. He travels to India and hey, guess who he ran into? The Buddha, whom he spends years studying under. It's so dumb you almost couldn't make this up. The more he tells the more upset his friends become, to the point where one of them even calls a psychiatrist friend in the hopes of having him committed. As if you could commit someone simply because they believed in a wild tale, not having made any threat whatsoever to themselves or others. They ask him one question after another, always trying to hit him from some new angle, demanding some shred of proof, and rather providing answers, he always counters with some "can you really prove anything?" philosophy. Deep, deep stuff here.The big revelation towards the end is so insufferably stupid that it warrants only a pity laugh. This is not even entertaining in a B movie fashion. His explanation of how he learned, under the Buddha, to slow his metabolism to near the point of death just made me want to groan. These people sitting in the room with him, they try so hard not to believe him. These poor college professors don't need much in the way of proofs. But we're not quite done. There's still one more surprise, and it's so shocking it causes one of the characters to keel over with a heart attack. Sigh.. I wish that old cliché would die of a heart attack once and for all.This movie is not "so bad it's good". No, it's just so bad. I truly am astonished by the high ratings given to it and I had to create an account just to write this comment. I can't help but think that anyone who finds this to be intellectual fodder is simply lacking an imagination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You've got to be kidding me....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I could vote for a less than zero, this one would definitely deserve it. There is NO, and I mean NOT ONE, excuse for producing such a bad movie. Was it due to the low budget? I clearly doubt it. Take Christopher Nolan's "Following" for example and you see what you can get out of 70 minutes and almost "no-budget".The story was predictable from the first moment he said that he was 14000 years old. I was kidding with a friend of mine and honestly telling him like "Yeah, wait up, in the end he's Jesus himself". I fell of my chair, when he really said that. The Characters are completely thoughtless and pseudo-intellectual. I am myself a student of psychology - and yes: there are some major dorks in that field who still believe in father-complexes and childhood dramas as reason for just EVERYTHING - but Dr. Will Gruber is just a bad sketch of a psychologist. The same goes for every other character of this movie - one more stereotypical than the others. On top of that is the crazy Christian conservative - how could it be different - symbolized by an old mean woman. The biologist, archaeologist and Tony Todd are also just poorly sketched "intellectuals" and at times I wondered, if Bixby has ever seen a professor in his real life because the character traits are completely stereotypical and made out of thin air.My favorite character is Alexis Thorpe as "Linda", student, hot and obviously crazy in love with her professor - who is just as nuts as everyone else with one exception: he drives a bike and looks like a real rocker! yeaaaaah! how awesome is he? At one time, at the end, when they leave the place you can see Lindas blank ass when she gets up. My favorite moment of the movie.As for the great dialogues and memorable lines from this movie:Dan: "I would kill anyone"Edith (after Dr. Gruber showed his gun): "Where did he get that?" (This Movie takes place in the USA an Edith was not so surprised about the giant crossbow in John's cabin... what the heck?)I really do not want to waste too much time on this piece of crap, but a few things need to be said.The plot is too transparent. The scientific "facts" are clearly out of a book and are used out of any context. The pseudo-intellectual conversations just seem way too posed. The ending is hilarious. As it turns out he is not only Jesus, no, he is also the father of the psychologist, whoms wife died just yesterday, and who has an obvious father-complex (see my irony please) and therefore dies too. There are some very uncommon gap fillers, containing actions and reactions I have never ever observed at any point in my life from anyone. Another pain in the ass is, that the acting is so bad, that they really have to speak out every single feeling, emotion, whatsoever. Good acting makes the vocalization obsolete.In my opinion Bixby made everything wrong that one could possibly be wrong. And i DO NOT hate it just because of all the reasons the people who rate this film high are referring to, namely shortness, lack of "action", lack of location variety or "intellectual demand", because there are many many movies that i love who fulfill these characteristics.You want a low budget film that is great: watch "Following"! You want a one location movie with intellectual demand: watch "Hard Candy" You want a brilliant movie without any "action": watch "Coffee and Cigarettes"To all of you who are easily impressed by scientific talk, that you may or may not understand: watch the film again. keep in mind the stereotypical scientist. think one more time what these people are talking about and if in any rational way a conversation like this could be possible. if you still think: yeah, it is possible, than i truly grief for America's university-elite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good science fiction is supposed to entertain a fantastic notion in order to stimulate new perspectives and ideas about humanity and reality. If you are looking for that, then consider a different movie.I watched this movie because of the reviews and ratings here on IMDb. This site doesn't usually let me down, but I have to say that there is no greater discrepancy here between rating and actual quality than there is with The Man from Earth.Have you ever had a professor who obviously considered himself a genius, and also considered himself funny, even though he was plainly the opposite in both cases? Prepare for dejavu if you watch this movie. The humor tries to be intellectual, but I would say it is more like Full House meets The New Yorker. The characters are all so unrealistic and, well, downright unlikable. The acting is awful, just completely bad. It feels like it was made by an atheist who considered himself enlightened, yet the message gets lost in the abysmal story.I won't spoil anything, as if there was some way that could make the movie even worse, but the ending will either make you laugh derisively or shake your head in disbelief over how poorly done it was.The review I read said the movie was for people who are not afraid to think, yet the ideas expressed in between the cheesy one-liners were no more profound than an AOL chatroom discussion about who is greater, pirates or ninjas. Nothing new was said, no ideas reinvented, no original thinking in the whole blathering mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am honestly confused as to why this movie is so popular.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't like this movie. It is very poorly made which partly owes to its low budget but then Primer had a low budget and managed to seem much more professional than this.SPOILERS AHEAD!The scientific basis of the movie is inherently flawed as it says that his genes have happened to evolve such that they no longer have flaws when copying(mutations). But this is like saying that if you built a car perfectly you could reduce its chance of having an accident to zero when in fact the probability of the car having an accident is not a function solely of the car, it also depends upon the environment. In the same way, the chance of mutation is dependent upon the environment such as ionising radiation and mutagens and thus the mutations could not be entirely stopped by his genome.However, many sci-fi films have shaky scientific basis so we may excuse this. Then there is the fact that he doesn't scar, which would have to be unrelated to the previous genome modification but again we can excuse this as it isn't a major issue.The part that really irritated me was when it continued to peddle such misconceptions like that people still thought the Earth was flat at the time of Columbus even though that hadn't been a serious viewpoint since at least the days of Eratosthenes some one thousand years before. At one point he also attributes his fortuitous luck in not succumbing to disease to the idea that the 'Water and food were so much purer back then' (meaning neolithic times) when this is just patently false and plays to the prejudices of the New Age pseudo-intellectuals that seem to worship this film. We are much better off today in the age of quality control and water treatment than we were then even if there is the occasional gripe about HFCS or food intolerances.The final straw that proved just how crappy the film really is came when he reveals that he is in fact Jesus and spent time with the Buddha etc. by which point I was seriously wondering whether all the positive reviews of this movie were in fact the work of a Moriarty of trolls.In conclusion, the movie had some promise but was wrecked by poor acting and a host of basic scientific and historical mistakes. The movie seems to be popular only because it plays on New Age notions of the 'pure' neolithic times and the apparent simplicity of religion. If you want a good, cerebral experience then read a book, there must be dozens of sci-fi stories which explore similar themes but in greater depth and without the patronising attitude. Even some non-fiction works touch on similar themes, I would strongly recommend those by Carl Sagan for example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of sci-fi and indie films, and after reading the reviews of this film i figured it was definitely worth a watch, especially with an impressive average rating of around 8. However, on watching it, i felt obliged to sign up to IMDb, just to right the wrong that is this overrated film.It's incredibly slow-paced; the actors could maybe one day aspire to star in a low budget soap with enough lessons, and it's impressive that they considered equal rights for blind people by giving no visuals other than people sat in a cabin acting badly.The plot is pretty terrible. It manages to be incredibly boring, and yet far-fetched at the same time.

There was no chemistry or connection between the actors and they all seemed like they were desperate to "act" rather than live truthfully in the given circumstances. Acting 101 was not observed. It's possible that it was due to bad direction. I could almost hear the director saying,"You should be really angry here."... "Ok, that take was good but can you be angrier?". Really bad stuff.

		<shortDescription>Writer's best work was in 1960s and this film feels old and bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man From Earth appeals to science fiction enthusiasts, like me, who dream about long life and like to debate the philosophy of being human.Unfortunately, The Man From Earth takes a premise and is pretty much all premise. We don't get to see the protagonist interact with the world. Have you ever heard the phrase "show, don't tell"? It's a writer's maxim that it's better to be direct rather than indirect with your plot line.Eight people sitting in a house talking is too much "tell". The story could easily just be two people talking, as in K-PAX, which is far better.The dialogue is awful (I thought it was the acting originally but that was wrong). There's no story arc (nothing is at stake). This would be boring even as a theatre production (where having a single location is more accepted).It's not enough for a story to be intellectually interesting. It has also be a story. The Man From Earth is not. It is all premise and very much reflects the goofy overly simplistic Sci-Fi days of the 1960s. And guess what, that's where the film's writer Jerome Bixby comes from. Click on his film history and you'll see he hasn't worked creatively in film since 1969.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At his going away party, John Oldman, a professor of history reveals that he is really a 14,000 year old cromagnon man.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film whose appeal is perhaps confined to those brought up on a strict diet of middle-American religious fundamentalism; for other viewers, the ground covered is familiar and unremarkable. As one hapless character states, "It was a beautiful idea", but the end result is very disappointing. While the device of the 14,000 year-old man is an interesting one, the central character, John Oldman, comes across as tiresome and humourless, and his supporting characters, who serve only to tease out the rather trite philosophical ideas discussed in the film, are lifeless caricatures. The dialogue is both predictable and unrealistic; I've never met people who are so uninterested in themselves they'll spend an entire afternoon at a party without ever talking about their own lives, but this bunch obediently behave as an attentive, if critical, audience for Oldman's story. The film is shot essentially like a stage play; most of the action is confined to one room and the actors struggle with the unidimensional roles they've been given, particularly the women, who seem primarily to act as supports for Oldman-as-prophet's rather flaccid and unconvincing claim to virility. The whole narrative unfolds like the scene in an Agatha Christie novel where Poirot gathers the suspects together and reveals the murderer, only without the suspense.I have no doubt that this movie will appeal to some -- fans of Dan Brown and Carlos Castenada -- but viewers who want to see a movie that grapples with the real complexity of human experience, or at least entertains, be warned; this is not the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb! A movie for endless discussions and deep thinking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a really long time since I saw a movie that captured me, mind and soul, that much. Even since the very beginning, when the whole concept of the movie (a 14,000 old man?) seems too fictional, you can sense the difference in the atmosphere, the escalating emotions, and the question keeps pop into your mind: "could it be actually true?" And the fact that everything is taking place in a small living room in front of a fire place among a small group of people -like in the theatre- makes it even more special. It is certainly one of the movies that will provoke endless discussions. Some may hate it due to the controversial issues that it is dealing with, but if you watch it with an open mind, you cannot but admit that "everything is possible". After all what is history and religion other than our current knowledge of what happened thousand of years ago and how it was captured through the eyes and hands of other people. Even the science that we know today is just a way to interpret the natural phenomena with the knowledge that we currently hold, knowing pretty well that if the situations change or new discoveries will be made then we will have to discard the old knowledge and adopt the new one. Overall I believe the movie is truly ingenious and mind challenging and I strongly recommend it to those who keep seeking alternative answers to long standing questions that are dealing with history, religion, science!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome "Question Reality" Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the "normal" cinematics and acting are here, of course. The usual things you would equate to a good movie. They are all here. Especially the acting. I'm glad they could afford those actors. Kudos on the acquisition. But one element of this gem, that I hold above all, is the "story/concept".One of the things that eludes me as a writer, how do you tell a story in one location? I've been trying to come up with a story that doesn't involve epic locations and special visual effects. I have a few ideas for movies that involve the subject matter of this movie, but, since I am a low-to-no budget filmmaker, I am concerned with how to express certain topics so frugally. I realize that it has to do with the dialogue and presentation of the story. This movie shows how one can tell a "grand" story with only one location.The subject matter is controversial. Some will hate this movie. Some will love it. But it is all based on verifiable sources. May be true... may not. However, it is good food for the mind (if one is open minded, that is).It's hard to write a comment about such a movie of this genre that doesn't give it away and still expresses how much this movie has enthralled me! One of the main premises of the movie is "What would you believe?". If a friend of yours came to you with information that unfolded your reality, would you stick with dogma, or have an open mind with what that "friend" of yours was saying? Could you let go of dis-belief, based on scientific "fact", enough to consider what your friend said "might" be true? I am definitely adding this to my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A huge letdown for me.The idea behind the whole thing was interesting but it was all downhill from the start.The whole movie felt so forced, did they really have to connect the main actor to all these individuals in history? It was so cringe worthy when he told he was Jesus, talked to Buddha and so on...The only thing missing was a meeting with Hitler, a cup of tea with Napoleon and maybe a conversation with Genghis Khan before he went all ape*hit with Eurasia...To me it felt like that scene in Equilibrium where the authorities destroy art and the painting just happens to be Mona Lisa - oh the shock value! It was also very hard to identify with any of the other characters, because the acting wasn't really that great.Screenplay, photography, cinematography etc was just plain awful. There are plays in theater for this kind of "science-fiction" where all the actors stay in one room, listen to Beethoven and speak like they are on the juice. For an IMDb rating of 8.3 I expect more when I pay 10 bucks from my student grant (which is probably bigger than the budget of this film) and sacrifice a decent spring evening in a bad Finnish cinema! A great film (rating of 8+) to me means that there is a good story AND that the setting is also captivating. I'd rather read a book and imagine most of it myself if the movie can only offer conversation in a log cabin.Avoid at all cost!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the words of Terry Gilliam "It's all about how they do the first weekend". Clearly they were not lost on cast, crew, their friends, their families and possibly from the looks of the discussion threads some religious cult, because whilst watchable the notion that this film deserves an 8/10 score and mention in the best Science Fiction films on IMDb is enough to get me to type my compulsory ten lines.The film is not bad in the same way that eerie Indiana on Nickelodeon when I was twelve was not bad, the acting is passable the story even verges on intriguing but at the end of it all it's predictable, rhetorical and cheap.It's not like we don't have plenty of excellent low budget productions that attempt to be clever and even pull it of well. Try Shane Carruth's Primer http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/ for a film so smart you'll have to watch it ten times before you get it all and so polished you'll be happy to do it. Try Richard Kelly's masterpiece Donnie Darko http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0246578/ to experience something that will spark discussion. You can of course try this, just don't be fooled into thinking it's a better use of your time than watching any of the films truly deserving of such credit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pretty shocked to see such a high rating and so many 10/10 reviews... Sure the story is original, but the execution was so poor it was irritating to watch. Yes, it had a twist, but it could have been condensed into a 30 minute episode of the Twilight Zone. I went back to read the reviews and realized what was going on. 10/10 scores one-time reviewers... how shameful.I hope IMDb and many other "review" sites tighten up their scoring, reviewing, and weighting algorithms. This kind of abuse is intolerable. There are companies out there that specialize in cheap labor when it comes to creating fake "user-generated" content which should tell you there is a demand out there.Next time spend the money on better production instead of trying to take advantage of the system.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I think this is an amateur film ? (a poor quality one)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are no rules in film-making, only sins. And the Cardinal sin is dullness. - Frank Capra"The man from earth" is 7 people mainly listening to 1 guy as he tells them bits of story of his life. They sit in a room for the entire duration of the movie (87 minutes). They are all teachers. and their approach on that 1 guy's story is that of a mediocre 16 year old kid. They are all dull and so is the room. Their acting is also dull, and so is the technical aspect of the "movie" - dull image, dull camera moves, dull lighting, dull sound, dull costumes, etc. There was no directing that i noticed.This "movie" is so badly made from start to finish. The characters are a mess... suffice to say, all those intellectuals with scientific education went hysterical, blown away and shaken by what that one guy tells them without bringing any solid proof (even refusing to bring one when asked).Supposedly, those bits of the story of the life of that 1 guy should entertain me as i sit through 87 minutes of dullness, like i never read belletristic or sci-fi books.There aren't many good sci-fi movies out there but..This is not a movie.Imagine going to a museum and instead of getting to look at the mask of Tutankhamun, you get a screening of 8 guys describing to you Tutankhamon's mask in a dull manner, one of them threatening to kill another with a gun at a random point of the lecture. Imagine going to a store to buy 1 kilo of oranges, and instead having 8 clerks handing you a bottle of water, 100 grams of sugar, a couple of vitamin C tablets, and lots of dry orange peels, telling you "that's the essence of the orange dude, that's the essence, it's awesome, you should have a revelation"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film (and I use the term loosely, it had not a vestige of film-making craft about it) reminded me of a bunch of stoned middle-schoolers sitting around going "WOW, dude...you realize our whole solar system could be just one ATOM in an entire giant universe...?" WHAT were they THINKING? You just transpose the dialog of a bad short story directly to the screen and call it a film? This isn't a movie, it's a book-on-tape. You could see the actors struggling to deliver the stilted prose with some sort of conviction. And failing. Miserably.Philosophical films are god-awful difficult even in the hands of a master. You have to make your audience like the players enough to listen to them yap for an hour and a half. And it helps to have philosophy a tad deeper than a comic book. Here's an example of an amateur WAY in over his head. You want to see this kind of thing done right, check out "My Dinner With Andre".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie doesn't have any action, CGI special effects, all it has are just a bunch of college professors sitting around a fireplace, discussing some really mind boggling ideas.I really enjoyed watching this movie. It's rare that you can stumble upon a thinking person's movie nowadays.What if you are as old as humanity itself, what if you have stood witness the evolution of mankind from its birth to the present day, what would you have done, which chapters in mankind's history would you have written.The concept of immortality is as old as mankind itself, but never before have I seen this concept explored with such, thoughtfulness and philosophy.One minor thing I did not like about the movie is the prolonged overly dramatic outright hostility towards John's confession. I don't think the incredulity is really necessary here, especially amongst a bunch of intellectuals.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>big disappointment (see the movie first then read this)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You got to give some credit to the script, as the concept is very original and it could have been a great movie, but there are so many holes in The Man from Earth that it's very hard to ignore. This is why I'm so surprised, considering all the 10s and 9s and all the wonderful reviews here.First of all, the concept is great but the script is sooooo naive. We get to hear incredible story from the main character, which at first keeps the expectations very high, but with time we see more and more of a lack of attention to detail. I could accept Buddha and Jesus story, although it's not easy, but Columbus and Van Gogh? The man had to have one heck of a talent when it comes to finding the most important people in the history of mankind, not to mention how charming he must've been to find a way to get near them. It would be nice to see at least some shadow of that charm, but instead we see an introspective shy man with a character of a person that just spent 30 years with his mom in the mountains. Smart men get smarter with time, so I'd expect a little bit more overall level of comfort, harmony and positive attitude from someone who was enlightened by Buddha and changed the mentality of mankind forever as Jesus due to his extraordinary teachings.The actor really didn't put much to his role, or maybe he just doesn't have the skills, but during the movie he failed many times to express his emotions with style. Character is shallow and boring. But his girlfriend is worse.As for a girl finding out that her boyfriend is 14.000 years old, she acts like it was nothing. Either the character is addicted to heroine (which would explain her non-acting during most of the movie), or the actress is a) friend of producer/director, or b) not much of an actress.The old doctor mr. Smarty and all just lost his wife day ago, yet comes to a social meeting like he just had the best sex of his life and has to spread that joy around. It takes a lunatic who claims that he's Jesus to remind him (in a very twisted and we-just-couldn't-think-of-anything-better way) that the guy's wife died recently.Add to this the "I'm your father/grandfather (don't remember) and I know your dog's name" and you have an amazingly disappointing finish line. It really doesn't take much to create a better way to show people that he really is THE MAN. They say in the movie that Jesus and Buddha must be turning in their graves if they know what people have transformed their teachings into. Well if they really existed and they have graves, I hope nobody dares to throw into them iPods with this movie on hard disk, because they would spin 3 times the previous speed! I could go on and on with this, and I realize how many people will hate me because this comment, as this movie seems to have a lot of fans, but it's been a long time since I have seen a movie which tries to be so deep and moving, and which at the same time is so shallow and unsatisfying. 3 for the concept, 0 for the rest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing this movie I must say I certainly became a Jerome Bixby fan.This movie changed my whole perspective on life and religion.The way David Lee Smith managed to capture the essence of the feelings and opinions an undying man would have is equaled only by the clarity and logical time progression of the distortion of historical facts.This movie manages to present somewhat insane ideas from a relevant point of view thus making those ideas relevant to the spectators.I love the way the main actor knows that his story goes far beyond the normal psychological,historical and even scientific guidelines,but because he doesn't feel that way he forces everybody to judge their on beliefs whether they're scientific or religious ones.Whether you find the story this movie tells relevant or not I guarantee it will be one of the best movies you'll ever see.</fullReview>

Some pointed out it would be of interest to Sci-Fan's of (which i am)- It is not. It is hugely predictable. Acting is atrocious. Maybe the book is good and it was just poorly adapted.I like an intelligent film and the fact it was set in one room appealed to me. It does not deserve this kind of rating though.He says he's old, they don't believe him. He says he's Jesus. Characters are so stereotypical its not even funny.For a good film of this type...

		<shortDescription>Talky, tedious, implausible, uninteresting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a movie that is virtually nothing but talk, the Man From Earth has remarkably little to say of novelty and intelligence. What it does say has been said many times before, much better, and certainly without the hokey premise. The movie begins with a handsome middle aged professor mysteriously announcing that he is leaving his university for points unknown. When pressed, he announces that the reason is because he is 14,000 years old and never ages. Therefore he must uproot himself every 10 years to avoid detection. The rest of the movie involves his friends pressing him for details of his life, which grow more juvenilishly implausible as time goes by. It is one thing to accept the possibility that an individual exists who has lived 14,000 years without aging. It is quite another to accept that he just "happened" to meet, and become friends with, every historical celebrity any of his friends mention in their questioning, from well-known figures in their time as Buddha and Hammurabi, to the completely unknown (in his lifetime) Vincent Van Gogh, who just happened to be his neighbor in 19th century Europe. Right. Nor is it plausible that a person who learned to speak English as an adult would now speak perfect unaccented American English, or that he not only appears, but acts no different than any of his peers. Certainly all of us are aware that people who are older do not only look different, but also act different, with mannerisms, clothing and speech patterns that are noticeably distinguishable from persons just 2 decades younger. How likely is that a 14,000 year old man will look and sound just like a contemporary middle aged man? In short, it is absurd to believe that any intelligent person would have thought that the protagonist's tall tale was anything more than a not particularly clever hoax, which is why I couldn't care less when he finally made his absurd claims regarding his real identity, and offered as revelation the same hackneyed ideas about Judeo-Christianity that are routinely posted by precocious 12 year olds on internet forums.</fullReview>

It's really only terrible by comparison to every other film I've ever watched that has had an IMDb score of around 8. There are no men (or women) from earth that should consider watching this based on the IMDb rating....Like some others here I had to create an IMDb account just to rate this film because I felt THAT strongly about it. The acting was pretty bad, the story was ridiculous really and there was nothing really to redeem the film save that you were wondering what was going to happen, and in the end nothing of interest did happen. I found myself bored most of the time as the ideas which were being discussed (which apparently others feel were quite deep) were really, in my opinion, just plain silly and in no way believable even if you accept the basic premise that this man has lived such a long life. But, it got such a high rating, so I watched on wondering what was going to happen. But to anyone else I would say don't waste your time, there are plenty more interesting films out there with a more interesting story to tell</fullReview>

I watched it because it's in the top 50 sci-fi films - it's my favourite genre and I was looking for something new.. The whole thing is over before it starts. The idea is laid out within the first 10 minutes and then you are left watching a group of awful stereotypes sitting and recited misplaced facts in the same room for two hours. This can be amazing (12 Angry Men etc) but the film is so poorly visualized it only bores you to tears. I am not one for big budget block busters but this is nothing more than made for TV crap - the direction and writing are dreadful, the throwaway music is annoying, and the acting wooden. Yes, the premise is interesting, but if (like me) you like sci-fi you would be better off READING A BOOK and not watching this film. Seriously</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lets start with ridiculous casting, horrible acting, poor editing and non existing scenography. It is much easier to list what this movie has that is done good (but i cant think of anything right now) then all the things this "film" is lacking. It is worst then many TV movies so that is enough said about that. The premise of the movie is very good band will keep you watching just to see what will the protagonist say next. The producer of this movie must have seen "The Da Vinci code", and said to him self "Ill make a film with a religiously insulting theme, maybe ill make me some money". He made the same thing Dan Brown &amp; company did; played with few facts unknown to the person of average education and combined them in a nice low budget movie story. There is a few things that easily dismiss this movies premise as comical; firstly being a biology teacher i am quite convinced that no self respecting biologist would take seriously that a man can live 14000 years like that poorly portrayed biologist in the film, let alone try to explain it with cellular regeneration. Secondly we should have in mind that science does not know almost anything about prehistoric man that is not on a theoretical level. It is very strange that John recalls almost everything just in the manner that modern science explains it. For example some scientist question the very existence of an ice age. Thirdly the "Jesus years". A white guy cruising around Asia hanging out with Buddha?? Then he comes to his former home that is Rome as an ex Etruscan to find it corrupt and so on..Just a few things, Etruscans and Romans did not liked each other much, Romes true history started when they got rid of Etruscan kings, so why would an Etruscan call Rome home? If John was so disappointed and wanted to make Rome better why did he stay in afar away province of Judea and preached there? A white guy looking like a Roman cruising around Judea preaching to the Jews??? All John had to do to stop Christianity was to talk to Saint Paul without who's efforts Christianity would probably disappear and Saint Peter would not go to Rome to "teach fishing" and found the Church who's ceremonies are not just a series of weird rituals so much as a sign of remembrance and respect for the Man who brought us the Light, and it wasn't a 14000 years old Cro-Magnon named John.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's the only term that I can think of that is entirely appropriate. A guy lives 14,000 years and has no deeper thoughts than those expressed in this film? I took the time to watch this based on the reviews and found myself terribly disappointed. As is frequently stated throughout the movie, "All of this could have come out of books!" (And how surprising, since they are all academics.) The film is not as anti-Christian as some reviewers would have you believe, unless you are a terribly sensitive Christian. Not recommended for people who are interested in an intellectual challenge. (BTW, I have both graduate and undergraduate degrees in anthropology, so I have a tiny bit of experience in related fields.)Added note: After reading many other reviews, I felt that I simply had to come back and add a final comment. If you are one of those reviewers gushing about how "original" or "startling" the premise of this movie is, then you have missed a great many short stories, novels, television shows, plays, and movies that address precisely the same subjects and have similar plots. I mean, Mel Brooks was doing it as a comedy routine 40 years ago. The only differences are that (1) his routines were amusing, and (2) Brooks actually expressed some deep thoughts about the implications of such a situation, thoughts that are notably absent from this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry cultists and astroturfers, but this is truly one of the worst movies I have ever watched.A group of medium grade character actors sit in one room for an entire film and spew pompous dialog about things that happened IN THE PAST! That's right, any "action" happens hundreds if not thousands of years in the past and the only reason we know about it is because we are told so -- no flashbacks or any of the other traditional methods for moving a story forward are employed. All we get is over-written, smug dialog and weak "stoner-style" philosophy that makes for some deadly dull cinema. I don't always need wild sci-fi action. I enjoy quiet, thoughtful and well-written movies -- but even those films have some sort of story arc. No such luck with this stinker.BTW, Not normally one for conspiracies, but I smell a rat here. Red flags are raised by the HUGE number of near orgasmic 10 star reviews. All for a low grade, low budget, unrated "indie" film that had limited theatrical play (at best). In other words, there appears to be a campaign to falsely inflate the ratings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pseudo-intellectual garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen much more creative and intelligent and work from high school students' group projects that were written in a week and shot with a cell phone.This was like listening to someone that has had one AP class in world religions, and now thinks that he has all the answers to humanity's complex questions tied up and resolved. This was not a sophisticated exchange of intellectual ideas, but more of a random throwing around of provocative statements.I was shocked to see the 8 star rating for this movie. I would have given it less than 1 were that possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poorly delivered film with unrealised potential that seems to be praised for what it isn't rather than what it does</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Scoring highly on IMDb with tens of thousands of votes (60k+ when I watched it) this film did interest me because of me having never heard of it and it being so popular and well considered; that said though, I didn't expect it to be brilliant and indeed from the start my expectations were lowered by the TVM standards and casting. The plot sees a Professor preparing to leave town, confessing to his learned colleagues that he has lived on Earth for hundreds of thousands of years without ever dying ? needless to say, they are curious and so begins a discussion that covers the development of man and modern society.Others have raved about this film because it is script and character, with no action to speak of and pretty much a limited cast delivering their lines in one location ? people have singled this aspect out as worthy for praise as if to suggest then that pretty much every single play that has ever been staged should be considered a classic by virtue of the same logic. I do not. I think it was a nice change of pace to find a film that is all about the ideas and words within it, but this is not to suggest that this alone makes it brilliant or that those who didn't love the film as somehow idiots that deserve to only Transformers 3 forever, as some lovers of this have done here. For me, the idea of something being driven by words and ideas is not unique and worthy of praise and the film still had to do something with these ideas and words. For me it didn't.I was kept interested by the idea started to unfold but ultimately it didn't do too much with it. The focus on religion in the second half doesn't really say as much as it thinks it does and the more it goes on the more it feels like a very obvious path for the film to have gone down. The twists in the final sections are pretty contrived and unconvincing ? as indeed is the setup as a man who has made this 10-yearly move thousands of times suddenly decides to tell his story to this group? There is an idea here for sure and it does manage to engage without having gore, nudity or swearing, but this is not the same as being good ? particularly as it fades as it goes on.The cast are undeniably TVM standard here. Smith is stiff and lacking any sort of spirit and heart, too many of his lines are delivered in a very soft and distancing voice. Todd has a bit more about him and is a good presence but Katt (Perry Mason), Crawford, Billingsley and others are weaker and seem more clichéd and worn in their characters. The script gives them plenty of words but they are not all convincing or realistic as they flow. The direction and production standards seal the TVM feel as it is cheap and grainy to look at, with someone making the terrible decision to put poor musical accompaniment under the majority of the film.The Man from Earth comes highly recommended but, having watched it myself, I really don't see why. Yes it is good to see a film with an idea being its core but this in itself doesn't make the film good ? just like a play, delivery is still important and here it is off. The words may suggest intelligence but the delivery does not as it is wooden, stiff and lacking intent and insight. I have no idea why this is as highly regarded as IMDb suggest it is, but for me it is a suggestion of a good idea that is poorly delivered and ultimately gives the viewer nothing to take away. It speaks volumes to me that so much of the praise here focuses on the film NOT being Transformers etc, rather than praising it for what it actually is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated and Dull Religious Rap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that gives thoughtful skepticism about Deity and Religion a bad rap. The rap here is nothing new or even refreshing. It is a rather "old" and tired rumination about Religious faith and doctored Holy documents.This one never elevates itself above sophomoric and the players seem to struggle and it all seems stilted and ready to come to a halt but unfortunately it musters enough forced energy to keep going. The philosophy is not thought-provoking and there is not one ah-ha moment. The other problem besides the script is the total lack of charisma that is needed for the main character to carry the film. It is he, after all, that after 14,000 years never developed a personality of any charm. The telling of the tale is so dull and distant that it seems even he does not believe it.This script is not worthy of off-Broadway theater and the monologues and ideas presented here as insightful and new would not pass scrutiny in a Village coffee shop in the 1950's. Inadequate, insulting, and incredibly overrated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paper-thin plot, executed listlessly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People hoping for an intellectually challenging movie, good science fiction, or even a mildly enjoyable movie should not watch 'The Man from Earth'.The central concept surrounding the main character does not succeed in becoming more than a gimmick. The writer mistakenly presumed this feature could stand by itself. It fails to spark a sense of mystery, which is aggravated by becoming apparent to even a mildly genre savvy viewer within two minutes. The obviousness of the concept makes the constant incredulous reactions of the other characters very annoying. Some reviewers have pointed out the strength of the concept is its ambiguity, but when one sees the amount of effort made by the writer to uneasily force this uncertainty unto the story, this argument can be quickly discarded.The characters portrayed are caricatures, which is an insurmountable obstacle in a movie in which eight persons are constantly in one room. From the rock and roll professor to the prudish zealot, not one character is realistic enough to be identified with. This is made worse by college professors discussing like 18-year-olds, with a failed attempt to use one student (behaving like a 14-year-old) as a foil. Very annoying is the lack of research. The film tries to attain an intellectual level by name-dropping and reciting well-known quotes, never digging deeper to any meaning in the progress. Some references break every belief in the setting, such as a professor in archeology citing the outdated (by a century) notion of voluntary sedentarisation.Lastly, the lackluster acting of the cast (of which some have shown that they can do better) is painful to watch, a pain which is only surpassed by the ridiculous choice and timing of the music. Together, these failures remove every possibility to take this movie seriously, rendering it nothing more than a (bad) effort.It escapes sense that 'The Man from Earth' is currently rated 8 out of 10. My advice: do not waste your time on this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure why this is (currently) rated an 8.1 I've seen this theme done at least twice before - once as a Twilight Zone episode (and far better, I should add), and once as a Star Trek TOS episode (Requiem for Methuselah). There are some interesting ideas, but the wooden acting and glacial pacing make it hard to watch. I guess if you haven't seen either of the previous, superior shows, than you might think that this was something special. As it is, it's pretty sophomoric. At least Bixby didn't give in to some of the most obvious plot temptations, like injuring John to watch him heal. Of course, he couldn't resist killing off the only character to finally change his mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My 1 is really a 10 on the ironic enjoyment scale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you saw this movie and consider it controversial or offensive, stop reading this now because I could care less about the laughable "controversy" and instead am wholly focused on this movie as a grand artistic failure.This came as a Netflix recommendation, which in retrospect has me seriously considering that their recommendations formula takes ironic enjoyment into account.Plot intro and formal panning: John Oldman tells his professor buddies that he's leaving, not coming back, and isn't sure where he's going. They ask why, and he doesn't produce a good reason. After them just asking a bit more(ie without creating an urgent motivation to answer or calling to mind any sort of motivating feeling that the audience that the audience is privy to) he tells them that he has never told the following to anyone, ever: that he was originally a Cro-Magnon, and is about 14,000 years old. Think about that. 14,000 years went by and he never once told anyone that he can't die? And assuming that that is true, he now divulges his secret just because a few people(who don't seem all that close with him) gently prod?Now you could say, "well, maybe he just had enough of being secretive." Bullshit. The movie doesn't give us any inkling of him trying to hold back. It's just "Honey, we're out of milk. Oh, and I've never told anyone this ever, but I'm 14,000 years old. Do you want me to pick up cat food?" Response? "Fancy Feast." That's essentially it.I won't even go into the shockers, but trust me when I say that they're absolutely adorable. Oh, and did I mention that the movie about the 14,000 year old man contains no flashbacks? Moving furniture is as high as the action gets.How did this movie attain an 8.0 with close to 40,000 votes? I'm no conspiracy theorist, but I'm inclined to believe that there's some vote rigging going on. I kind of doubt that 40,000 people have even seen it. The sad thing is, I would probably have given this a 7 just out of the sheer enjoyment I got from it, however ironic it was, but my urge to right a wrong is stronger than giving a sincere 7 star recommendation for ironic enjoyment.On a side note, see the trailer, whether or not you've seen the movie. It's really well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 of 10 was the acting at various points throughout the film. However, given the content of the film, I feel that the actors did the best they could with the emotions and reactions they had set out to portray. This movie is an EXTREME look into faith, philosophy, technology, the way we learn, the way we think, and they way we perceive things should be based upon our known logic to date. I haven't read the book but absolutely plan to, if only to hear more arguments in the round-table discussion. I was very hesitant to see this movie, and only did because I had nothing better to do. After a few minutes into the film I was hooked and couldn't step away for even a moment. Another reviewer had commented that the movie sometimes made you want to be right alongside the characters asking your own questions to the main character, and they were right. This movie has no action sequences, love scenes, or violence that we know and sometimes love in cinema. All that is here is simply this: a story. A story that questions a great deal of what you thought you knew. I doubt that this movie will "open your eyes" to a new way of thinking or spark a revolution in your own mind but I can guarantee that even if you hate this film, you will still be talking about it when it is done, especially if you watch it with someone else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films I've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first thing you should know before watching this movie is that the IMDb reviews here are flooded with 9 and 10 ratings from one-time reviewers. Evidently the filmmakers and production company recruited hordes of shills to post bogus reviews in order to salvage an extraordinarily bad film.Proof of point: Most of these phony reviews have similar content and patterns. Some common themes you see in these fake reviews: 1. Making the point that this film doesn't bother with all the overwrought special effects common to big production Hollywood sci-fis. 2. The film is a deep philosophical discussion of "theology", "biology", "psychology". Yes, look for these exact terms and their variants. It's quite amazing all three of these appear simultaneously in so many reviews. 3. Overzealous description of how amazing the film is without explaining specifically why. Generic and broad stroke statements about how ingenious the movie is.I won't bother to describe all the ways this movie is terrible because it's already been done so well by many of the other reviews on here, and I concur.One funny note: The one redeeming quality is accidental. The editing is so bad that they didn't even bother to redo a scene towards the end where "Linda" stands up and you can clearly see her ass crack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a science fiction lover, loads of different thought provoking films like Donnie Darko really engage my interest because of the depth and thought which has been put into the script. I came across this film during a night of hot passion for an unusual plot. This at the time had a score of 8.5 I believe, I thought "wow, this is gonna be good". Then I watched it... Oh God, why did I watch it, I am actually foaming at the mouth for my complete hatred for the high score and great reviews. Before I go any further please read: THE SCORE OF THE FILM PLUS THE MANY POSITIVE REVIEWS ARE ACTUALLY FALSE. This is discovered by first the absolute joke of a film and second, the review is only by "one time reviewers" purposely for this film. *****SPOILERS***** Okay, the concept is interesting, however the acting, script writing, dialog and character development is so bad you can't actually laugh because it is so rubbish. For starters, when he said he was 14,000 years old, everyone gets angry, real angry, in real life, people would laugh it off. Second, no one decides to try and get someone taken away by the men in white purely for a crazy story which you don't even know if he's having a laugh. He's Jesus, he met the most influential people of the world, with no telecommunications of their whereabouts, HOW! and the absolute steamer of an ending is this, one of the profs in the room WAS HIS SON (7 billion people in the world, 1 of them is his son, he is sitting in his living room, with a gun telling everyone he's going to pop some caps at a story). Oh, so he found his pops, why not throw in a dramatic (loosely associated with a coffee bowel movement)heart attack. Watch this film if you do not heed to my warning, then make sure you review it because it deserves to be on IMDb's most hated list.I must mention that I made an account to review this to help you lot on not watching this film</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The reason I watched this movie was because I was a huge fan of the Highlander series on TV as a kid, and I've always thought that the series was great at utilizing flashbacks to show how certain events and experiences can shape a person's life. So when I saw that 'The Man From Earth' was about a 14,000 year old immortal, I was interested to see if Bixby would do something similar.The movie went in another direction however, and focused not so much on individual growth but the growth of societies and their views on history, religion, etc. This is done without much visual aid: the entire movie is a long, poorly written discussion.I like to think of this movie as sort of a preamble to an introduction to an intellectual movie. Any views this movie challenges happen on a very low level. These include: "Some religions may be wrong", and "Man's view of history often gets skewed over a period of time." And I'd like to make sure you all know that it's not because the movie was just a discussion that it failed. Stalker, by Tarkovsky, is a film which is 90% discussion. THAT is an intellectual film, which challenges views on many different levels. The Man From Earth is a movie that is only slightly interesting but pretends to be much more.If you want a good story about an 'immortal', go watch Highlander. If you want an intellectual movie, watch a Tarkovsky film. Don't waste your time with this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice idea, but too absurd to be funny - contains SPOILERS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all: it is hard to categorize this movie. Until the last minute, I was not sure what to make of it. But then, when the final credits came up, I could just - laugh.I am a bit surprised that most comments take this movie for a serious Sci-Fi movie. Admittedly: the plot is not that bad, the dialogues are entertaining (even though they are trying a bit too hard to be intellectual and witty), and it seems to make sense somehow - but then the story gets so exaggerated that it just draws the whole film down to ridiculous.There are (at least) two points which deprive the movie of all its credibility, so you just can't take it seriously any more: the role the protagonist claims to have played in the bible age, and the role of the psychiatrist. Until this point, you can still follow the line, enjoying the discussion of the characters involved; but then - the whole plot gets blown into pieces by that absolutely absurd and ridiculous statement, which is too nonsense to make you actually think and too cheap to actually make you laugh.I can, for the life of me, not see in what respect this movie could be considered intellectual. It is based on one interesting idea, but doesn't make much of it and leaves you wondering why you just spent your precious time on a half-baked fantasy story. I am not sure whether the director was aiming at being a Sci-Fi guru or a comedian - to my opinion, he failed in both.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>seen through the eyes of an immortal caveman, throughout the ages. Man from Earth brilliantly challenges logic and religion and science, all from the confines of one room. In the hands of a lesser writer this premise might have made for a good Twilight Zone, but Jerome Bixby has examined every emotion, every question, every insight, and through the simple art of conversation has given us a feature length history lesson for the ages. We leave the experience knowing there are no real cavemen still walking about, yet we are left with numerous historical details that they just don't teach in school. Not unlike William Peter Blatty's The Ninth Configuration, this film demands utter attention from the viewer, and should be watched three or four times so as not to miss any of the rapid-fire dialogue. Fundamentalist Christians may not appreciate some of the historical truths in this film. Not John Oldman's former identity, but verifiable facts ranging from the origin of Moses to the inspiration of Jesus.Godfather and Jaws and Touch of Evil are still my favorite three movies, but Man from Earth is now in the top twenty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The budget for this film was SO low they had to return all the rented furniture in the middle of the movie. And what's with the color correction, if there was any? I remember, when I was 12, I tried to shoot a movie with my classmates, on a cheap VHS camera - it had the same quality of the picture. The main hero claims to be a Jesus, but why the heck would they pick a B-rated porn actor for this role? I have no idea. I like the music in the picture, however. You know why? Because there was no music. Thank God for that because it would probably be as cheap and ugly as the people who thought that making this abomination would be a good idea.The main plot of the film is simple - a guy brings a bunch of people he worked with for 10 years to tell them that he leaves, and that they're all gonna die soon, while he will continue on living forever. Moreover, this shmack, doesn't feel too much satisfied with the results, so he adds a stunning fact that he's also Jesus, the Christ. What a plot twist! Someone, please, give the writers an award, award for the lamest movie scenario. Is there such an award? Well, I hope there is because otherwise this movie will not get any at all.Obviously, offended, and p*ssed off co-workers call him crazy, and some even start crying, so bad he made them feel, but he doesn't care. He just wanted to tell the truth to someone for once. He doesn't stop pouring everyone in the room with historically inaccurate bullsh*t until the very end, and this is when he finally realizes that he's going to end up in a mental house and the end of this day, so he suddenly "reveals" that it was all just a funny joke. So, you guys can laugh now. Of course, no one laughs. In fact, this makes everyone feel angry to the point where they decide to leave.Speaking about accuracy. Have you ever heard about an ocean named "Mediterranean"? Personally, I didn't. Well, the movie, and all the scientists in the movie believe it does.This movie starts bad, boring, uninviting, and it continues being bad up to the very end. Even the ending itself is bad. One of the characters dies from a heart attack. Makes me think that on his place could've easily be me, along with my poor computer. I'm sorry, my computer, I'm sorry my brain. I promise, I will never ever let you experience such pain again.And what's with the title itself? Even the title is confusing, and in general is just not right for the movie. Man From Earth? Okay? Where is the man from Mars, or from other planets? There will be none. Why is it called Man from Earth? Is it because all the characters are Plutonians, and the movie was shot on Pluto? Nope. It was shot on Earth. The will be no Plutonians here, only few unlikable, boring, very boring characters from 50's. What is the point of this title? Man from Earth, And?... So what? It's like making a film about a guy driving his truck for 87 minutes, watching the road, whistling something to himself, sometimes picking up hookers, drinking coffee, and calling the movie "A Truck From Earth". I don't get it. It's just f**king stupid.Should you watch this film? Well, here's another question for you: do you like having a really bad day, and a headache too?This movie sucks.</fullReview>

It's entertaining, slightly thought-inducing when it takes on a few deep topics, in particular relating to religion.The acting is average, the storyline below average and the production value way below average. But because it takes on religion, it so far received incredible ratings (higher than most iconic scifi flicks in fact) from a specific group of American viewers who perhaps feel oppressed by the lack of separation between church and states in their own country.For people outside this demographic, this movie comes across as very bland and unimaginative. Even the so called 'groundbreaking' ideas it touches have been re-hashed over and over again, no only in theological cycles but also on the Internet and in other movies.The only shocking discovery this movie brought me is how small minded and angry some reviewers are on this site. 10/10 just because the movie's main character poo-pooed the religious dogma you hated so much as a child? You're not movie critics, you're angsty teenagers.I give this movie 4/10, and for the record I'm an atheist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an overly boring movie. Everything happens in one room packed with mostly bad actors. (Tony Todd being the exception on the good side, Alexis Thorpe on the other hand is just unnecessary and David Lee Smith is just depressing. Others are mediocre at best.) I bought (!) this DVD since it was not available for rent anywhere in Germany and the reviews here were so good (I probably did not get the irony). I am also always looking for some good Sci-Fi and a star Trek script is not the worst resume. From the review I knew that I could not expect a space opera. In the first ten minutes of the movie I was only annoyed by the music, which is cheesy and does totally not fit to the dialog.30 minutes later one must realize, that not much more will happen. One guy insists on being 14.000 years old and tells some stories, one of those is that he was a misunderstood Jesus, to prove his point. In the end he admits it was all fake just to relieve the listeners, and then it is of course being revealed to the viewer that everything was right - the 14.000 year old man is actually the father of one guy in the group and proves this be giving family details.Ouch. This movie is just a plain bad TV-production. I give it 4 stars, because I never give less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, this "movie" looks like a play put to the big screen. I looks like it should be in a theater. It does not translate well.Second, the story just has too many holes and not enough answers. The guy has 14,000 years to finally tell the "truth" to his friends and this is the best he can do? He has very few details and the story goes too far to explain why the author couldn't provide those details by saying that it's too hard to remember details.He provides no proof, which, like believing in a god, would be a clincher. Waiting for him to provide this proof, I guess I was asking too much. How hard would it be to show a 100 year old picture of yourself?He studied with Buddha and was Jesus...ugh. I think the writer must have evolved the whole story around that. (i.e. No childhood of Jesus and appeared around 35 y/o, and survived a crucifixion)The ending was SOOOOO weak. He "accidently" blurbs out the he use to be some guy who happened to be the father of one of his friends, who happens to die from the shock. Hey, that's convenient. Why bother telling your girlfriend, when you can tell your son?Acting: I think the main lead guy did a good job with what he had. The director must have told everyone else to overact by acting "intelligently angry" the whole movie.Science Fiction is a generous genre to put this into. I think the poster art is cool and obviously was hoping for more.My wife walked out 1/2 way thru and I had to tell her the rest of the story, which took 4 seconds of my time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My initial comment is; it's too bad that devout Christians will not be able to separate the current fiction of Christianity from science-fiction as this movie is classified.My primary comment is; I thought the movie was very well done. I agree with several other commenters that the cast of characters brought out the discussion very well.To watch a movie that presents an alternate view point to so many closed minded "Christians" put a smile on my face. Sorry Mentaly Shallow people disgust me. Open your minds and respect an alternate opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a movie buff,so don't mind suspending my disbelief to live a story but this movie requires along with it,suspension of ur intelligence and ur common sense.I mean u'd have to be incredibly lucky that u not only live for 14000 years but also live in some of the best known moments in history like our very own very oldman john in this movie did by being a sumerian,a babylonian,living under hammurabi,meeting buddha,sailing with columbus,being friends with van gogh and obviously being Jesus himself,LOL.What i find incredible is the lack of any serious thought given in developing the central character,like john obviously realised he was special very early and humans started recording history a long time ago,so why didn't he record his life,in a diary or something.Humans,normals ones,like all of us who know we'll face certain death in 70-80 years,even we always seek a purpose,sometimes higher than our own selves to live by but john here supposedly Jesus himself,lived for almost a 1000 years watching people in europe being burned at the stake by the church for heresy in his name and did absolutely nothing about it,i mean he could have at least tried to form a new religion to undo the damage he unintentionally did the first time around but here he is professor and all,moving on every ten years like a ghost.Initially i thought at least the concept was interesting but the ending was just awful and it morphed into this left wing Christianity bashing,buddhism advertising ugly exercise and i say that even though i'm not a Christian,the poor attempt to hide the lack of story by resorting to Christianity bashing in this movie is just pathetic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well written film - inspired by the legend of Krim Ros&#x169;</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Transylvanian folklore a tale of a man with almost eternal life is told, a man of great wisdom, gathered through all his years in this world. That is the legend of Krim Ros&#x169;.In this film Schenkman and Bixby tells a tale truly inspired by the one about Krim. A man, born over 30.000 years ago, tells his friends about his life and experiences. But his friends, of course, have trouble to believe the tale, unbelievable as it is, and some protest him telling the story. But Harry convinces him to keep going, as a thought experiment.The discussion continues and touches some important philosophical and religious issues as well as some highly personal ones for the characters. It is easy to draw a parallel to Krim Ros&#x169; and the philosophical questions he raised, and I think everyone who sees this film should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>speaking solely as a movie, i didn't really liked it. not because there were no FX or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole film, actually that was what kept me watching it.i didn't like it because the acting was shady, his "friends" are all happy and then they're mad, but you have no idea why; then they take distinct roles, one is the believer, other is the antagonist, but they never really make the point! also, the lighting was terrible and i'm just mentioning technical issues.in a few words, i thing the movie could have just had a "ok i'm outta here!" from some characters. like the lady who doesn't want to hear his version of the bible.about the story itself, everyone is free to write about what they want, and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination. i credit the book author for that, hence, my 4/10.so, in the end, hear the man's story believe it or not, just don't spend the whole time acting like you believe him and being shocked at what he says, and at the same time moving around and making jokes like you don't believe him.Coherence.thanks for reading ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best science fiction film of 2007</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They simply don't make films like this anymore. Dramatic, thoughtful, insightful, an intellectual mind trip with a non-Hollywoodized killer of a surprise ending.Some people are describing Man from Earth as a "book," not a movie, because there is nothing but conversation. If so, it is certainly in good company. 12 Angry Men, The Breakfast Club, Glengary GlenRoss, The Verdict, and so forth. Man from Earth reminds us that good entertainment need not require explosions nor car chases nor violence. Good stories are just that -- stories. This is a campfire story, as was long before ipods and television and radio, when people would sit around the fire and someone would speak, and others would simply listen. Also, these characters are intelligent. Their dialogue isn't dumbed down, as so often is the case in films these days, so the Knocked Up crowd can understand it.A shame so many religious fanatics are bashing this film based not on it's artistic merits but rather on their beliefs. For the record, atheists can enjoy Ben Hur for what it is, brilliant film-making, without childish whining about Dawrwin and how there was no real Christ. To the nice people in the Bible Belt; learn some tolerance. Calling a brilliant film like is "the WORST movie ever made" does nothing but parade your ignorance.Judging from the majority of the comments, there is obviously a large audience out there starved for good science fiction. I recommend Man From Earth as the one movie you do not want to miss. Be it science fiction or simply good drama, Man from Earth will not disappoint.</fullReview>

Sad to say, I missed the premiere in Hemet. His father wrote this story in the late 1960's He completed the screenplay just before his death in April of 1998I love Sci-Fi and Indi films and this movie was no exception. Written by Jerome Bixby, who wrote Fantastic Voyage, four classic Star Trek episodes and one unforgettable Twilight Zone episode ("It's a Good Life", )The Man from Earth's plot concerns a goodbye party for a college professor who reveals that he is an immortal who is more than 14,000 years old.It is a brainy film, without all the million dollay effects you see today to drive the film leaving it up to the story and actors, like the good old days.It's one of the best Indi films i have seen in a while.

Great movie if you like to think about humanity as a whole, and the journey we have been on. This is the first comment i have ever made on any movie on the Internet but i think its important to support well made, intelligent low budget films as opposed to thoughtless blockbusters churned out by the Hollywood machine.

		<fullReview>I felt the need to get involved with this film as well. I watched this because I love Sci-Fi and this was rated so highly, but I really have no idea why.The central idea is that a university professor is really a 14,000 cave man who has evolved and lived on. He doesn't scar (convenient), doesn't keep mementos (again very convenient, but awfully explained away in the beginning), and offers no details other than some crude outlines of what happened at that time. Let's not even begin to think that the odds of him not being killed by something other than nature is probably very likely to happen over the course of the ages that he lived through. Oh, and he happened to be around and close to some very historical figures and was also Jesus Christ. So for someone who doesn't really keep a low profile enough to be in contact with some of these people and yet still manage to not be killed from any act other than nature beggars belief.The idea was actually decent, but the lack of prying from these so-called university professors bordered on the ridiculous. The explanations that were offered up were not really thought through enough either. Surely, one would keep mementos when you meet and are close to some serious historical figures - he happened to have a rock from his days as a cave-man and a painting from Van Gogh, but nothing else. That is just poor writing. No photos offered. No other languages spoken. In essence, there seemed to be so much time to get through that everything was literally waxed over and badly.Also, that this cave man was merely just a university professor was a source of irritation as well. You'd think that he would be so wealthy that he could actually hide himself away from having to move every 10 years or actually established a method for the least amount of upheaval. Nope - for a 14,000 year old man, he must have been a complete dunce. Let's also overlook the fact that these teachings that he got from Buddha seemed to be of no consequence to his consciousness. That was also overlooked.So the result is a very stereotypical movie which the central thrust is that Christ was merely a man whose story has been deified and lost in translation that it is now more or less a fairy tale.Now we get to the acting which is probably the most laughable portion of the film. Every character (bar the professor who represents the pro-Christian view) was poorly acted. At times, the main character is talking so lowly that the awful soundtrack is in danger of upstaging him. The other characters are just as bad. Tony Todd has to always have something else that he is doing in scenes, like examining the inside of a cupboard (like you do in someone else's home), or constantly punctuating his lines by slinging a yo-yo (I absolutely hated that. He even did it just as his character made his exit. The last scene of him driving a car, I half expected him to do it). The old man's heart attack was acted terribly as well. It seemed that a 7 year old instructed him on what should be done. Not to mention that earlier, he pulls a pipe allegedly stuffed full of tobacco out of his pocket (his pockets must be full of tobacco).The film is worth a watch, but is this film even approaching as high a score as it is claimed here? Not a chance. It is probably no better than a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to understand the enthusiastic reviews, maybe the audience is nowadays as under-educated as the professors in the movie who lack competence to argue the story of an pretended 14000 old man. Out of arguments, they mostly react angry, burst out in emotions, by the way, awfully acted. It's a movie in a closed environment, and you expect witty conversations. None of that. You expect professional knowledge of historic facts. None of that. You expect surprising, but understandable changes in the relations or behavior of the characters, none of that. Oh, how shocking : he's Jesus, not the son of God, the foundation of my life shattered, that's the climax? Well no, he's the father of the old professor psychiatrist, who then dies of an heart-attack. Ridiculous. What can you expect from the author of StarTrek series. And for 1.000 of years, it never came to the main character to keep souvenirs of the people he lost, of things he was attached to? Right, superficial all over! There is only one good phrase at the end of the movie : "It's a beautiful idea, so rich, so full of possibilities." But the idea of an everliving Caveman is awfully wasted. If you want to see a brilliant movie in a closed environment about truth and lies, I recommend "Sleuth" 1972</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the premise, not the execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just watched this and was amazed when I came on here to find so many glittering reviews. Don't get me wrong; I loved the idea and approach of this movie, very refreshing. I also thought it had some very good dialogue here and there and had its moments - but as a movie overall? Sorry, no thanks; ultimately it was underwhelming and often I thought just clumsily executed. For one, there was for me a lack of believability, and I don't mean about the premise of the main character. I didn't generally find the characters very likable or even believable within themselves - eg the clichéd, wise-cracking Harry. And why were Art and Linda even there? They added precious little to the story. Further, it was at times hard to believe these people were friends at all, let alone good ones. They (and so the movie) just didn't have a "chemistry" to me; it had a sort of disjointed feeling. I also think it was in part a thinly veiled excuse to rip on Christianity; gee there's something new (for the record I am agnostic). I couldn't help rolling my eyes and going "oh brother" when that part emerged. In short, I loved what this movie tried to do, but felt that too often it was clumsy, even amateurish, in its execution and ultimately just didn't work. Frankly I think this is the kind of movie that some people embrace or overrate because of its attempted "intellectual nature," ie as a way to go "see, it's intellectual and I like it, so I'm intellectual." The fact that the author was a popular sci fi writer and this was his last work (completed on his deathbed) might not have hurt either. In short, it's easy to see why this would be trendy to like. To each their own; I'll agree to disagree.Again I did love the premise of the movie, I just don't think it worked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard a lot about how this film proves you can do great sci fi with no special effects, etc. Which is great! But "Primer" is a much better example of that. Because "The Man From Earth" is all premise and no film.It's a fantastic, thought-provoking idea. No argument there. But they didn't build anything resembling a film around it. Yes, you can make a great film out of pure conversation, but you have to be careful to construct real, convincing, engaging drama. This film does not. The dialog varies from acceptable to outrageously phony (a good example: one character howling out in a heated moment "I reject this!" Who talks like that?) The character's reactions are inconsistent and swing wildly from confusing to unbelievable. Every twist is predictable. The final revelation is poorly set up as a crazy coincidence, overheard by accident.If the film gets by, it's only because the premise is so fascinating. But it only BARELY gets by.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this movie. I appreciated that the entire film was solely based on dialog and that there were no fancy flashback scenes. And I also enjoyed the intellectual challenge posed by the film.I think though that this film could have been so much better. For this film to work it really needs to be a lot more thought-provoking and ground breaking intellectually.As a historian I loved the idea and was thrilled to see it being played out. However I was disappointed that the story revolved around Western Civ 101.The story of the birth of Christianity as told by the main character is an old and favorite of amateur historians mostly told at cocktail parties to impress and create controversy.I was really hoping and expecting something new, exciting and thought-provoking. Instead the story is based on trivia and historical generalities (e.g. pig farmer friend of Van Gogh, student of the first Buddha, etc...).The idea of a man living from the dawn of human history is a vast literary treasure trove. And yet all this movie focuses on is the roots of Christianity. David Lee Smith's character, John Oldman, lived 40,000 years and yet the only details of that incredible story he re-tells are of being Jesus and his convenient friendship with Van Gogh which he never describes.This film could've been a beautiful and amazing insight into human history and into the human condition and all it turns out to be is an agnostic vehicle.I rated the film 7/10 as the idea is wonderful, the dialog is decent and the simple presentation is daring and well-done.Where the film fails is in the poor cinematography and lighting. Its almost as if the director was directing a play vs a film. The characters are all boring stereotypical professors with the addition of their attractive female devotees/flunkies--Alexis Thorpe and Annika Peterson.Furthermore the film's inability to tap into the wonderful richness of the human story keeps it grounded in mediocrity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having read a review of this movie on IMDb I was rather keen to take the time to watch it. What a big mistake. I won't go into depth as to the plot, as I cannot find anything positive to say, although, the subject matter intrigued me. I was intrigued by the IMDb plot-line and that was as far as it went.A movie for TV, SciFi? Low budget, stereotypical, are all the thoughts that went into my mind during the first 5 minutes. Unfortunately this continued all the way through the film. The acting is not of a high quality, the characters are your usual US / TV movie stereotypes (Professors / Teachers etc, the young blond girlfriend).One aspect of the film did stay with me, only due to the fact it's a pet hate of mine. Why, Oh Why! Do people from the US feel the need to call Vincent Van Gogh, 'Van Go!', do they pronounce 'Cough - Co'? or 'Rough - Ro'? I'm sorry but that is the only one thing this film left me with.I know a previous reviewer thoroughly enjoyed this film but I sadly found it too much on the side of cheap rubbish. I wasn't expecting anything amazing but half decent would have been a start.2/10 is more than I should really give.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IMDb users may tell you that this will exercise your brain, but every idea it puts forth hoping to startle you into a frenzy of mental activity might well have been thought up in an 8th-grade social studies classroom.Beginning with an interesting, if old, premise, The Man From Earth can think of nothing more interesting that a 14,000-year-old man can be than Jesus himself, who met Buddha, Columbus, Van Gogh, and who the hell knows who else, and is frankly terribly disappointed at the way humanity has just gotten everything he taught all wrong! Are these seriously what we are calling new and shocking ideas? To how many of you did it not previously occur, perhaps during your adolescence, to think, "Well, what if Jesus's teachings were distorted? What if he is looking at the world today upset at its mistakes? What if Jesus was just Some Guy?" Could this idea not have been approached with some intellectual integrity? Especially in the nonsense academic setting in which the story is placed, perhaps some academic research and thought would have been appropriate. The story, written as it is, might have been better placed around a table at which were seated a religious zealot, jokester, and pseudo-philosopher who didn't happen to have degrees.Acting is terrible too. Everything altogether feels like a high school play. Tony Todd's weird mumbling, high-school pseudo-philosophy ramblings sound like he is about to lose in a poetry slam, Harry's awkward joke-telling is consistently unnatural, and John himself is odious and wooden, creaking through his stiff dialogue.I watched this movie based on IMDb's ratings, which have at times failed me, but never before have I found popular opinion on this site to be so bizarre. I can't remember ever having said this before, but I honestly think that this movie had few, perhaps even no redeeming features! This is a humiliating farce; watch History of the World, or listen to 2,000 Year-Old-Man recordings. You'll be no closer nor further from a stimulating "What-if?" examination of a truly ancient human being, but at least you'll laugh.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man from earth seems, by description, to be a film with an interesting plot base to write from. You might think that it could be interesting to observe how the director/writer pull it off. You may think that maybe they would tailor the story to some interesting sort of unbiased theological/scientific limbo which leaves the viewer provoked but not completely driven to one conclusion.You would be wrong. As I was.The acting is mostly poor and the production completely uninspiring... not to mention the writing. They sit there and initially show suspicion at the 1 or two objects and indications of the truth, but when they confront the subject they are pacified with kindergarten answers.One character has a complete breakdown about 2/3rd's in, which you might imagine to be a reasonable response for a less emotionally stable subject when confronted with the daunting truth behind the "man[...]". Wrong again. The writer manages, with the help of the actors, to make the whole scene completely un compelling and un believable.You would expect a "man[...]" of his nature to be slightly more learned about how to leave town without arousing suspicion, or to be more careful about building apparently close relationships with the people in every time and place he's lived.Don't waste your time. Instead: call up a friend or two or five, grab a beer/drink, and talk the subject over yourselves. You will come up with much more intriguing observations and possibilities than this movie offers.</fullReview>

The opening scene made it apparent this was a low budget straight to TV release but I was still prepared to watch this movie for the promise of something special. I was deeply disappointed. This movie is so bad it doesn't even warrant a one. The story line is so shambolic it could only have come from a seriously deranged mental patient. The characters are so annoyingly stereotypical that painting a 2 dimensional picture of them would give them depth. The look and feel of the movie screams cheap so loud it would bring the birds from the trees.This is just a very poor movie on so many levels that to see it get an 8 is just amazing.

		<fullReview>This parody of a scifi movie directed by a guy who hasn't directed a single good movie in his life (unless you think Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies should have gotten an Oscar nomination) and written by a guy whose previous supreme achievement was a few bad episodes of Star Trek. There's no script, no acting, no directing, no photography, no production, nothing that would make this worthy of being called a movie. What it is is an opinion poll that gives us a very revealing and depressing picture of how shallow the average scifi movie spectator has become.Today you couldn't drag the average scifi spectator to 2001 Space Odyssey or Tarkovsky's Solaris with wild horses but they'll all rave over how "deep" Matrix and Cloud Atlas are. If you're a fan of the Wachowski Bros circus, you're gonna love this. It's right up your very short, tacky, and boring alley. It's deep like the deep end of the kiddie pool, which is apparently about as deep as 80% of scifi fans can handle nowadays.If someone had really lived for 10,000 years trust me, he wouldn't say anything that we in our present state of intellectual decrepitude could understand. Mankind has watched the idiot box for over 50 years and Hollywood dreck for even longer. That's more than enough to turn us all into the living brain-dead.

I do however consider myself to be a good person, husband of 40 years (to the same wonderful woman), good father, etc. I think this film presents religion for what it really is... the continuation of ancient myths and stories handed down from time immemorial. As we are taught as children to believe in, as George Carlin said, "an invisible man who lives in the sky" it becomes so deeply embedded in our psyche that we cannot shake the belief. Even now, in my 60's, I get that little "twinge" when I say I don't believe in God. This film presents religion and history in a rational alternative to what we have all been taught. Why can't IT be true and the "truth" be wrong?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best sci-fi movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie title got my attention and I decided to watch it. I didn't read any synopses and because of this I didn't expect it to be so mind blowing. The handful of characters are well developed as the movie goes on and the climax is superb. Although the movie isn't action paced like most of sci-fis, this one is masterfully crafted when it comes to characters dialogues. I caught myself wondering and questioning my very beliefs while being amazed by the movie's excellent plot. Its simple premise of a guy having lived for 14k years gets deeper and deeper and you start imagining, as even some characters do in sake of scientific argumentation, how would it be like to be him. For all those who love philosophical sci-fi movies this one is mandatory, it's definitely a must-see. (Sorry for my poor English)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a deception!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie based on the rating that was displayed on IMDb. Normally it works quite well... not this time! Rarely have I seen worse acting, worse photography, worse directing and worse adapted script to the screen. The main character almost didn't change the tone of his voice during the whole movie, maintaining a sanctified-poker-face across all of it even when pointed at with a revolver. But the rest of the actors were just as bad with maybe one exception, John Billingsley was fine, doing the best he could with a cardboard "adaption" of a script that might be well read in a book but not on a film. But the problem was not only the acting, to start with, I don't know what hardware these guys have used, but the image definition was very poor (or the editing ruined it). Not only that, lighting looked like the one used in cheap Mexican soap operas, with strong sideways light burning the faces of the characters, even when, supposedly, the sun was setting down. Like these, there are several details that make this movie look amateurish to say the least. So why does it have more than 8 points on IMDb? I can only think that there is a strong presence of the geeky-intellectualoid type of readers here. Anything that looks like a well built historical-sci-fi script will rate well, even if the movie is just a piece of crap. I gave the movie two stars, one for Billingsley and another one for the book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that reminds me of Stalker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Tarkovsky's Stalker, the Room is a place where only the innermost wishes are fulfilled, wishes you might not even fully realize you had. The world that Tarkovsky portrays in that film is bleak and glum, but I believe that man, even in those grim circumstances, would wish for humanity's strongest desire, immortality. I have often wondered if the stalker is actually immortal, and if the Room is nothing but a scientific instrument to provide immortality, the stalker being an obvious product of that. John Oldman is a history professor, leaving his job and his friends of 10 years, to move over to a new place. It is a time for a final goodbye. As it turns out, its time for a shocking revelation ? Oldman is a caveman who has survived the past 14,000 years. And as events follow, the scholars around him consisting of fellow academics who seem to have pretty much arrived at 'final conclusions' as far as their respective fields are concerned, have their thoughts truly provoked like never before. There's a clever observation the film makes early in the film. Dan, an archaeologist, asks John that the seemingly authentic burin in his home is one of those artifacts he has kept with and for himself as a well, memento. Dan replies that it is indeed from a thrift shop. Our primary instinct as audience is that he's obviously lying. Yet, seldom is it do we keep mementoes of our present. If we go back in time, we might treasure it then via mementoes and relics, for we're living in a time frame significantly different than us. But, if we're living in the present, all the time, it is a whole different ballgame. Put in front of an immortal, we would shoot questions that would primarily have to do with a lot of historical events. And, even for a man living in those times, he never would know everything about it. We seldom learn and know the present; most usually, and this is a solemn truth of humanity, we tend to learn about the present by realizing about it once it is past. Most often we experience that realization by means of books and art when the brilliant elite of humanity show us the way.It is this knack of consistently keeping us engaged in the discussion after having captured our imagination that makes TMFE as riveting a drama as it is a thriller. Often we find ourselves part of the discussion when one of the characters raises our questions, and often we revel in the journey the scholastic discussion is taking us through. Courtesy the script an equally adept direction and most importantly good performances, we know these characters, we realize their biases, we realize how their arguments are a result of their inner selves and the shock their intellect has received. Brilliantly blending conventional editing under a tent that is essentially an extended sequence, the film, in many ways, plays out like an extended sequence in an adapted for mainstream Tarkovsky film. I was reminded of the brilliant third act of Stalker, its ability to keep us intellectually alert without keeping the human aspects of it at an arm's length. As a minimalist science fiction it is gripping, but as an intellectual discussion it is that rare film that is stimulating. The color of the film is essentially brown, even the under-lit sequences having a brownish tinge to the proceedings. Amongst the woods, the film manages a nice little setting, enacting the kind of settings our protagonist usually likes. Or would like, since I guess brown is nature's most common color after green. The visual flair reminded me, yet again, of the serenity of Stalker. By means of close intense shots and its low-key lighting, the film grippingly creates a cozy environment of thought provoking discussion we feel home at. It reminded me of those nights in college, few friends wrapped under blankets, as we discussed the mysteries of life and world. There were a few arbitrary grainy shots, but I guess working on such a low budget is bound to have its effects. Or was it my copy? Part of the brilliance of the script, and it is one of the most stimulating of recent times, is its conviction in what it stands for. TMFE is essentially a film whose intellect thrives on issues of faith. To my great relief, this one believes in its stand, often taking strength from its protagonist's assured belief. It is a film that through a scenario of immortality, which we would like to exist, tries to disturb long-standing beliefs. It is never what the film believes that matters, it all boils down to how much of it we can believe and how much of it we can, well, consider as mere "interesting discussion". Why did John feel the need to reveal his secret? It is a question as puzzling. He claims a lot, some of it feels like the bragging part of a very true claim. He could be a man in the laboratory of time, a product of an aberration of time like the one suggested in Stephen Baxter's Time's Eye. Does his psychology work the same way as us? There're few films ? Solaris, 2001, Stalker ? that I felt should never end. This film made me feel that. That it has achieved it without a single special effect is all the more wondrous. It is very interesting for what could be a greater achievement for a film on immortality than making us want to run it forever, and ever. I wonder what made them name the film TMFE. I guess they see him as a prospect to explore outer space. Man from earth would be just about perfect for those species to address him. And if the species by an outside chance happen to know English, John Oldman wouldn't be bad either. Probably they'll appreciate the sense of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting idea, flawed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, first let me say that I agree that the basic idea of the movie is interesting and thought provoking. But the main question is: does it work as a movie? No, not really. The big problem is that when after the man's initial confession there's not much story to keep the movie going for 90 minutes. And the big "surprise" half way through the movie is not that intriguing unless you're a religious person (which I'm not). The ending is totally unsurprising and bland.The whole movie basically takes place inside one room with the same bunch of people, which obviously makes it hard to keep up the viewer interest for the entire movie. If Spielberg or Cameron was directing this I'm sure it would be lots of historical look-backs spiced up with fancy computer effects, which at least would make the movie more entertaining. The production, acting, dialog, sound editing etc. is so bad it feels you're watching an episode of Twilight Zone rather than a feature film. You can really tell that this is very low budget.So, in conclusion, interesting idea, but much more is needed to make a good movie.P.S. If you were living for thousands of years, wouldn't you keep a journal?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting concept-gone totally awry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie as I saw it on a list of great movies to watch which no one has ever heard of. Reading the summary I was pretty excited as it sounded like a creative concept. But then the moment the movie started, the editing, directing, acting, cinematography...everything was really low quality and poorly done. I honestly could not believe this was released in 2007! I'll be blunt-the movie starts out pretty bad, then gets interesting (but it feels more like a documentary with several scholars discussing an idea like from the discovery channel of 'how it might be possible'), but then it got weird.There were many historical inaccuracies of his accounts of things which anyone who's studied those topics knows weren't the way things happened, but perhaps a filmmaker doesn't realize it. Overall, his stories were quite unrealistic. And yes, I do realize the whole premise is unrealistic, but at least they should have been a little more creative than having the protagonist meet every single famous person from history (including him turning out to be Jesus). Then the movie gets weirder. The one thing I will give the movie though is it shows how easily humans are skeptical, and equally, how suggestible we are once we have decided to believe in something (as depicted when he pretends at the end that the whole story is false, and everyone is more upset at him than in the beginning as they had started to finally believe him). I really wish that the previous people hadn't given this movie an 8 star rating, as it was so poorly executed, and overall just incredibly underdeveloped in terms of script, plot and characters. If I could give this movie -star I would, but I can't.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching this movie I felt that it was the twin brother of TV- adaptation of Stephen King's "The Stand" that came out in the early 90's. It is VERY noticeable that this is a budget movie. Bad casting, bad acting, crappy background props/environment, bad soundtrack - just like The Stand.But the story is AMAZING, and unlike The Stand's post-apocalypse setting, should apply to everyone. It is the story of a man claiming to have been born 14 000 years ago during the stone age. During the story telling you are kept on the edge all the time: Is this man telling the truth or is he just making it all up, trying to pull off some insane prank on his friends?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but doesn't live up to the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, let me say that I really wanted to enjoy this film. It sounded right up my street after all the glowing reviews. However, I have come away disappointed, and must admit I am a bit bemused by the raving about it.This film has a "made for TV" air about it. Whether it is the dodgy acting in places, or the slightly forced script I'm not sure, but it feels amateurish, especially at the start where I was cringing at points. However I stuck with it and the last 30 mins were a lot more watchable. The whole air made me think of the 12 Angry Men remake, although I enjoyed that a lot more.I don't think I'm giving anything away by saying that the protagonist claims to be 14,000 years old to a group of intellectual friends. The entire film is a conversation in his lounge that results from this revelation.The film is played "straight". There are no magic effects or weird powers. Just a normal guy who says he has lived for a long time. Whilst this sounds like a fascinating premise I found it very flat in practice. The film turns into a potted rapid fire history lesson which doesn't suddenly become interesting just because a guy says "I was there". As the characters constantly point out, this is stuff you can read in any history text book. The point of the film seems to be to put history into reality by the context of one man experiencing it, but this is nothing revolutionary. If you can imagine yourself living from the stone age you've pretty much got the film right there. The script keeps correcting the erroneous assumptions of the friends, and by extension the watcher, but to me these corrections were self evident and in no way clever.Later the film leans toward religious history and debate, but while superficially interesting, again it's nothing any watcher of reasonable intellect will have not known. In these days of constant religious debate / argument on the Net, everything has been covered in far greater depth.I came within a hair's breadth of giving up on the film half way through, but stuck with it just to see the outcome. As I said, I found the latter end of the film more interesting for some reason. The acting didn't seem so wooden, and people got personal rather than reciting history. The ending was reasonable.I suspect a lot of the high marks given to this film are purely because it's refreshing to have a film that is actually intelligent and thoughtful rather than dumbed down action. I agree that such films are rare and should be lauded, but much as I want to I cannot give this film the accolades that everyone else seems to.Anyone who wants dumb action is going to hate this film without a doubt. For those who are intelligent enough to appreciate it, I wonder exactly what it's going to teach them?</fullReview>

I only crib that this movie was so short. With the intensity that it carried, I'd have watched even if it ran for 4 hours. The characters were properly chosen so as to foster the critical discussion that is the crux of this movie. Filming a movie solely based on dialogs and keeping it intense can seldom be pulled of brilliantly, and this movie underlines every bit of that brilliance poured into making it. If there ever will be an equivalent remake of this movie, I'll watch. But this one will remain the yardstick.</fullReview>

The pace of the storytelling and detail of the events within the story are incredibly fascinating and impress the viewer with astonishing reality.

Never before did I ever believe that I would be so immersed in a movie, that has a group of professors simply talking for 90 minutes. What makes it different is that one of the professors is actually a 14,000 year old man. John played by David Lee Smith, reveals this long-held secret to the group of curious professors. The way John pacifies their baffled minds, with answers so unexpected. Studded with logical explanations the movie is a must watch for those with a taste for deeper understanding.Unlike other movies from the science fiction genre, this movie has its base rooted deeply in ideas. One shouldn't expect a lot on the acting part for its only the story that counts for this one. The communication of ideas is quick, no suspense involved anywhere except for a plot twist at the very end. So if I ever have to suggest someone movie that kindles the mind , this is surely the one.</fullReview>

As a consequence the story will probably seem a bit slow at times. If you need lots of action to have a good time, you might want to just skip this one. Technically, I thought the acting was somewhere between "pretty good" and "so-so", but the story line and plot more than make up for any of its technical flaws. To be honest, I think thoughtful people would really like this movie even if it was only just people sitting around a table and reading from the script-- just because of the story it tells. Fortunately it does much more than that. But it isn't an action-thriller in any sense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What if you were a man that lived for 14,000 years? What if you could witness the living history of the planet? What if..? This is the central idea of Jerome Bixby's highly under-appreciated gem called The Man from Earth. A film that takes place in a single room and is essentially a series of discussions between college professors from various fields. A film so mysterious that will have you glued to the screen the whole time. A film that deserves to be reviewed."I've done this before". One of the first things our protagonist says, is actually one of the key elements in the story. We begin following John Oldman (get it?) who after 10 years has decided to leave his position as a history professor at a local university and move. His colleagues however decide to send him off with a party. And this is when our story begins. John decides to do something he has never done before...to tell the truth about himself. So he explains that he is a man that never ages, a man that has lived for 140 centuries. Upon this revelation a cat and mouse game begins between the host and his guests. John narrates his life while the others try to disprove his sayings. Through this back and forth we travel through the history of mankind over the past few millennia, from the Cro-Magnon to the modern era. A journey that takes you through science, art, history, anthropology and religion.At first, the film seems to go around the same topic: "Is John lying?". If you focus on this though, you have missed the point. The main message coming across is the sense of uncertainty that is present throughout the discussions. How can any of us be certain about anything? How can we function unless we take certain things for granted? More importantly, what happens when the things we have taken for granted are questioned? The guests' reactions to John's story, cover a wide range of emotions throughout the film. Indulging, disbelief, concern, curiosity, mockery and anger are all present and expressed in different ways.During the discussions you are presented with various historical facts combined with the fact that knowledge of these facts does not constitute an answer to the ultimate question. The structure of the film prepares you from the very start for the possibility that you might not even get one. Yet in the end we see that even for a man who has allegedly lived this long there are still things he hasn't done before. In an effort to keep this review as spoiler-free as possible I will not go into lengths about what is being discussed, and I will only say that it is a chance to see an alternate interpretation of history. After all, as it is continuously repeated by the participants of this academic discussion, "Anything is possible".The film does not feature a well known cast and performances are the obvious flaw one could find in it. With one exception; David Lee Smith as John Oldman. The silent and humble portrayal of Smith seems to be extremely fitting to the character and all he represents. He is a man that has known and experienced more than one could imagine and that has given him an inner peace that can be seen by his reactions during the conversation. He is, however, still a human and so when Dr. Gruber corners and directly attacks him, you can see the doubt and fear he has about his own nature come to the surface.There is not much to say about the direction, but the score is very subtle and only present at times where it sets the mood without hindering the conversation. It augments the sense of mystery and always ties in very well with the topic at hand.Bixby's excellent writing lights the fuse that can lead to endless possibilities for discussion after the end of the film. A man who spend his life writing cheap science fiction, finally managed on his deathbed to complete a screenplay that he first conceived in the 60s. The materialization of his idea about the true nature of man, that is the perfect mixture of open-mindedness and cynicism.</fullReview>

That alone should tell you Man from Earth is different...I know that I didn't give you a good review of this movie,but what I am giving you is this advice - watch with an open mind and if you find yourself shaking your fist at the television and screaming at it,leave immediately,go to your place of worship,and beg your God to brainwash you some more till the awful thoughts in your head are all gone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid 6/10 movie (in a good way!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fun movie to watch, and keeps you interested because of its unique story. It's a very simple movie with one setting. It feels very much like a play. If you like philosophical discussions, this one's for you! Read further for my analysis of its score (which, for this movie, I think is quite good!)I gave it a solid 6/10, after initially giving it a 7. It's probably closer to a 7, as in my book a 7 is a "good movie" and a 6 is "average". Usually my 6s are reserved for big-budget Hollywood movies that I didn't particularly like but at the same time I can't rate lower because of production value, effects, editing, acting, etc. If you have to rate every movie ever made on the same scale of 1-10 very few should be 10s and even less 1s--mostly because you'd have to seek out the worst of the worst to find a 1. As far as this movie goes, it's production value, directing, editing, etc are all clearly B-movie quality. The acting is actually pretty good, and the actors are all capable. It's the directing and the script that makes the actors seem poor at times. The story is absolutely a great and unique one, which is ultimately what elevated this movie from a 4 or 5. But then again, the big plot holes prevent it from reaching that 7/10 mark indicating I thought it was solidly a good movie. It's tough, because I can't say it was bad either. This movie's a good example of having great elements and bad elements, combining to give it an average score!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good exercise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is basically a well written play, it's not exactly a movie, it feels like going to the theater. It's one room, pure dialogue, very low budget. The story is interesting, and the actors are good. You sort of feel taken by it sometimes, but I wouldn't rate it higher because it feels a bit odd. The movie went out in 2007 yet everything feels old and dated. The clothes, the image quality, it feels like an 80's movie. I think they could have chosen a better place to shoot it than this awful small house, something more conducive to the mood. I know the story itself was written a while back and maybe it's an homage to have such antiquated decor, but I don't think it's a good thing.Also, some twists feel a bit too out of place. The Jesus thing I can accept it, it's not perfectly set up, but it leads to interesting debate. However the very end with his "son" I could have lived without. It's a bit too much, but I guess they didn't want to mess with Jerome Bixby's story.So all in all it's a nice intellectual exercise, but I'm not sure it deserves the "cult sci-fi movie" tag everybody seems to apply to it. I hope the TV series they kickstarted could go further in the reflection, although I'm afraid it may just be the life of that man through the ages...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There seem to be 2 groups mainly reviewing this. Those that just didn't like it and those of us who did. You know by 10mins of a movie or less if you like it or not. That said, you should choose to watch any movies regardless of what others say, as your own point of view matters more than others. You might or might not like the story. Everyone has a different point of view and angle to approach things and this movie certainly made that very well. I think the story was well told and engaging. I am happy that there is authors out there still making some good scripts now and then. This was definitely one of those I enjoyed the most in a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent sci-fi but lacking some of the common sense many good reviews invoke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the fact that this is clearly a low budget movie, I think that the acting and the idea behind the narration are quite good. The movie is enjoyable and can keep your attention up if you became interested in the plot.This leading to a decent overall evaluation of the movie from my point of view. However in my personal experience the interest was mainly directed to the hope that some of the brilliant professors would eventually point out a few, clearly problematic, points in the narration of our "oldman". What I'm about to write is mainly thought for those who have seen the movie already, and may be considered a "spoiler". Now, if I would encounter a person claiming the same things as the main character of this movie I would say that there are only a few possibilities. We must consider the fact that the man claims to be unable to age and to have any kind of scar, however he is not immortal and he can suffer from wounds, diseases and eventually even die. At a certain point of the movie someone almost point out this fact and conclude that he must have been "really lucky". We could even consider that in a lifetime it is possible to avoid deadly diseases or serious accidents, but I'm sure that everyone of us knows at least a few people that, unfortunately, died or got mutilated for one of the reasons given above. If we multiply our lifetime for about two hundred (the lives he is supposed to have gone through) the chances of not experiencing any deadly or mutilating event are really, really, really, low. Even the chance of being hit by a lightning should be taken into consideration at that point. Hence, that "really lucky" should turn into an "almost impossibly lucky". Another option would of course be the possibility that he is truly blessed by some God that protects him in virtue of some kind of message to give or mission to accomplish. However, since I do not believe in any God, i consider this option as unlikely as the previous one. Even considering this, for him to prove not to be a liar would still be quite easy, although in the movie they seem to consider any demonstration impossible. He could just show them a video, a photo or even a painting of him from the last two hundred years. Obviously there was absolutely no need for me to demonstrate the impossibility of such a case as the one in the movie, I would just have loved some of the professors to raise this questions and make the whole thing more credible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A divisive but thought-provoking sci-fi drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As with other reviewers I was suckered into seeking out this film by the high praise and intriguing premise. By the end I wasn't sure if I could say I enjoyed it - but it did make me think for a long time afterwards and for that it certainly warrants praise.Yes, the film wears its low budget on its sleeve with its single setting, questionable set dressing (I know the main character lived in a cabin and was supposed to be moving away but still...) and hideous wardrobe. Yes, the characters are grossly stereotyped and the acting is quite stilted at times. And yes, the vast majority of the film consists of people (even worse, "intellectual" people) sitting in a room talking and the most vigorous piece of action is when the removalists take the furniture away (or when the psychologist goes into cardiac arrest, take your pick).But damnit... I couldn't help but be drawn into the story that unfolded over the course of the film's runtime. It was preposterous, fantastical, cringe-worthy, wonderful, woeful, thoughtful and clumsy all at the same time. It stuck in my head for a few days afterwards... and (damnit again) it made me think! I can't honestly say I got "enjoyment" from watching this film - but it tickled something in the recesses of my brain that didn't go away. If only more films could be so affecting.Thoughtful sci-fi should make you reflect on the outrageous situation/s it presents and how this may apply to our modern day lives, for better or worse. Forgive this film its technical limitations and I am certain you will get something similar out of it.</fullReview>

At that point I was thinking of it to be so-so. But HECK, am I glad I did turn on this film. Its a brilliant, mind-blowing and yes, an intelligent science fiction film! I sure had doubt watching a dialogue-only film as I am a hardcore visual effects sci-fi fan (although I do look for interesting story lines in the sci-fi films I want to watch).This is a must see for science fiction -readers- and a should see for all science fiction fans. I've seen Jerome Bixby's grandsons Brian posting a review back in '07. Brian, if you are reading this: you can be very proud on you grandfather's and your father's brilliant creativity!

The acting was absolutely below par, I only continued watching because of the 8 rating thinking something amazing is about to happen. But nothing happened except I lost 90 minutes of my life and another 5 writing this damn review. However, if you enjoyed watching Sondra Locke act then you will definitely enjoy this movie.

		<shortDescription>a few problems to overcome first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few problems I see with this movie...while it is very thought provoking the historicity is wrong. This film assumes that all that is written about the Buddha is known while all that is known about J'shua (Jesus) is anecdotal. In reality the opposite is true...we really have little record of what Siddartha actually said nor do the followers of Buddhism really care whereas there is more historical evidence for the life of Jesus and His teachings than any other figure besides say, Julius Cesar. Another problem is that Buddhism and Christianity have conflicting beliefs at their core. Buddha never was interested in heaven or hell or God. His sole mission was to break the karmic wheel of death and rebirth whereas Jesus and all those who knew Him (and even those who hated Him) reported that He claimed to be the unique Son of God solely capable of redeeming mankind back to God. Another problem I see is that whole " after I was beaten and flogged with 40 lashes and after my side was ruptured by a huge lance and I died, I slowed my metabolism down and while no one was watching I rolled away a huge stone that was covering my tomb and then took out a battalion of Roman guards. I mean this movie did make you think and the writers were pretty darn convincing but discarding all of Christianity as complete fabrication and hype was a bridge too far I think.</fullReview>

That's the story here and like an independent play it takes place almost entirely in one room. The plot concerns a man, a professor moving and his friends (mostly teachers, writers, doctors, intellectuals, students, scientist, etc.) wanting to know why he is leaving slowly demand the details. Their backgrounds, all minor experts in their various fields, leads them to ask probing questions. Things quickly escalate when John Oldman tells everyone he thinks he is "thousands of years old." HA! But wait, they make him prove it and every time he satisfactorily answers a new challenge we start to almost believe him until the next round of? but if that's true then how can this be (hits the fan).

Jerome Bixby shows us that even with practically unlimited time, education, experience, travel, friends, lovers, gurus and teachers ... we live only when we are open to new ideas ... the rest of the time is just wasted. Eternal life is not a blessing to someone who freezes their mind to protect it from change. And ten years of a full life can be better than another 14,000 years of mere survival.</fullReview>

This movie..My first glances at the screen were of disappointment, seeing not that great image quality and some dodgy acting (the first 15-20 minutes, that is). However, it becomes very clear that the graphics will not take the lead in this movie and that the actors weren't cast for their fluent acting but rather for their perfect place in this intellectual and mind blowing adventure that you are about to embark on, once the story kicks in..The concept sounds simple sci-fi: Dude claiming to be very old, living for 14,000 years, and sharing this with some close (former) colleagues.. Those colleagues are, how convenient, all experts in some specific branch: an anthropologist, a biologist, a bible expert, ... So the questions raised (and answered by our 'old man') come from a wide array of the current understanding that humanity has..You don't need to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this movie actually.. I love science rather and have a natural interest in the way things work and humans/animals think. All you need to have, is the ability to set an open mind and enjoy the intellectual roller-coaster this movie takes you on..There are absolutely no special effects in this movie, the setting is a room with some people in it (with the occasional shot at the front of the house), and that's it. And yet this is the best movie I have ever seen..Said it before: It's such an awesome movie, it made me even write a review here..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good premise, mediocre execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is worth watching for the way it demonstrates what effort it takes to make a truly good screen play. The idea here is intriguing and even the sparse setting is workable, but the scripting is a series of leaps in thought - contrivances of conversation serving the screenwriter in his attempt to bring out certain points within his idea.John Oldman claims to have been alive for about 14,000 years, a fact which he has pieced together in part thanks to modern findings which help him date his origins. He reveals this to his friends on the day they are helping him move out of his home, in his usual pattern of leaving town before people realize he never ages. The idea has such potential, but it seems thrown into a movie and not thought very well in terms of the actual script.Firstly, John's stammering reveal of his situation doesn't show any of the experience of someone who has been moving on every 10 years for over a dozen millennia. He knows why he is moving on, and yet he isn't prepared to cover it with a simple believable story. With his experience, he shouldn't even have to cover it. He should have developed ways to move from one town to another without the slightest suspicion about his leaving. But this is the idea that winds through the whole script.Secondly, none of the reactions were handled credibly, not in the words of the characters and not in the portrayals by the actors. When someone begins to tell you that he's been alive for 14,000 years, it will take more than an afternoon of chatting about it to convince an educated person, which all of these characters are, knowing each other through their professorships at a local university.When it comes to the reveal inside this tale, it's a wonder anyone is still taking him seriously, and yet they do. It's clear this was an attempt by the writer to get the viewer to take the tale seriously as well, but it doesn't carry. We're left thinking the professors are a bunch of idiots.Overall, the characters are too constructed, and the script too perfunctory for such a novel idea. The concept is worth a rework.</fullReview>

The actual execution is a sub-par TV flick with adequate acting. The pace is slow, since the obvious intention has been to stretch the script to the 87 minutes.I'm still not sure who the target audience would be.

		<fullReview>While going through reviews for this film and also after watching the film with two other friends. I realized something rather fascinating about it out of every 3, two like the film and 1 of them is some what taken aback by either the magnitude of the conversation in the movie or its simplicity . The most compelling thing about the narrative or the argument amongst the main character and his intellectual brethren is really "simple". It is something that can be followed by everyone but neither disproved or proved at the same time. The only reason that there is a certain amount of resistance to the film is when preconceived notions are brought into the picture. The film from the start asks one to leave all notions behind as the only way one can adhere to new ideas.The final verdict- it is one of those films that will force u to think whether u like it or not. The makers have done excellent research and also compiling of that knowledge to the script is done exceptionally well. U just need to have an open mind and remember it is fiction and not reality. so be a little kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very weak attempt at a "think" sci-fi piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I am a huge fan of "think" sci-fi pieces, from Arthur Clarke to Fred Pohl to my personal favorite, Philip K. Dick, and have always thought the genre woefully underrepresented in films. So when I found out about this film and saw the high IMDb score (it was an 8.0 at the time) I eagerly bought it, only to be extremely disappointed. The biggest culprit here is the acting, which ranges from "B" quality at best to "Z" quality most of the time. It's particularly bad in the first 20 minutes of the film, and the only actor who gets into any kind of groove as it goes on is Tony Todd. The story is also rather uninteresting--Jerome Bixby just took the story to the Star Trek episode "Requiem for Methuselah," which was a mediocre episode to begin with, and remade it at 2x the length. Unless you are thrilled at the idea of hearing lengthy discussions about the geographical layout of the Earth in the cro-magnon period, the first half of the movie is a complete waste. The film tries to regroup later on with a rather ambitious religious angle, and rides that to a few interesting scenes, but it lacks the insight to really explore the nuances of the subject matter, preferring an attack on religious conventions with the subtlety of a photon torpedo. To top it all off, there's a ridiculous, unnecessary, surprise ending that is worthy of M. Night Shyamalan (in case you're not sure, this is NOT a compliment). In the end, this is just a really overlong mediocre Twilight Zone episode, except with worse acting than they typically had on that show. Perhaps it has such an inflated rating on this site because 90% of its votes came from non-US users, who maybe saw this film dubbed or with subtitles, masking the poor acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever but deeply flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Man from Earth' is one of those occasional films which generates far more controversy than anything on screen justifies. It won't impress the well read, the ideas are nowhere near as brilliant or learned as many claim. Fair warning: for many this movie will be the first blush with concepts millennia old. In the excitement they'll take affront to any criticism. When reading these reviews recall many considered the conceptual adaptation of Plato's Cave in 'The Matrix' profound too. History professor John Oldman is dismayed when his plan to skip out on a prized tenureship for a new life is temporarily sidetracked by a handful of close colleagues who arrive at his home for an impromptu send off. A bottle of Johnnie Walker Green, a comforting fire and the prodding of concerned friends eventually convince him to open up and reveal what drives him to abandon a brilliant and rewarding future without goodbye. The rest of the film is a living room discussion of and challenge to his explanation, John's claim to have been born in pre-history and moving every ten years before it becomes apparent he never ages.Whatever interest the film creates in examining that claim rides almost entirely on its attention to the small details of educated discourse and David Lee Smith's convincing portrayal of Oldman. He hits just the right balance of compassion, detachment and weariness to convince without revealing if the tale is true. Tony Todd also lends much needed support as his skeptical scientific friend excited at the prospect. (It's great to see him in a role that doesn't involve malevolent spirits or serial killers.) Unfortunately, even with well over five hundred shared IMDb Filmography entries the remaining cast give surprisingly uneven and over-the-top performances. That, along with overwrought direction and an unconvincing script, consign this movie to also-ran status. After a promising start focused on the nature of history and evidence it appears the writers lose confidence in the concept of a fourteen thousand year old man holding your interest. A love story gets folded in. From humble beginnings as a plains hunter John claims increasingly improbable and extraordinary experiences, including contact with pivotal figures of art and history, presence at pivotal events in history, and finally culminating with a claim of being perhaps the most pivotal figure of history. Things quickly go off the rails. From detached skepticism and concern for his sanity his erudite audience grows increasingly irrational and emotional in reverse proportion to the probability of John's claims. As the evening progresses Oldman's tale becomes more convincing than their reactions. Eventually one breaks down in tears over a claim regarding their religion, another pulls a gun for no coherent reason. The penultimate scene in which the film reveals the true nature of Oldman's birth hinges on a final unnecessary improbability of staggering proportions. Little past the midpoint rings probable or likely, it ends in a shambles. Still, for an indie movie that's essentially ninety minutes of living room banter something clicks in spite of the generally flawed acting and unbelievable script. It won't change your life any more than 'The Matrix' did, but it's worth a rent if you're the religiously tolerant kind in the mood for something different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was probably a fascinating piece of sci-fi writing, but as a movie it was a pretty weak effort. From the cinematography to the acting - this was a non-budget sci-fi channel original movie. Sub-career actors giving hammy performances - often skating the line of annoying.I have to admit that the basic story here is very interesting and thought provoking. I can't say it was perfectly written, but this is science fiction. I think this would work good as a play. I'd also like to see this re-done with a better cast and director.In the end though - there was nothing here that gave me chills or touched me in some special way or gave me any sort of epiphany like it seems to have done for so many others... At best it held my attention until the end.It's very much average and mediocre - it will end up being the sort of thing people will reference in speculative conversations with their friends to help them feel smarter. It will end up being shown to high school and college students by that hip and cool teacher. It's very accessible and gently challenges religion, so it's perfect for that.I've definitely seen better science fiction movies - with or without action or special effects.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The secret to this movie's success...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>is that the producers went to every known atheism forum and pleaded with the followers to log on here and write a top-notch 10-star review.If you don't believe me, I'm sorry that you'll waste your time finding out for yourself. There's no redeeming quality to this glorified film student project. The characters are caricatures and one-dimensional, the acting is over-emotive and forced, the script is poorly constructed, and above all the plot makes absolutely no sense.Case in point: 1. Why does the main character decide after thousands of years to reveal his secret to this particular group? 2. What's the purpose of revealing his story? He already knows it's implausible and unconsumable.3. Not a shred of evidence? Really? Main character offers up half-assed reasons as to why his story can neither be proved or disproved. Really? You don't have anything to show that's dated at a MINUMUM of 100 years? All you have to do is go back as far as that to at least hook the bait. He conveniently carries nothing through life. "What's the point?" he asks. Hmmm, well....maybe to prove his story???? 4. Characters nonchalantly have a laugh at the end when he tells them it was all a ruse. If I were in that room, I'd be looking at this guy with a stare of bewilderment, and probably just leave and never speak to him again.5. Main character is not only Jesus, but also just happened to run into Buddha, Christopher Columbus, Van Gogh, and a host of other historical figures. What a small world it must have been! 6. The psychiatrist's wife died just the day before. Nevertheless he rushes over when called on the phone, engages in discussion casually with no hint of being distraught over his recent emotional trauma, pulls a gun at one point (why did he bring a gun?) which happens to be empty (why did he bring an EMPTY gun?), quickly does an about-face with the credibility of the story at the end when he hears his father's name.Don't waste your life with this overwrought misrepresentation of a "deep philosophical thriller".</fullReview>

Of course, a film like this would never get a Golden Globe or Oscar nomination. Most people don't have the patience to sit for more than 5 or 10 minutes. Not once throughout the whole film did I get bored. I did have to rewind a few times because I got thinking about what had just been said. A rare find in today's cinema.In summary, please have your teenager sons and daughters watch this film with you.

		<shortDescription>A simple premise beautifully explored</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, since there are a lot of people here praising the plot of this movie, let me just step in here and say: this movie has basically no plot whatsoever. It works more or less like this: A guy tells his friends that he's 14.000 years old and then they spend the rest of the movie asking him questions and he tells them stories about his life. That's hardly a stroke of genius.However what makes this movie unique and worth watching is the atmosphere the movie develops around these stories. The movie is not on the screen, it's in your head, drawing pictures of far distant pasts. On this level the movie is an unrivaled stroke of genius and I personally haven't yet seen anything quite like it.This is the kind of movie that works so well because you're completely new to the concept and I am going to add it in my short list of pictures that every person should have seen at least once in their life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Indeed it was like sitting "on the floor listening to Beethoven"... the music that still keeps playing after the last note.I am still seeing myself ironically smiling after watching just several minutes. This is what happens if you allow for what then seemed the unreasonably high expectations to kick in from the very beginning. Fortunately, as it is with most roller-coaster rides, you can't jump out when it is already climbing the hill. Gosh, I am glad I did not take the risk. At start it was a little bit unpromising, slightly shaky, lacking confident direction for a few negligible moments, but what then followed was a full-speed flight drowning in adrenaline, excitement, and the whole pile of positive emotions.The story is involving to such a degree that as the credits begin you want to buy John another Green Label so that he would continue his story for at least another hour. It does not cease to amaze me how easy it is to relate people we meet each day to John's audience in that small room."The Man from Earth" left me full of whirling thoughts which still need to subside but if I was to summarize it in one short message -- the real beauty lies in understanding the complexity beyond perception of reality.Anything is possible...</fullReview>

The 3 woman characters had Very little input-and the only one that actually said anything was a weak old religious woman that made everyone food and lost every small confrontation there was and then cried.The only character that had an ounce of intelligence was Dan. The other characters personalities were inconsistent and were changing all the way through it.

		<fullReview>Leave it to a Star Trek writer to make the best sci-fi movie in years. A retiring history professor reveals his true identity to his close friends; that he was born a caveman 14,000 years ago, and never died. At first they think he's joking or maybe crazy, then they begin to wonder if it might really be true.Man from Earth was written by Jerome Bixby, and is similar to his TOS episode Requiem for Methuselah, (an immortal who has "been" people from Earth history, including several historical figures) and it works on many levels; philosophical, emotional, dramatic, even moral. Is it right to live forever, watching helplessly while everyone you know dies? If you're immortal, is it your responsibility to make the world a better place? I never heard of this movie until a few days ago, and now it's all my friends and I can talk about. I love most sci-fi movies, but how many really make you think? I personally didn't walk out of E.T. thinking about morality or human history. This movie makes you think, it wakes you up to new ideas. It's like a non-boring history lesson on things you never knew, or even imagined.Some people won't like Man from Earth because it challenges their beliefs,their very faith. Hopefully they'll walk away better people. If not reconsidering their faith, at least looking at it from a more logical point of view. Because this "caveman" can teach us a few things.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie for the first time, and while I am an avid sci-fi fan, I cannot think of a movie that has instilled such pure awe, regardless of genre. It contains so many elements that labeling it as solely science fiction would be degrading. I am truly surprised that this was not a book before it became a movie. It will take you on a journey of history with 100% factual information, through the eyes of one man. While one might categorize it as blasphemy to religion; I see it as a wake-up call to the hopelessly blind, seeing the world as a fairy-tale story. I see it as an accurate, rational portrayal of the world, as it was, as it is now, and the doubt we all have about our origins as a species (which will never end). There are no amazing CGI effects, $20 million dollar actors, nude scenes nor gore. There is only the story, using your mind's imagination to paint the canvas, living the life of a spectacular person, as your own life.Buy the DVD and open your eyes to history!</fullReview>

But this one just had me repeatedly shaking my head in disbelief at such poor execution. From the opening sequence I sensed that the acting was not going to be up to the task. But I don't think the actors had much to work with, anyway. Everything seemed contrived and forced about this movie. Strange camera angles that just distracted, out-of-place mood music, and a script that was cringe worthy. Strange that there are such positive reviews. I gave it a 2 only because I managed to sit through to the end. Barely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed movie that could have been a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh what an attempt "The Man from Earth" makes at being a low budget deep thinker hit. This movie is solid, there's no doubt about that. The premise of characters sitting around and talking about more interesting events for the better part of an hour and a half might sound boring, but on screen it is beautiful. The score perfectly matches the theme and tone of each section of our famous traveler's increasingly strange tale without ever coming across as cheesy or unnecessary. When discussion and arguments between characters breaks out, the score goes away and lets the actors take over on screen; and for the most part, the actors do a pretty good job. Sometimes dialogue comes off as cringe worthy or cheesy, but that seems to be more of a result of a flawed script than a issue with the actors themselves. But overall this movie and the story it weaves is original and thought provoking, so much so that it feels like it has the depth of a full length novel compacted into over an hour of screen time.So where do the problems begin? Well for me they're immediate. I understand that this is a lowest of low budget kind of movie, and its more about what is being told by the characters rather than shown on screen, but the lighting and camera quality are terrible. Every close up shot looks grainy, and the obviousness of the studio lighting is annoying. Another issue comes from an early factual error. Not spoiling anything, but our characters tell of how Columbus showed everyone that the world isn't flat. Yeah, that's not true... at all. I mean there was a reason in Greek mythology why the titan Atlas was holding up a spherical world rather than a flat map... I mean out of your whole movie about life from the beginning how do you screw up the one story that is most famous and well-known? Oh and lets not forget melodrama, cause we can't make a movie without a character at least once pulling out a gun to threaten someone and then to threaten their own suicide. Like really, was this necessary? Cause after it happens the whole situation is pretty much discarded and never really addressed. It was basically pointless drama for the sake of drama. Here's my biggest nitpick I have (less of a full fledged issue and more of a personal annoyance): why is the Christian lady portrayed as the most stereotypical Christian alive? Seriously that's pretty weak. Out of all your characters why did you have to cop out and make the religious woman the most whiny, easily irritated character who throws out the terms "blasphemous" and "sacrilege" like a pedophile throws out candy? It's just weak and basic way to write a character in a story filled with complex characters. Overall this movie is: unique, original, somewhat flawed, and definitely above average (I consider a 6 average BTW because I'm bad at rating on a number scale. Just a little fun fact about Reid Hawkins that you can discuss in your fan club meetings) so this movie gets a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

I wasn't expecting that when I put it on, I'd rented it from the sci-fi bin at the store which is normally full of B-rated cringe inducing flicks, but I was wowed. From the moment I turned it on, I was enthralled with this complex film.It's not special effects or action that enthralled me. The script in this film is phenomenal, the characters diverse and real. It challenges the viewer and the characters and the beliefs they hold dear, and I've never had a science fiction film actually make me wonder if it could be real. I'm not sure of the validity of the science, but it certainly was strong enough to make me ask questions. The Man from Earth questions humanity's core beliefs; religion and our concept of mortality and the supernatural.I was amazed to find even my 13 year old brother enjoyed this film. It's message is not so complex as to alienate the viewer, yet it is not so banal as to bore the mind. A must watch for all thoughtful cinema goers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I live in Finland, and the Man from Earth has never been officially released in my country. Lucky for me, I was able to comprehend the movie even with English subtitles. I didn't expect much, but ended up having one of the greatest movie experiences of my entire life.David Lee Smith plays a man who claims to be quite a bit older than you might expect. So much in fact that he has lived on Earth for a whopping 10 000 years. The main focus of the movie is: how do we relate to unexpected and surprising information that conflicts with our present understanding of the world and humanity? How tight are we locked inside that box of ours? Without giving away the story, I'd like to point out that only one of the guests was able to bypass his personal egoistic evaluations and asses the situation in itself: not blindly believing what was told, but not dismissing the information either before carefully evaluating the situation.An open mind with an open heart. A great example for other to follow during these times when the internet has polarized everyone's opinions. This, accompanied with wonderful acting, captive drama, and sympathetic characters, is what makes this movie great. In the end you don't even care whether its true or not what has been told: the main focus is the drama, the reactions, and the philosophical and epistemological question of how much do we really even know of what is possible and what is not.Best movie of the century so far. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most gripping movies you will ever come across. I was on the edge of my seat all the time, just intrigued by the thorough discourse that the movie has to offer. Each and every word, line and sentence spoken has an effect on you. You are just waiting for more and more to come from this movie and believe me, it delivers. Big time.The movie revolves around a group of people sitting in a cabin and talking about the history of mankind and its evolution. The main protagonist is calm and serene while all others are anxious because of the unfolding events. All the characters behave differently to the ongoing conversation which is very realistic. One question leads to another and then another. This keeps the audience engaged in the movie throughout. A must-watch for movie-buffs. One needs to watch this movie and just enjoy the refreshing new subject. A breath of fresh air. The movie will captivate you from the beginning till the end and will blow you away with its sheer depth and profundity. For any person who is open to new ideas, believes in the possibility of anything happening, has an intellectual mind, you have finally found your dish.This movie solely depends on the story, the narration and the dialogue. The script is the true star of the movie. The writer has done an impeccable job and one must appreciate his subtlety with this masterpiece.</fullReview>

Why critique harshly the production and acting?... a story meant to be read (the book/dialogue is more important), it would stir one's thought and emotions up the way it was meant to be... without visual distractions.

Also, apart from proving/disproving hypothesis of a 14000 year old man, there was no other alluring sign that something more was at play in the situation.Should have actually been a play.

The direction keeps the pace moving in spite of this with instant focus on the revelations of David Lee Smith whose character John Oldman is very convincing in his played down approach. This is apparent throughout the movie and if the topic wasn't so compelling it would have been fairly dull to not include 'flashbacks' or other sets apart from the one chilly living room they spend the majority of the film in. The one fatal flaw I found in the arguments skillfully presented was David Lee Smith's character comments on lack of spiritual elements responsible for Life which - scriptwriters please! - is a contradiction in terms to the concept of 'eternity' given his age! Well crafted and recommended watching if you want to stimulate your ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler alert.The concept of this film is very good. A man living for thousands of years and deciding to reveal himself to close friends who happen to be teachers in various areas who can ask him questions is very intriguing. However most of the questions are very basic and the answers are somewhat vague. The problem is when you intersect real events with the fiction, for example he has a painting that is recognized to be a never before seen Van Gogh. This is fine but when it starts to add that he has also met Buddha and then finally that he was actually Jesus. It was at this point that the film went off the rails and I felt like I was being sold atheist propaganda. That said, the idea of an immortal man who may have been Jesus isn't particularly objectionable to me in itself. It probably would make for another fascinating movie. The problem is, it doesn't fit with this movie because we start off with an interesting concept of a 14,000 year old man and a psychological script that decides halfway through the movie that it wants to now become a statement on all religion being false feels like having a bait and switch done on the viewer. It would have been far better for the writer to have just focused on this man's life through the ages rather than claim he was a specific figure and that figure is a fake. The reason this doesn't entirely work is because the movie is now making a specific claim about a figure in history and making a judgment on that figure that it cannot possibly know to be true.Had he claimed to be someone like George Washington, for example, and cited specific things that happened it would work. But take that figure and have the fictional character say that George Washington was not a real person and a myth was built around him places fiction on top of more fiction. The writer obviously believes that all religion is mythical and seems to use this film as a vehicle to make us question faith in general and uses Christianity as its focus. It could have chosen many other religious characters but focused on the one that would likely be the most offensive in order to shock viewers. In a sense, it could be looked at as an interesting twist in the story because first it questions what you believe. Could you believe a man if he told you he was an individual who lived 14,000 years and could not be proved. And then the twist is that it makes you question your own faith in things you believe. But I personally don't think the intent here was to be thought provoking but more of an atheistic message which is why I feel the movie pulled a bait and switch. I feel like the writer tried to pull a fast one on the viewers.In any event I appreciate most of the film and its concept. I can accept it was low budget and there were a couple of good actors. I even enjoyed seeing William Katt from greatest American hero again. In the end, I think it has merit as thought provoking and an insight on basic psychology and makes you question what you believe but they definitely went off the rails in the main character making the claim he was a specific character from history and then trying to claim he was something other than what we know from writings. It just didn't fit with the rest of the concept. I feel like someone tried to trick me with an atheistic message with a story wrapped around it. Kinda like you feel when you are offered something for free like a timeshare only to find out you have to sit through a long presentation for something you will never buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great concept, bad acting, worse writing?don't waste your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seeing the glowing reviews here and elsewhere, I'm surprised to say I couldn't make it more than halfway through the film. While the concept is fantastic, the execution is gut-wrenchingly bad. Don't waste your time.The whole film (or at least what I was able to stand watching) takes place in a living room, focusing on a conversation between professors. Films like this can be great (cf. 12 Angry Men), but they absolutely need solid writing and acting. Unfortunately, it seems this movie was written by the angstiest of the internet atheism crowd, and while no actors could make a script this bad shine, these actors do especially poorly.I was told to go into this film being willing to have my beliefs challenged, and I understand why I was told that. But when the script is filled with mindless drivel and plain historical errors that all the characters seem to believe, only the beliefs of the mindless will be challenged. The rest of us just lose our patience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do not believe those who say this is excellent. And do not write my opinion off as wanting a certain thing from a film, like big budgets or action sequences or sex or anything else. I watched this film because it was on the 'People who liked' for 'Coherence', which was amazing, despite being low budget and lo-fi. Man From Earth, on the other hand, is just bad writing that is then acted badly and filmed on some kind of rig from the '70s. Seriously, natural light etc. is great, but not if you actually can't see anything and the whole thing just looks like a straight to video production. So what do people see in this? you may ask. Well, I don't want to give spoilers, so I won't, but it basically promotes a really popular (but wrong) world view about some pieces of history, that, I shall reiterate, are totally wrong and not believed by any historians anywhere. That is all, watch this movie in the knowledge that you're probably writing off 100 minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a wonderful trip down the rabbit hole labeled "eternal youth". I let this movie take me on a wandering journey through "what-ifs" and "I wonders" and was thoroughly pleased with the experience. I fully acknowledge that there are historical inaccuracies, but for most of us 'common folk' the 'facts' given are what we know and are what we were taught. This movie is good because of the idea explored, and the portrayal of the people's reactions to it. I don't think this is a movie about a 14.000 year old man. This is a movie about people's reactions to an absolutely unbelievable concept. This isn't a man on the street coming up to you and claiming that he is a 14.000 year old caveman. This is your best friend that you went k- 12 with suddenly saying that. His credibility lies in the fact that these people have known him for 10 years. They sit and talk to him and believe him because they have every reason to believe that he is serious. I know that if I was trying get a friend to explain why he was leaving and he finally, and reluctantly, told me this tale in perfect seriousness, I would at least listen to the whole thing. I don't find their reactions at all unbelievable.One of the two big story complaints I have seen is the name dropping of historical figures like Hammurabi, Buddha, van Gogh, and other famous figures. Yes, it is absolutely absurd that one man would happen to run into these figures (though I want to point out that he only said that he lived under Hammurabi, not that he knew him) but ask yourself this, would it be interesting if he didn't? If his entire history was, I spent some time in Switzerland with Zarko the dairy farmer, studied with Chi Ling the rice cooker, and was happily fishing in Japan around the time of Jesus, would that be nearly as interesting? Maybe it could be quite interesting in a full on book to explain his watching of the rise and fall of empires from the view of other nations, but I don't see it making a good movie.Since I just mentioned Jesus, let's talk about the other big complaint. There is definitely and atheistic slant to this film. I'm not going to deny that. Some find this to be quite offensive, but it isn't really saying that this is absolutely the truth of Jesus, not as I'm viewing it anyway. This was a purely hypothetical, "What if a man survived through all of human history? What if in his lifetime he tried to teach all of the philosophy he learned?" If the dominant faith in the U.S. was Islam, he would have been Mohammad. This didn't say to me, "This is what happened" but "This could have happened, in some fashion."Finally, I want to add my two cents about the character John. I very much identify with this character in his gentle nature, and somewhat passive behaviour. This man is a born scholar and in his own words, "not adventurous." This isn't the man who romped through history, rocking it with Alexander the Great and Attila the Hun. This is a guy who would have been attracted to colleges, schools, and other low confrontation areas. I honestly would have had trouble with him being 14.000 years old if he were anybody but a passive introvert. Were he braver, bolder, or even just more emotional, I would be sure that he would have gotten someone seriously riled up and gotten shot or stabbed somewhere even he couldn't heal. The only time he did put himself out there, he very narrowly avoided death because he had learned some nifty (and narratively convenient) tricks.In summary, I would say that this is an unconventional, but good movie with an intriguing idea and a gripping narrative. It is slow, it is a bit far-fetched, and definitely a bit cornball, but it is worth your time if you can just let go and flow with it. It is especially fun if you are the type to bullshit philosophy with your mates every chance you get. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Intellectual Sci-fi"...??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie off Netflix so many years ago, and it's one of those little intimate films that stay with you long after you've seen it; so much so, you just have to go back and watch it again...thinking to yourself- did I get that right?? A little history about this film: Jerome Bixby, who was one of the writers for "The Twilight Zone", conceived the screenplay in the early 1960s, but did not complete until his death bed in 1998. The film gained recognition in part for being widely distributed through Internet peer- to-peer networks; its producer publicly thanked users of these networks for this. The film was later adapted by director Richard Schenkman into a stage play of the same name. In fact, I remember thinking what a great play this movie would make since the whole thing is dialogue that basically takes place in one setting.The plot focuses on John Oldman (David Lee Smith), a departing university professor, who claims to be a Cro-Magnon (or Magdalenian caveman) that has somehow survived for more than 14,000 years. The entire film is set in and around Oldman's house during his farewell party and is composed almost entirely of dialogue. The plot advances through intellectual arguments between Oldman and his fellow faculty members.*Possible SPOILER* If you are of a religious background, you will probably have some major problems with where the story ultimately treads, just to be warned. I see that IGN (Imagine Games Network) referred to this movie as "Intellectual Sci-fi" and THAT is a brilliant way of looking at this... The cast is mostly made up of non-household names, but nevertheless a group of people you will probably recognize from various things here and there- besides Smith (who I remember from a few episodes of TV's "CSI: Miami"), John Billingsley, William Katt, Richard Riehle, Alexis Thorpe, Ellen Crawford and Tony Todd.</fullReview>

The movie pokes into that. Wonderfully written, the words make you think. The plot grips you. It's amazing to see how intense dialogs can override the need for outdoor shots, fancy locations and other production hassles. The Man from Earth does not preach a particular idea. It does not influence any ideas upon you. It just puts forth a question. How do you find that middle ground? Brilliant acting, epic dialogs and the constant probe into personal belief makes the movie a must watch!</fullReview>

I thought this would be another overrated movie which the intellectuals pretended to love. The story of just 6 characters sitting together and having a discussion was incredibly engrossing. Jerome Bixby, actually started writing the screenplay in the early 1960's. He wrote it for about 35 years until it was finished right before he died in 1998. The true strength of this movie is its life-like characters and subtle dialogues. I never really felt I was watching a movie, it was like I was peeking into the room myself and the pace was perfect. The budget for this movie was around $0.2 million and did they ever make the most of it. The Man from Earth is an undisputed masterpiece and one of the greatest science fiction films of our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man From EarthYear:- 2007 Director:- Richard Schenkman Writers:- Jerome Brixeby Starring:- David Lee Smith, Tony Todd, John Billingsley, Ellen CrawfordReview:-"The Man From Earth" is a rare example of how a unique idea and an excellent, engaging script can be the sole ingredients for an interesting film. It is hands down one of the best Sci-fi films of our generation. It is not your typical eye candy big budget blockbuster illuminated with a star cast. You may not recognize anyone from the cast. The fact that almost all the movie is shot around a single room may not be appealing at first. But 10 minutes into the movie, and all these objections disappear into insignificance as the main story unfolds and draws you into it like a black hole.The movie begins with Professor John Oldman who is about to shift to a new location after 10 yrs. What starts as a simple interrogation from his colleagues on to why he is moving, unfolds into an a brilliant, intense and engrossing discussion as John reluctantly decides to disclose his inconceivable secret in the form of an intellectual game. As his colleagues, professors from various departments use their expertise in their respective fields to counter or support his claims, he gradually ascends from hypothetical assumptions and begins answering the questions in a first person perspective. His calm,impromptu and logically on spot answers to everything baffles his friends as they find the foundation of their beliefs and assumptions rocked. The gripping conversation that follows is simply aesthetic to the brain, as we realize how meaningless are our assumptions and beliefs about life which we haven't even seen and if we can be really sure about something. The script never loses its focus for a moment and the portrayal of the characters by the actors is so genuine that you almost feel as if you are there in the cabin with the characters. The movie projects you onto a philosophical and imaginative backdrop. It is a brilliant story, which is made better by the setting. It is like reading a really good book, your imagination takes over to fill the gaps and you are left pondering over the meaning of life, the authenticity of your beliefs, and if what we assume to be real is in fact real. The movie really makes the most out of its microscopic budget of 0.2 million dollars, and the fact that Jerome Brixby wrote the screenplay for around 35 years shows how much effort has been put into the story. For all of you out there, who appreciate a little cerebral activity once in a while, this is a must. We have become so addicted to the striking visuals and the exploits of the advanced photography and computers, that a certain very important section of cinema has almost disappeared into a dark corner. I seriously hope this movie brings to light, the importance of the art of story telling. And I do hope we get to see such cinematic gems more often.</fullReview>

As always, first when I downloaded the movie, I tried to seek through the video to get a general idea about it, you know, like superficially and I found nothing but a bunch of people in a room all throughout the video-play. So I decided I would either not watch it, or postpone it because it was visually unappealing at that moment's notice.After a couple of days, reluctantly, because I had nothing else to do anyway, I started watching this movie and believe me the movie doesn't start off that grand.It starts off in a simple, delicate way and goes on exploring the world, the history, the science and the spiritual in a tiny room filled with men and their designations. The movie, indeed, is one of the best ones I had ever watched and most importantly one of the most beautifully designed thought provoking movies of all time.The movie, is destined to give you chills and it won't grab you out of your seat for even a minute after you start watching it, and believe me, it's intriguing.

		<fullReview>I loved some ideas in this film. It really feels like an intellectual, philosophical discussion and is certainly instigating and entertaining at same time, which is quite rare characteristic in films nowadays. Being said, the film, from a technical stand point, is a mess. Editing is rather poor, typical of low-micro budget films. The quality is very low in the acting as well. And I mean, the actors put effort, but it was horrible. The interpretation was even worse(due the film being wordier, I suppose) and there were some unintentionally ridiculous moments, which, again, I suppose wasn't worked better because of the budget.But yeah, the script has great potential. With top production values, this film has a chance of being a possible '12 Angry Men' of our times. Because the screenplay is THAT good. For now, we can say The Man From Earth is an extremely ambitious film that couldn't have been any better with the limited budget it was made.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>apparently this is one of those movies that you either like or you don't, but most likely you won't stay indifferent. Just like the characters in the movie who listen to 1 guy telling a story about his life and how he wandered around earth thru the last 14 millennia. The intellectual conversations throughout the movies are a bit shallow and lack substance and to some extend plausibility but it's compensated by a clear train of thought from point a to b always embedded in the ambiguity whether the characters believe him or not. Some interesting concepts and ideas around religion and scientific methods are used as motifs. Also they found a neat way to make sure that the characters could neither proof or disprove the story, which kept this superposition of truth and lie going shortly before the ending.Spoilers ahead ------------ And with the ending I would see the biggest problem with the movie - unfortunately they chose to go for one that tries to tie up some loose ends instead of keeping everybody guessing. Oldman could have walked away and leave it up to everybody else what they take away from it. The fact that one of the other characters turns out to be his son was an absolutely unnecessary twist and to a degree, invalidated the bottom line of the movie, which could have been that everybody chooses by himself what to believe.</fullReview>

It's a fruitful idea that really grows and grows with each "what if?" you can conjure up, and luckily his friends are the perfect group to have this conversation and ponder these questions.That was probably one of the greatest story I have ever been told, especially in such a simple, yet effective way. I have to say that the script for this film is practically flawless. It explores so many different ideas and in such interesting ways. However, this is not a perfect film. The direction and acting water down the script a bit. But they can definitely be over looked as the film is incredible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply, a gorgeous piece of work. I got this movie when it first came out and I watched it multiple times. It is not everyday that a movie can give you the same experience of the theater and the self- visualization of reading a novel. The movie introduces colorful characters with various beliefs and insights portrayed by some fresh, classic acting skills. David Lee was the right choice to play John Oldman, who is definitely a character of intrigue. He conveys the wisdom of a man alive for over a millennium, but still gives the performance of a man who is giving a performance of a man alive for over a millennium.Being a Christian man, I was taken aback by the reference to Christ. But not being an ignorant fool and with my appreciation for art, I got over it. It is a FICTIONAL PIECE OF WORK, not a revision of religious beliefs or history!This is a movie that ends with you wanting a sequel or wanting a prequel even more. But this is beautiful just how it is. Good job, Bixby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think a lot of the reviewers who have rated this movie lowly have done so for a few of principle reasons. 1/ they see a "Sci-Fi" movie with an 8 rating and a lot of 10 reviews and think it will be something to rival Avatar, 2/ they aren't expecting something that is more like a stage play than an feature film, and 3/ a lot of religious people will think it is offensive for the usual "looking for a reason to be offended" reasons.The Man from Earth is almost entirely set in a single room, and is a conversation among a group of people. Some of the acting, mainly at the beginning is weak, though in a "they should have re-shot it" sense, because for most of the movie it is much better, but like you'd see in a theater production, rather than a high production values block buster. The subject matter is intelligent, touches on many aspects of philosophy, theology, science, and history. It is thoughtful and well written, and I don't know why it has the label "Sci-Fi" attached to it at all.It's not a Shawshank Redemption by any means, but it is very good, if you don't go into it expecting it to be something it isn't. If the themes it covers interest you, I'm confident you will like it too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have just come across this 2007 movie on Blue Ray and cannot believe that a quality Sci-Fi film like this slipped beneath my radar. Film critics and the media and all film award bodies should have been shouting and screaming the praises of this film back in the day! It is very rare in this day and age to be completely sucked in to the unravelling drama that a low budget film like this has quite honestly mastered and excelled at. This would have definitely been on my shortlist at the 2007 Academy awards! Much Kudos to the Director Producer and cast of relatively unknown actors who all made this one of the most enjoyable and intelligent "What If" Sci-fi movies I have watched in some time. This would make a great stage show too!</fullReview>

At least 80% of the quality of a movie is due to its writing, and the premise of the story as told through its dialog is thought-provoking, to say the least. So much so that it's the only movie I've specifically shared with my friends in a private screening, followed by serious discussion of the issues presented.

Not often you can find a movie with such a deep thoughts. Acting is not the best, but when you got deeper into movie you forget about it, and that makes it great! If you're interested of watching something which raises philosopher thinking (not regular movie "splash crash" or action) this movie is for you. I don't know any movie like this one, and that makes it unique, every aspect of the movie is perfectly finished, every thought is well represented. You would say that the movie is science fiction but on the same time it is just wider thinking about the life, surviving, influence to environment or just a second w're living in.</fullReview>

The other members of the cast were quite unknown to me, even though I had seen Davis Lee Smith in Mysterious Skin, and Alexis Thorpe in American wedding. This movie has overcome our expectations. It is a true gem, excellent writing, superb acting, and the twist at the end is well... surprising. We had to watch it again to understand some parts. Truly superb movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I am not a fan of movies that start and end up in a single room (with and exception - 12 angry men). And now, even this movie added to that list. The movie is an outcome of a beautiful and creative mind. It compels you to think beyond your traditional belief about the world and the laws of nature. It will make you believe that even nature laws have their exception. The movie is actually a discussion of group of professors,all experts in their fields about their view points on a rare nature's law exception. The movie has real good dialogs, real good theories, and a real good explanation of all the things that we might disapprove saying irrational. The movie leaves you to thinking about your own belief. A must watch for open minded people and be prepared to get your beliefs challenged..!!</fullReview>

Looking forward to watch movies with the same tone.This movie answer to many questions you have in your mind about human evolution and made you think about them again. In the movie, the main character, John tells about his experience of 14000 years to some friends coming to see him off. It's really adventurous to see him answers all their curious questions and doubts.Characters are fit according to the movie. They are serious, funny and intellectual. Movie has the power to hook you up if you try to understand what they are talking about.The only drawback is: Some viewers can have problem with some religious things. So for solid believer, take it lightly it's just for fun. And enjoy it the more you can.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Large budget is not necessary for a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first review on this page so hopefully it won't turn out to have burnt taste. This movie stands out of a big crowd today's big budget Hollywood blockbusters by being a piece of art and philosophy. It has no special effects, no beautiful scenery, just a few aging scholars debating in one room for 90 minutes about a man who is possibly 14 thousand years old. What I liked the most about it is that it is aimed at proving complete nonsense statement as truth. In this way it is similar to another very well accomplished movie, sci-fi documentary "Dragons: A Fantasy Made Real". It is a philosophical discussion about perception and believes which shape up our biased truth even today. Movie has very low pace requiring a lot of patience from viewer but it prepares and rewards you with some great discoveries and emotional moments. However, movie has a few strong flaws. Argumentation is often naive and flat which does not evoke discussion of educated men. Movie lacks details. Also, camera work seems to be week, sometimes annoying.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Only defect of this movie is that it's too short. I would have watched this movie for 6 hours at least, without plot twists, just for the story- telling. Being a gamer, I'm comparing this a bit to Assassin's Creed, for dabbling in history and modifying accepted facts (on another scale, of course) while still keeping it somewhat believable. You will enjoy this movie if you like to question things, reflect on life in general. The narrative line is easy to follow, and you don't need to be a rocket scientist to understand the used terms. Great movie, and in my opinion the kind of movie you want to watch alone, with no distractions. Intoxication level up to you but a bit more tilting to sober.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best movie judging by the price-quality ratio</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me this is probably the best movie there is and let me tell you why: For those of you who know me (mostly probably from my reviews on Czecho- Slovak alternative to IMDb) it is long time known that the most important thing on every movie or TV show are not the actors, directors, crew and lots of money pumped into the set, but always number one on my list is script, close second is script again and third would be the book by which the script is written (if there is any). This film simply have the best script there is thanks to great work of late Jerome Bixby. It is so short, so simple, written just for handful of actors and yet it's so brilliant in it's originality, complexity and ability to chain one to the screen from start straight to the end, that no other movie can be even compared to it. Not to sound like I underestimate the work of the rest of crew and cast, let me just say that all of these people did a really great job of putting late Mr. Bixby's lines on the silver screen, it surely could have been even better, but there is no eleventh star on IMDb. The casting is simply great, no superstars, but very well known faces that any cinema-geek knows quite well, great director Richard Schenkman and judging by his blog also great crew. Together this film is a cherry on the top of any evening!</fullReview>

After the first five minutes it seemed like a really poor movie, mostly because of weak acting, I think. Then they started talking about John's crazy claim and from then on the movie was pretty interesting. Weak acting was the biggest problem throughout the whole movie, but music, editing, directing and lighting could also have been better.The best thing about this movie was definitely the story and it really carried it to my 6/10 rating.

		<fullReview>The Man from Earth is a movie that takes place in one room. Any movie that can engage the viewer without a bunch of CGI, explosions, fast paced scenes, etc is very hard to do, and Man from Earth did that. I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, and didn't have any expectations. If you have not seen it, know that you are getting yourself into something very intellectual that is closer to a book than a movie. The reason I give this movie 6 out of 10 is because of the direction the movie took. I thought it to be very interesting, but at the same time very out there and slightly insulting. I do not have a problem with movies that question religion, but I do have a problem when movies make Christians out to be the uneducated, close-minded, and "faith-only" kind of people. Without diving into that issue, I feel that this was a very thought provoking movie that is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say this is the first time I do write a review. I am not a professional reviewer, but I do enjoy watching good movies.I do realize people seek different things in a movie: acting, plot, the cast, action, landscapes, good music, special effects, and, sometimes, provocative ideas that make them think.It's not inappropriate to say different movies may have different objectives. Some are made to be blockbusters (like Men in Black, let's say), but you don't actually watch MIB expecting to see a romance like Casablanca, a plot like Man on The Ledge. It's just FX, comedy, a good time in deed. You know you have your expectations in place just when you buy the ticket for it. If you enter the theater expecting to see Startrek-like sci-fi, you well certainly be frustrated.I know the best movies manage to score fairly good in all the criteria mentioned above,as much is relevant for the objective they were made for. Again, MIB was not created to show you a window to a different world, as Matrix did and Blade Runner surely did, and that's why these movies are awesome sci-fi thrillers.Well, I do have to say acting in The Man from Earth is not it's strength, that's quite obvious. The cast is not Hollywoods creme d la creme, but you won't feel like watching high school plays either. As a matter of fact, I am incline to like them very much, because most of them were in sci-fi series I've watched during the last decades. The FX are non existent at all, no question about it. Romance, well, it depends of your definition of it? Landscapes are nonexistent too, at least explicit ones, but the one the dialogs suggested I've managed to construct in my mind, like I would have to do if reading a book, and, I have to say, I don't mind constructing it in my mind at all? What about the plot? Twists? Surprises, suspense? Well, in my reading, I DO found them all, lots of it, actually. I don't need someone running and million dollar explosions to recognize action, and turnovers.The upside of this movie is not how it starts or how it ends, but how it develops itself trough the dialogs, arguments, facts and possibilities. All important ingredients to stimulate my mind , so I can picture a new world, different from what I know, opening my mind to something else. And that's precisely why it's brilliant? Overall score do not have to be the average of all criteria. If the objective of the movie is to be mind opening and provocative, AND I DO WATCH THE MOVIE WITH THAT IN MY MIND, I don't see why I have to criticize it for not having FX, or whatever? According to the objective, mission accomplished! Period! I don't feel like pseudo-intellectual (as someone pointed out about the lovers of The Man From Earth) because I feel stimulated by sci-fi stories. I do like reading about technological , philosofical, sociological, religious and biological/evolutionary material, but no one is gonna tell me sci-fi is mediocre because there is no laser and visual eye-candy obvious stuff, or even anticipates I'm note lectured because I do enjoy an unconventional fiction story? Seriously, I suspect people saying so had a hard time understanding what the movie was about? Adjust your expectations,knowing what the movie is about, and you will enjoy it deeply. And if you are not into it, use your time to something else, but don't complain about something not fitting what you wanted it to be? Well,overall, it's a must watch, if you do want a provocative time. If you don't, you can always sync with the Warner Channel.</fullReview>

It doesn't star the same characters, nor have the exact same plot, and focuses a lot on finding true love, rather than the (long) life story this film focuses on.

		<fullReview>This film gets a bit more credit than it deserves, as it is not nearly as smart as it would like, nor as many of its viewers claim. The script is fine, and thought provoking, but still not very deep. Occasional bursts of history and science are peppered throughout to give it a sense of reality, but it's as if the writer kept his Wikipedia nearby, not having been armed with any real research or interesting connections of historical events. (This includes the big "Biblical reveal" near the end, which one can see coming a mile away, and which lands with a dull thud.) But eventually bad directorial choices get in the way of something that could have been much better. Soundtrack music blares in at inappropriate times, and the pacing is a mess. People walk off camera and are barely out of range before the others start talking about them as if they'd been gone for 30 minutes. At least twice, major characters have very large changes of heart in the span of just seconds, even though the dialog implies they did some long thinking in between. One character pops offstage only to reappear, awkwardly again later. It's as if the script was written for a 2-hour stage play, but the director was under the gun to get the running time to under 90 minutes, or he was running out of shooting days. Everything is rushed. Performances are middling, with John Billingsley's portrayal comic relief character a uncomfortable disaster. It's a character study with thin, undeveloped characters, shoved into a rushed production of what could have been a very original idea.</fullReview>

The story itself, impeccable, in the sense that it needs no special effects other than good action, good plot and good storytelling to get the point across.

Putting all the religious thing away, this is the best Sci Fi without and Gagdets and sparkling things.End is.... there is no Limit what the Man from earth can Imagine</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply one of the best stories ever told.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is brilliant. I haven't heard anything about it before seeing it. I just downloaded it randomly. I was fascinated by it since the first minute. It is a movie, but it feels like Theater (Actually, I'm looking forward to seeing an adaptation of this screenplay). It's masterfully written, directed and acted. It qualifies as Science fiction (and it's great at it), but I think of it as a psychoanalytic session brought to the theater.The characters are so real, believable, and masterfully written. Each represents a different slice of the human condition. It's the seventh art at its very basics, and yet taken to its maximum expression. It keeps you at the edge of your seat throughout the whole film using just the power of words. Download this movie. Make 100 copies and give them away to your friends, then make a nice paypal donation on their website, I certainly did. (The official site encourages you to do this, as the main publicity this movie's got was through p2p networks).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good despite poor acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The poor acting was a bit distracting, especially that of John Billingsley. However I have watched the film a few times now and like it more each time. It is surprising how low key the film remains throughout without becoming monotonous.My biggest complaint is when John Oldman mentions that he felt he might fall off the edge of the earth with Columbus. The idea that people believed in in a flat world that you could fall off of is a modern myth. Every source I can find on the time period and every history professor I have asked says that no one believed the Earth was flat. Columbus had a rough time getting support for his exploration because people knew that his estimate of the radius of the Earth was very poor and it would take much longer than he claimed to sail all the way around the globe.Columbus had a reputation for being a poor scholar, which I suppose is what caused him to assume, despite all evidence to the contrary, that one island he landed on was Japan and another was India.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No sense of story at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is the perfect expression of old school science fiction.There are a lot of knowledgeable people, who spend the movie talking and debating. Remember, when you were in High School, how you'd sit around and wonder about things like "What would have happened if you invented a time machine, went back in time, and your parents had never met?" This is the same kind of stuff. There's precious little human interaction and motivation, just a scientific exploration of an interesting concept that's never developed as human experience.I'm not saying I have to have Independence Day, but just some changes of scenery for the pretentious dialog would have been an improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mess of a Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know when people say: "I wanna punch that movie in its face"? The Man from Earth is the consummate reason for the existence of that phrase.The film has a basic premise. A college professor is retiring and during his goodbye party, reveals to his colleagues that he has been alive for over 14,000 years. Everyone at the party has their doubts.First I should say that this film is extremely low budget. Now for the criticisms (and there are a lot). Visually it looks like it's one of those Hallmark straight to TV movies. There is a strange "dream- like" quality about it. There is no visual flair whatsoever. The acting from every actor -- yes every actor -- is quite dreadful. The story is original, I'll give it that, but the dialogue is too forced and on the nose. It talks down to its audience. An example is the main character, as mentioned earlier, is trying to convince his colleagues that he has been alive for over 14,000 years. The characters name in the film is John Oldman. Get it? Old man. Because he's old. I might have given them more credit if they at least come up with something more original than John.Directed by Richard Schenkman who earlier provided us with 1994's "Lusty Liaisons" and the oh so thought-provoking "Playboy: Playmates in Paradise" as well as his follow up to The Man from Earth, the classic "Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies", there is essentially no reason to see this film.I am very suspicious about its 8.0 rating and 100,000+ votes on IMDb. I understand its a low budget, but at what point do you stop running out of excuses for a film that it just so enamoured with its own importance?5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay movie. Not as great as most people portray it. If you have no knowledge of history and are a atheist who follows his anti-religion routine religiously, this movie will certainly impress you. Took off one star for bad acting, one for bad camera and sound quality, one for repetitiveness and one for ridiculous story.For a 2007 movie, this feels more like an early 1990's movie, probably because of the way actors are dressed or bad camera quality. I see no reason this movie is supposed to be made to look 'old'. Save your time and skip this one, unless you are an aficionado of anti-religion stuff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very introspective and thoughtful film. Plays out in sort of the way 12 angry men does, in that all of the action is talking and everything seems to take place on one set. Very realistic and dramatic, would definitely recommend.I know it's a little thing, but the part at the end where John called Will "chilly willy" really struck a chord with me. Sure parents have nicknames for their children, that's no surprise, but I haven't really seen that sort of thing portrayed in the media. It really gave the moment the spice of realism.I also liked the fact that John's rock knife thing was actually from a thrift store. That was funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is proper sci-fi. No CGI, no big spectacles. Just great imagination and a profound story about the human condition, about life itself. It explores philosophical and theological questions in a way only fiction can.Clearly a tiny budget. There is no post production polish on this, sometimes the sound is not great (otherwise I'd give it a 10/10). They did no promotion either, that's why you've probably never heard of it. But it's clearly a labour of love. The screenplay was developed over a period of forty years by Jerome Bixby who has an impressive list of great sci-fi writing including four episodes of the original Star Trek. The acting is top class- I guess that's where the budget went. Good decision.A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all this movie really made me think about 'what is God?', 'are we in the right direction?' etc. Really I never thought a script can be so tightly written and without boring the viewers with simply 5/6 casts. The film moves all the time with the average speed.The director has written the script just perfect. A well written screenplay is half success of the movie. This movie is no exception for that thumb rule. Most of the casts are just perfect to their portions. And this should be really mentioned here that none of them have overdone their part. That is the most important thing in this type of movie with lots of argument and conversation.I never thought a film can be captured in a single house without boring like this. Really a great team effort! I loved the movie a lot. I saw the movie 3 years ago, but still I remember the whole movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one came to me from a comment in a thread about scifi movies, which are out or about to come out, by a poster debating the quality of a good script, versus the overwhelming dazzle of CGI. I am eternally grateful to that anonymous person, whose remark I cannot now retrace.This film employs an ensemble cast of actors chosen largely from the realm of scifi shows and movies, fans will recognize them, to tell a strange and engrossing tale, of a man who has lived since prehistory. The story starts off with that time-tested TV movie awkwardness, where the characters show up at an isolated location, and we are quickly introduced to them, and the inter-relationships they share. These are all university educators, intelligent people, who have an obviously tight knit group, that seems to orbit around the central figure, John. In a moment of emotional weakness, when it really sinks in to John that he's leaving these friends forever, probably the best group of friends he's ever known, and for undisclosed reasons, he takes a bold step and reveals to his colleagues, that he has lived for 14,000+ years, and was born a paleolithic caveman. What follows is an interesting take on how a person like that sees the world, evolving as the world of mankind evolved, always an observer, and sometimes an outcast, and how he struggles through 200 lifetimes, to stay alive, and adapt.There's a central focus on philosophical and theological debate and doubt between the characters, which rages through most of the rest of the film. The caveman can only relate his experiences, which will certainly offend many people, but you need to rise above what may disagree with your own take on things, and try to focus on how interesting the concept of immortality was presented, as opposed to the usual vampire tale, THE PORTRAIT OF DORIAN GRAY or HIGHLANDER.If you can try to maintain an open mind, you'll enjoy this intelligent foray into the life of one who would surely be the loneliest human that ever lived. Imagine having to move on every ten years, and having to reinvent yourself, make new relationships, and watch everything you know fade from the world as you improvise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most overlooked movie in the 2000-2010 decade. It is one of the most entertaining movies I have watched, based on the little movement by the people, I mean it all goes on in one room, in one area. No flashbacks, no nothing. Just people having one of the most interesting conversation of all. This movie is so fascinating because, you can't as pointed out in the film, not say if it's true or not. You can't prove, nor disapprove it. I don't know what to believe, and I think that is the point of the movie, leaving the audience torn apart. The movie got me hypnotized and not once was I distracted. Not by my phone, not by being bored. Just simple attention for straight 85 minutes. That is indeed, fantastic.It is very much worth a watch, and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did and still do. I can't believe this film has been overseen, I mean it is a hard movie to get. It's not sold many places. Good thing we can stream (rent) films, now a days. I am completely blown away by the level of intelligence this movie is on. And the fact it goes against everything mankind is to believe, it goes against science and religion. Very, very interesting. 10 out of 10 no doubt!</fullReview>

It's very much like "12 angry men" in its absolute reliance on speech and character development, but with ideas and stories dragging you so deep into the rabbit hole so vividly! I simply cannot get enough of this film!Now that that is said, I would like to add one of the dimensions that make this film so highly esteemed in my view, is the character development. Although on a first watch I was buried by the mysteries proposed. But if you pay attention to individual characters, and their sequential responses to the stories, you can view several stereotypes of people and society embodied by the professors. Easily one of the best films I've ever seen. If you are open minded and looking for an adventure in your imagination, this film is definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

I put aside any expectations of aliens, spaceships, wormholes and any other sci-fi cliché to once again find that the story is what carries a film - not the bells and whistles. I can understand how people will put down "The Man From Earth" but it was indeed an education for me as I've avoided biblical/religious study my entire life - all 53 years of it. It's similar to another favorite of mine "Monsters" in that both films emphasize substance over style. That is to say "The Man From Earth" isn't for anyone weaned on the run-of-the-mill CGI extravaganza's that typify Hollywood sci-fi, it's more cerebral than that, but definitely worth every penny to see.</fullReview>

It's also done in only one room. There're no scenery changes except at the very end. That should tell you something about the unusual premise of this movie. So the movie is somewhat small scale, and maybe better fit as a TV movie. If this movie was an episode of Star Trek, and Flint was the name of the main character, reprising his role from another episode of Star Trek TOS, it would have been sensational.In a way, this movie is another version of that Star Trek episode which Jerome Bixby wrote the script.Jerome Bixby saved this story for the very end. Perhaps the subject of immortal man playing major figures in history was a concept that intrigued him deeply.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film for the Intelligent viewer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is a cerebral saturnalia, a sensory-intellectual stimulation most authentic of its kind. That Jerome Bixby let three decades pass between conceiving and completing the screenplay for this piece-of-art is altogether condonable. A 'remarkable cinematic accomplishment by a team of unremarkable people' has been the long-n-short of this films' post-release existence.Released largely on the Internet and spread through p2p networks, it was the ordinary internetizens who proliferated the web with copious offerings of positive reviews which abetted the movie's emergence on the horizons of popular imagination. The juggernaut still continues to roll as the movie has maintained its upward climb on all major ranking directories.Of the movie itself. The substance of the plot is a longdrawn, often back-and-forth, resolution of the protagonist's outrageous claim, to his friends over drinks, of being a cro-magnon man who has sustained an animate existence on earth for 14000 years (and evaded biological ripening for the entire duration)!! In the course of discussions between the protagonist and his friends, touched upon, often didactically, are such diverse domains of knowledge such as anthropology, biology, archeology, technology, history, culture and religion. The narrative structure is neat, linear and unfolds in cognition by argument rather than in temporality by events. To the indulgent-participative viewer, the crescendo of the story would feel akin to a precipitous change in the state-of-consciousness as, one by one, all the arguments and counter-arguments flow into the narrative and inter-weave to corrosively overcome the disbelief that was securely established at the beginning.Slowly, with punctuated reassurances and frequent regressions, taking the viewer from a state of complete staid a priori unbelief in the protagonists' claim and putting him, by the end of it, in a mind-numbing position where any further denial is rationally impossible but accepting any of it is inevitably mindf**king - a state of immense cognitive arousal - is the genius of this film and also the biggest reason for its captivating pull. All of it transpires in the undistracting enclosures of a drawing room in a house where the protagonist and his friends have gathered for his farewell as he is to leave town permanently, something he claims to do every ten years lest his supernaturality become ostentatious and a subject of unsolicited social curiosity.There is'nt much need to discern the merit of individual performances and other filmic specifics as the movie is powered solely (and over-sufficiently) by the ingenious idea embodied cogently in the screenplay and, as such, could have been just as good even with an amateur cast. An absolute must watch once-in-a-decade kind of film. Pure brilliance.</fullReview>

To tell the truth, I didn't think it possible for me to really like a movie, in which the whole stories lies in one room. I can't spoil anything, because that would rob you of most of the pleasure of this film. Though, I can say, this is an incredible movie, relying only on a conversation between persons of very different beliefs, and fields of expertise, psychologist, biologist... It really makes you think, and I think it would be a very good thing if extremists (no matter the religion) had a really good critical look at it. It might really well put there beliefs in trial, and some good might come of it.A really wonderful piece of scenario, more than worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was one of those movies that made me cringe right off the bat for poorly written dialog, development of characters, and cliché directing choices...but I couldn't stop watching it.My background is theatre, and I just kept thinking it sounded like a read-through of a 2nd draft script. The ideas are there, and carefully thought through and developed, but the dialog is weak and often forced. The writer tries to bring us into this world fast, but the emotions that he is trying to have us accept are not well planned or timed.I don't blame the actors, although I thought some delivery was poor...but the writing should have aided them more with that. And I blame the director too, the shots of John looking off into the distance while people talked around him or at him were cheesy.As a fan of movies like Gattaca, Children of Men, and what i consider a somewhat similar movie Last Night(although i don't know why i think that), I can't understand the 8.3 rating...except that I think it's given based on the ideas and not the actual movie. It was poorly executed, and the dialog needed revision. Don't use the excuse of lack of budget, it didn't need one. I would be happy sitting in that room or in a theater watching this exchange of ideas unfold on a living room couch, but it needed an editor. This is a real world, with educated people sitting in a room talking? I just didn't buy it.I'd love to see this worked on again and revisited, on film, a stage, or in a book...it is a neat concept. Enjoy it the way I did, thinking about it as a cold read in some guys house in the woods.</fullReview>

Genius Jerome Bixby ensured it. and I am quite impressed. He proved himself in star trek and twilight zone. This was his last work. I'm truly feel his absence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie while surfing through the movie channels. Usually movies without explosions or spaceships have trouble holding my attention... but, oh boy, this one was great and no FX was required! Talking about an intelligent and creative dialogs! A breath of fresh air! All movie enthusiasts are certainly happy to see a beacon of hope from time to time! In my humble opinion actors and crew delivered superbly their parts! You will feel invited for John's goodbye party! You may even feel the fireplace heat or taste a JW green label! And overall, how good was it? Let's say you will not want John to leave... ever!</fullReview>

Did not expect anything from a low budget film but was in awe during and after the film.I can understand why some people would give this film one or two stars. Closed minded people will not like this film, so if you are closed minded, do not watch this.You have to remember, it's a movie. To be enjoyed as is. Sit back and enjoy one of the best movie's ever made. Deserve's to be higher up on the IMDb list but you can't please everyone.Will watch this movie again several times, that's for sure.

		<fullReview>I was genuinely moved by this film. I did not shed tears, nor was the message a revelation of some sorts due to my background in studies of different religions as well as interest in neuroscience. What moved me was both the story itself as well as the acting and direction. This film has no action, no plot, it relies on dialog and the connection between the characters. John Oldman reveals to his colleagues that he is by some unknown miracle 14000 years old. Is John playing a hoax? Is he for real? His friends and colleagues try to presume neither, but approach it critically, analytical and objective. However there is just so much objectivity one can manage before one's personal feelings get in the way.The Man From Earth is not a film about religion, nor science, nor the possibility of a correlation between them. It does not take a stance for either. It is a film about humanity, about people. It is a true humanistic film at its core; humanistic ethics, stripped down to the bare simple truths about life right here, right now. It is not a film in the high standards of Tarkovsky, Bergman, Kurosawa to receive a top rating, yet I am still giving it a 10. The pacing was fantastic, all the characters displayed warmth and were equally sympathetic, the direction and photography while not original and extraordinary was perfect for telling this story. There are no hidden mysteries that are revealed, you won't find from it the meaning of life. But perhaps it will inspire you to find your personal meaning of life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kudos to the author and Falling Sky Entertainment. Of all the movies I have seen (about 50 years worth, as of this writing) this is the most amazing film that clearly needed very little budget. This movie paints an image in the viewers mind, much like listening to an Orson Wells radio drama.Here is the story of a college professor packing his possessions as he prepares to move away. A number of other professors drop in to say goodbye and as the conversation begins, the amazing story unfolds.The story is triggered by a carved rock that appears to be from the time of cave men. The story weaves through the time of cavemen up to modern times. It is a fascinating story that I recommend everyone to see.</fullReview>

It's not that this amazing piece of film making needs any more reviews, it already has over 400 and 99% of them are 10 or 9 stars. I just need to let people know that those few reviewers who canned this film are either children without the yet developed intellect to understand it or religious fanatics who don't like their creation theories questioned! I am a very spiritual person and I was not at all offended by the premise, it is simply a magnificent piece of science fiction that will keep you thinking about it for weeks after you've seen it.

The movie could have kept going for 30 more minutes and it would have been great, I was really enjoying the story, it didn't feel long or boring at all. Felt like reading a good book, you cannot stop watching.If you put famous actors and high quality equipment, this could have been the "12 angry men" of our time.

		<shortDescription>Not as philosophically deep as the writer might think it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carl Sagan once said of humanity "This is what hydrogen atoms do when given 15 billion years of evolution." Well, 13.7 to be precise. The point is, the idea that a human might live for fourteen thousand years should provoke awe inspiring questions, and instead we get a film which ignores them in favor of a focus on religion, and not a very interesting focus either. The script is condescending, and none of the actors are believable as professors in their respective fields. The contrivance of the script is transparent, but that's to be expected- after all who wants to do much homework for a movie script? How is it that a man lives through 140 centuries and only knows English? He is a male of prime fighting age, but he was never pressed into military service? Ever? He was never shot at or stabbed? We are to believe that his special survival abilities extend solely to cancer and infectious diseases, but not trauma? If you want a low-budget philosophical and thought provoking sci-fi tale, check out Doctor Who and don't waste your time with this intellectually sophomoric drivel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was such a pleasure to watch late at night and all alone. There were no car chases or sex scenes, no slapstick humor or explosions, yet it kept me glued to my seat. It reminds me of how enthralled I would get watching the twilight zone as a child. Without giving away any plot points, I'll just say it presents a fascinating premise explored from all angles with interesting characters. It plays a bit like a low budget TV movie, but again, this movie isn't about polished showiness, it's about ideas. Not all movies about people sitting in a room and talking can hold one's attention. Often movies like that feature young self-important hipsters, pretentiously waxing philosophical about things that most folks could care less about. This movie is the opposite of that. It is mature, deep, complex, and thoroughly enjoyable.</fullReview>

This is something you absolutely must see if you love sophisticated and thought-provoking conversations. Don't expect too much action or perfect visuals from it though - this film was certainly not made for this. You should probably also be a bit open-minded on the topics of religions and history to fully enjoy the plot. Don't take it all too seriously, it's still just a movie, but, man, such a great one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't get fooled by the high rating. Let me explain:</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>IMDb ratings are useful but OF COURSE, if you know how to read them!First of all, viewers who allow their time to sign up and rate the movies must be considered as above average viewer. Therefore ratings on IMDb have a certain value. But still, the population of IMDb includes a dispersion and you should understand how people tend to rate based on this fact.1) Big productions with an original script (or a revolutionary technique as SC cam as in Avatar) and a topnotch cast would go up to IMDb's Top list and they would probably deserve it. Look at that list and in general you'll see the master pieces of the cinema history.2) Big productions with a well-crafted script and a good cast would definitely have a rating above 7 from numerous users like 50000 people or something like that. According to your taste of genre, you won't be disappointed by these films most of the time. 3) An indie film with a low budget, a good or an original (or as it seems that way at the first look) script and an unknown cast would have a rating above 7 from a comparatively lower number of users like 20000 or so. This 3rd case is the tricky one. If your time is valuable, you should take some time to read some reviews and make up your mind. Because in cases like these (like The Man From Earth here) when average educated people with an average intelligence see this kind of film THEY THINK that they're so intellectual and special and THEY FEEL like they're above the rest of the human kind and THEY ARE the first and the only ones who understand the false concept of things like religion and stuff, THEY GIVE a 9 or 10 to a poorly made movie with a poorly written script and awful acting!!!Be aware!For this movie my rating is 5. And that is for the nice effort on a low budget and the success on reaching so many people. I should give 1 to compensate the over-raters though!</fullReview>

It tells me that it is not really necessary to put fancy technological things in order to make audiences impressed.

		<fullReview>The movie is story-telling which captures the viewer right from the beginning and only lets go a while after the movie comes to an end.If you are looking for an intellectually stimulating story, this movie delivers it with the craftsmanship that very few can match. A series of sharp dialogues comes mixed with some very emotionally charged responses. This feels like a natural result of an absorbing semi-academic discussion of the principles behind the topics of religion, modern ethics, biology and the matter of the value of human life. "The Man from Earth" offers a surprisingly broad and yet deep and very stimulating insight to all those topics and manages to leave the viewer with feeling deep satisfied with the dynamic and rich story in a movie where action does not leave the room.</fullReview>

Considering the "hated" reviews, it is acceptable that it may be too harsh since it mostly criticize the concepts which many people take granted for and believe in. And yes, since it is not a "paper" or a "thesis" on social sciences, it may not project the absolute "historical" facts. But, the gist is always there and the transfer to the audience is well managed . And the film is really courageous considering that the audience may be anyone.

I don't think it's intended to any public... you need a brain, an open mind, a few cultural and historical background too. And you need to follow the flow of thoughts between the different characters and their motivations to dig further in the intrigue.

		<shortDescription>An interesting "Small movie"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With about a half dozen actors/actresses and all shot inside and outside a little cottage, this is an interesting and thoughtful movie.If "science fiction" to you means spaceship dogfights and laser-swords (which is more properly "science fantasy") then you won't get this film. This is a film about ideas, one main one, and the impact that discovering something that breaks all your deepest held beliefs has on people. We the audience, just like the characters in the film, are caught in the grip of a tale that seems too challenging to be true.. and too wonderful to *not* be real.The writing and acting is top notch and makes this movie, which could have easily been a stage play, gripping throughout. It has a small twist to its ending... just enough to surprise and delight the viewer and put a nice "cap" on this very thoughtful musing.I should add that this film was well researched, including many current historical theories and melding them together into one compelling narrative. If you get bored in movies without fast cuts and things blowing up, again, this movie isn't for you. But if you like to play with ideas and are a student of human behavior, don't miss a chance to see it.Afterword: In an ironic twist to a movie about what happens when people's cherished or well held belies are challenged, reading many of the negative reviews here will show you exactly what the movie is exploring in real life.</fullReview>

No explosions :-) It does covers an interesting thought of line that includes an intriguing possibility. "Everything is possible" is a fine quote that just sums it up. What does get in the way is the television series style, Bruckenheimer style, background music. And, of course it is not very PC.

Everyone should watch the movie and find out for yourself.Of course some people might disagree with me, and regard the movie as a religious film. I believe that is another way to describe the film.

There is no character development so i am not invested in any of the characters. basically the only reason i give it a 4 out of 10 is for originality. They could have done so much more with this film, use some different angles with you camera, add something more to the characters interactions between each other. I do give props to the filmmakers for making a scifi film with only dialogue, but the writing needed to be more fluent.

Although the characters never leave the confines of an isolated cabin in the desert, this is one of the fastest-paced movies you'll ever see. There are no dinosaurs here, no fight scenes, no action at all, just an original and dramatic movie with some of the best dialogue to come out of Hollywood in years.My only regret with "The Man From Earth" is that it was not longer. I could have sat and listened for hours to the questions that were asked and to the historical responses given. A lot of today's audience won't get it. They'll be bored because there's no CGI, no naked girls, no car chases, and they'll go play X Box.Perhaps it's fate that "The Man From Earth" was released just as the writers were going on strike. Jerome Bixby, who also wrote for Star Trek and The Twilight Zone, did this as his last script, and he went out with a bang. He probably won't get any Oscar nomination because this is such a small movie, but anyone who has seen "The Man From Earth" would surely agree it's the Best Screenplay of 2007.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great story, not so great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I agree with most of the comments about this movie. This is the forward and bold thinking we need if we really want to evolve - technological progress is not enough. The concept of an argument-supported discussion among intelligent and educated people gives it proper credibility. It is a great approach to shed new light on already accepted (but likely invented and imagined) stories imposed by years of religious dogma. It was also greatly paced with a final snap, saying it was all a story, allowing only the most persistent to find out the truth. Nevertheless, I was disappointed in the acting. I am aware that no celebrity would accept such a bold role, especially now when most of us are still not ready or not willing to peek beyond. Hopefully, in a few years of so, it will be properly remade with A-list casting (not mainstream) to have a greater impact. 10 for the idea and boldness, but only 5 for the acting. This is still a movie and needs persuasive acting, not just a great story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly one of the best movies I have seen in a long time... Its thought provoking and compelling to say the least. Though it could be a tad controversial due to references to Jesus and this could very well be one of the reasons, why it would not have mass appeal. Other reasons being that it has no action and focus is on just discussions, which a person with at least moderate patience and intelligence, only would be able to enjoy!The script seems to be a well researched one to a layman like me, but it's up to experts on the subjects to comment on it. The climax was truly astounding, with a twist most of you would never imagine! I personally feel this is one DVD worth collecting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I feel like I'm being pretty liberal giving this movie even 6 stars. The main reason for this generosity is that I think the story behind the movie is conceptually interesting and was probably much better than the film. I wish I'd had the opportunity to read it rather than watching this movie.Bixby scores with accurate and amusing historical perspective, which is sadly obscured by layers of uninspired, mechanical acting (the possible exception being Tony Todd's performance as Dan) and vision-less direction. The overall product is stiff and flat and comes off like a pretentious attempt at intellectualism by self-indulgent college film students.With all due honors to the writer Jerome Bixby, for whom I have great respect, I'm shocked that it gets such high scores with the viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing film. Really got me thinking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so this is my first film review/comment so I don't have much experience in the reviewing department, however I do have experience in watching films! (Doesn't everybody? haha) To be honest, when I first heard of this movie my expectations weren't that high. I simply thought 'Oh, another independent film. Probably low budget, meaning a lame script, screen play and surely the selection of cast can't be that fantastic', however when I sat down to watch this movie, I was pleasantly surprised.Not only did it really get me thinking about life and what it means, but in a way it gave me a different perspective on history, and what people 'could have' been like in that time (I know this film is not a history text book, but as a visual person it gave me an insight into the possibility of what life was like back then).This movie practically had me sitting at the edge of my seat, just waiting for the next line of dialogue that would meet my ears. To me, it almost felt like I was sitting there on the chair with that group, becoming transfixed with John Oldman's story.I rate this movie a 10 out of 10, simply because not many movies get me thinking like this one did - And it also has a level of educational value in there that I found rather interesting (being a history student and all). To anyone that finds Earth's history curious, intriguing and interesting, I recommend this movie to you.Sci-Fi fans will love this! As did I! And Dear Director, thankyou for making this movie. You have made me a very happy person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film, important subject matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would go as far as calling it an important film, for its educational value. I have rarely come across a piece of media that manages to tackle the most basic argument that effectively disproves all religions (but not spirituality) in such a logical and methodical way, while at the same time being entertaining.In my opinion, this film should be shown to all first year University students undertaking a phylosophy or even religious studies degree. It's the perfect film for getting students, or any young person, to start thinking about what drives belief and how time twists these into belief structures.As I heard it said recently "There are five major world religions ... four of them are wrong". This film will show you that the fifth one is no more valid than the others.The script is enganging and gently starts the viewer down this philosophical road (don't worry, no spoilers here!). It's no surprise that Jerome Bixby used to write for Star Trek as there is a premise the audience is asked to accept which borders on science fiction (besides, Star Trek was notoriously secular in its approach), however, whether this premise is believed by the viewer or not is irrelevant for the appreciation of the story and its message.I can't recommend this film highly enough, especially for bible-belt Americans who don't mind having their beliefs analysed and debated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immortal CroMagnon's Revelations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a truly superb film: Script, acting, direction, production values (on a shoestring budget no less). The cast is spot-on, and David Lee Smith in the title role is a superb young actor who enthralls the audience and gets to spread his acting wings (so to speak) much better than the somewhat limited opportunities for him to do so on *CSI: Miami*. Smith plays John Oldman who, at a final farewell gathering with his closest friends/colleagues chooses for the first time in his (rather long) life to reveal a secret: He was born approx. 14,000 years ago, in the Upper Paleolithic, aged to approx. 35 years, and then ceased to age, which is to say that he is not vulnerable to the syndrome we call aging, or senescence. That is, he is, for all practical purposes, *immortal*. He's lived and loved for many, many, *many* human lifetimes, has experienced, and, indeed, of course, been a part of, the rise and fall of various civilizations. And there is one more secret, which I shan't spoilingly reveal here, and which the character John Oldman himself only very reluctantly reveals/discusses, that is a further tribute to the genius of Jerome Bixby, further establishing him (posthumously), as if there could really be any doubt, as one of the greatest "speculative fiction" writers of all time, along with his cohorts Richard Matheson and Phil Dick, to name just two other illustrative luminaries of the genre that come to mind.What WOULD it be like to be such an immortal---originating from the Upper Paleolithic no less? To remember what it was like to be, not just pre-industrial, but, indeed, to be pre-"civilization", to be prehistoric, to have hunted Mammoth, giant ground sloths, etc., to have feared sabertooth cats, to have domesticated canines...etc....etc. To have experienced Hellenistic times, the Roman Empire, the Dark Ages...to have had the opportunity to sail with Columbus...to witness the Black Death, or the French Revolution and The Terror...? Don't just rent it---buy it for your collection. You'll want to return to it every once in while. To savor the plot, the ideas, the script, the superb acting and direction (as well as cinematography)---all on a minimalist $200K budget! It is, as other reviewers, at Amazon for example, have pointed out, a filmed stage play which takes place (at least for the most part) in a cabin's living room, and in this regard is somewhat reminiscent of Hitchcock's *Rope*. And what a cast: In addition to Smith we have Tony Todd, John Billingsley, Annika Peterson, William Katt, Ellen Crawford, Richard Riehle and Alexis Thorpe---each and all at the top of their game, and one can tell that they were enamored of the project, even though they probably weren't paid much (if any) more than "scale"; they are devoted to their characters, and they do indeed come to life: You are there in that cabin with them as the story unfolds. (And, again, a tip of the hat---and thanks---to producer/director Richard Schenkman, who is, in my judgment, right on up there with Phillip Noyce, Ang Lee and Antoine Fuqua, to name just three of my favorite contemporary directors.) Not to knock the Coen Bros., whose work I very definitely like and appreciate very much, but this film beats *No Country for Old Men* (no pun here intended, btw) by a country mile! This film is simply a GEM, and sails through to its climax and conclusion in a sparse 87 mins. This is a film to be savored like fine wine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first when I saw this movie I was somewhat disappointed that it was very low-budget. Some of the actors are terrible, and the soundtrack is sometimes interestingly unfitting.Still, the main characters and the the screenplay kept me intrigued, and as the story continued I didn't want it to end, as I never do with interesting movies.This movie is a little gem that deserves more respect than the blockbuster that have state of the art effects and overpaid actors. The story is extremely compelling and I wonder how huge this movie could have been with a little more money to back it up in the first place.It would not surprise me if it became something of a cult movie, and after searching the web a little, I found out that in Norway it has already made quite an impression on some people who recommend it on a lot of sites.Highly recommended for people who appreciate a good story and doesn't have the "A.D.D movie syndrome" where an explosion every five minutes and state of the art special effects is a must to enjoy a good sci-fi flick.A little gem that I hope makes an impression on the bigger names in Hollywood</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting to experience an intellectual exercise of film making and was very disappointed. The story was overly predictable and full of inaccurately researched data. How inaccurate, worse than End of Days or The Da Vinci Code. Yes, that bad; mixed up time periods and names, selective data to fit the story premise with the apparent hope no-one would point out the many factual omissions that would contradict the script. Perhaps if the script had stayed at innuendo, the story might have worked but as soon as factual names started appearing, the research faltered. SPOILER The protagonist says he has been historical figures over his long life, many for which we know the actual dates for 'birth' and 'death', and that of the figures' parental lines. Impossible for him to have just been that figure for "a period of time". END SPOILER The scriptwriters for The Mentalist do a better job of making a character seem to be someone else.</fullReview>

I mean a good enough idea and all but how do you expect people to keep listening to inane questions that group of nerds ask a supernatural immortal about his life.

And mind you, the answers or for the matter of fact even the questions are nothing out of ordinary.Final verdict, read the line between the quote at the start of this review and you don't have to watch the movie, 'coz you wont miss anything!Kindly avoid this movie and watch anything that's for people who think and not for people who praise 'the emperor's new clothes' just to look intelligent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jerome Bixby's script (apparently finished not long before his author's death) almost starts like a joke to unfold in a most engaging and fascinating story that challenges all sort of preconceptions. Some of the most elaborated dialogue lines of all-times cinema, excellent characters, emotional performances and beautiful, seemingly irrepetible moments, contribute to this ode to humanity, this triumph of reasoning over beliefs, to this pure message of hope for the future.If you see it with an open mind, The Man of Earth is, I believe, all the above and more. And all with a very low budget, one set and a bunch of actors.I saw this film recently in DVD, nearly by mistake. I then found out that it had only been released in some countries and always at a small scale. I didn't have high expectations, and I'm delighted to have found gold. As I said to a good friend recently, I'm still pondering whether this might be the best script I've ever have enjoyed.Then again, you may hate it.

		<fullReview>The premise is very promising, and so are the chosen characters. The problem may have been the limited imagination and intelligence of the writers who could only do so much.The story development is simple-minded and lacks depth. The acting is bad, and the lack of character-depth doesn't help either. It's hard to accept that a bunch of university professors have such a limited understanding of life; any complex issues are 'clerverly' avoided. Like mentioning Buddha in one phrase as 'the wisest man I've met" and then moving on fast. It seems a big deal, when in fact it's just smoke.While the lack of emotional content may be somehow explainable for the man who's lived 14000 years, the lack of emotional content of the whole film can only be explained by the fact that the writers are merely browsing. They could not decide what's important and what's not.This premise deserves better treatment - it deserves better, smarter writers. I can only imagine what it could become.This film - is not worth it. This is all you need to know: "what if a man would live for 14,000 years? what would he be like?"</fullReview>

Strong script, decent performance, and a good deal of drama all played out in one small living room. Excellent historical and speculative knowledge, everything feels real and makes sense.

		<fullReview>Just finished watching The Man from Earth a few minutes ago. My first impression was just WOW. Early on in this film though, the acting felt a bit poor, as in not very convincing. However, that soon changed as the film progressed, and I started to realise what a clever movie this really is. Only after a few minutes the excitement started to build up. At this point TMFE really "owns" you, and just won't let go until the end. It's clever because it never really lets you in on all the secrets, there's always a little shadow of doubt.I believe the movie could be put into comparison with a magic night which you never want to end. Exactly that is how I felt towards this movie. It was captivating, from beginning to end.Moreover, this motion picture felt a bit short. Maybe John could have been developed further, maybe it could have gone deeper. I also thought it ended a little bit too soon and I was not entirely satisfied, despite the ending being plausible. Although I guess it had to follow Jerome Bixby's screenplay? That said, I must underline that the excitement that engulfed 99% of this movie outweighs the limited runtime. Overall this is an excellent movie that discusses important topics and really gets your mind working. I will certainly watch it again many times to come. Kudos to the makers of this film. It was about time a science fiction movie of this type was made! I'm also thankful that you demonstrated that science fiction can be so much more than space ships and ray guns to the general public. I might even get some of my friends who are die hard non-SF fans to watch this. It is probably the best science fiction story since The Matrix. Very well done. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>History is written by those who have power and they can modify it to any extent, spread any myth or embellish any truth. How much can your senses filter the truth? At the end of the day most of our actions are dictated by necessity and if it fits a cause it can be made into an act of God or an act of Evil. Man from Earth does a pretty good job in pointing the obvious stated above. The thing that interests me the most is that at the end of the day one doesn't need to have immortality to gain insights about human culture. It's all here and can be traced down by a free spirit. That's why I was reminded of Agantuk (http://imdb.com/title/tt0101279/). I don't want to talk about the movie because I believe that defeats the purpose of the movie as it intends to initiate a discussion among the viewers about our current beliefs and validity of the norms in society. But I think its a sorry state if a movie forces you to question the obvious. I think somewhere during the evolution phase common sense got lost, maybe its time to restore it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I started watching this movie, I didn't think it was a children's movie, during the movie I became sure that it was, but then after, when looking at reviews etc., it seems others do not consider this to be targeted primarily at children. So I rated it as a film for a mature audience.Personally though, I absolutely feel that children would be the best audience for this film. I can imagine that it might be quite thought-provoking to a child. I would, though, have thought that most adults would find the whole thing too flat and simple to really captivate. The characters often act and react in contrived and incoherent ways, taking away from the credibility of the story and the immersion of the viewer.For those who remember the "The Twilight Zone", to me this movie felt a bit like an episode of that (if better and a bit more intelligent) - exciting for children, but not very captivating for mature viewers.

		<shortDescription>a deep story and a taste of what good SF can be like</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was delighted to watch this movie. I have always been a fan of science fiction literature, as well as sci fi cinema. Sadly, sci fi cinema usually presents us with VERY simplistic stories, and if we are lucky, some good entertainment. Very rarely are we treated to anything spiritually enriching. This movie has a lot of what good literary science fiction has to offer - a story with a simple science-fiction gimmick with good potential, developed in such a way that without any CGI and car chases, we get to experience something exciting and certainly worth our time. Like I said, the basic idea, of a character having lived through thousands of years, is not that original, but as both an avid sci fi cinema and story fan I can tell you that I can't think of a single story or movie which developed the idea so intelligently and coherently.This movie gives us insightful perspectives on knowledge, memory and identity, and the impact of one's actions on the perceptions of others, and how those perceptions can be forged into reality, either through time (history) or categorization (as sane, insane, credible etc). Although the movie is mostly dialog, and at the beginning I was preparing myself to be bored by the format, what is being said is so interesting that it will certainly hold your attention, especially that we get to see strong performances from the main characters/talkers (all are good enough). Also, the movie is not too long, and has very nice pacing for what it is (not an action movie). Strong science fiction stories found their way onto the screen before, but they were usually simplified or censored (think Twilight Zone) or watered down to fit into a simpler, action-oriented frame (like most adaptations of Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov), and there have been many examples of original screen science fiction, but the story in this movie is the work of someone with a great deal of insight on what people are, it is spiritually enriching without being moralizing at all, and is portrayed in a very nice peaceful movie too. So give yourself a treat and buy the DVD - I hear this is independent cinema, so they will need all the support you can give. Skip a box-office hit and use the ticket money to give yourself the pleasure of seeing something truly original. I really recommend this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I stumbled upon this movie on the P2P networks, while looking for quality Sci-Fi recommendations. Now, with a very small exception, and just like in the case of "The Fountain", I wouldn't exactly classify this movie as Science Fiction, but here's what I have to say.Although the background story line has been pretty much laid out before both in writing and in film, there is something inescapably attractive in the way the director chooses to play the simplicity hand in shooting this movie. It really felt like a breath of fresh air from the Hollywood routine.As a story, I enjoyed the premises and loved the mind game it generated. I appreciated the inquisitive characters, as well as the faulty ones - all of them standing for the faces of humanity. I sensed the point that hurt the most and, if personally I don't fully agree with the take on it, I found it worth exploring.As for acting, what can I say: I don't have the training of a movie critic, but I've got nothing to complain of, nothing to distract me from the important side of the movie, except probably the uncanny resemblance of David Lee Smith with Robert De Niro. Man, that was much too much! :) In conclusion, I'll definitely leave Mr. Schenkman a positive message on IMDb's board, and as soon as the DVD is available in my country I'll make sure to have one copy for myself; plus I can already think of a couple to offer as gifts.</fullReview>

Characters are stereotypical: archaeologist, psychologist, biblical realist, history teacher, etc. The main character claims that he has been alive for thousands of years and says that he was such figures as Jesus, Buddha, and other religious leaders. This is presumably meant to "ooh" the viewer by making them questioning everything they believe and injecting skepticism into every belief. No, its not like watching the twilight zone.

		<fullReview>I ran into this film when I was boring. Tips said we shouldn't expect any popular scene as we usually saw on the film. I just wondered why this kind of movie was filed into science fiction.It is all about a story, which has enormous anthropological&#xff0c;biological and archaeological knowledge. Under most circumstance this kind of movie won't be attractive at all.Like &lt;12 angry men&gt;, most of the movie was set in a house, conversations happened near a fireplace&#x3002; If I were the director, I would desperately do my best on the lines&#xff0c;because I couldn't offer any other things to keep audience in the couch. What I didn't expect was that Prof. "Oldman" posed such an amazing question: what would happen if you could live for ten thousand years. I asked some of my friends about this question, some were confused, and others just doubted that if I was mentally disordered. So it was really a tough job to analyze this topic, after an impossible assumption. We could really do a lot of things to make us happy or regretted, for we had endless of time. But we could also do nothing for we had endless of time, why hurry? We delayed things tomorrow and nothing bad would happen, in all ,we can wait, just let time do it.This film might have religious points of view which I am not familiar with, and someone may disagree with those things, but using the imagination as we are watching the movie over the assumption of immortality can bring us lots of fun. Just suppose if I could once work with Confucius or any greatest emperor of China or Rome or any other countries, I would be part of history. My people would remember me as an hero although they didn't realize that I was just around. One can look further if he could stand higher, some man who lives forever might develop the truth or natural philosophy which everybody believes.The limit of life may do the only good thing to us that time pushes us forward, we can't wait until tomorrow. The threat of death generates vast number of changes, some are good, and some are the worst. The man from the earth gives us so many surprises; even some imagination can drive people crazy.

		<shortDescription>Reminds me of SF of yesteryear. Great Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished seeing this movie and the first movie I have ever reviewed. This movie reminds me of my childhood reading great SF. Most good SF is about great ideas and this movie had a great if not original concept.This is one of the few good intellectual SF movies. Great story and a highly plausible explanation. Might offend some religious people. This movie made me feel a part of the discussion about what a 14,000 year old caveman would feel and think after all these years. Great performances from the cast. Liked the characters.Hopefully more people see it and support these type of low budget movies which have great and compelling ideas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, the Internet. That's how I discovered this movie originally, but I loved it so much that I had to buy it. This is a low budget movie but it's done spectacularly. Some of the actors fall flat a couple of times but the rest of the cast is great. The story itself is really intriguing and makes you think. There are no action scenes, cool effects, and explosions but the movie really works. I've already watched this twice and I will definitely watch it again. If you are a sci-fi fan or if you're looking for a movie that actually makes you think, then do not miss this. I highly recommend it!It gets a perfect 10/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even in science fiction characters have to have at least a drop of credibility. Here characters (the ordinary ones) have no motives, make random comments, say random things, and behave as if they themselves are from outer space, or maybe robots. No human on this earth bears the slightest resemblance to these creatures into whose mouths the most arbitrary sentences are placed. This is the worst script I've come across in a long time and I felt sorry for the actors. I am extremely suspicious of all these raves and ten stars; some appear to be written in the same style. But maybe other viewers just didn't mind that there was no characterization, no emotional logic, no psychological coherence and zero realism, which is what the writer was striving for. A student in scriptwriting 101 could do a better job than this mess, with its desperate attempts at conflict. Every cliché in the book is used, including Oldman's simplistic and amazingly unimaginative, didactic Wikipedia articles read out loud. A waste of a very good idea. Lots of unintentional humour -- you could watch this film for the laughs, if nothing else. Also, might be good for very young kids. But even kids deserve some artistic merit, originality, coherence, imagination and a decent script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of movies that makes me critically think about the resolution and the point; also the ending. Movies such as Usual suspect or the Memento are one of my all time favourites. Sure I stumbled onto this movie because of the rating it was given, and as a simple man I like watching movies that are rated high. But upon reading the synopsis was when I really wanted to watch this movie because I could sense that the movie would deliver me some mind- puzzling session throughout the runtime.To speak my point, I was very captured by this movie throughout the end but I decided to give 1. The topic of the shift of time from one man's perspective and the respective audience (John's friends) giving their own insights into the topic was all too mind bottling and I was anxious to hear what would happen in the end because a rating this high would not have a blunt ending when the introduction is so anticipating. Hence I waited and when John decides to speak about how he was Jesus and how he was friends with the Buddha and how Christianity was really a hoax of what people wanted to believe deeply offended me. Now, don't take this the wrong way because I am not a Christian nor a Buddhist. I am deeply offended at the idea of how a simple movie created by a simple direction could touch on such a sensitive topic such as a religion into something so simple and offending. I found it hugely blasphemous at this movie even when I don't have a religion. I guess I just felt it for the rest of the Christians out there.A director or the writer could throw in a little scene with 'let's make the main character Jesus since the character we have given him is deemed immortal and lived over a 14000 years, so might as well fit it in as well' and it would seem intelligent because the protagonist have built up his knowledgeable depiction throughout the first hour of the film from discussing all the truthfully spoke history before he touched on the fact that he was Jesus. This is offending because it would have changed a vast majority of the people's viewpoint on religion... why?It's just my point of view on this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No special effects, yet a riveting movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a mix of science fiction and some real philosophical questions. And it works wonderfully. It is not a movie for anyone looking for special effects or violence. Nobody shoots anybody and there are no aliens. And the space travel is all inside of the collective Western mind. The whole movie was shot in a small, average house - with a shot or two outside where two or three cars are parked. All at night. No pretty scenery or shrubs. It is basically a conversation, so there are a number or characters - well played and well directed. There will be no Oscars for acting, it is not that sort of movie. But there is no inadequacies either. All is very well and neatly done. And that is how it should be, because the action and the utter fascination is all in the story that unfolds. It starts slow. Then it at some point you think you can see where it is going, and it is cheap and disappointing now, you think - then it goes there (!) and lifts off and transcends many things, among them was my jaded expectation of where it will go (and sort of went)! I ended the movie with a new insight and a new questioning wonder of things I grew up with all my life. This is one of those movies that illustrates the almost forgotten wisdom that a good story is all in how relevantly it delves into our minds(hello dr. Jung!)and how neatly or well it is told. This movie shows up the emptiness of mere special effects. If you have a brain, watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie doesn't require a huge budget or an ensemble of stars or a heavy publicity to attract the audience. Sometimes, just the story/concept is enough to make a movie epic. "The Man from Earth" can be considered to be a perfect example for such a movie. Often treated to be a Sci-Fi movie, it can be better categorized as a unique blend of theological fantasy and mind games. The sheer brilliance of the idea behind this movie keeps the audience awestruck throughout.It all starts quite normally with an impromptu farewell party for Professor John Oldman by his colleagues. When pressed about the reason for his sudden departure, John makes some shocking revelations about himself leaving the people around both confused and amused. This makes way for an interesting conversation between them revealing aspects of John's life that are too hard to believe. The movie ends with a small twist which keeps you thinking for quite a while.The 89 minute long movie takes place only around one house. It is heavy on dialogue but it is precise and well written. Though there is not much scope for acting, all the actors have done justice to their roles. But the real hero of this movie is the writer Jerome Bixby. He has done an excellent job in materializing his ideas. It may hurt the religious sentiments of some sections but that is completely dependent on the viewer. All in all, "The Man from Earth" is a must watch for all thinkers out there. Watch it with an open mind and you will never regret.</fullReview>

The concept. Movie tells a story of a man who is forever young for 14000 years. How he encountered people,places in his really long life.The man who has lived for so long knows a lot,..and hence mastered the art of living. This may be the reasonable explanation for all the gods out there. You just don't become a god but its a journey. In the end he also believes that he's lost in this world of religion.He's the one who told us how to..because he has encountered most of these situations in all his long life. Yet his vigor and curiosity and his pain when his son dies in front of him..is probable.In my opinion the man who lived for so long can actually has any authority to tell others how to live.You have to understand this..you have to believe this ,because this is the most probable of all that there is!!!.Enjoy this piece of art,Don't miss this in your life!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film with no expectations or knowledge of what was going to happen. The title "The Man from Earth" vaguely suggested some intergalactic travels or perhaps a story about robots (?) thus you can imagine I felt a bit misled when minutes in I realized that it was a "talking" film with no action in sight. However, that did not dissuade me. I really enjoyed having a break from intensely visually stimulating movies. What really makes this film work is this gorgeously written story full of insightful ideas about religion, psychology and most obviously - history (hats of to Jerome Bixby for all that). Some of these concepts are highly sensitive though so I would not recommend this films to any type of hardcore fanatics concerning topics mentioned. All in all, this is a spectacular movie for those not dying for action or those looking for food for thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the truth is not true... or is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have often wondered as a writer, if it possible to hold the attention of an audience with a small number of characters in an elevator, so for me I love to see what I call a "compact film", one whose entire story can be played out in one location. The Man From Earth pretty much plays out in the main room of Dr John Oldman's house (and just outside) as he prepares to move on. Unable to fully or satisfactorily tell his friends why he is going or where, he decides to explain himself and he does so by telling them a story that initially seems preposterous to everyone, but gradually at the very least, brings their mind-sets into question. I was engrossed in this film from the moment the story began, as it is of a concept that raises so many questions, most of which are touched upon. Ingeniously, the validity of John Oldman's story is never really clear; we think it is and then something happens to open the question yet again. On that point, for me, it parallels the movie K-Pax in which Kevin Spacey's brilliant portrayal of an alien called Prot, is supposedly proved to be a delusion... but then something happens right at the end to leave it an open question. Was he telling the truth or not? We are left to decide for ourselves. Sheer genius; and both films are definitely on my favourites list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have made a good book, not a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm about as atheist as they come, and love a deep philosophical movie, but this was just painful to watch.The content and idea behind it was great. It would have made a great book; in fact, to really play out this idea would have NEEDED a book, not a 90 min movie. But the fact is, this movie just had far too many holes and was wrapped up with some of the worst acting I've ever seen in my life.OK, this was low budget, so I'll put the bad acting thing to the side right from the start. And sure, I understand we are not looking at special effects here; just a bunch of people in 1 room. That's not even an issue for me - one of my favorite genres is "people trapped in 1 room" But the story and dialog was just so unbelievable.OK, first; he hung out with BUDDHA, not to mention countless other iconic and powerful figures, either mentioned, or implied for someone who would have lived for 14K years; not to mention unfathomable numbers of "significant others" who he must have loved to varying degrees ? and never revealed his secret. Yet all it takes is single swig of JW Greens and he's spilling his life story to bunch of mid-tier academics who just happen to inhabit one iota of his thus-far immeasurable lifespan.At first, they predictably call BS on his story. Yet after a few facts spouted out of 6th grade textbooks they are now swaying to the on the side of believing him. There are some interesting philosophical points made about "how could you tell who is lying?", but as far as the viewer's story goes, we still haven't been presented with anything that makes us believe.He says he can't remember most of his life. Understandable, who can? But he quickly starts describing walking through tundra, forest, deserts, etc. Obviously he would have retrospectively learnt what these things are, given he had no scale of geography at the time he was there. But without that knowledge as a reference, how would his memory have been able to assign meaning to "forest", "desert", "tundra"? I mean, we aren't talking about a Sunday walk here ? this is over a period of thousands of year's migration. When does tundra become a forest to someone who has no concept of either, and is passing through them over a period of 2000+ years? He said it himself; only events of extreme importance leave an imprint on the memory.Then the old psychiatrist turns up. He's missed the previous 30mins of story, yet he's able to jump straight in and, in a comrade-like fashion, start asking deeper questions about Oldman's inner beliefs on life and death. No background convincing about the validity of Oldmans's story needed here?he's a believer, right of the bat. But wait, then the psychiatrist inexplicably becomes hostile and threatens "Either admit this is all a lie, or I'll put you in an asylum". Well, considering Oldman has kept this thing a secret for 14K years, this presents a real dilemma ? either stick to his guns to convince these worthless blips in his life of a tale no-one could ever prove or disprove? or just say "BAAAHAHHHHH, I gotcha!" Unsurprisingly, he chooses the latter.His friends again have no trouble switching beliefs again ? back to disbelief. Phew, what a relief! After a few perfunctory "WTF dude!", everyone is matey-matey again, like it never happened.But like I said, the movie had some great philosophical content. Primarily, what indeed would a "caveman" be like if given 14K years to live? It's true to an extent, he could never know more than the current progress made at the time. But all that back history, whether he absorbed even only 1% of it, would make him unbelievably knowledgeable. And if he put his mind into active learning, as we assume he did, he would be THE most knowledgeable man of the planet.Therefore, he potentially could be unbelievably rich and powerful. Play the stock market for 200 years? Damn, even just flipping burgers, he would have accumulated immense wealth. "Oh, but he has to give it all up every 10 years"; OK, even then, anonymous Swiss bank accounts ? hell, even burying gold bars in the dirt ? have been around long enough in modern history that he would have been the richest man in history without even blinking an eyelid.This movie feels like it was a book. If it wasn't, it should be. If it was, it should have stayed that way.</fullReview>

That's the start premise, and it's OK, we just wait for the logical consequences. The whole movie consists of a long session of questions by his friends, all of them scientists. My two questions to the writer. First: How could he get an academic degree? Since the Paleolithic he is too old for a formal education. Second: He's not immortal, so he could die in accidents, wars or plagues. 14.000 years is a lot of time, you have to be very cautious to not to suffer any visible misfortune.

Center it around religion, but ignore the elephant in the room,that humans are nothing more than killer apes with weapons; did he ever kill anyone.....how could he not and survive so long, especially the periods that he talks about.

		<shortDescription>Christians might be offended. This post may offend some.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoiler Alert*** The acting was well done and it was nice to see some familiar faces. About 45 minutes into the film, it changes from a discussion of a man whose lived for 14,000 years and his experiences into philosophy. John tells his audience that the Buddha was his friend. When asked if he ever met Biblical figures, he told his friends that he didn't want to talk about it. When pressed, he confessed that he was Jesus. Not that he was the Son of God but that Jesus really isn't a God and that he played a roll like many of the others that he has done. From a movie perspective, John doesn't really give the Philosopher-esq feeling that one would expect from a 14,000 year old man who walked with the Buddha and claimed to be the all wise Jesus. I would expect that some really wise dialogue would have taken place at this point. From a suspension of belief, it doesn't quite work. He's not like the Buddha; and he's not the wise Jesus of the Bible. He's just a guy. He's nothing special. Now if you were a young Christian, this might be tough to watch. Some of the standard arguments against the divinity of Jesus are used. Unfortunately, the move comes across as anti-Christian. I get where the author is coming from. Belief systems are based on many things and develop many ways. He might believe that Christianity isn't true. I have no problem with that. There's no material evidence that any belief system is true, that's why faith is important. (Here's where some may get offended.) While it may be easy from a philosophical perspective to say that the Bible was a bunch of stories that where made up, that argument falls apart when if you believe the Book of Mormon to be true. The Book of Mormon testifies that the Jesus of the Bible is the Son of God. For me, the writers argument falls apart because while it could be true that the New Testament was crafted and isn't really true, the Book of Mormon makes that pretty much unlikely. If someone wanted to destroy the belief that Jesus was the Son of God, they could attempt to do a decent job arguing against the New Testament. But the Book of Mormon also testifies of Christ. That person would have to argue against both books. I would have preferred that the writer stick to something other than going against Christianity. It would have made the suspension of disbelief easier.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading many of the other reviews, I can understand that, having a one set 'talking' script, it surely could have been done on stage or even as a radio play. Some reviewers seemed disappointed with the level of thought; as though it was one of those late night sophomoric, stoned discussions at 3AM in the dorm room.I disagree! Certainly the movie could have gone further and included more facts and explanations from John Oldman, but that would have been mostly unnecessary and likely only satisfying to geeks like myself. The acting was quite good. Any disagreements there I would blame on a few weak lines in the script. (Very few!)Those that disagree with the movie based on their own religious beliefs are a waste of time to reply to; they wouldn't hear me, anyway. I especially liked the central characters realistic sounding answers about NOT knowing some things that happened long ago. "Where were you last year on this date,' he asks one questioner. So many mundane details would certainly fade over centuries!How many movies, without special effects, dazzling sets, exciting action and great sex, can leave you thinking about the it long after it's finished?I remember Amadeus making me think and effecting me like that. Gandhi. Elmer Gantry. Nightmare Alley. A few others. This is another of those that can fascinate and touch you, if you relax and flow with the story.I've even bought a couple extra copies and given them as gifts to a few thoughtful friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you do not want to know about this film, please do not read any further, my review cannot be made without writing about the content of this film.So, here goes.This was a highly intellectual and literate film, it comes across like a documentary, like the viewer is a fly on the wall, when one of the actors begins tell his friends, who are all professional people, he has lived for thousands maybe millions of years, having never grown old, somehow he has bypassed the aging process, and this is also a matter for conversation between him and his friends.His friends reactions to his stories about the past at first flow between astonishment, shock, to anger at supposedly being duped, but slowly they begin to really take in and believe what he is telling them.From the outset they make statements, ask questions, are astounded, are astonished, are shocked, are angered, but slowly and surely they do begin to believe him.The ending is a twist you might or might not see coming, and it happens quick, so you don't get time to really think about it, but when the twist comes, you also might believe him, only to realise that this was a film, and not reality. The documentary, fly on the wall side of this film, may well take you in, you may well get sucked in to believing what you are watching and listening to is real This film is billed as science fiction, it is not science fiction, it is different to anything you have ever seen before.Based on the script, this film is full of facts about the past on this planet, from the Apes to today, and the film is based on one man's story that he has seen the lot and experienced much.I would urge anybody who has a "thinking" brain to make sure they see this film, because the very way that this film is made, and it's subject, throws up many questions for the "thinking" person. This film is not rubbish. It is very clever, because it will make you think about lots of things, just like it did me, hence this review, which I had to write.I will tell you now, that when this film finished with the twist ending, I was gripped to my seat because my subconscious had taken the film as a reality, it was my wife who quickly brought me back to the reality that this was only a film.

Is he simply, plainly mad and should be institutionalized? How could you prove you were alive in the Stone Age? Even if your own freedom depends on that proof? In an austere, minimalist, nearly monastic mise-en-sc?ne, the movie moves on an on, always forward, depicting accurately the questions we would ask to a man that claims he was just then and there, while Christ raised himself ?supposedly? from the grave, when the Cro-Magnons migrated east to the plains of Central Asia, when... The movie questions, questions, asks,asks... Just enough to generate the anger from those who think they have all the answers: the believers, the historians, the scientists. Fortunately, we don't think that way, and the movie shows us we shouldn't. Ever. Superbe acting, neat, nearly perfect tale-telling and direction, in a fantastic movie supported by an awesome script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget, interesting story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is clearly not one for those who are looking for a high paced action movie or outrageous comedy. However if you are a fan of story driven, intellectual films, like Donnie Darko for example, it may be right up your alley. It actually reminded me a lot of Twelve Angry Men, the entire film takes place basically in one room and you have one person trying to convince a group of others of a story, gradually they begin turning to his side. While this may not be an exciting thriller and the acting / filming leaves something to be desired, it does tell an interesting story and even includes a plot twist. The film does bring up some religious issues that may bother some viewers, however if you look at it with an open mind I think this can still be interesting to those people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beware; this movie may turn you into an Atheist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do I say about the movie, I have never seen something so short and simple (and not documentary) and yet so wide is its view that one can visualize the whole world with its past, present, and future. I bet you won't stop thinking for about a day after you have seen the movie.The movie kicks off with the sudden moving of John Oldman (David Lee Smith) and the gathering of his closest friends to bid him farewell. But one question is stuck on their minds -- Why was John moving even though he was well established there. After minutes of reluctance, when John answers them, it creates an outburst among people present there leading to a debate among PhDs in anthropology, biology, psychology, archeology etc.John's answer was another question as he asked them if they could imagine a person from Stone Age living 14000 years and still alive, how much he could tell them about the changing world. So the debate begins for everyone is assuming this to be a topic just to be discussed as something fictional. But the visitors are shocked to hear that John is the man they are talking about and that he has lived for 14000 years. His friends, not believing him though, ask him to continue with his "fictional story" which later unravels the mystery of him meeting the Buddha and later becoming Jesus.To the archaeologist's astonishment (Dan) played by Tony Todd, John had correct answers to each of his questions. The character of Dan has been played extremely well especially the sudden changes of expression from doubt to astonishment. Ellen Crawford who plays the part of Edith , a devout Christian, does beautifully the part where she is disturbed when she gets to know that Jesus was just another ordinary man who currently is her friend. There were times in between the discussion when people felt that John was actually trying to take away other people's lives and has so far lived for 14000 years giving evidence that his listeners had started believing him. His psychologist friend, Dr. Will, was even annoyed by his story as he was already depressed of his wife's death the previous day.Finally when the topic was going over the line John told them it was just a joke and a healthy discussion and not to be taken seriously. But while talking to one of his colleagues Sandy (who loved John and believed him) he mentioned being John T. Partee in Boston during 1940s who actually was Dr. Will's father which accidentally was heard by Will and he could not take this information finally dying of a heart attack.Direction wise the movie was awesome. Director Richard Schenkman has even looked into day to day details like phone calls, drinks etc. even though a serious topic was being discussed. Also, the movie brings out the important part of misconceptions from past saying that supernatural actions of Jesus were not actually real because he never had done such deeds.Generally, taking everything into account, the movie is greatly directed and David Lee Smith has done excellent acting to complement Richard. However I feel that the movie could have been a little more grasping to distinguish it more from a documentary and also the death of Will could have been directed showing a bit of more seriousness into that scene and hurriedly end it. For me the movie was 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you may have surmised from other reviews the story is the star in this movie and you can't talk about it without giving it away. It's best to just watch it knowing nothing about it except a lot of hardcore sci-fi fans recommend it as a must see.It must however be stated that the acting is a bit off in some parts; someone else described it as wooden and that's apt. It's a bit stiff in spots but it's not so bad that it ruins the movie but it is a bit distracting. I don't want to harp on the acting too much, it's mostly good, but it keeps this from being the 10 out of 10 some people seem obsessed with bestowing.I'd love to see either a remake with better acting or even better a prequel that expands on the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Give this a read before watching...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I generally like to know as little as I can about a movie before watching it. I don't read blurbs or watch trailers. And so with this, The Man From Earth, I had only in my head "Sci-Fi Drama, mostly dialogue, rated highly on IMDb". However, having watched it I think there are a couple of things people should be wary of before watching so as to approach it at the right level.1. This looks and feels very much like an American TV-Movie. Now, my issue here is not budget or special effects - I knew it had none. But for other non-Americans like me you need to be aware that the format, direction, cinematography and especially acting is very much of that style. It's somewhat... stylised and cringe-worthy. It's just something you have to get accustomed to.2. If you're a sensitive Christian, be wary. The film doesn't particularly hide it's scepticism of the religion. It takes quite a long, hard pop at it. I'm not saying it's malicious, but it isn't subtle, and it dominates the second half of the movie.As for the film... I actively spend my spare time searching for thought-provoking science fiction movies. I like minimal effects and interesting ideas that make you go "what if?". And as such, I admire this film for trying to sweep you along on the strength of a fairly unique premise. It is an engrossing watch. However, this isn't exactly what one would call 'hard sci-fi'. It's ideas don't go a lot further than the premise, and ultimately they do reveal themselves to have a definite agenda, which is sad and probably the source of such a high IMDb rating.The more you think about it, the less daring and intelligent it seems, but I would cautiously recommend it for people looking for a film of ideas.</fullReview>

The set of the movie is rather simple, and the scenes very easy to follow. The first thing that i loved about it was the fact that even though the scenes, acts, and all the moments described in the movie were not shown visually, the characters narration was almost like a novel, it just sparks your imagination.Another fact about it, that impressed me, was that, as i said in the beginning the set is rather simple, and the scenes very easy to follow, and that contradicts with the heart-breaking(for some), hard, deep, open minded and beautiful storyline of the film.I would give it a 100 if it were possible!</fullReview>

The idea, the treatment and presentation are so different from conventional commercial cinema that its amazing and unbelievable that something can be put up so simply and still be so thrilling. The movie is not sensationalised like Da-Vinci Code or even promoted like it and thats a pity as avid movie goers would find it more than entertaining, may be even food for thought. It must be one of the best sci-fi's (if u consider it that) and the makers have proved that no CGI or elaborate settings can ever take place of a great idea.

With an excellent story line, this movie creates its own impact. It raises questions, questions about everything we perceive to be so true around us and makes us think about a new meaning of reality. This work is the last of Jerome Lewis Bixby, who completed it nearly on his deathbed in April, 1998. This story can't be thought by an ordinary person, and it took him 38 years to write this story. Each line of the dialogue, is well thought and perfect. A must watch. It's intellectually stimulating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As an actor, I understand why the choices were made in the way they were and I don't actually fault the cast per-se. But, as well as this is written AND ITS WRITTEN VERY WELL the central character is, in the end, simply uncompelling. He seems blank at the most intense emotional moments and, again, I understand that choice but it renders the impact of the story tepidly. One finds ones-self unable to feel great empathy for John (the lead) and without that, the conflict seems contrived.The supporting cast is simply stellar and each thoughtfully and perceptively fills their position within the conflict in a truly inspiring way. Even the quieter roles make up for it in a moment of insight or impact. I don't see how it could be much better.To the lead actor - I wish I knew your choices had been determined by a Director. I could not sense if the aggravating restriction within the lead character had been written or directed. I wanted more.Mac</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid attempt at retro man genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great manuscript. As a science fiction screenwriter myself with a few credits, not nearly as seminal as the screenwriter's, however I am not that old nor were alive when potentials were different for this genre.It is clear the writer has been thinking about this topic for a long time, and it was difficult not to make it a giant narrative back story from the protagonist's, nay antihero's lips. Too difficult, perhaps.Surrounding the main character with experts close in relationship abilified to qualify his story, made this hard to see as more than a quintessential talking heads film driving the basic assumption, perhaps trapping the storytelling in maintaining suspension of disbelief rather than showing and not telling.I wonder if this story would not be better served rather than as a giant justification of existence over green label scotch in a cabin where character actors can really shine in ensemble than to have gone the other way in production value choices and shown the man's life instead of discussing it. I haven't seen the source material nor had time to consider fully how it may best be presented as entertainment.Showing the man's life of course, would have been a prohibitively expensive production consideration, so the filmmakers chose to do it in possibly the best scenario format consideration.So it was the talking head experts slowly censoring all possible encroaches to suspension of disbelief, a primary writing skill in screen writing. I believe, however, as a working professional writer in science fiction since the 80's, I feel this story would have been better served in another format, such as a novel or novelette, as the filmic storytelling presentation of this topic material is sort of flat and dictatorial in the long winded narration sense, despite the passionate words chosen by a master writer (no one will question the credentials or skill of the original master author) and the way they are performed by the male lead.Some of the qualifying duologue lost pace and relegated itself to the perspective view even when discussing topics such as death, birth, change, religion and relationships.I believe this was a case of a bunch of talented film people who found a great story idea, well thought out and superbly described with language and thought in an age of story suffrage in qualitative terms in the film business, they were so enthralled with discovery it clouded their judgment in aesthetic terms as to creative choices available to them to best serve the story in format terms. This would have been much better treated as story material in another format altogether, IMHO.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Garbage film sewing seeds into minds which will attempt to discredit Christianity. A movie for TV, SciFi? Low budget, stereotypical, are all the thoughts that went into my mind during the first 5 minutes. Unfortunately this continued all the way through the film. The acting is not of a high quality, the characters are your usual US / TV movie stereotypes (Professors / Teachers etc, the young blond girlfriend).This movie is not "so bad it's good". No, it's just so bad. I truly am astonished by the high ratings given to it and I had to create an account just to write this comment. I can't help but think that anyone who finds this to be intellectual fodder is simply lacking an imagination.I have no doubt that this movie will appeal to some -- fans of Dan Brown and Carlos Castenada -- but viewers who want to see a movie that grapples with the real complexity of human experience, or at least entertains, be warned; this is not the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where the mystery of aging is perhaps not so mysterious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who has not fantasized about living forever? Could we even hack it? This movie is intellectually stimulating, philosophically fascinating and medically interesting; and, it's quietly entertaining to boot. While watching, it occurred to me the mise en sc?ne - where a group of eight people meet to bid farewell to one of them, with 95% of the 'action' in one room - reminded me of 12 Angry Men (1957), My dinner with Andre (1981), The Sunset Limited (2011) and a few others.The stand-out feature is the script: written by the late Jerome Bixby (writer of Star Trek episodes and others), he explores the possibility of living for thousands of years and perhaps - theoretically - forever. This is not complete nonsense: other animals on this earth live for many hundreds of years, while flat worms and a type of jellyfish are in fact virtually immortal (according to scientific articles I researched).So, how would you react when one in your group announces he's been walking the earth for 14,000 years? How would you begin to tackle the truth of that claim? Could you prove the claim false? Would you - mortal, vulnerable, with limited years - feel angry, cheated, or thwarted? Would you even lash out to the point of wanting to kill?The actors do an adequate job of presenting that scenario as their reactions play through all of those emotions, and more. All the while, John Oldman (David Lee Smith) maintains his cool, calm exterior, adroitly fielding all the questions, accusations and admonitions. Hence, the script, as constructed, hangs together quite well. Towards the end, though, the discussion gets into the most sensitive areas of the human psyche - religion and spirituality - and presents a situation that will definitely offend many believers. And, if that's not enough to swallow, Bixby then adds an incisive twist which, given the scenario, is entirely logical, psychologically harrowing and cleverly convincing.Oldman, at one stage, says he's not a "superman". Yet, to live forever, or even a mere 14,000 years, would require a "superman" intellect and perfect body. Well, the first is already possible, obviously, when considering history. It only remains to be seen whether science will eventually solve the mystery of aging. I think science will.Given the subject matter and the presentation, this is a nine out ten movie for me. See if you agree. Recommended for all.December 4th, 2014</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not saying I'm a genius and figured it all out but I big lines I deducted what the ending would be from the very first minutes. And I was right, almost spot on. That didn't ruin the movie though. What did ruin the movie is that it didn't matter. It didn't make me think about anything. I didn't care if it was true or not. I did care if the other characters thought it was true, but the answer was pretty obvious from the beginning. Not much thought was put into the characters and I never really got to know them.The worst thing about this movie is the acting. It's all completely emotionless and it looks like they're reading everything off a teleprompter or citing the lines in there heads. On a side-note, I don't know if this was just a problem with the DVD but the voices sounded like voice-overs. Like the sounds weren't really coming out of their mouths in real-time.Lastly, it was WAY too serious. I love movies like this, people discussing something in one simple room. But you can still put some excitement or humor in it. None of that here, the whole movie was just a long monotonous speech of a few people in a room.</fullReview>

I tried to my level best not to blink my eyes as I did not want to miss a single second of such heightened profound intellectual exchange of historical ageless ideas. Believe me I am sort of an atheist. But after watching the movie I got up, stood in front of the mirror and asked myself "I look back and now i see i was in your hands the whole time, My Lord." In short I was rejuvenated, invigorated and enlightened.It surely compels you in believing in humanity and not in religion because the only religion that exist is inside of "YOU" your faith your hope your gratitude your kindness your duties and The salvation.If you are a kinda Action-lover, or enjoy jaw-dropping jumping out of the chair thrillers, i would strongly recommend you to delete it from your watch list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Concept, Low Production Standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An extremely low-budget, imagination-dependent work of ambitious science fiction, this is a textbook example of substance over style. Set at the farewell after-party for a beloved college professor, it picks up just as the departing prof announces to a small gathering of colleagues that he's been alive since the dawn of humanity. What follows is an uncut, stream-of-consciousness conversation between the confident subject and his bewildered, skeptical friends as they try to punch holes in his story and decide if he's spouting truth or fiction. The screenplay is a work of art, slowly gathering steam as the speaker's claims grow larger and wilder. At every step along the way, his audience analyzes the latest revelations from a variety of angles, working through their own misgivings and gradually convincing both themselves and the viewers that there might just be some fire beneath all the smoke. Sadly, the brilliant plot deserved a better production; bland, redundant camera angles capture a dozen performances on par with bad community theater. It's horribly overacted, with a clunky cast of misfits and journeymen that couldn't find chemistry in a high school textbook. Still, I can't help but wonder how much of the simplicity that fuels this project would have been lost in the hands of a large, glitzier production. Great food for thought if you can put aside the superficial shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good concept. Mediocre execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big fan of science fiction, I can understand how some will feel that this movie is "so innovative". Conceptually, it is but how they actually carried out the movie just makes it "so so" at best. I wanted to like this move, I really did. But I just can't.Basically the movie is one giant wanna-be mental circle jerk, with a bunch of folks sitting around in a living room. The constant light music background score was annoying. It would have been much better if they had purely stuck to using real music, being played in the background, as they did at one point. After all - it's a going away party for the guy, right? So why not have music playing ...One piece that particularly killed any hope of suspension of disbelief is the director's idiotic decision to take the out of shape and older Harry - the actor is 55 and isn't exactly well preserved, and have him make a mock attack and then claim that he's a 2nd degree black belt. Oh yeah ... black belt in buffet lines and lying on his couch .... maybe. Ridiculous.I could go on, but as it is watching the movie is something like "90 minutes of my life that I won't get back". So I'm not going to compound this by writing up anymore.Bottom line is that this is high concept and poor execution. It's just that simple.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this last night, and it is easily in the top 10 movies I have ever seen.This is a science fiction movie that involves a room full of educated friends debating the possibility of one of them being a 14,000 year immortal.The movie is very small, involving one location. With a premise like this you would expect to be fed Highlander style flashbacks, but they spared us that trope, thank you! It's exactly as big as it needs to be.The dialog and plot is tight, with very little padding. The relationship between the characters is established well. It's not that they believe John, it's that they love him as a person and trust him. If someone you loved dearly told you such an outlandish story with sincerity you would think they are crazy but you would hear them out.Someone finally went and made the movie I've been wanting to see for years!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing, and fascinating low-budget surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Streamed this one on Netflix, and to be honest, because of it's obvious budget limitations, I did not expect much. I am pleased to say I was VERY wrong (and delightedly so). This is one of the most mature, sophisticated science fiction movies I've seen since "Gattaca" 13 years ago. Think "Interview With The Vampire" minus the camp, the fangs and the gloss. There are no special effects, no big, epic flashbacks; it is an isolated, little drama that tells a tremendous story..."TMFE" begins with a university professor, John Oldman (a pun, as we discover), who is resigning his post and 'moving on' when his colleagues ambush him with an impromptu going-away party at his house. When constantly probed as to WHY he is leaving, John confesses that he is in fact, a 14,000 year old immortal (once a primitive cro-magnon) who moves on every decade or so to avoid detection (because of his inability to age, he finds it difficult to form lasting bonds with people or places). During the course of a very intriguing evening, he lets slip some incredible details of his loooong life (to the dismay and disbelief of some, but to the fascination of others). The story is told primarily in ONE room; in fact, it's more like a stage play at times than a movie. But during the course of it's 90 minutes or so, I could NOT take my eyes off of it. It is riveting. It relates the experience of immortality very realistically; John has no superpowers (other than perfect biological renewal of his cells), he is not super intelligent (he holds 11 degrees, but they were acquired over hundreds of years, and as he points out, some of his knowledge is 'very out of date' as some of his degrees were obtained centuries before). And of course, there is one BIG revelation that threatens to completely tear asunder his increasingly fragile relationships with some of his friends.If you don't mind a one-room science fiction drama with NO special effects, no CGI, a largely no-name (but very able) cast yet told with tremendous conviction and skill, then this is a movie for you (as it was for me as well). It also has one enduring hallmark of some of the late Jerome Bixby's work; a fascination with immortality (one of his Star Trek episodes, "Requiem for Methuselah" dealt with similar themes, but in a far more 'sci-fi' way). It also bears a strong resemblance to an old Twilight Zone episode called, "Long Live Walter Jameson"; in fact, it could almost qualify as a partial remake. "TMFE" is a remarkable little surprise of a movie that'll stick in your mind long after it's over. Kudos to David Lee Smith; whose 'John Oldman' is related simply and intelligently, but most of all, realistically. It would be easy to see how one could completely buy into Oldman's story based on the strength of Smith's expert performance.I plan to buy this one on DVD ASAP; highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely brilliant film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably one of the ten best films I've ever seen. It will hold your attention even though the entire film (well, 99% of it) is shot in the living room of an old cabin.I felt as if this movie could be even better if it was done live, on stage, a la "12 Angry Men". No special effects (and the movie has none), just storytelling at its finest (accompanied by a bit of spot-on background music).I've watched the movie at least a half-dozen times and appreciated it as much every time.Go out of your way to find this film; you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>soooo... i checked this movie out on IMDb before watching, all these film types say this thing is the greatest thing since sliced bread, so "smart" and so on... the movie had mediocre acting in my opinion, but the premise was interesting, wasn't a terribly hard movie to follow, wasn't very intellectually challenging, its just a good story, i would have like it to look a bit more "professional" - kinda came off as a film school project, or local access TV type show... but i rated it at 7 stars, because the story was a laugh, and watching the "response" to the story of the main char was amusing, again, i wish the acting or performances or whatever hadn't been quite so "forced" or phoned in maybe... that could also be because of the low end production though... its worth the hour and a half, it will definitely stimulate a little discussion afterwards over drinks - i just had to write a review because of some of the reviews i read crying about how "smart" and "thinking mans movie" type crap, its not, its just a good enjoyable movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good idea poorly executed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this being the first review for me on IMDb and furthermore, the first review I have ever written in a foreign language - I sincerely apologize for any assault I might to do it. "The man from Earth" did intrigue me, I must say. I read the synopsis (which in short words are a man revealing himself to be somewhat 14.000 years old and then arguing for his cause in a room filled with different specialists in different fields), some reviews (without spoilers) and decided to get my hands on the movie. At first, I was thoroughly impressed with the dialog and the effort the author, director and actors seems to have made in the name of authenticity; the film plunges the viewer in to a deep puddle of what is the vast sea of science. We are exposed to theories of "perfect generation", religious misconceptions and so on and so forth. And in that stance, the movies offers me a great deal of entertainment and critical thinking. I do believe though, and this is - for me - a VERY important part in order for the magic to work, that the movie fails in a utmost important point. On several occasions, the concept of "learning over time" is brought up and discussed, and the question of languages is at the table. Of course, if a man where to indeed live 14.000 years, he must know at least ONE language outside the English one. When he is asked this ridiculously profound question, his answer is "yes." And NO ONE in the ENTIRE films challenges that answer. He never proves himself to own any knowledge of any other language, and they just accept it. Supposedly brilliant minds just going "yeah okay, well.. that's fine by me."For me, that single episode ruined a, in other instances, fantastic SCI-FI movie. It lost all its credibility, and the film was ruined for me.Good dialog, decent acting but a big gap in character credibility.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect for humans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I have been a sci-fi follower--if not a geek--for about 15 years. That is, I started trying to read any good sci-fi available only after three years from the time I had learned how to read. I humbly happen to claim that when I see a literary intelligence in a work, I cannot help noticing--and admiring--it.If that literary intelligence broadens to such an extent that it makes one revalue his/her own vulnerabilities against (and endless questions about) the incurable temporariness of humankind, as this tiny in shape yet vast in value movie does, the result is nothing but a masterpiece.It's no shame that this was Bixby's final piece of work, because every writer would love/have loved to say such a genuine farewell in my opinion. This fact (and only this fact, not the box office hit counters) should have this particular movie labelled as Bixby's magnum opus.To say the least, the movie is: Good for all-time students, who are keen to learn on.Better for cinema students for it's minimality in making great use of little to none setting diversity and keeping it's focus on the story rather than mind-dazzling effects to keep the audience on the edge of their unbreakable seats.Great for linguists, Bible scholars, psychologists, anthropologists, archaeologists... (and more.) Amazing for sci-fi devotees who are looking for a good story rather than a laser gun in the first place.Perfect for humans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thought Provoking Attempt - Excellent Result</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerome Bixby's "The Man from Earth" is an astonishing tale about a man purportedly 14000 years old. I was blown away by the script. (Jerome Bixby is the writer) There are no heroes in this movie. It is the script that captivates you. And that's sad because, this amazing movie though extremely popular, has not made any money. In fact last heard, it is yet to recover the costs.The producers of this movie, Richard Schenkman (Also the director) and Eric D Wilkinson, made a passionate appeal on the torrents site ? encouraging people to go ahead and download this movie. If you watch it and like it, you are requested to make a donation however small it may be. I parted with ten dollars immediately after I finished watching the movie. Such attempts should be encouraged.Let me forewarn you. It is a science fiction movie only in the strictest sense of the phrase science-fiction. The entire movie takes place inside a room and there is no movement other than people shifting from one lazy boy recliner to another. It is actually a dialogue ? kind of a group discussion where the "14000 year old man" is subjected to a long, strenuous and sometimes scary cross examination by his friends. The dialogue is the soul of the movie.I will stop at this point as any more disclosures will adversely affect your experience of watching this movie. It is not without its shortcomings though. In a crucial juncture towards the end, you find certain complex schools of thought reduced to oversimplified notions and if you are deeply religious, there are chances you would want to declare a holy war on the makers of this movie. However, it makes you think and it entertains you completely. The objective of this movie, if I am not mistaken, is to captivate the viewer and from that point of view alone ? it merits a full five stars.My recommendation: Catch hold of this movie. If you like it, donate as much as you can. Let more such thoughtful movies delight us.</fullReview>

In conclusion a very original, intellectual (no special effects!!) science-fiction movie. The only point could be on the end, but it is OK as it is. I also very much appreciated Wilkinson's (the producer) reaction regarding "Internet distribution" of the movie: very intelligent too;-).

		<shortDescription>A very silly movie that somehow still works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Te overall premise of this film is very stupid to say the least, but they still managed to make a gripping movie out of it that attracts the viewer's attention. It's probably simply because there is conversation between intelligent adults, mostly about history. The acting is virtually non-existent, it's just one guy talking while others are reacting and asking questions. This lecture style really aids you to just go along with the story. Not much new is said in those conversations, but a pleasant insight into history, religion and such engaging topics.Said silly premise is that a young university teacher claims to be 14 thousand years old, when saying goodbye to some of his colleagues at a farewell gathering.Again, don't be put off by the silliness of the basic idea, it's an entertaining movie for those who enjoy mental stimuli.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie - even "true" Christians should watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few movies I can imagine to give a 9 (or a 10). For example "Bin Jip", "The Usual Suspects", or "Primer" and even "Matrix". Why is this little independent movie one of them? Because it is an intelligent made movie and it forces you to use your own brain - qualities only a few movies have. The discussion (here at IMDb) goes about the criticism of Christianity. I think this is not the point of the movie. This movie is only criticising people who literally believe in the words of the fairy tales written in the Bible. Not the idea behind. People who _behave_ like Christians, not just go to church on Sunday, can enjoy the movie because it doesn't change a thing to them. They will still care about social coexistence, still be nice to others and still always try to do the right thing. I suggest to take some time, turn on your brain, and watch this movie with friends or family. Maybe you can get a new point of view, a new perspective. As far as I can tell, the research for this movie was done very well. The actors a convincing and the setting is as simple as it has to be.In my opinion science fiction at its best!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can safely say that I enjoyed this movie, and, like so many others, I was seduced gradually by the flow of the story. The narrative flows forth very subtly and gradually, which goes well with the unreal story and the ethereal soundtrack.That being said, the story is the only thing that this movie has got going for itself. The picture quality is horrid, with severe grain, color inconsistency and poor light. Aesthetically, the scenes are bland and the camera work is dull, even boring. The movie takes place pretty much on a single location, which is admirable in a sense, but also fairly dull. Most notably, the acting is somewhere between average and terrible, and although the characters are cast fairly well, the lines are delivered unenthusiastically and monotonously. A serious problem for a movie which is driven entirely by dialogue!By all the rules, this movie should be a disaster. And yet it isn't. It's fascinating and seductive in it's simple premise. This movie is a fantastic example that a good story simply can't be killed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant high-brow film for the open-minded</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was recommended to me by a friend and i probably wouldn't have seen it otherwise. So i checked IMDb to see what it was about and was shocked to see such a high rating for a relatively unknown flick, as well as the glowing reviews about its originality and simplicity.The beginning flustered me slightly as the acting seemed a little off and i got the impression it was one of those low-budget indie movies that had a great idea but a sucky production. But soon enough, things kicked in and i was knocked backwards. Don't be fooled or misled by a relaxed opening as its definitely needed as a setup to the much more intense hour ahead.Wow.Make no mistake, this is a film about religion. It's a profound idea. I couldn't believe how intelligent the script was, and how they managed to cram so much high-brow material into such a small amount of time. It won't appeal to everyone and i suspect that it will leave a lot of Christians very defensive and unassured. I'm quite versed in the historicity of the Jesus Myth theory so it didn't phase me, although i was a little put out that the issue was covered dominantly from one side.The most incredible thing to take back from watching this movie is that it is about challenging your beliefs and opening your mind. You find yourself as one of the people in the room, questioning what you know just as they do. The realism of the character's reactions is strong and distinct, just as it should be. But good sci-fi is all about stretching your mind. I was completely drawn in by the discussion with the characters themselves. The science of ageing is fascinating in itself. It's a very brave type of film to make when the current trend is for SFX and event-based storytelling. All based just on - an idea.Compulsory viewing for every thinker, student and movie-lover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very rarely do I feel the need to write a comment about a film on IMDb, there's usually little point as the film is already highly acclaimed or a decent, thought not mind-blowing movie experience. However tonight I watched this small, minimally produced one room drama unfold and felt compelled by its conclusion to write something about what a throughly refreshing and stimulating experience it was.There are no car chases, gun fights, steamy sex scenes or overblown fight sequences on offer here. The story is confined to a small cabin in the middle of nowhere where a handful of people debate matters of science, religion, theology and physics. In short then, 9/10's of the population will be bored stupid by this movie.But that's okay, because this movie will never be a blockbuster best-seller, will never have (nor ever aim for) mass appeal. Instead it is a low-budget science fiction drama which shall find a niche among the cult crowd, a flick that is often talked about but rarely actually witnessed first hand, much like Primer from a few years back.The movie unfolds at a tremendous pace, not in it's rapidity, but in it's perfect balance between recollection and debate. As the story of our central character, John Oldman, a history professor who claims, to the bemusement of a handful of gathered colleagues, to have lived for 14,000 years, the film shifts gears and delivers several fantastic twists and moments which endeavour to confuse and even anger the gathered few. What starts of as little more than a perceived hypothetical scenario slowly unravels to become a heated debate, by the end of which, will leave the viewer just as exasperated as his esteemed colleagues he has chosen to share his closely guarded secret with.People have compared this movie to Kevin Spacey's K-PAX, but they are nothing alike. John Oldman is not a being from outer space nor a mentally deranged lunatic, he is simply a man who has experienced far more than the average human and is at a loss to truly explain how, or why for that matter, he is different. As his story unfolds he bats away many of the more inane objections with his own analogous comparisons, particularly focusing on the human perception of time in relation to his own extraordinary life cycle. The Man From Earth asks many questions and answers many more, and by the end you too will be uttering the sentiments much repeated throughout the movie: Anything is possible.</fullReview>

There are no car crashes, no love scenes, no nudity, not even any action - just one man in a room answering questions from his colleagues - and the story he has to tell is totally great.I especially loved the other characters in this movie, not because their acting was very good (it wasn't) but because they did a such a tremendous job of portraying the view points that I think the vast majority (99+ percent) of people who consider themselves 'intellectuals' or 'smart' people would evince if put in the same situation in real life. Directing was decent, acting not so great, the story, the writing was EVERYTHING.Even with it's flaws I consider this one of the all time best movies I have ever seen.11 thumbs up.</fullReview>

This is not a film you watch with a group of friends and a six pack.It demands your complete attention,it pulls you into the room with the assembled cast so you are sitting there with them,open mouthed at this most incredible story.I have seen at least ten multi million dollar blockbuster movies this year that have left me literally angry with disappointment.Yet here is a low budget,practically no budget film, with only eight people in it, set almost entirely in one small room,and it was one of the most satisfying and gripping films I have seen for several years.A picture is worth a thousand words,but several hundred words strung together in an intelligent and articulate way are worth a million CGI effects.Pour yourself a glass of your favourite drink,open your mind,and be taken on a mind trip of epic proportions.I really can not get this film out of my head at the moment.Just amazing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rare and captivating film that relies on good old-fashioned story telling, intrigue, strong character development, unique and unpredictable plot, and intelligent dialogue. Not a special effect within 14,000 years (I mean miles) of this movie, and if CGI bunnies with M16s were attacking the White House (they didn't), I couldn't have been any more riveted to the screen than I already was. The Man from Earth defines the term "sleeper"(ie. great film hidden from the public eye) and is a big winner. If you have an open mind and inquisitive brain, or would like a reminder that you own one, watch this film.What fills the frame during this quiet, unassuming movie are endless paths down a story-line that made my head spin as fast as those worn by the professors in the scenes--all attempting to keep their pseudo-suave acts together, but instead falling deeper into puddles of their own melting academic stoicism, intellectual superiority and rationalized disbelief. I was prepared to rip some of the questionable performances in the film until I realized that the actors actually captured accurately, the flawed and self-aggrandizing personalities of the academic characters whom they portrayed. Were it not for the uneven sound recording, often grainy lighting, and occasional continuity glitch, I would have given The Man from Earth a nine.In the best possible way, this movie's concepts will haunt me for the rest of my life. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I find the movie a tad overrated. Yes, it brings up philosophical issues, but nothing else that hasn't been brung up before or discussed almost every year by your friends. Immortality, religion, morales, imagination ... it's just done with a different twist. Immortality is already proved, it is our own genes that are killing us with our own gene-codes to prevent overpopulation and endorse evolution. We just haven't found the key to make it work yet. But HERE the movie takes a good issue : the morality of immortality. Too sad there was way too little on that matter. The rest is mainly old conversations / ideas we all have thought through at one point or another, unless you've never read a book. However, it was beautifully told and I really promote any movie that is entirely about philosophy and does it well, despite some of the ideas has been done to death, just with a twist. All in all ... with some minor changes, I would have given the story a 10 ... 2 points off for too many clich?s and not ENDING the movie philosophically! Should have left it open ... But again, it is a wonderful movie nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great SF Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've recently seen two movies that really impressed me. I subscribe to Stephen Hunt's British science fiction/fantasy e-zine: www.SFcrowsnest.com. In a movie review (http://www.sfcrowsnest.com/features/arc/2008/nz13093.php) one of their reviewers raved about "The Man From Earth," writing that "The Man From Earth very probably will be one of the best science fiction films of this decade." Well, I couldn't help but adding it to my Netflix list. With no special effects and set mostly in a professor's living room, I must agree this is a most amazing movie. It is a movie of ideas not action, so don't expect anything remotely similar to Hollywood. But the ideas and the way they are expressed kept me glued to the story and at times finding my jaw dangling.The screenplay writer was Jerome Bixby who contributed stories to both The Twilight Zone and Star Trek. The Star Trek connection is continued here with some of the actors having appeared in the TV series. I don't want to say any more as not to give away what's going on here. You can read the review, but really ? you have to see it! Visit my website: www.aadalia.com and its linked blog Wuxia Novelist!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"the man from earth" is a pleasant intellectual romp through absurdity. it is a nice (albeit slow) mix of Bixby's own "Requiem for Methusula" with equal parts "My Dinner with Andre" and Plato's "Republic."confronted with the news that their friend of ten years is fourteen thousand years old, we see the range of human reaction when confronted with the nearly incredulous: some believe, others reject, still others hold to a healthy skepticism pending more information. and that's what you get in this film... continuous gradual revelation. this is not the recipe for an "action hit." rather... it's a living-room conversation between friends as we try to figure out if the protagonist is insane, playing a practical joke or honestly 14,000 years old.if you are a fan of science fiction film monologues, you'll love it. the only detractions are some uneven performances by the cast. at varying times each of the cast members displays a woodenness, as if they were struggling to find that right emotional motivation. perhaps they felt duty bound to restrict themselves to Bixby's script as written? who knows?but it's a pleasant film, and each of the actors does come around to eventually give an authentic performance. so... assuming you like your science fiction cerebral, you'll probably like this one.honestly... this would have made an excellent radio play; simply listening to the film would probably give you most of the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this movie because I'm a sci-fi fan and it seemed packaged as such, but it quickly became apparent it was a low-budget indie film of actors sitting around talking all night.That being said, I loved it. The story intrigues and keeps you watching. There's enough good pacing, so that it lets us step back and digest a little and then get back into it.The lead actor did a terrific job, especially at the end. I believed him all the way through even when he was lying, or was he? What I didn't believe was the friends showing up at the beginning. It seemed contrived.But the ultimate high mark for a movie for me is "Am I thinking about it the next day?" Yes, especially on Sunday morning. There's a lot to think about here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome to see the art of characterisation hasn't deserted Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's make no bones about this, Man Who Fell To Earth is about character. It's a close up, one scene study of personality and the story is simply there to keep you glued to the emerging developments on character. So many film makers could learn so much from this movie.Highlights are John Billingsley (best known for playing Dr Phlox in Enterprise) whose portrayal of the incurable comedian Harry steals the show, Ellen Crawford's religious but three dimensional prude Edith and Tony Todd (best known for his creepy depiction of Candyman and as far removed from that monster here as Jekyll was from Hyde) as the open minded professor who wants more than anything to believe his friend's incredible story.This is also a risky venture from director Richard Schenkman and writer Jerome Bixby, because really, this is a play, best suited to a stage, in a theatre, in some London back road watched by an audience of long suffering bohemians who worship playwrights like Harold Pinter and think the rest of us plebs are worthless because we quite like watching TV and going to the movies once in a while.It's modern Alan Bennet for the masses, if you like (and without the Yorkshire accent). And boy does it deliver the goods.The is-he-isn't-he gameplay is sublime, keeping the viewer guessing right to the end. And therein is the only down point. The end. It gives away too much while leaving the story on a lingering point of failed resolution. The audience deserve something better I think, and I personally would have been happier had the final revelation occurred in front of all the characters so we could see their reactions and enjoy that ultimate conclusion to their harrowing journey. A bit of a cop out by the writer, methinks, but not a fatal one. Elsewhere the film still pushes all the right buttons at all the right times.A stunning piece of screenplay and worthy of an Oscar if you ask me, more so than most of the so-called award winning dirge on offer these days. Watch it and see the best our modern writing talent has to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful movie for people who enjoy thinking about life as a whole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie, my brain was on overdrive so to speak. I kept going about the general plot in the movie, and it really got me thinking.The movie offers a new 'somewhat unrealistic' perspective on science as we know it. Any man or woman should see this movie. The movie revolves around a story told of a man with an extraordinary past. The setting for the story is perfect, and the right atmosphere is used to create a brilliant movie.I sat on the peak of my chair for the entire movie, and before I knew it, almost 2 hours past. the movie built up rather quick to a point where your brain was about to implode from an overload of mystery, and dull moments were nowhere to be found. The casting was great, and the various roles played by the actors again added to an atmosphere that worked perfectly in the story setting.I saw the movie a few days ago, and I am still captured by it's story and controverse. Even though the story is somewhat 'unrealistic'. Then again, which part of Die-hard ever showed any realism.I am someone studying chemistry myselve, and have always wondered about science, and have had an open mind to all things that revolve around science. The movie catapulted me into a world where mystery reigned supreme, yet in a way that you don't loose interest. Too much mystery and you loose interest, too little and it gets dull. But this movie was just on the right level in my opinion.I am not the type to like the 'Hollywood-oh-so-often-braindead action movies', and enjoy the storyline movies, or just movies that capture you. This was by far one of my favourites. Only the greatest of movies can rival this one.Like I said before, and cannot say again. The setting was simple, the story even more, but there was a perfect harmony between both, the camera angles simple, but yet again in perfect harmony with the story. Little music was involved, but the constant telling of the story around which the movie revolved maked up for it by far.I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch a movie about something as serious as life and science as we know it, and has the rest of his evening left to wonder about what he just saw, trying to grasp it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a short 80 minute film that couldn't have been done better than it is right now. Completely surviving on the story line, the movie was highly entertaining and quite thrilling during many moments. Though i found it hard to catch up with some of the history and geography of the subject in discussion, i was completely engrossed in the movie.The best part with "man from earth" is it transforms every viewer into one of the people in that room. With our own questions to ask and be startled by the answers, i found it quite fascinating. Gave it an 8 on 10 for its sheer strength in story and concept.The movie though had its weak points when the discussion went a little too far reaching the realms of film absurdity(though one would debate the whole movie as absurd). Discussion on Jesus and Buddha were a little annoying. The ending though was not too surprising but nonetheless the best that could have been done with the story.I watched it once and felt like i had noticed errors in the logic of the discussion but soon fumbled and lost them by the end of the movie. The director succeeds in keeping the viewer glued to the screen for the whole 80 minutes and in all, i feel its a very good movie with an amazing script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A university professor named John Oldman (David Lee Smith) decides to suddenly leave town. His fellow professors - a biologist, a Christian literalist, a historian, an antrophologist, an archaeologist and a psychologist - see him off while also attempting to learn the reason he is leaving. After some hesitation, John proposes a story about the possibility of a caveman who have lived up to the present. He then reveals that he is the said caveman.The Man From Earth is a very unusual movie. It isn't about crime, suspense, adventure or action. It doesn't involve car chases or explosions. It involves a group of academians being asked to believe the story of their fellow professor that he is a caveman. What follows is a film that tries to convince the audience that it is indeed true. What I like about this movie is the fact that it makes you think and proposes life questions and possibilities that you haven't heard of. And that twist at the end ... you have to see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am glad people still have imagination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally, I wanted to say this movie probably gained more momentum from the whole Internets torrent thing than from the actual movie. However, after thinking about the movie for a few months (how many movies make you do that?) I am glad I didn't say that in the first place.I am also very glad people still have imagination. I'm not talking about the people involved in making the movie or the writer of the original story. I mean the people who watched the movie and thought it was good. The movie is basically a series of tracking shots of people talking and talking in one little room, yet I almost remember the movie as a big budget movie with scenes depicting John's life.Another thing I'd like to point out that John is surprisingly fresh as a character. You get a sense that he's grown past the trendy cynical attitude characters like him usually are. Even the inevitable (or even cliché or naive) connections these kinds of stories have do not feel very forced. You already are in the mode for accepting that kind of stuff when they are revealed.The whole movie could be an episode of The Twilight Zone (one of the episodes written by Mr. Serling, of course) but it works surprisingly well as a feature-length movie. I guess some of the acting is a bit uneven and some other director would have done something a bit differently but all that just adds to the charm of this movie. I have to say David Lee Smith was very good as John.In all, the movie is well worth downloading, watching and then buying. It shows a great amount of honesty for the makers to acknowledge the "illegal" downloading as a viable way to promote your product - of course, as long as the product is good. I guess the character of John also could be described as honest - there's this weird aura of honesty around the movie.</fullReview>

In truth I was amazed to find out that the film was created in 2007, and in truth only the Audi being driven in the final stages really convinced me.This film was breath taking. I just read on wikipedia that the author of the screenplay passed away, which I was extremely disappointed to see. The litany of people that Jerome Bixby influenced is only a hint of how great this film is.Situated in what appears to be a remotish cabin on a hill-face 5 people catch a youngish man 35-40 packing a pickup, obviously preparing for a journey; boxes packed and bin liners filled. The film is sly even from the outset, the hints are malevolently obvious, yet exquisitely seductive. This film tells a story that is a master-piece to behold and the director, cast and simple production (Not many films have the limitation of being situated in one room - but this just makes the film more timeless) as a whole will allow this movie to stand apart in time.Well worth a watch once....

		<fullReview>The movie is essentially a one room act/drama revolving around set of academics that gradually spins out of control over an astounding claim made by one of the academics - that he has been a Cro-magnon human surviving for the past many centuries and that can never die. Greeted with sneers and jeers, the discussion hits the rooftop when he claims his participation in key historic events of mankind. This leads to animated discussions surrounding those events and the viewer is led to a demystification of them by the professor narrating the experience. On one hand the script manages to hold the viewers attention to the last word, while on the other movie suffers from quite a few liberties and under-the-carpet push-over explanations to drive home the main theme. Overall the movie is worth a one time watch and post movie argument on the movie contents.7 for the efforts at screenplay and script and that its an independent movie production.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thanks for making such a sincere and interesting film. I wish there were more like this one.From an analysis of modern man staged 14,000 years ago, "The Man from Earth" is a conversation that sheds more light on the viewer's own existence than more standard fair. Utilitarian in that the movie, like "My Dinner with Andre," so many years ago, is nothing more than a conversation among scholars and friends. John claims he is 14,000 years old, and the narrative starts there with an excellent cast.It's kind of like "The Big Chill," without the gymnastic carnal flexing and catchy sound track (perhaps knowingly so as the director finally opts for Beethoven.) ;)Jerome Bixby is a favourite of 20th Century sci-fi canon, from Star Trek episodes, to the Twilight Zone classic "It's a _Good Life," that existed in pulp before it's triple views (the boy who put _them in the cornfield), also incarnated as "Charlie-X" for Star Trek. He was a master of the deft concept, and that skill is certainly on show here.Without giving anything away, perhaps it is more telling that a love of science and analysis that stems from humanist compassion still relies on _some_ absolute and "supernatural" truths despite the thorough treatment given under Richard Schenkman's direction, so I don't give it a 10, but rather a solid 9.The movie is provoking some meritorious discussion and some without, so just remember (to the finger-pointers down there) neither did Christ pick up stones and toss them. The movie is an allegory, so be kind to one another and try to learn something, please. :) Khal Shariff</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the few movies I've seen in a lifetime without all those special effects.... just a "bedtime" story. Great actors, although they only have to talk with there mouths and body. Just body talk and standard talk were enough to make this movie become supernatural. It's amazing that this story without special effects, without breathtaking stunts, car chases, special fights etc can make people "glued" to the screen. I must say I like special effects. But nowadays aren't we looking for just this type of stories. We are overdone with stunning special effects.... it's standard now. The characters were all played well, also the unbelief of the woman that he also was Jezus (in this story). Each character was different, but they all are (were) friends... To be honest I was a bit afraid that the end would be like a fading candle or with some special effect... but NO, just as the whole story it ends great. Gosh... wish there were more movies like this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes! This movie's got it: A great story. And thank you for not making this a cheesy Hollywood production with the usual cast, mysteriously just out of the hair parlor.The research has been done, a fellow archaeologist and student of the ancient Middle East will know this. The talk is smooth and with plenty logic vs. feel. The believer, the fanatic, the frantic analyst, the disbeliever is present, it's an all-round affair, everyone chips in. I was caught in the middle.I think you need something particular in you to fully enjoy this movie. Some doubt, some faith... a feeling that all in the world is not what it appears to be, and that truth is individual.What does it matter who this guy claims to be? How can you be upset? If something about this movie strikes you, look to yourself - something has been struck! But what? If you're angry, your beliefs have not made it across that river.A few glitches in the polish here and there, and a slight piece of (I feel unjust) self-authority towards the end made this a 9 instead of a 10. Almost perfect, guys. A gem with a small dent in it.I felt rejuvenated after watching this movie. I felt very strongly that not loving EVERYONE is failure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure there are chinks in the armor but this is as solid a movie as I have seen in some time. Stripped down to the bare essentials, "The Man From Earth" (TMFE) represents what is right about the art of cinematic expression. There are no special effects to lure the "Fast and Furious" crowd. There are no big name stars to sell the picture; instead, there is a compelling plot and a great story.Through it's compelling dialog, TMFE asks the impossible question, "what if every thing we knew about western civilization was wrong?" The brilliance of this question has little to do with the film and more about how we, as viewers, respond. Richard Schenkman should be commended for his beautiful adaptation of Jerome Bixby's vision.</fullReview>

The truth, when you come up with a good idea, get someone to write a script the will do justice to it, bring it to life and entertain, mystify. This was not the case, either the movie company ran out of funds and decided to carry on or the director was single minded and decided to do things their way, or maybe every one from the script writer to the director and producers were high on the best "pot". It ended the way it began, clueless. Thank God I was not patient enough, I watched it all in fast forward otherwise my tombstone would have read"death by boredom"</fullReview>

Allegedly he was the first person cast, and I am glad he was. While he may be best known for horror films and especially "Candyman", this is a man who is a trained actor and knows his craft -- let him do it. Here, he does it.This would make a great stage play or perhaps an even better radio drama -- it comes across as sort of pointless as a film. Not to say it is a bad film -- it is excellent -- but without there being any action or more than one setting, it seems almost silly to have a visual aspect at all.</fullReview>

I did not mind at all the missing special effects to underline the points or facts that they were talking about, even if it is a sci-fi movie. The arguments were so strong that I didn't want to reach the end of the movie. It was so good to listen and to think about the facts they said, that I had to watch it twice more and still finding new interesting details. The scene with Jesus coming into the subject of questions is brilliant, same applies for the last scene. Low-budget, only a few actors, ingenious screenplay, and absolutely mind-blowing result ....I just love when a movie lets me think about it for several days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clearly conceived as a stage play and not a film, The Man From Earth is actually a fascinating debate on sociology, psychology and theology. And for the fact that a movie consisting of nothing but dialog kept my interest for nearly two hours, it gets my respect. The dialog is just that well-written - it's not high drama, no, but it's high concept, and even if it's hard to believe in any of the characters, the debate itself is fascinating enough to be enjoyed throughout. The downside is that the acting, directing and especially god awful music still feel like a mediocre play. Still - for anyone who has the patience for it, I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>9/10 first of all, sorry for my mediocre English. this my first review.When the idea behind a story is this simple and effective, there's no need for great cinematography. The movie reminds me a bit of this Jewish tradition where students gather to argumentate (argue? discuss?) the writings. Or more humbly the conversations we used to have younger, sometimes after smoking funny looking cigarettes. Of course, there are flaws. But doesn't every story, no matter how great, contain flaws? Keep in mind that our whole intellectual evolution has been based on what if's, sometimes for the worst, sometimes for the best. The movie is more about storytelling than it is about dialectic and reasoning. about the creation of myths.So, don't take it too seriously, it's just a mind-challenging and entertaining story, quiet well executed.Its main flaw in my opinion is that it could have been longer and richer in historical references.BTW, the concept is as old as Christianity as it is very similar to the biblical myth of the errant (wandering) jew.I hope you enjoy it as I did =)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the modern world, Films come and go like a cheap drink...I firstly want to express the difference between a Film and a Good film. most films only show you a rehashed idea, something thats been done countless times and done again for shallow purposes... However a good film goes the distance, it thinks outside the box and it shows you an idea... A concept regardless of the cost (be it financial or visual).'The man from Earth' didn't have Explosions, it didn't have aliens coming down raining fire, it didn't have cities collapsing and it certainly didn't have a massive budget. But it was A fantastic movie. I cannot stress enough how good the film was. I myself have watched the film countless times and not once does my interest weaver.It is one of those films that will leave you thinking for a good long time and it will DEFINITELY leave you satisfied (if not mind-blown).In my honest opinion, "The man from Earth" is a Perfect example that even a film with a low budget and no fancy explosions can surpass even the biggest blockbusters around... My only fear is that films like this do not get enough credit, and that in future they will not be made...The world needs more films like this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man From Earth is a tale of a man who claims to have survived for 14,000 years. The film opens with the main character placing boxes into the back of a pickup truck as his friends arrive. He is cornered as to why he is moving away and without an acceptable answer he is somewhat obligated to tell his life story.Going in I didn't know what to expect, the writeup looked interesting so I checked it out and it blows the mind. As a viewer you are just as drawn in by the story as the characters are. Immortality is an interesting topic and it's been used before in films but never like this. The film is thoughtful and provoking and kinda humorous, all of the actors do a great job and all show genuine emotions people might feel if they were in the same place. Although the film came out in 2007 I just saw it for the first time December 10, 2010. In my opinion this film better than all of the dramas and comedies released thus far into 2010.</fullReview>

The including of certain elements in the plot (you will know if you have seen it what I mean) was really a breath of fresh air and I really enjoyed the explanations there.The dialog and acting in this movie was surprisingly good. It has a good, strong cast that really deliver their subtle and at times not-so-subtle emotions. I especially loved Tony Todd, Richard Riehle and Ellen Crawford driving the plot forward. These are three excellent actors we have seen in the past, never at the top of the charts, but still made themselves deservedly noticed.This movie is actually a textbook example of what the SCIENCE in science fiction means. This is a true science fiction movie, acted out as a drama. And the combination works extremely well. If you hate sci-fi, try this one anyway, even my (now, sadly, late) grandmother would have LOVED this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Sci-Fi, A movie about the way we perceive reality and possibilities!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie review in the sense of what you would consider a movie review to be, but a review into the way one person's perception was after watching this movie. It is a little insight into preparing you to see the movie in a different way than the way you may have seen it without first reading this. I try to look deeper and get something more from a movie then an average viewer would. I try to see what the script writer envisioned within his/her creative endeavor other then it just being a mere science fiction story. This gives me more appreciation to the immense talent of the writer and for those actors who could see beyond the script as more than just a science fiction story, but instead a story of classic human denials, acceptance, understandings and a real view into how scholars might view reality.This movie will focus your attention to a deeper level and give you insight into a few different pathways of thought. These are the type of movies that I have always enjoyed. Movies that focus your attention into the way we think and the way others will struggle to maintain a certain way of thinking no matter what evidence is set before them. A way of thinking that has been nurtured into them by society and the mainstream educational system. A teaching that most of us are familiar with that does not allow for expanding the mind outside the box of the so called norm. When we are confronted with something that challenges our intellectual premises, (which are the reality of the way we perceive it through our taught learning's), we then find ourselves struggling within our own minds to face something that we were never prepared for and had no prior data ready to deal with. This in turn turns our whole academic world upside-down, which then in turn threatens our intellectual beings that took us years to learn. It is like data fed into a computer program. The computer makes no sense of it without further established data to properly do its calculation and make sense of it all. So the computer rejects the data as do our own computers (our minds), with neither finding a logical place for it. It will try and go through its thousands of calculations, but in the end it will always reject it until more data is fed in to help create a pattern of norm that starts making sense to the prior programming. Our minds are no different with people trying to make sense of something that they never before gave any possibility that such an equation could exist. So our minds have no prior information to draw from (no prior stored data) and it is left with overwhelming confusion and self-denial. This can even lead to a self breakdown to the intellectual being of reasoning.What is logical to our minds is based on what we already know. So nothing can be logical because we really don't know anything. What we think we know becomes obsolete at some point in the future when we learn something that overrides, with further data, what we once thought provided the correct answers. We are always evolving and revising what we thought we knew in the past to new data which now becomes the standard, but we continue to arrogantly think we have all the answers. Science has a hard time acknowledging that nothing is set in stone and everything we thing we know will change and the answers will once again become new. So why can't science learn from their own history that we are in a continual state of learning and the answers we think we have answered and don't need to answer again will only be challenged as we absorb more data and the amounts of data out there will always be more then what we will ever fully comprehend. We evolve and learn based on prior knowledge, so the more new knowledge we learn will always conflict with what we thought we knew to only end up replacing it. In the end some of us realize that we really don't know anything. We are the observers within time and space who will continue to evolve by only keeping our minds open to all things being possible and what we learn today will require we rethink what we learned yesterday. However, without thinking outside the box we will be hindered in what we are capable of learning.When these people are placed within such a situation they have a much harder time dealing with accepting a possible reality then those who have always held open minds to all things being possible. When one has no prior data to draw from to reach a logical conclusion, then the brain will merely reach a conclusion of the situation as being illogical. Not that the brain accepts that it can't be real, that is only an assumption we make through our conscience minds, but only because it has not been given the proper data to arrive at any conclusions other then something being illogical due to the lack of data we have provided it. This movie, while still a Science Fiction movie, is a study into how highly academic people on an individual level struggle with denial and acceptance into a step beyond their world of perceived reality. The movie puts a face on us all too just how acceptant we are to all things being possible or how we limit our realities to a confined area within the box that we are told to never venture out of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man from Earth : A Spark of Brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man from Earth is an 87 minutes sci-fi drama that beautifully carries forward the legacy of Jerome Bixby, the creator of Star Trek. The movie throughout deals with questions relating to life, death, history, religion, philosophy and most importantly with the skepticism of immortality. The entire movie is set in the compound of John Oldman (David Lee Smith), a professor of history who is packing his things and leaving the town forever. He is unexpectedly joined by his fellow colleagues who are there to give him an improvised farewell and to demand answers to some of their questions. Oldman's audience consisting of Dan (Tony Todd), Harry (John Billingsley), Art (William Katt), Linda (Alexis Thorpe), Edith (Ellen Crawford) , Sandy (Annika Petersonn) and Gruber(Richard Riehlee) belongs to sundry professions covering various fields like anthropology, biology, archaeology and psychology. The stage is perfectly set for a grueling debate on the most ambiguous and unexplored topics ever contemplated by the human mind.The scene kicks off with one basic hypothetical question put forward by John that 'what if a man from the Stone Age was able to survive for thousands of years and lived to the present?'. Soon the discussion takes a course as everyone assumes that John's working on a fictional story and decide to go on with it in search of some loopholes in the tale. But everyone is left bewildered and confused when John reveals that was a Cro-Magnon from the Paleolithic era who has lived for an amazing 14,000 years and has had the honour and opportunity of interacting with Columbus, Vincent van Gough and Buddha. Then begins the sequence of questions and more questions from the group of intellectuals who try to test John in every field of knowledge in order to prove his astounding revelation false and absurd.It is this phase of the movie that tickles the imagination of the viewer and engages him/her into the paradigm of events which is complimented by both, excellent script and class acting from the entire crew. The subtle manner in which David Lee Smith (as John) answers the queries of his colleagues is a class act. There are timely breaks in the discussion like ringing of John's phone and the interruption of charity group to take away John's furniture. These lapses in continuity give the intellectuals in the room and the viewers to assimilate the events so far and have a point of view of their own.Things get heated up and emotions run high when the debate swiftly shifts to religious affairs. John is questioned whether he was a biblical figure in those times. Although John tries to evade the question but eventually knuckles under pressure and makes some startling revelations that deeply hurts the sentiments of Edith, a devout Christian. But John had an answer for each of their questions and even if they wanted not to believe him, they couldn't as they could not a find a reason to do so. The story has a very peculiar end with everyone departing with a confused mind and shaken conscience. The climax of the story is towards the very end which leaves no doubt in the minds of the viewers regarding the validity of John's story.Overall an exciting and engaging sci-fi drama that will surely leave you with many unanswered questions. Although its an extremely low budget film, its the marvelous script, superb acting and the intensity of discussions that constitutes the real essence of the movie. For me its an 9/10 and definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

While the acting and script was a bit wooden in establishing the relationship between the characters, when the characters explored the hypothetical presented by Oldman, the movie soared. I was absolutely and completely in the moment with the film.I had one complaint about the film and it's a pretty major flaw. Oldman claimed to have been Jesus. What a complete let down. It wasn't offensive and it didn't "challenge" any of my Christian beliefs, but it ruined the credibility of the theme of the movie. At most he might have claimed to have been a Secretary of State in Fillmore's cabinet or the first mate to Coronado, but Jesus, the most pivotal historical figure in all of human history? An over reach that nearly sunk the movie despite the most brilliant concept.</fullReview>

Filled with immaculate acting and tension-building music, The Man from Earth will keep you interested for its entirety. The striking thing about this picture is the fact that it's about a group of people sitting in one room, talking.

		<fullReview>When you see the first shot, you do question whether this is a movie worth watching. The first shot reminds you of a B-movie, done under $5000 and maybe based on a good idea but very badly executed. Wait for fifteen more seconds and you will think differently!From the moment they enter the house, you realise there is something waiting to happen. Something which has waited long long enough to happen and has decided that was the moment beyond which it cannot wait. John starts his story. The rest happens in successive exclamations. And as John's story gets more bizarre and impossible, it becomes more and more believable, truthful.Superb acting, fantastic script and very tight yet simple direction has made this movie astoundingly beautiful. Made on a very tight budget, you feel you have missed out on nothing. All the treats are in the dialogues, all the action is in the silence, all the humour is in the crackling fire and all the despair in Beethoven's 7th.A movie which makes you wonder about life, universe and you. A fantastic feat and a must watch. Also, a must watch-again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought-provoking; highly recommended!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man from Earth is a thought provoking movie. It is different from your everyday dramas and thrillers, since there's not much action - it all happens in the conversation.The premise of the movie is in a man living for 14000 years, his mental makeup, references, memory juxtaposed over a group of otherwise ordinary "professors", all experts in their own domains. He tries to bid adieu to them, in his true form, but they refuse to believe him, thinking he's taking a tale too far. He accepts this, only to get to the marvelous ending: The psychology professor is his own son; worse, our "caveman" has to see him die, as the professor is unable to bear the emotional pain! Despite this, the female lead decides to follow him on, brings out that perspective in human nature - I'll take my satisfaction now, and suffer the consequences later. Brilliantly done!The movie is otherwise minimalistic, and that probably is it's charm. It will be releasing on BlueRay on 2nd February, 2010. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best sci fi movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good Sci-fi movie has a big budget, great visual effects, big star-cast and a plot full of loop holes which the viewer ignores because of the former three attributes. The Man from Earth does not have any of that. The man from earth has no visual effects at all, no big star-cast and a mere two hundred thousand dollar budget. But what it does have is a brilliant story, which is quite rare for its genre. Its intellectually intriguing story-line with its apt screenplay and captivating script keeps the viewer absorbed in the movie, as he tries to comprehend and understand the story as it unfolds. Its a movie which keeps a viewer intellectually involved. And the twist in the tale at the end is quite remarkable. All in all, The Man from Earth is a remarkable film and its a must watch!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And it's not a big issue: but it's so sad I can't share it with non English speaking friends. subtitles suck and often kill the dialogs.whatever. I watched the man from earth yesterday for the first time, knowing absolutely nothing about it: I just liked the nice DVD cover art and it was cheap. I do that often. I really enjoy discovering a movie with a fresh mind, no pollution from teasers or critics.After 5 minutes, I was trapped in the awesome story. Scifi storytelling at its best: no need for expensive CGI, no need for a dumb young captain Kirk, no need for an explosion every 7 minutes, no need for a psycho bad guy, etc... In this true masterpiece, the story is everything (so much film makers forgot/never knew this).This is for sure one of the best movie I watched for years, and I'll try to make sure that all the people I know watch it. If I had only 3 movies to take with me on a desert island, I'd take this one.I want more...</fullReview>

I felt like I was sitting in the room with them.And at the end, when John and Sandy I think it was, talks, and John reveals he was Dr. Grubers father, I was just sitting in my chair with my mouth open...This is a movie I will strongly recommend for all audience, though it might be hard for younger people to understand all that happens.</fullReview>

It started kind of awkward and then once it picked up speed on thoughts and comments, I had to try hard to follow. I have almost read most of the history, religion and Eastern philosophy and could not appreciate better that someone can make this type of movie. Movie has its own style to lead you into a concept and then give you various perspectives. Someone became Atheist after watching this movie, I will not say it goes to that extent but yes if you are very religious you have to think again after seeing the movie from another perspective. I recommended to one of my friend and she liked it a lot, though she had to rewind couple of times to get it.</fullReview>

It's like a really good short story that I want to read over and over. I loved the looks on the characters faces as John's story unwound. The biblical references will more than likely offend most close-minded "christians". I was telling my wife about the movie and she sounded interested until I got to the part about John being in the bible. Blasphemy!

		<fullReview>I loved this movie. The movie wasn't put together incredibly well, and it was clearly made on a tiny budget. It won't win any Oscars, and not many people are ever going to know it existed. But somehow, this movie earned my respect. The way it is scripted and the way the dialogue is delivered, it allowed me to really get attached to the scene in a way I have not experienced in quite some time with movies. I was expecting an interesting but borderline boring movie, but what I got was a 90 minute thought experiment that was both thought-provoking and suspenseful. I didn't give the movie 10 out of 10 because I felt there was some untapped potential that could have taken the movie to the next level, but it was a pleasure to watch nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the best and original movie's I have seen in my 37 years of life... Now while I'm not considered an expert or hold any certificate's when it comes to giving reviews on movies.. I do consider myself worthy of a comment or review... and at the end of the day, it is just my opinion... What I can say is this.. Since I have been a child, and I am now to date of 2009, 37 years of age... I have seen literally hundreds of thousands of movies, and from all different genres... So after seeing that many movies, you kind of see a lot of movies that even tho they are different titles and of different genre's, most movies have the same sort of story lines or plots.. and that's fine, because it's all part of entertainment, and helps to get us away from reality for that couple of hours... But over the years there have been a select few that stand on it's own, and have it's own merit of uniqueness.. and I find 'The Man From Earth' as one of the select few that come to mind from the hundreds of thousands of movies I have seen... so that has to say something of this movie, if it can hold that sort of worthiness after all the movies I have seen... While yes, there has been other movies over the years that have touched on the origin of man or religious views... I must say there has not been one that has covered all aspects like this movie did... And to think we live in a day and age of special effects and big budget movies, and I must say I am a big fan of those.. This movie managed to capture my whole attention and then some, on such a small budget and simple location.. as much of the movie spends it's time in just one house or room... So for one movie to command such attention with such a simple budget and location, it has to be special and outstanding... This movie does get you to think out of the square, and out of what we are usually programmed to believe in culture, religion or about life... And the story line even included these sort of people that we come along in life, and consider experts on the fields of subjects that are raised in this movie... and while it is only a movie, it does prove, no matter how wise or educated we are... really how little we do know... and that is something to think about and pull us back to reality... and make us firmly grounded.. I could talk for days about this movie, but unfortunately this column doesn't allow such time or space... so my last comment or opinion would be this.. don't just rent the movie.... buy it...!!!</fullReview>

I'll assume everyone knows the basic premise of the film so I wont go into the plot.I really enjoyed this, i think its one of those things you watch and may discard, however over the course of time you might look back at it and think that was unique and different and you may appreciate it more than when you immediately viewed it.When i sat down to watch it i thought this would be the most boring 90 minutes or so of my life however, i think it was a well written script with believable characters, and a man telling a story that you really want to hear!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an excellent movie! Wonderfully woven around a mind boggling concept. The idea discussed in this movie is so strong and powerful that it did not need any special effects, or even the change of background! Yes, the movie is a discussion among a group of intellectuals(professors to be precise). I found the background score of this movie very haunting and appropriate for association with the ambiance required for the movie.The movie is a complete entertainer, there is thrill and suspense, in the movie, the sort that I have not experienced in years in any movie. It compels you to think, defy the idea, dismiss the incredible and stupid sounding theory and you search for explanation in the quest for which you start admiring how beautifully the idea is defended. This is the kind of movie that takes you to another dimension and question the myths, the realities and faith.I always rated movies secondary to books, in terms of how they can present an idea and can be intellectually challenging. But this movie has achieved the excellence in entertainment, it surely a medicine for your monotonous boredom!</fullReview>

So, they live in sort of "pagan" life, don't really care about tough questions like "where we came from" or "what happens after death"..So for those people this movie is like a charm. All the answers they'd love...But if you give it a second thought you'll see many holes in the script and even it'll look silly.The movie suggests Buddhism over Christianity. It quietly passes Islam and Judaism. If they never existed, if billions of people not believe in those religions and "if" many many books, schools, scholars have not created tons of knowledge about them.It just takes the matter so simple, this is not wise..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-budget masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jerome Bixby was a science fiction writer in the early days of American T.V. who wrote for some of television's pioneering sci-fi programs. Among his credits are the screenplays for "Mirror, Mirror", the episode of Star Trek in that alternate universe where everyone is an evil alternate version of themselves and Spock has a beard, and "It's a good life", the Twilight Zone episode where the little boy has absolute power and everyone is terrorized by him. When Jerome Bixby was literally on his deathbed he wrote a story called "The Man From Earth" which is the basis for the movie I will now copiously laud.The film version of The Man From Earth is a super low budget indie film starring a cast of actors who reside in that realm of semi-stardom where most people would recognize at least some of their faces, but only a handful of true cinemaphiles would know them by name. With no superstars, complicated sets or special effects to overshadow the story, the narrative is driven forward solely by the performances of the actors and the marvelously written dialog. In that regard, as well as with respect to the quality of the story itself, I do not think it an overstatement to call this film the 12 Angry Men of science fiction.OK, so what's it about? The Man From Earth is the story of John Oldman, a college professor who, after ten years of teaching history at an unnamed college, quits his job and prepares to leave his entire life behind with virtually no advance warning. Beloved by his colleagues, they meet him at his cabin in the woods for an impromptu goodbye party. He explains that his sudden departure is not some sign of trouble, but merely a desire to move on, but after some arm-twisting and expressions of sincere concern he reveals to them that he is, in fact, a 14,000 year old Cro-Magnon man who has, for unknown reasons, never aged beyond his current appearance. He explains that he moves on every ten years or so, when people begin to notice that he doesn't seem to age.The remainder of the film consists of Oldman recounting the details of his remarkable life while his friends, themselves highly knowledgeable academics, try to poke holes in his story in an attempt to determine if their friend is insane, playing a strange and tasteless joke, or if, against all logic and common sense, he truly is what he claims to be. At times this intellectual exercise resembles a dance, at others, a heated dispute. At all times it is fascinating to watch. More than once I found myself wishing I could have been present for the conversation so that I could have added my two cents. It is a testament to the brilliance of the writing and the skill of the acting to keep viewers enraptured for 90 minutes with little more than dialog.The Man From Earth is truly a thinking person's science fiction film, a picture that entertains by spurring the imagination and stimulating the intellect rather than dazzling the eye with elaborate special effects and testosterone amped action sequences. In an age when the major Hollywood studios turn out so much dreck, it sometimes falls to independent filmmakers to produce something truly unique and beautiful. For this I believe that the makers of this film deserve to be rewarded. I would not tell someone to buy a film without first seeing it, since that is something I almost never do, myself. But if you can find a copy at Blockbuster, rent it. If it's available on Netflix, put it on your queue. If you are the adventurous sort who buys movies you haven't seen it's only a small risk at $10 on Amazon.</fullReview>

As to how special he turns out to be , that one can judge by seeing the film . The man from earth is a story told by the protagonist for his co actors and retold simultaneously in camera for the audience .Its in such a way as to show that a good film can be made without special effects or scenic locales or maybe the director was plain broke . The way the ordinariness of oneself is perceived as a greatness for others stands out as the story unfolds . The film plays with the state of suspended disbelief of the viewer , deftly presenting both sides of a happening in such an exquisite manner that belief and disbelief remains neatly balanced until almost the end. The refusal of the human mind to accept and recognise a miracle when it happens and to remain content with fantasising about one and continuing to lead an ordinary life is a paradox that crucified Christ . The film makes us accept closure in continuity and the thoughtful viewer is left pondering over issues holding eternal fascination .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So nice to see a thought provoking movie, that could easily have been made on a negligible budget (and probably was!), while still commanding the attention of the viewer better than most big budged productions.This is because the movie was so strongly concept driven, that things you normally look for in movies (like strong acting) were of secondary importance. The religious discussion was fascinating too - in that it brought out just a few of the things about ancient mythology, and how it relates to Biblical texts, that the vast majority of people are blissfully unaware of. As such, the movie can be a bit disturbing to any Christian fundamentalist, but then again, some ideologies need a little shaking up.I very much recommend this for anyone with a taste for philosophical speculation, or just plain old rich imagination in need of nourishment.</fullReview>

In an atmosphere where the foundation of the plot is based solely on the actors, their relations, and stories, it rises to become the unimaginable, and stays at that level, to the very end, giving a magical feeling, like you witnessed something that no one else has.One room, with 8 people, where every character is essential, everybody is playing their roles to the fullest, always one step ahead, or behind, just delivering the question that was dwelling in your mind. The only film, that I have seen, that has a similar background is the masterpiece from 1957. - 12 Angry Men.I strongly recommend this film to all.

But to make up for it the story delivers wonder, hope, and intelligence. Not everyone will appreciate this film. From the outset that's a given. In fact, some may find certain elements offensive (what film doesn't offend someone?), but to many it will be a welcome stroll through a fantastic story. I would recommend this to anyone with a hunger for something different.I repeat, as far as modern film making and story-telling goes this is an aberration but to me and to many others I would bet, in spite of it's budgetary shortcomings, it is a welcome one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really a fantastic film. The SF genre has been overcome with visual effects, which I appreciate, but which also deny the viewer imagination. Particular sequences added music which alluded to a flashback that never occurred on-screen. This gap allowed for me to visualize the details, a value in story-telling. Anyone who enjoys the genre will be able to appreciate this film. The Star Trek connection allows for a degree of leniency as far as production is concerned (they could've if the wanted to). Being a person enthralled by ideas, possibilities, this film overcomes the independent film shadow, by applying a good storyline, rather than awesome special effects. It is my personal belief that a valuable SF reader/viewer engages himself/herself in context rather than imaging. Do you agree?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Definition for Agnostic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea that Jesus has been around for 14.000 years even before he knew who he would become is not just a "clever metaphor" or "the ultimate sci-fi", as people prefer to label this masterpiece. Man From Earth deserves far more than that. The movie is one of the most deep and unbiased analyzes ever made deconstructing religion and human myths in less than 90 minutes. Simple, objective, real, and humane, the film touches an universal subject with profound respect and subtlety.The greatest catch is understanding all historical facts and relate them as simply as possible to the fall of all previous myths and empires worldwide. The connection is Jesus Cron-Magnum. A mortal man who's been alive for 140 centuries and is getting older, 35 years in his life time today. The possibilities are groundbreaking as far as explaining ourselves to ourselves.Personally, I can't see a better definition for agnostic: a person who believes in all mysteries but realizes truth is one also. A moving, intellectual, and bonding experience that could be compared with some of the greatest films of all times, Bergman's Seventh Seal, Tarkovski's Stalker, Kieslovski's Decalogue, and Kurosawa's Rashomon or Derzu Uzala. Man from Earth, perhaps, is one of the most important films ever made and should create positive instigative discussions among people of good faith from all backgrounds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At his farewell dinner, history professor John Oldman asked a ridiculous question to his colleagues in the university: is it possible for a cave man to still exist in the world today? Being intellectuals, of course, they disagreed while keeping an open mind and telling him that nothing is really impossible. But when he mentioned that what if he were to tell them that he had been rubbing elbows with Christopher Columbus, Van Gogh, and even the Buddha himself and that he had stopped aging when he was 35 and that he had been in this world for 14,000 years, every single one of them embarked on an philosophical/psychological/religious/intellectual journey that shook the very foundations of everything they had believed in.Written by one of the best writers of "Twilight Zone" and "Star Trek," Emerson Bixby's script of The Man from Earth could not have fallen into better hands than independent or non- Hollywood filmmakers. This sci-fi movie does not have any special effects, audio or visual, no computer-generated animations, but it does nurture the very core of a brilliant science fiction: a resounding and masterly constructed what-if story. The story moves through the discussions among these so-called experts in the university as they question or try to refute the possibility of a self-confessed cavemen who has survived hundreds of millennia. Evoking their reactions, from utter disgust to awe and wonder to emotional outburst, Professor John Oldman's character tells his story with a brick face, casually expressing his past and his thoughts and reflections on history. He tells them truths that rocked the very core of their lives.The movie triumphs in its witty dialogue and very impressive cross-cultural juxtaposition of various moments of history and religion. Anyone who loves intellectual conversations will definitely be drawn to the arguments presented in the film. At the same time, it is probably inevitable that many will also be offended, particularly those who have rigid and firm religious beliefs and those who take everything too seriously and literally. I have always been drawn to films filled with conversations on strange ideas, most especially if the films pose a threat to the social construct or to what the general public assumes as acceptable and irrevocable. I find it amazing how a trifle such as a movie can change how one sees the world. This film is definitely one of these films: a simple story to be reckoned with.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am one who normally doesn't like movies where people sit around and talk, but I was sucked in to this story from the very beginning and never bored. Also, I thought the ending was very satisfying. The story just got better and better as it moved along. It even had a couple of big surprises. I have rarely seen a movie of this type that was so fascinating and deeply satisfying. Unfortunately, people with strong religious beliefs might find this story offensive because it makes strong statements about the accuracy of the bible. I have read some reviews that believe the whole purpose of the story was to attack the bible. The part about the bible is a small part of the whole story and fits in perfectly with the story's premise. If anyone just watches the first 10 minutes, I don't think they could stop watching it until the very end and would be very glad they did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imagine, if you will, that you're a 1950's agnostic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine, if you will, that you're a 1950's agnostic. You wonder, what would it be like if I had been born 14,000 years ago, and have stayed alive that whole time? How would I have survived, what would I have done, what would I have learned? And what happens if, one day, you finally decide to tell some friends? This movie is that conversation. If you like classic sci fi, you will love it. If you find that stuff too talky, this will seem boring and contrived to you. There are no special effects, there is no pacing, no plot points, and very little of the emotional development you find in most modern movies.This is classic sci fi in the sense it is the type of stuff that was written back in the days when any book with a rocket ship on the cover would sell 10,000 copies. I grew up reading this stuff. And I would guess that the 11,000 rating votes this movie has garnered so far (with an amazing 8.3 star average) were from people who grew up reading this stuff, too.Its biases are deep, but subtle. It appears to have explored every corner of human existence, and to be open, skeptical and forthrightly honest ? to an almost ferocious degree ? about the human condition.But this kind of thinking never explores the corner itself, or the walls, or the context of the human situation. It never says, What am I? in a profound, ontological way. What I am, what you are, to these 1950's classicists, is a rational, autonomous individual with certain wants and needs. Oh, sweet mystery of life ? there is none. What is given is rationality, is want, is need, and nothing beyond that. You're a 1950's agnostic and you've lived 14,000 years and you're still an agnostic, still cramped within this bittersweet ache of the apparent meaninglessness of life.I love the old-time sci fi writers, Asimov, Bradbury, Sterling, et al; they were my spiritual and intellectual fathers. But they only go so far down the path. And they have curious blind spots. I mean, really, 14,000 years, and you're still in the 1950's?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most thought-provoking film I've ever seen !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't write many reviews, let alone comments. But this is the one film that compelled me to leave a statement here at IMDb.I have a habit of checking the IMDb rating before watching a movie. I would read a few summaries about the film before actually getting them, so I would know what to expect to say the least. But this movie just blew me off. I believe the high praises here are would still not do enough justice to such a superb movie. It is just too unique and extraordinary and even these words are mild to describe the movie.To me, this movie is the pinnacle of intellectual and thought provoking films. The setting of the film is very simple, everything just happens in a small living room. All the suspense and drama; the entire plot is made up of a few talking professors in that room. The entire cast was just so perfect that it kept me glued to screen the entire duration of the movie. The premise of the movie is about a professor who is actually an immortal who have roamed around Earth for 14 000 years. This movie delves into topic such as religion, human emotions, human behaviour, history and art. The ending of it also consist a rather welcomed twist that made the movie a whole great perfect package.I really didn't think it was possible to make such a superb movie, with just such a simple background. Yet, the depth offered by this movie is so great. I just can't think of any other more words to describe this masterpiece; it is definitely a must watch movie for this decade! This movie is for: People with an open mind on religious issues, thinkers,amateur philosophers, sci-fi lovers. Recommended age is above 18 years old.This movie is NOT for: People who will get mad when their religion/belief is put up at stake.</fullReview>

We may know less now than they knew then. Ours, alas, is but one of the smaller universes in the vast metaverse.No special effects. No flashbacks. No crane shots. Just words, spoken very well by a crew of fine actors. The story is pure and the film is equally so. A minimalist painting that is beautiful from all angles.What a wake-up call and thought-provoking joy this film is. We should applaud until our next lifetimes.Bravo and thanks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie for open minded intellectuals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure most of the negative comments about this film break down into two groups: easily offended Christians and condescending science fiction fans. The first group is too close-minded to see that this movie wasn't an attack on anyone's values or customs, but rather a fantasy meant to explore the human condition. The second group takes so much pride in their superior knowledge that they're too arrogant too see that this movie wasn't really science fiction, it just uses a little sci-fi to suspend disbelief enough to explore an emotional topic.If you are a member of either of these two groups I wouldn't recommend watching this movie, I really don't think you'll get much from it. However if you have any curiosity in you about the origin of man and are open minded enough to explore some of the tougher questions, this movie might be interesting.There's really only one scifi plot element in the movie; the one that's mentioned in the tag line. It's the catalyst for so many great and puzzling questions. What if a man lived, not just through all of the history of civilization, but even through prehistory before the end of the last ice age? Archeologists and anthropologists agree that our species, in its current form, has existed for some 30 or 40 thousand years on this world, and in only the last quarter of that time have we lived in civilizations. What if someone could have lived through all the major phases of man's existence; through the exodus from the ice, through the establishment of the first cities, through all the known religions and customs? How would he survive? What would he remember? What would his life be like compared to one of ours? Would he have some great wisdom or superior knowledge of the world? Would he have had the chance to participate in any of our more notable historical events? How would people regard him if they knew his secret? In two hours this movie touches on a number of those questions, some which are obvious and others that are remarkably insightful. There are even a few surprises mixed in for good measure. It uses the characters to act out the various viewpoints and opinions we might have if we had to struggle to comprehend such an astonishing finding.By the end I was left with a good feeling because I felt as through its message was at my level emotionally. I even decided to go through the special features and commentary on the DVD and found Actor John Billingsley and Director Richard Schenkman's audio commentary hilarious.The participants in this film have a lot of ties with Star Trek, even though I really doubt that your average Star Trek fan would find it interesting. It was reportedly low budget but it's not noticeable. It's an intellectual film which can hold its own even with pure dialog. Some flashbacks to the life and times of the main character would have been amusing, but ultimately eye candy that would just accentuate the already pithy storyline.I give it a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a film this is not very exciting, but as an interesting proposition it is well thought out. I 'watched' much of it with my eyes closed as one does an audio tape. Made me think and not a lot of films do that. Chewing gum for the eyes as someone said. How could he prove his age: An old photograph? Yes, he packed them away, but nevertheless. A person he knew, a lover, from 50 years ago. He must have had children. A mark he made on stone, something he wrote on old material. I wouldn't call this an Atheist film because it doesn't refute any religious arguments for the existence of a God, but I'd put it in that general category, because it postulates human existence with the need for a God.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there was a man who could claim that he was a Cro-Magnon, would not age, has lived through 14000 years and he sat down in a cabin with a bunch of other intellectuals (teachers with degrees), would you want to be a fly on the wall? If there are movies that provide food for thought, "The Man From Earth" is a King's banquet.I can just imagine the screenwriters, sitting in a room or even a cabin, and as they draft the script for the movie they cross-ask each other what kind questions would you ask this Cro-Magnon man, if he told you this ludicrous story that he would not age, and has lived through 140 centuries? Many questions are asked and answered, and that gives the viewers a very satisfying feeling.I can understand the dangers of him spilling the truth about history. Regular people, not religious fanatics but regular folk like you and me, if we had our faiths shattered by the truth, broken in front of your eyes, would you be angry? Not that I'm saying everything in this film is true, but it's very interesting to try and relate with the characters. The acting is superb. The irony of humanity throughout history is repeated right in front of your eyes. I took one look at the message board and knew beforehand what I would find. Stay away from the message board until you've watched this.If you have an open mind about theories, faiths, philosophies, and life itself, you must view this movie. Get off this website, do not read the other reviews, there are quite a few surprises that could be revealed. Fortunately I had never even heard of this movie before when I found it in a DVD rental store, and I found myself stunned and awed more than a few times. I wish you the same viewing experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never paused a movie so often. Every 10 minutes or so, we'd have to stop the DVD player so we could talk about whether we thought Oldman was a convincing 14,000 year old. We talked about everything from historic weather patterns, to epistemology. The movie addresses historiography, comparative religion, and almost every social science and humanities topic out there. We even got into a 30 minute discussion of quantum immortality. This movie is so deep with philosophical, psychological, and sociological implications that, much like a Shakespeare play, there are seemingly indefinite ways to look at it. This is one of the best scripts for any movie I've ever seen.The only major problem is the acting, which is really mediocre. I've seen unwilling students in a high school drama class act more convincingly. With the exception of Todd and Smith, the actors really hindered this script by being really stiff and unnatural in all their reactions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most intellectually mesmerising films I've ever seen. And,for your knowledge, my wild interest in movies ranges from Black &amp; White to Colour, and from Comedy to the most pedantic and elaborate Documentaries. This is a truly as magnifying and evolving a cinematic miracle as it can get. It contains no trace of action and if it did it would have inflicted irreparable damage upon the quality of this stunning creation. Highly recommend it to those who can appreciate the art of human intellect.It is about a man who survives through a seemingly endless period of time. A man who has lived through centuries of peace and war, a man who has finally come to a point where he can no longer keep this utterly compelling secret locked in the dungeons of his ageless mind. The secret is about to be revealed to a company of dear friends and colleagues who were initially supposed to be left behind unaware of their friend's true nature.Join the mysterious man's company of friends in the most engrossing and captivating revelation of their lives. Fill a glass with something warm and relaxing. Sit down, let the story begin, and ENJOY !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Film But Misses Some Key Facts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strong film, very thought-provoking. Great discussion of the selectivity and murkiness of memory. Still there are weaknesses in the Bible portion. Jesus was a Jew and lived a Jewish life, worshiped Jewish festivals, observed dietary rules and Sabbath, went regularly to the Temple, wore fringed garments (talit) that Jews wore, and was punished as a Jewish trouble-maker. The film's portrayal of Jesus falls into an old supersessionist stereotype that is centuries-old: stripping Jesus of his Jewishness and criticizing the "Old Testament" as promoting guilt. All in all, I really enjoyed this film and only wish that the directory had checked out some facts. Check the Message Board for more detailed commentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard about this movie after reading an article about the director Robert Schenkman thanking internet video pirates for sharing this film over the internet.Thank John Oldman that they did.This film is without a doubt, the most riveting, most intense film I have ever seen. All without a single shot being fired, no multi-million dollar explosions and not a shred of cheesy lines. Actually, it's 1:27 hours of 6 or so people sitting around a fire.The Man From Earth was indeed, an intellectual film, with the greatest of insight. There was a scene which stuck in my mind about the discussion of Christianity and its links to Buddhism: I've spoken to a Buddhist monk AND a Christian priest prior to watching this film, and both believe that what is mentioned in the film may very well have been a staunch reality.This film doesn't throw anything down your throat. The Da Vinci Code, for example, gave you a story to follow - The Man From Earth gives you a person. There are experiences which he won't remember, experiences that are a bit hazy - far from a blockbuster script where the "hero" will remember every detail and glorify himself.The acting is first class, the director makes you feel as though you're part of the discussion. The first 8 minutes, for me, felt like a wait. From the 9th minute onwards, I had closed the door to my room, turned the volume up and sat hanging off every word.THIS, is what science fiction is all about. Not futuristic spacecraft, but of something which may very well be a reality, something which you can actually believe is real. The suspense the viewer is left in, right up until the final moments, is simply fantastic.I feel compelled to thank both the Director, Richard Schenkman, and the Writer, Jerome Brixby for what really deserves to belong very highly in IMDb.com's Top 250.For someone who is only 18 years old, I truly believe that I won't ever see another film as fantastic as this in my life time. It simply cannot be described, I only hope that you manage to find a copy, even if it be on the internet, and watch this film.I, for one, will be ordering the DVD next week.</fullReview>

What is truth? It is something that matches our belief system? Did the teachings of Jesus really have an element of Buddhism? Is the 'conflict' between science and religion? or is it between the scientists and the priests? or is it the conflict of beliefs? why do we hold beliefs so dear to us?

But tonight i just decided to watch it after all and man was I engrossed. The movie just pulled me in after a slow beginning.The movie is just a conversation between college professors during a farewell get together. And that conversation is the story itself. It dose not impress you visually with special effects or any thrilling plot twists but at an intellectual level and makes you think along with the characters.Enough said this movie is a brilliant piece of cinema thanks to the original story by Jerome Bixby and the performance of the ensemble cast. A must watch I will recommend it to anyone who can keep an open mind while watching. Im going to by the DVD when it comes to the store near my house.</fullReview>

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of watching this film. It had a lot going for it and what it lacked in commercial qualities was more then made up for with a thoughtful story and good characters. This is what thinking scifi should be like and not concentrate on blowing things up, but then again this isn't that kind of film..From the moment "John" posed his question to the last scene I was wrapped, so much that I watched the film in one sitting.Now I did mention a spoiler so here you are so be warned.* * * *I did find one character's reaction in the film surprising. The lady Edith seemed to get quite enraged when "John" mentions that he could have been Jesus, and while it's understandable and it seems at one point her head is going to explode. Wonderful acting on the part of the lady that played her..What surprised me was both her intolerance to this idea and at the same time her ease at letting it all go when "John" capitulated having seen that his story had gone too far and was upsetting all in the room. When he finally does call it quits everyone feels both relieved and frustrated and as they were all leaving Edith forgives him and that was the second bit of her role that surprised me..I won't say any more because to do so would spoil the film more then I have already but I think you should go out and see this for yourself and make up your own mind. I loved it 9/10</fullReview>

I had never heard of this film so I went online to the IMDb site and read some of the reviews.Most of the reviews were positive so I thought I would give this movie a try. I logged into my NetFlix account and started streaming The Man from Earth.The story develops around the following summary: An impromptu goodbye party for Professor John Oldman becomes a mysterious interrogation after the retiring scholar reveals to his colleagues he never ages and has walked the earth for 14,000 years.Right-off-the-bat I notice several things about this film ? it was low budget, the characters were poorly cast and the story seem pretty predictable. However, I thought I would allow the movie to play-out so I continued to watch it.About half way through the film the story turned into a "how to discredit Christianity" commercial. The writer of the story attempts to use debunked theories to prove Christianity is all a sham. The one alleged Christian character is portrayed as narrow-minded, backward nescient who clings to superstitions no matter how much evidence is thrown at her.The movie is boring, drawn-out and predictable. You can do much better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, here's the premise. A man, a successful and well-liked professor, doesn't appear to age. Seven years after showing up at the university he looks the same as he did before.By his own accounting he is about 14,000 years old, once a "cave man", but with a perfect biological regeneration system so he doesn't show usual effects of aging.David Lee Smith is this man, John Oldman ("old man"). His MO all these years, he has learned, is to leave after a few years and start fresh somewhere else. That way no one asks embarrassing questions. But this time, as his professor friends press him during an informal "going away" party at John's rural cottage, he explains everything.This movie is low-tech, no special effects, no scene changes, just dialog in this one place. The interest arises when we, the audience, examine our own "what ifs", what if that really happened? Of course at first no one believes John, but every time someone comes up with a good question, John has a good answer. Within the context of the film, the fictional script, John really is a 14,000 year old cave man now living in the modern world.</fullReview>

A man lived for 14,000 year is just a representation of our one concept and from that point the writer looking in to others reaction when they know what happened really. As GOD concept is the one main social issue the writer take it in the last moment and stop there.

		<fullReview>9 out of 10, just because there is always space for improvement, not because I found anything inappropriate.Decent is the word. No crime, no sex, the film is still an attractive one, deadly attractive. You can feel that living alone for thousands of years carved John a little bit sorrow, tired, but still with desire.I kept the DVD and watched it over and over again. Actually this is my first taste of Scifi type, and it's sweet. It tells you that the only thing matters is your mind, special effect, crime is not a must. After watching it over and over again, you may find Dan is a little bit annoying. I guess his role was to lead the audience and explain some idea. A little bit not nature, or just because I saw it too many times. Many characters will inspire you and encourage you to think about yourself. Is the old lady living in her own dream and afraid to wake up? Is it right to wake her up or leave her alone? Where will the relationship between hero and heroine, will they be happy until facing the fatal departure? What's the difference from your status? Too many thoughts, but that's the beauty.First time to comment a movie, words may be confusing, but it's true. To sum up, great film for thinking deeply, looking into life and yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have watched science fiction movies since the mid-50s, and I've never encountered a *better* one than The Man From Earth. It's extremely faithful to the nature of Jerome Bixby's story, and turns a talking-head movie into the SF equivalent of My Dinner With Andre. Astonishingly, it appears to have been made on somebody's pocket change. With the decent cast and screenplay, it shows that SF as idea and concept can be mesmerizing. As opposed to what we usually get when a well thought-through SF story is translated to the screen: an 'A' budget thrown at what is rendered as a grade 'Z' story. I can't recommend this movie enough to a true fan of science fiction, especially one who laments that SF in the cinema rarely holds a candle to written SF.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is remarkable that a movie can capture one in such a web of excitement without any real action taking place! the topic is really striking which enables the story to be told as if it was a mindgame. also, the dialogues are so interesting that one just gets caught in the rhythm of them. throughout the film one gets puzzled with every question raised and sees once again how history can be re-written. all in all, the movie is a successful example of its kind both as a histographic metafiction and a work of science fiction. it is a breathtaking journey that everyone should experience while wondering how things will conclude in the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting idea and I didn't get bored throughout the whole movie. Although set mainly inside a small house (a living room) the ideas and discussion are thoroughly thought provoking and slightly controversial, depending on where you live. Its a great movie to watch if you are into philosophy or anthropology. After watching the God Delusion with Richard Dawkins recently I like the presentation of ideas in this film. They are a great way to look at the way religion and history are developed by the perspectives of the people who are involved and then how those perspectives are skewed in the interpretation of present time. The characters took me a while to get on side with but once it got rolling it was gripping, like a book you don't want to put down. I really liked the way it ended too ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Above average dialog based movie. Well acted, well cast. My only complaint, not enough negative space, silence. While I like the dialog, they should have thought more before they respond to each other's lines, or they should have been a little quicker to step on each other's comments. More an editing thing than an acting thing. I would recommend it to anyone that wants to see a movie you don't want to end. I was first introduced to the movie when it was being filmed. John Billingsley (Harry) had come to a Star Trek convention, and he brought a clip. The whole idea was that it was intended to be filmed as a low budget movie. Mr. Billingsley told us that the writer the director (et al) wanted the real fell of a no gimmick filming. The ambiance of the quick shot, on location filming makes the movie work. Cheers. p.s. If you rent the DVD watch the behind the scenes featurettes before you watch the movie. I loved the long list of Star Trek tie-ins...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beauty of this movie can only be compared to the beauty of a great lecture in Mathematics, where in one hour, in a small room, an entire universe is presented by some lines on the blackboard. This movie brings up and thoroughly discuss a simple, yet deep and eternal idea, related to human life, human kind, the religion, the personal viewpoint on the world. The project is very well designed and invested, and I refer to psychology, arts and history research rather than money. It is a joyful journey for an intellectual and a mind-boggling "what if" game for any person. The whole movie takes place in one room of a house, with few people in it - no magic tricks and special effect you will find here. It might as well be a theater spectacle, which it definitely deserves to be.</fullReview>

As it's a low budget film. Though hang about for a few moments and it sucks you in.Though some of the characters can be slightly irritating our main character is a master story teller.The Man from Earth is as close to time travel as you can get. Before you know it the flick has finished and your left with the same satisfying feeling as one of your childhood Christmas'.

It's not everyday that I see movies like these.I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys philosophical conversations. It's one of the VERY few movies where plot overshadows visuals. It illustrates various belief systems without imposing. I really loved how it never told anyone to believe, but rather suggests endless possibilities.90% of the movie is set in one living room, but I'd only noticed this towards the end.

		<fullReview>I watched this film last night on a recommendation from my brother, i was told that "its the kind of film that i would like" being a huge mystery/sci-fi lover, so i decided to watch it. The film is set in (basically) one room only, with a man telling of his story - that he has never died, and doesn't age..he is the fountain of youth. His story is told to a group of scientists, paleontologists, psychiatrist, devout Christian and biologist. All who cannot prove that he is not 100% truthful and so just sit back and listen. The film reminded me of a similar storyline from "K-Pax" but at a different angle... i applaud the writer for this story as it is the answer to a question that has plagued man for an age, "can we live forever?". The main character claims to be over 14000 years old, claims to have painted with Van Gogh, sailed with Columbus, studied with the Buddha even maybe, just maybe he is not such an unknown character from our own Christian religious beliefs. Take the film as it comes in whatever way you see fit, but there is no denying that in directing the film, there were a million and one ways to play it out, but a simple link between writer, director and actors showed that a film with such a small surround can span the imagination, the world and our hearts. Watch this film, you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sci-Fi fun with no CGI!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's refreshing to watch a film and not be bombarded by the endless CGI that goes into film productions these days. With a great story, comes great opportunity! And yet, for some reason, most films in the Sci-Fi genre, either fail to satisfy or promise to satisfy and let you down in the last few minutes.In the case of The Man from Earth (2007), you have a fascinating story that pretty much takes place within one location and throughout the film you are intrigued and caressed into wanting more and more. And for me in particular, who has a weak spot for Sci-Fi and will often accept the dribble and last minute anti-climaxes of this genre, I was thoroughly entertained and particularly curious of where the film would end up.Well done to the production team of The Man from Earth and for movie making hopefuls out there, this is a film to study. Watch how the story is key and how everything else falls into place because of that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until "The Man from Earth", the last film that took place in only one setting (not even another space within the same premise) for nearly the entirety of its narrative length, that fully captured my attention was Louis Malle's "My Dinner with Andre". Sure, there has been a few movies in between that had a similar scenario, but somehow, they always end up compromising themselves in the end - adding some twist or "shock" value to reward the audience's patience; to give them a closure. But in both MDWA and TMFE, the premises were laid out in the beginning to suggest that there's no hidden surprises, and it gives you a choice to leave or stay for what comes ahead. Any emotions provoked come from the words of the protagonist, no embellishments whatsoever. In spite of the bad lighting, inconsistency in technicality, or some questionable choice of music, this film is a fine example of what a strong screenplay can accomplish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the kind of movie that grabs you at your intellectual level and challenges you to come face to face with what you know as the truth. The story could not be any simpler and straightforward than this. With only one location, eight characters and a very intense and profound conversation the good old story telling method is back.It looks more like a stage play than a commercially embellished feature film. John, a colleague among the other lecturers who consists of a Christian literalist, anthropologist, archaeologist, psychologist and biologist, is given a farewell get-together on his last day in his home. They were all curious as to why he is leaving without saying goodbye and without a credible reason.After urging him to tell them why he was packing up to go he reveals a secret far greater than they could accept. From an amiable confabulation among friends it gradually disconcerted everyone with the stories of his past and turned the gathering into a debatable contention.There are no sidetracking to this movie but a wholesome erudition of ideas and theories within the confines of a room. This could have been one of the Star Trek or Twilight Zone episodes where thought provocation is the basis of good story telling.Although it looks like a low budget movie with mostly unknown stars this is one of the better movies I have seen in a long time. It is written by Jerome Bixby who is famed for his contribution to Star Trek, The Twilight Zone series and the movie Fantastic Voyage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Up there with the best writings from my all-time favorite author, Robert A Heinlein (particularly his AMAZING story about a similarly long-lived individual, Lazarus Long in "Time Enough For Love"), right alongside one of my favorite reads of all time, "The Celestine Prophecy", and instantly comparable to exceptional movies of beauty, wonder and intelligence such as K-PAX, GATTACA, THE LAST MIMZY, and the WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW series.This truly blew my mind, after happening upon it during a chance P2P download of recent sci-fi releases, I really wasn't expecting much but within ten minutes was completely drawn in, my mind reeling and my jaw agape, eagerly anticipating the next upcoming revelation. I could write about this movie for hours and still not say enough, but I will leave it at this: If you even REMOTELY enjoyed any of the above, you absolutely HAVE GOT TO SEE THIS FILM. Even though I downloaded it (a technique I use to weed out the myriad of fodder films to find the true masterpieces), I will be buying it the moment I can afford to, and will doubtless pass the word on to many, MANY more people from here on out.Even though I wasn't even remotely excited about burning this to DVD and then putting it on to watch during a random solo movie session, I am now full of hope after having seen it, and am extremely overjoyed that I was lucky enough to have found this. It truly feels like it was a gift from heaven - and I'm not even REMOTELY religious (although I AM spiritual, and feeling vastly more so after this glorious experience).Simple. Elegant.

It's worse than anything I did at college - the acting, dialogue, storyline, set, absolutely everything is beyond laughable. It looks and feels like an amateur "straight to TV" movie.

		<fullReview>Well, I figured it had to be good with a 8 point rating on IMDb, as well as winning San Diego's Comic Con film festival and best screen play in Rhode Island Int'l film fest. I love thoughtful, deep, well crafted and scripted movies.So I plugged it in and I'm sorry to say but the reviews of this movie have to be rigged. The acting in this movie is beyond terrible. Go watch the trailer on youtube and decide for yourself if it looks appealing. The trailer acting is actually 10 times better than the acting in the movie itself. On a positive note the concept of the movie is actually somewhat intriguing. Unfortunately, the plot feel very contrived. If you ended up on this page because you are a sci-fi fan like me and were looking for good sci-fi movies to enjoy my advice would be do a little more research on the film before committing to watching it.</fullReview>

When it first started playing, I checked to see if it was originally in another language and only poorly dubbed in English, but no, its just bad acting coupled with horrible unnatural dialogue. Its almost unbearable. If you watch the movie put yourself into any of the listening character's place, imagine what you would feel in their place and you can see how silly their responses are. Just think, people. It's silly. Granted, the idea for the story is good. A man who doesn't age and can give his unique perspective on history as he knew it, that's a neat idea, but the people in this movie just don't act like real people. Here's how real people act: my friend says he is 14,000 years old, I say he's silly, he explains stuff, I listen, I think he's silly or I believe him. The end. I came across this movie while reading about "The Quiet Earth", watch that instead. Or watch "Hancock", if you really want to see a movie about a guy that doesn't age.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film that makes you think.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really made me think. I have seen this movie several times now on netflix and every time the discussion seems to get deeper and more magical, with a few twists here and there. I recognized some of the actors, John Billingsly I recognized automatically, Even though it's not necessarily a fast paced movie it draws you in. The basic plot is a "What If" question, that slowly builds and builds. There are no explosive special effects, fights or other hokum that are traditionally associated with science fiction. When John speaks you can sense an eerie depth to his voice that makes you want to listen, his voice and story draw you in.When I am listening to John I can kind of imagine my self in his shoes, which is one of the most powerful aspects of this film. When he talks of being a pariah among his original people is moving and well acted, as well as well researched.The fact that the other professors are sitting there listening, and debating the points makes it seem genuine, and reminds me of some of my philosophy courses from college.The professors seem genuine, kind of swaying between is he crazy, or is he sane. Some are willing to take that leap of faith, while others are mired in academia, religion and logic. The ending blew me away because of how well thought out it was and how it kind of came out of left field. The movie answers many questions in the end but one question still lingers in my mind "What happened to John after this event?"If you want a thought provoking movie this is the one to watch. I rarely buy physical media anymore but this is one I am sure to buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Religious Bible Thumpers Go Away // First part is a review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is intellectual, ingenious, I would say original, but thats only because its the first film of its type i've seen. It most certainly is my favourite movie ever. To look at it, you would not think it was that great, the entire film is set in one scene, the house of Jon Oldman, a group of people sitting in a room talking, there is no CGI, no action, no sex scene's, there is pretty much nothing noteworthy, but is there. There is depth, many interesting and intellectual plot lines, it is one big narrative, its a novel in all senses of the term but played out in a movie. The ingenious is that your imagination can run wild while watching as the incredible performance from the cast makes you feel as your in the room with them as they bounce idea's round the room. You might nearly find yourself shouting out an answer, forgetting your actually on your sofa enjoying a mug of hot tea.I will not speak of the storyline, it is something better experienced for yourself, all you need do, is imagine the possibilities.I know the plot lines off by heart, I know everything thats going to happen, I have watched this movie several times, and not once did I not enjoy watching it, not once was I not fixed and pulled in by the story even though I had heard it before.It may not be everyones cup of tea, there is no flying cars or magical dragons or space ships. It is simple, and yet it is deep. If you like having your brain massaged by thought provoking and interesting story telling, then this is definitely worth a watch. I would recommend everyone at least watch it once......................................................................**May Contain Spoilers** This movie is not anti-Christian, the fact that you bible-thumping cromagnums are "obhored" by the "attack" on your sensibilities is ridiculous. God is not real, it's as fantasmagorical as Dragons or believing there's been a Teapot orbiting around Saturn since its creation. However this is besides the point, if you wish to delude yourself that fairies or orc's or other fantasies exist that is your right, its called role playing, go nuts. However, you can't go and write reviews about how The Lord Of The Rings is wrongly portraying your beloved orc's. Its a fantasy and both sides are as correct as the other because both are fictional.*Spoiler* "He was black, he was Asian, he was a blue eyed arian with a golden beard, he was a blue eyed alien, he never existed at all, now he's a cave man." /end spoiler.Jesus, the bible, and all other religious rigmarole, its all fiction, there may be some basis in facts, there may very well of once been a man named Noah who built a boat and survived a flood. But anyone who has played a game of Chinese whispers knows, stories spread and told generation to generation down the ages can very often change. Perhaps there never was a man named Noah, perhaps he first came into existence in the mind of a mother or father telling his children a bed time story. The bible is indeed real, there have been many version's, and many similar books, records of beliefs written for many religions. It can't be known if any of the books stories have any truth in them, but the stories themselves serve their purpose to inspire or to control, depending on the wielder of the book.My point, don't bring your fictional points of view into the reviewing of a film, it doesn't attack you or your religion, it is merely an entertaining story about a man who has lived 14,000 years. As someone in the film says, "what a chance to learn". The story is not about trying to convert people to atheism, anyone with a logical mind can see it is merely fiction designed to control or to inspire, to ease minds (everyone will go to paradise after they die) or to control with fear (unless your bad in which case you go to hell). If anything Atheism is the scariest "belief" system (I use that term loosely) that exists, nothingness, after death there is nothing, when I was a kid this is how I perceived death, "No more power rangers, forever" The thought of dying has given me a sunken feeling in my gut ever since. Although now Power Rangers is not my consuming thought. Would it be comforting If I believed in Heaven, and after death my life would go on, of course, and in fact I often fantasise about being immortal, it is very comforting, but that doesn't change the fact that with no imperical evidence to the contrary believing that Death is not final, that this life isn't the only one we will ever live, is completely illogical and you certainly shouldn't give worldly possessions or your time to Churches to "deliver your soul to the afterlife" because they can do no such thing, if anything, people should sue them for false advertising.Keep the reviewing of the film to the actual film and don't go on about your views on religions like I just did, take the second part of this review as a "how not to write a review"..................</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The misery started yesterday, when a friend of mine said to me: "You just HAVE to watch this great movie!". Long story short - he owes me about 80 minutes of not being bored. I don't even know where to start. The actors - a nice group of extras from various series - you can clearly see the excitement in their faces that for the first time they will not appear in the credits as "the man in the store", but with a real name. Most of the budget was probably spent on the bottle of Johnny Walker green label, so I guess they were forced to record the movie with an I-Phone - at least you don't have to use a DVD, because in this quality the movie should easily fit on a floppy disc. I don't want to sound too negative, so I have to admit that, if you look very closely, you can even find some plot around the holes. As an example - Dr. Will Gruber (a person participating in the mind blowing twisted culmination of the movie), joins the group by pure accident, because a friend of the main character calls him, obviously afraid that the whole thing could end for them being buried in the woods. My recommendation: if you are going on a long trip with your car, take this DVD with you and listen to this movie - you wouldn't miss any of the atmosphere in an audio-only version...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>14,000 years old. He can't be can he?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group in a cottage are taken on a journey through the life of a 14,000 year old man who hasn't aged since he turned 35. He had everyone convinced, then admits it was all a story. As the group leaves, John confides in the one remaining woman that in fact it was all true. In providing her with some of the names and recent places, the story is over heard by an old man, a psychologist, who it is revealed is in fact John's son. The story was all true and was being told as the young man moved on, as he had to do when people began to notice his age. The old man dies of heart failure in his sons arms, and it transpires John has never seen one of his children die in 14,000 years.All through the movie, I wanted to believe him but thought I would be let down in the end by the usual American ending. In fact this is one of the best scripts in years. I saw the movie makers comments on RLSLOG. If only I had been able to see if on the big screen.As we say in Australia, it was a real Beaut! Utterly amazing. How on earth do people think these things up?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What comes to mind when one thinks of science fiction movies ------ UFOs, aliens, deadly venoms and their antidotes, gizmos, computer-generated graphics, insane budgets? And what comes to mind when you hear of a science fiction movie which doesn't have any of these things? And do any of you recall having seen a science fiction movie that is actually believable? I think not.The Man from Earth is such a movie. I must confess, this movie quite simply blew me away! When I first saw this movie, I wasn't planning on watching the all of it, due to time constraints. But as soon as it started, this movie gripped me like a Black Hole. I just couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. When it ended, I was left completely satisfied.This, my readers, is a movie that has brought back dignity to science fiction. It is a film that has forced me to ask myself this question ------ why aren't more such movies made? It is a great example of how great scriptwriting and great performances alone can make a fascinating movie. Jerome Bixby, the brain behind great television shows like Star Trek and Twilight Zone wrote the script for this movie on his death bed in the April of 1998, making it his last project.It is astounding to know that director Richard Schenkman roamed around for eight years with Bixby's script, looking for a producer. Finally, he decided to produce the movie himself and made it at a very modest budget of $200,000 US. The movie didn't make it to the theaters and was released on DVDs straight away.David Lee Smith is extremely convincing and sincere as John Oldman , the retiring University professor. The support cast, comprising John Billingsley, Ellen Crawford, William Katt, Richard Riehle, Tony Todd, Annika Peterson and Alexis Thorpe is equally fantastic.This movie will appeal not only to your eyes, or your ears, but to what matters most ------ your mind. It is for people with intellect, wherever such people may still exist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly thought provoking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this movie on a whim and put off watching it for a while since it sounded kind of boring. When I finally sat down to watch it though I was hooked. Yes it does seem boring at first glance; it has no action and is just a long conversation; but the topics covered are so thought provoking. I've never been a religious person, always trying to believe in the simple goodness of man. I have researched Buddhism and found it to be the closest I have come to actually declaring a religion for myself. After watching this movie and hearing the main characters' explanation of the origins of Christianity I find myself wishing that it really had happened that way. Whatever may have come of it, he made it sound like he was just trying to do the best thing. And unfortunately no matter what century or age he would have made the attempt in, I believe the end result would have come out the same. This movie may not have the quick enjoyment factor of a big blockbuster, but it will leave you thinking about it for days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have watched a lot of movies and hardly ever comment,if at all, however after watching "The Man from Earth," I was driven to change that.This is a movie that is not limited to the film it is recorded on, the sets and locations it was filmed on, the script that spawned it. This is the kind of movie that you get you ask your friends to watch without telling them about the story and after it is done, they have one more reason to call you a friend.The characters are extremely believable, and the conversations were very thought provoking. There are warnings I have seen for people to avoid this movie if they do not like their beliefs being questioned. the movie seems to be a study between belief and disbelief, when we watch the "harry potters" or the "Oceans" series, we suspend our belief system and take things on face value. I challenge you to do the same when watching this movie then challenge you to not be entertained.As I type this comment I am letting the movie play behind my browser screen. the movie works even without the visuals. it is a condensed ball of goodness, a refreshing take on movie-making, minimalist yet has the potential to make you think as much as any other movie possibly could.</fullReview>

Not a single special effects shot! The best piece of screen writing I've seen in a long looong time! Intelligent sci-fi at its best! Most of the movies take an idea and develop it to a story. This movie takes the idea and gives you a brainstorming session! Dialogue storytelling, questions and theories from different points of view - every time you thing "Yeah, but what if?" some of the characters asks just the question you want. I don't wanna spoil the story for you, so I'll only describe it as "Highlander" meets "K-Pax" I strongly encourage everybody to see this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like all fans of classic science-fiction, I was familiar with Jerome Bixby's writing long before seeing this film. Like Asimov, Roddenberry, and Arthur C. Clarke, Mr. Bixby stands among the best of 20th century sci-fi visionaries. The Man From Earth, however, rises further perhaps than any science-fiction film has dared or even attempted since Clarke's 2001, challenging the viewer with an intellectual and historical road map of part-fact and part "what if", and accurately presenting much of what most people believe -- Christianity -- as hearsay and rumor and gossip, revised countless times by the churches who stand to profit from our very faith.I, for one, am a Christian. I believe in God and I believe in Jesus Christ. Having said that, I believe a good percentage of what I have been taught from childhood to be false. Not God's word, but rather man's attempt to express God's word, distorting it over and over again throughout the past few thousand years. As stated in this film; the history of Jesus Christ parallels the life of Hercules, from mythical Pagan folklore. The similarities to their two lives are remarkable, so much so that had Johnnie Cochran been alive and well and practicing law so many thousand years ago, whoever wrote the first tails of Hercules would have had a dead bang case of plagiarism against whoever published the first Bible, with regard to the life and times of Jesus Christ.But The Man From Earth is not about God-bashing, as some on this message board have claimed. It is about thinking, about ideas, about stretching not only the imagination, but looking beyond the furthest horizon and asking what if? Fundimentally, it's just a movie, intended to entertain us, the viewer. I personally doubt there are any 14,000 year old cavemen teaching History at Stanford. But unlike so many movies, The Man From Earth challenges the viewer to think. It has been nearly a month since my sister and I first watched it, and still we cannot stop debating and arguing. My husband has declared Friday to be Man From Earth Day, and the past two weeks we have had friends and family over for dinner and then we all watch the movie, and then we all talk about it, sometimes pretty loudly. Last Friday, we argued almost as much as the people in the movie, one couple didn't leave until two in the morning! Tonight my Father In-Law is coming over for dinner and a movie, and I am apprehensive to say the least, as he is a devout fundamentalist.My highest praise to Mr. Bixby, and to everyone else responsible for making this wonderful wonderful film. I cannot remember the last time I wished to have been in the shoes of a character, to participate in the story I was watching. The Man From Earth certainly is not for everyone, as there are no special effects, no car chases, no explosions, no nudity and no big name stars, and considering the mentality of religion, people across the globe still killing each other to this day in the name of their Gods, The Man From Earth is not for self-righteous intolerant individuals too trapped by their own self-importance to simply open their minds and ask a question or two. I still pray, I still believe. But not quite so blindly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really, really great film! After watching it I spent a lot of time reading the reviews and could not understand some of the negative ones.Just to qualify what I mean by not being able to understand these negative reviews: these reviewers have no sense of what is meant by suspension of disbelief. Further, I just do not understand reviewers who open their reviews claiming to be 'scientists' and 'academics', followed by critiquing this film for it's engagement and open approach to Christianity and it attempts to spark philosophical ideas and debates in it's viewers.Almost all of the scholarly references to Christianity made in the film are nearly bang on with regards to their accuracy to debates amongst practising theologians and philosophers?even the Buddhist connotations and influences have been picked upon by scholars many times before.Other's who make comment that this 'sci-fi' film has no 'action', well you are going to have to look elsewhere for entertainment of this kind. This film never claimed to be that sort of movie and I find criticisms of this type, hard to justify and maintain.However, if you are the type of person that likes to have thoughts provoked inside of you and prefers a film to engage you on an intellectual level, then this film is definitely for you.That said, such a recommendation comes with the proviso that you are not overly familiar with some of the themes touched upon in this movie; as sometimes familiarity can be mistaken and lead to a film such as this, being experienced as an exercise in 'dumbing down'.</fullReview>

The biggest part of the movies takes place in his living room on day before he moves on. I've watched this movie 3 times in 2 days without getting bored. A movie that makes you think.It's a good example of a movie that follows the principle of KISS, Keep It Simple Stupid. No need for explosions, pursuits, blood, etc. And still, it keeps the attention of the audience every single minute.I wonder why nobody else came up with something like this earlier.

		<fullReview>This is simply one of the best sci-fi or let along best scripted movie appeared (so far) in the 21st century. Well made and well shoot, this movie has no special effects, not laser cannons, it all focus on one simple idea: What do you do with some one who claim to have lived for thousands of years! It wasn't that others didn't came up with similar concepts, it was the way this movie has revealed the concept in such plain, simple conversations and human interactions, that it captures audience with the ideas, thoughts naturally. It's shine point was highly accessible. Anyone who believe their thoughts and philosophy aren't dictated by doctrine should watch this film. As for some of the controversial concepts raised in this movie, it matches what I have read from source which tries to explain things without resolving the miracle of god. An open mind is required for some to take the idea. But see that as a logical way to explain certain things, just as between creation and evolution, which creation supporters puts their case. OH! Confused over what I was talking about? Go watch the movie! Good films and good stories should be promoted. I wonder if there is a director's cut that throws an hour more...Story / Script: 10/10 Ideas / Concept: 9/10 Acting/Directing: 9/10 Educational value: 10/10</fullReview>

The story sucks you in like "a black hole", and provokes your curiosity in such a way that you are given an experience that can't be explained to another person, only experienced through personal progression. (Similair to finding the one place/action that gives you total serenity.. the feeling that "nothing matters in the world, only that you are here in this instance enjoying every bit of it" - i get it from surfing personally)10/10 in my book.(note: I'm 20 years old and a surfer, making bad grades in college and living from party to party...

		<fullReview>I bought a big flat screen TV recently to enjoy one of my favourite things to do; Watch a story unfold and see the world in another perspective. Poëms, lyrics, novels or movies, they all serve the purpose of killing excess time in a comfortable way. This morning i decided, though really pressed for time, to see if my download (my bad) played at all. So i sat with my cig in the kitchen at my computer and double clicked. What can one expect from a movie called "the man from earth"? Aren't we all from earth? Did this title give away a lack of creativity, or was there some intricate deeper meaning to it? Interesting... The clock is 3 feet to my right, but not a moment i could get myself to look at it. This movie grabbed me and still doesn't let go...Now who said you need many millions to make a great movie? This one proves them wrong. The story is simple, yet brilliant. The actors are not the best known, yet superb. The setting is so cheap, they even take out the furniture while the movie is being shot. Its almost funny even, though you forget to laugh because it keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat, trying to make sure you don't miss a sentence, a tear, or a grin."What if?" is the pre-acting question of our curiosity that drives our intellect and therefor always a great concept to use in any form of art. Now combine this with a second great concept of creating art; moving, or displacing and you have the story that is worth telling. This movie follows these principles and hits you right between the eyes. No need for car chases or big explosions, it could have been shot anywhere, with anything, and with basically anyone who can remember his lines and feels them.Now i praise this movie, but try not to expect anything. Just sit and let it take you as if it were just some friends that come over and someone tells a boring story, that in the end turned out...If you like Desperate Housewives Flying High this is not your type of movie. If you like science, possibility and are genuinely open minded this will blow you away.The only thing i regret about this movie is that i didn't watch it on my big flat screen TV...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those of us who have grown up reading and loving real Science Fiction recognize this story. It's that short story that you wake up at 4AM and finish. It's that story that just turns your whole way of thinking upside-down. It's the story that changes how you think about the world around you, what it is, what it was, and most importantly, what it *could be* in the future.And it did it all with a great story, great characters, and almost no special effects. In one room.I could look at this story in retrospect and talk about the plot, about the "coincidence" of having a Religious Nut, a Psychiatrist, a Biologist, and an Anthropologist all in one room together, but I never thought about this for a moment during the movie. It was smooth. The characters were believable, and awkward at times. The conversations were rapid-fire, and then stilted. The story was all the better for it.This movie deserves all the ratings it's getting here, and more. I am afraid most closed-minded religious sorts are going to give this movie 1 out of 10. Fortunately, this is a real "Thinkers" movie, and I do believe the thinkers among us will keep the ratings up where they belong. This is the best movie I've seen this year, by a longshot.</fullReview>

I will also buy DVD on nearest occasion. This one definitely deserves this and more. "The Man from Earth" reminded me a little bit "K-Pax". Both movies research human believes and cognition system. It's difficult to tell anything more about this film and not to reveal any plot information. If you are that kind of person who is prepared to think while watching the movie - you probably will like it. Deep, involving story, good screenplay and comparably good acting - this makes "The Man from Earth" probably the best movie of this year. Just don't expect any special effects.

When I was awake, I heard lots of pop concepts and country club "smartest guy in the room" theories, none of which reflect any serious scholarship.Eventually, the humanist, non-religious progressives are proved right by the caveman's recollections, while the narrow Christians go away whimpering, but not before demanding he retract his entire story! (closing their eyes to the truth, you see). If there was ever a more clichéd portrayal of Christianity or religion in general, I haven't seen it. Moreover, I'm astonished at how many rate this movie so high when I wouldn't even call it a movie. It's more like a Saturday afternoon PBS special. And that they're so satisfied by lazy science baffles me.As a movie, there is no action, no climax, no palpable conflict that you can sink your teeth into, and no character development. It's a seminar on how liberal science and humanities department faculty see the world, and it's zenith, make no mistake, is that they were right all along, and religion is a phony invention of the weak. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this purely on the strength of the amazing reviews is gets here having never heard of it before.Now I feel pretty silly for paying money to see such an atrocious film. If you want to see paper-thin characters behaving in an inexplicable manner then this is the film for you. Could perhaps be a moderately interesting premise but it's killed stone dead by the poor execution. 8/10? I could have believed 5 or 6 perhaps tops. But 8..? And no, I was not expecting a slick, action packed movie. I was expecting something well acted and engaging. Very very disappointed. Save your money folks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rate this as my number one worst movie of all time. It's about a room full of people smelling their own farts, which is the only thing the writer and director managed to successfully get across to the viewer. I even listened to the directors commentary to see if they could explain themselves but the only thing they prove is how they could be real life characters in this movie. I've seen the word pseudo-intellectual in several of these reviews and that couldn't be more spot on. This movie tries to be way too smart for it's own good. The only way I would recommend this film is if someone needed the definition for pseudo-intellectual.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There must be an error at IMDb. I looked for good sci-fi movies and found this extremely overrated and absolutely forgettable TV movie.What in Earth makes The man on Earth worth being watched? There is nothing remarkable in the film, just a bit curious story that could fit well in a 10 min. short, not this boring film.It is a kind of shabby pseudo-scientific remake of "Highlander", but just and only narrated, like a radio novel, by one person to some friends, sat on the sofa watching the fireplace. Just speech, no remarkable scenes or images. No cinema at all. Shame. Lost 2 hours of my life.If the high rates are from friends of the film stuff, I understand. If the high rates are from people suffering insomnia that could at last sleep well during the film, I also understand. If not, I insist there must be an error, IMDb rates usually don't fail so spectacularly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This review is simply based on the trailer because after seeing that I would never watch such a hackey looking grade C low budget movie. If the trailer has not one interesting moment in it I think I can assure you the whole film won't be any better. A bunch of no-name actors, a lot of talking and some bad action in a living room. The music is cheesy, the concept is boring and the lighting and direction are way below par. I am not a big fan of low budget, and when I say that I don't mean the amount of money spent, some really great films were done on the cheap, but this is just not one of them. I need to give this a really bad rating to counter act the obvious friend of the director posts calling this the "must see" and greatest of all time and giving it ten stars? Really? Ten stars? It's the best movie ever made? Even Citizen Kane doesn't get a ten star review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What an absolutely magnificent film The Man from Earth truly is. A subtle thought-provoking exercise for the mind and imagination. To those who wrote, produced and acted in it, I can only say a hearty "bravo", wish I could buy you all a beer. It's extremely rare in this world to see a movie that doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator in any way, that displays a simple purity of purpose. If you haven't seen this film, I strongly recommend that you do.Sadly, for many the demands the movie places on their thought processes and religious beliefs will either bore, confuse or anger them (or all three). That's a shame, but it's not unexpected. Modern audiences have been conditioned to expect an explosion, witty one-liner or sex scene every few minutes to maintain their attention, and I for one have had a gutful of this "moronification" of mainstream movies such that garbage like '300' or 'Transformers' are heralded as the great movies of our time. I'm glad films like The Man from Earth appear once in a while to restore my faith in the medium. I applaud the producers for having the guts to make this great movie.Unfortunately the film is not available in Australia, however having seen all the positive reviews and comments regarding its thought-provoking nature, and given the somewhat tentative green light the producers had given, I downloaded the movie. I usually oppose piracy, but in this case it was worth it, and in return I've made a reasonable donation at www.manfromearth.com under my name - and I encourage everyone else to do the same if they can't buy the DVD.Everyone complains about how the usual Hollywood movies are all garbage, yet we all line up and pay money to see, buy or rent them time and time again. Well it's now time to demonstrate clearly that a movie which is not centered solely around dazzling 15 year old audiences with blood, gore and special effects can still succeed.All the best, hope to see more movies like this.Cheers, KoroushKoroush Ghazi Owner/Author www.tweakguides.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>9.5/10 Wow. Not the kind of movie I normally watch, but flat out wow. I really, really want to give this a 10/10, but I'm hesitant. Filmed as a play on the stage would be, it's essentially 90 minutes of yak, but it plays so well thanks to fantastic performances by most of the cast. Tony Todd?an actor who normally couldn't out-act William Shatner?was fantastic, as was David Lee Smith, an actor whom I'm barely aware of. As I said, it's filmed as a yak, yak stage play, with no profanity, no gore, no horror, yet it plays as the most entertaining movie I've seen since?maybe all year!The story was so engaging that I was completely enthralled by the tale. I will give no spoilers at all, except to say it's the story of a man?he claims to be 14000 years old, told to a group his academic peers. Is it truth, or is it fiction?This movie will not be for everyone?what movie is!?but it will certainly entertain those in need of pure drama. I wholeheartedly recommend it.</fullReview>

It successfully conveys a deep, earth-shaking, moving story through dialog and minimal effects. As you watch the movie you feel almost like an invisible participant, really there and taking part in the story.I highly recommend this movie for anybody who wants a story, first and foremost, followed by intelligent dialog and deep themes. If you watch your movies for special effects, this one isn't for you. If you watch your movies for action, for shooting and car chases, this isn't for you.I wouldn't recommend it for everybody, but rather for the (lucky) few.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I heard about all the internet hype and decided to see this movie for myself. I must say I was extremely glad I did. Very few movies can move along on dialog alone but this one does and does it well.From the start of a hypothetical scenario the plot unravels into discussions about the very nature of humanity and faith. Even though it falls into the science fiction category it isn't bound by the traditional genre elements of futurism and altered sci/tech with big budge action sequences. Rather a simple idea discussed in a rational and thought provoking manner makes it a more plausible movie.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie even as it left me wanting to know more about "The Man from Earth."</fullReview>

During the Movie you get the feeling of actually being there and experience a sort of sensation of -is this real or is this a lie?. You enter a stage where you almost would like to ask the main character things you would want to know.The location is warming and relaxed but gets its climaxes from now and then.The movie resolves into an ending you spend your 90 minutes waiting for.With a good twist. i recommend this movie highly to audiences who like to think about the movie even days after watching.Its very entertaining and well shot too.So don't miss this one its a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

I was disgusted at myself for watching this for the entire 87 minutes. If I were in the hospital dying, I would take the sweet embrace of death over watching this piece of trash again.There is no circumstance under which I can recommend watching this movie. You can read other reviews about the actual plot of this movie, I will not lower myself into describing the supposed storyline of this turd. I fell into the trap of watching it....please don't do the same. And for you people who have given this dreck glowing reviews, you should be ashamed of yourselves.

No fancy effects, no false heroism, no huge explosions, just mesmerizing story. I specially liked disappearing of furniture in background, which reduced set to actors, fireplace and cosy couch only.

		<fullReview>This is indeed a chess game of a film, but not one you can just sit back on the sidelines to watch.... unknowingly it draws you into the game and you become one of the major players... creating belief and disbelief with every statement, each question creates an answer and each answer creating another question, so the wheel revolves taking you deeper and deeper into your own acceptance of what you think is reality. No super special effects.. No big budget flash... no unmaintainable hype... just plain and simple.... damn good story, excellent facts, believable actors and doubt. The story creates a world of doubts and questions that you will be asking for a long time. The whole story line grows like a virus in the brain... infecting your trusted beliefs and accepted theories until what you never imagined becomes reality. recommended for anyone with a brain that operates above 1% This is without doubt one of the best films I have EVER seen</fullReview>

For that highly addictive story I give it 8 out of 10 (I would surely give it 9 if not for some bad acting) you might think it's a lot but what really is sci-fi? it's the idea, the incredible imagination that has no boundaries! It might seem the story takes place in this one room only but in truth it happens all over the history of human race and in very beautiful geographical locations you just need to have your own imagination to enjoy it! Writing this I'm hoping for the sci-fi fans, who somehow lack imagination and expect a guy in latex killing lots of other latex guys, to find my message and save them-self some frustration.

		<fullReview>I know that this is another comment amongst hundreds, however i can't help myself from writing a few words about a movie, better yet, a story, like no other to date. I am a huge fan of Asimov, and this could be compared, in a way, with the "Bicentenial Man" (sorry for the spelling), but in a much more philosophical way. It makes the viewer wonder: what if someone like John Oldman does really exist? What if there was a man who had seen everything that this world has been trough for the last 14,000 years with his own eyes? Furthermore, i would like to say that, even though there are no visual effects whatsoever, the movie should win an Academy Award for the best script. I hope i have the chance of experiencing this with all of my friends, to see how they react. I definitely recommend the movie to anyone who can think outside the box. However, there is a downside to it: the ending. It leaves to much on the viewer's imagination. Some might say that is a good thing, but i think i would have wanted to see how a brilliant mind like the one behind the novel would have elaborated the idea.

This is atheism on tranquilizers, and it looks dumber than a cult about UFO priests. I guess even religious bigots would fall asleep before they could even attempt to protest this nonsense.

		<fullReview>John Oldman is a Baker's Dozen (plus one) millennium years old. Just a kid, really. And he has a fantastic story to tell us. He's an immortal! But he doesn't look a day over thirty-five. Should we believe him? It's a dilemma. So, just pull up a chair, pour a glass of your favorite spirit and enjoy some good conversation. This film had me engrossed from the start. I watched it between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.--and there was no chance of me falling off into a deep slumber. The movie touches on all the hot button subjects of the day: religion, science, life, death, politics, an entire raft of radioactive issues for your contemplation. I can see how some people of faith may find this to be offensive and an awful exercise in movie-making. Others among us may find it slow and lacking in action. I didn't. The action is in John's words. His story is all one should need to sustain interest. And for me, anyway, I was enthralled by his answers to the others' probing questions. Nothing was pat. You may not like what he has to say, but, unlike many modern films, he is given the freedom and the time to say them. If you have an open mind for such material then this is the film for you. I recommend a purchase of a bottle of Johnnie Walker Green and some grains of truth for your viewing pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not an action movie, true. The acting is borderline terrible, which is also tolerable since technically the cast is supposed to take it all as a joke.However what is not tolerable is the rambling about nothing for the entire duration of the film. This isn't historically interesting, neither is it factual, neither is it literally digestible. This is nothing more than your average Monday morning coffee house chat altar boys (it's on the same level - junior high at most) have about what they have just heard over the weekend in Sunday school.I was utterly disappointed to discover this movie was a mascaraded Jesus movie executed in a bad fashion. It has nothing beyond the tag line (which is never developed mind you) to keep your attention and it is clearly made for a specific audience, but advertised to all in the hopes that people will not realize what a pile of crook it is an still watch it. One needs no more than 3 minutes to realize this caters only to confused religious people who are so wrapped up in their way they grasp at every strand of non bible verse to look outside the box.To everybody else, this is an insult. The script is an insult to logic, to history, to facts, to science, and certainly to religion itself really. The ONLY niche that will be impressed (as can be seen by the scores and volumes of forum posts) is that little confused religious group that isn't quite sure if their religion is real or not. Well folks, let me save you the time; you won't find the answer here. The man from earth should take heed to its name and be buried in the cinematic graveyard where it belongs.It will pose no questions past the high school level, offer no answers and leave your totally hanging asking "i want my 40000 years back". You can learn more about religion, history and anthropology from just about anything. If you manage to not vomit or laugh after 30 minutes, you are probably too far gone</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am not a Sci-Fi fan. You need to watch this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface this by saying that never in my life have I watched a complete episode of Star Trek. I skip past Battlestar Galactia, Firefly (?), and barely made it through the entire Star Wars saga.This movie is simple. A bunch of colleagues, scholars, sitting around a room discussing things of a globally important as i'm sure we imagine they do. Only this time, their discussion is earth shatteringly important. What happens if a man is immortal...more importantly, what happens if he is standing right in front of you?For a movie to stand 100% on dialogue these days is tough, audiences don't want that, the general population wants special effects and explosions and sex. There is none of that here. There is, however, wit and sarcasm, anger and sadness, raw emotion brought out in a way that rarely happens in modern cinema. Listen, you already know about this movie. You may have stumbled upon it or heard all the hype about it. Ignore the hype and judge for yourself. It's a great film and to quote another reviewer on a different site, for some it will be a good way to spend an hour and a half. For others they will love it so much that they will buy 3 copies of the DVD and write their first review on IMDb.com.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder why this movie is so highly ranked? The only explanation I can think of is that the people behind the movie has begged their friends to vote for it.The whole movie is 80 minutes of pure dialog. I do not say the storyline is uninteresting, but this project would have been better off as a radio theater or a book. The problem is that the picture does not gives the movie any extra dimension at all. I will as a matter of fact say it limit the experience. I am pretty sure your imagination and ability to make pictures in the head is to be preferred instead of what the makers of this movie have achieved.If you expect something else then dialog, avoid it! If you nevertheless have the chance to watch "The Man from Earth" be sure to close your eyes or at least be certain to get payed to watch it.You are hereby Warned!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun, Story Driven Film Flawed by Cliché Characters and Average Acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm kind of surprised by all the love this movie is getting. Not to say I didn't like it, I enjoyed it quite a bit actually. But I see people giving it perfect scores and all that jazz. A perfect ten? That's overdoing it a little bit.The Man From Earth is about a man who tells his group of friends, who all happen to be professors or wannabe intellectuals, that every ten years he has to pack up and move. Why? Because he doesn't age and he doesn't want his secret to be discovered. Huh? Because he's a caveman, who's lived over 14,000 years due to a perfect working human body. The movie is simply this man, John, answering question after question and telling stories about his long, event filled life due to the his friends not believing him. You'd think this would be a boring mess, but it's really a fun film. You have a plethora of characters, from the "Cool" professor type, the all knowing psychologist, a geeky wise-cracking biology professor, a black level-headed professor, a strict Christian, the girl friend, and a beautiful young student who is possibly banging the "Cool" professor. You may see this wide variety of characters a unique touch, which for this type of movie it kinda is. But it's also incredibly clichéd, and it feels that way quite often. They deliver and act how that specific character is supposed to act. The Strict Christian had the Motherly/Homemade sweater look, the "Cool Professor" had the leather jacket and facial hair and so on for each character. I'm guessing it was a safety measure. But even though this "problem" exists (I put it in quotations because it's not really a problem if I'm the only it really bugs) the characters do their jobs right, and it moves the picture at a quick pace. I have only one other problem with the film. And that's the acting. As soon as the film starts, if you know anything about acting, you'll know that it's average at best. Especially the opening scene to the film. But as the movie goes on, the actors get in a groove and some actually do deliver good performances, especially Candyman. The one who is the weakest unfortunately is John, who plays the supposed Caveman. He's delivers his lines in a soft spoken way the entire time, with no emotion, and only a handful of expression/mannerisms. Well, I'm a slight stickler for acting, you may not be and may be more a story driven person. And for you, this movie was made.The film as I said before moves at a fast pace, since huge issues of friendship, religion, and humanity arise. It's nonstop talking but it's filled with a smart script (sometimes too smart with the vocabulary) and led by an intriguing story. Some say it's a SciFi film, it is, but I'd rather say it's a Drama with a SciFi theme. Anyways, The Man From Earth was a nice surprise and I'm happy I took the chance to see this movie. 7.5 outta 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm disappointed with the film, do "intellectuals" feel they need to rate this title well because it supposedly addresses them? It reminds me of some contemporary art..The acting is wooden from most of the cast, but I don't really blame them because the dialogue is unnatural and lacking in fluidity.There was no meaningful insight into humanity or our history from the 14,000 year old man without any charisma. The history lesson was basic and boring, and nothing that we didn't already know, which leads me nicely on to the point of the film.A film is supposed to inform, inspire emotion, or entertain in my opinion - unfortunately this film just doesn't do it.But nice try, I like the premise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't just the goatee beard that was awful!I have lost so much faith in IMDb users! I can see what they tried to do with this title but they FAILED. Ultimately this is a simple storyline made worse by poor acting, in a dismal setting, (a cabin) with an obviously fake 'real' fire, presumably put there for continuity reasons...You will feel nothing for the characters, they create no atmosphere at all and if you manage to fight your way through the tedium to the 'massive' ending without strangling yourself you'll be disappointed.If it wasn't for the religious element it would not have got peoples attention. This is a boring film. It's linear, factual and virtually sterile. You'll wait for it to go somewhere... but it won't.It's one to avoid I'm afraid and I give it a big fat 1 out of ten.</fullReview>

So bad that I at first thought maybe this was a clever, ironic style of comedy they where using but no its its just bad. You might laugh but it will be at it certainly not with.Maybe somewhere at some point there was a mildly interesting point or idea here but it gets lost within a script which would work well as a school play but no more. You might find this intelligent or thought provoking if your a stoned, 15yr old, boy. Otherwise I recommend staying well clear of this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie starts out solid. What if a man from 15,000 years ago was still alive and tries to confide this to his friends. The performances are good and the dialogue very engaging. For the first hour I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen. Then the movie throws the twist at you.Spoilers! The caveman turns out to be Jesus. Why movie? There were so many great directions to go and you choose to crap on religion. If that wasn't enough they make the Christian woman look like a hysterical simpleton. If that wasn't enough the rest of the cast attacks her for her beliefs. The movie is still worth the watch but the twist seriously reduces my score. It's a 6/10 that could've easily been a 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What apply to others shouldn't apply to us, Think NOT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me clarify some of the factual and logical errors occurred in this movie,-John Oldman (the protagonist) mentioned something like he always called himself "John" from his youth, i.e. since his prehistoric days in Europe, but that is absurd. The name 'John' is an ancient Middle Eastern name, not European. In Aramaic and Arabic "John" is Yeh'ya.-The Christian Bible was written in Aramaic, not Hebrew, as many dull ignorants (religious freaks) think.-Why someone, who lived through a LOT, suddenly wanted to 'dish it out' to people who are not so interesting, or significant after all- from his point of view. I mean the protagonist met far more interesting and influential people in his 14,000 years life time whom might believed him much more readily than these 'intelectuals'; why trying to convince people who may seem just shades of by passers in his near eternal journey. He should know better than anyone on this Earth; he's supper- experienced. What is the point?In addition, the movie is obviously made with some 'anti-religious' flavour, and I noticed many uptight religious freaks (ignorants) can't stand this and there was even one who suggest that had the religion been switched (i.e. Islam) it would have been worth it!As if these ignorants live on a different planet and don't realise that Hollywood, plus outside its domain, had made thousands of movies, documentaries and TV programs bashing other religions (e.g. Islam) and mostly ended in an utter failure and equally absurd conclusion, far more so than this movie did, well these people, of all, should realise how it feels when ones' belief is 'insulted'- it's a b*ch, ain't?'What apply to others shouldn't apply to us', yeah, well that is very "Christian" of you. Hello? You missed the core morality-massage here.How Pathetic.Ultimately, the movie is pretty thought provoking but executed poorly. ***** for its objectivity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the man from earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely does a film hold the attention when on one small location. Six degrees of Separation comes to mind... and a few others. What needs to propel such a choice is dialogue - both the integrity, and the interest component. The Man from EArth has both, and more. A gentle, exploration of a very big subject. Having been aware of Jerome Bixby's work from Star Trek, I was pleased to see him expand on the episode of Requiem for Methuselah.All the characters act as archetypes for the eternal questions posed about the possibility of a human living an immortal life. All characters act in a realistic manner, and react in what I felt to be an authentic way.It's a cracking good story, told well, and held with great integrity by his son to carry Mr Bixby's immortality through his writing. I hope this film gets the accolades it deserves. I work in the Australian Film Industry where our budgets are generally the catering component of most American films. It is so refreshing to see American filmmakers do what the rest of the world does - making great films without spending the national debt of a third world country making them. Congratulations to all involved. Watch it folks !!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Man from Earth" really surprised me, and this is the kind of movie that will stick with you for a long, long time once you have watched it.The story is about John Oldman (played by David Lee Smith) who is about to leave town and saying good bye to his friends, when he is coaxed into unveiling a very surprising and somewhat disturbing story about his life to his friends.Don't expect much to actually happen physically in this movie. Let me be straight with you, all that happens in this movie is basically a group of people sitting in a living room and talk. Yeah, that is literally all that is going on. But it is done with such finesse and skill that the movie turned out to be interesting and compelling. Director Richard Schenkman really managed to pull this movie off so nicely on many levels."The Man from Earth" is the type of movie that gives the audience something to think about, and all throughout the entire movie you are sort of kept in the dark, but constantly being fed bits and pieces of information, letting the audience themselves make up whether or not what is being told is a tale or actual fact.The cast was great, and they had managed to put together a good ensemble of acting talent for this particular movie. And everyone delivered nicely, especially given the fact that everyone was basically just sitting around listening to a story being told and questioning the storyteller.I stumbled upon "The Man from Earth" by sheer luck, and it turned out to be one of the more memorable movie experiences I have had in a long, long time."The Man from Earth" scores a solid 8 out of 10 stars from me without a doubt. This Sci-Fi drama is guaranteed to set your mind into motion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best talkies around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is very different from other films in that it doesn't have anything besides talk. Yes, it is just a bunch of people talking to each other for two hours inside a house. That's it. The most audio-visual experience one has in the film is when they play the second movement from Beethoven's 7th symphony (a movement that has been called the greatest song ever made by some classical composers and critics).It is a very interesting smart film but it is not smart in the sense of an art-house film but more in the sense of a philosophical novel. This is really the reproduction of a dialog driven novel on screen rather than something that could be said to be appropriate to the film medium. It is not a bad film but it is also not a masterpiece of cinema by any means.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an original film about a man who gets members of the scientific community to get drunk and help him pack his belongings to move. The movie takes place at the main character, Professor John Oldman's house then for close to an hour and a half, he tells them a story. ----------------the following may contain spoilers---------------------The Kung-fu scenes where so unrealistic one could say they where non-existent. The movie cuts from the thrilling action to show a scene in which in which two dudes take some of his furnishings. Near the end one of the characters drives away from his house to ponder the long story john had told them. Over all I rate this movie a 7 out of 10 because of the action sequences This film could of benefited its rating from me if hit had more graphic violence or nudity. It does have alcohol in it introduced into the film quite quickly. this easily moved its 5 star to a seven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is quite nicely scripted. However, I have a feeling that the movie is highly over-rated. Though the movie has unusual stories which is highly justified over the movie but I feel that the movie lacks the charm where a viewer would be attracted. I felt like i was in a classroom listening to the lectures. Boring but really makes thoughtful. I feel that the movie wanted to follow the path of 12 Angry Men on bringing all the characters together and undergoing a discussion. I find some scenes in the movie highly non-relevant and useless. If you fall for the title of the movie (The man from earth) and expect really amazing story then I would like to warn you that it can be really a boring experience. Besides religion and science the movie has tried to include different aspects of life which has given unnecessary weight to the movie.</fullReview>

This film my well challenge that idea.I won't give away any plot details, but just watch the film with an open mind. If you like it, then make sure you buy a copy. The makers of this film deserve support!

		<shortDescription>Simply fantastic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hate to sound pretentious but this is one of the most intellectually stimulating films that I have ever seen and therefore represents exactly what I love most about science fiction. If only they could make more films like this.Basically, it's about a university professor named John Oldman who, after ten years, is deciding to move on. Some of his closest friends, who are all professors as well, visit him at his house to give him a bit of a send-off, albeit a fairly low-key one. One of them, Edith, remarks that John has not aged a day since she first met him a decade earlier and that she and every other woman on the faculty are jealous of that.At that point, John asks "What if a man from the Upper Paleolithic had survived until the present day?" His friends at first think that he is considering writing a science fiction story but, after a little while, it is clear that John is referring to himself. He is claiming to be 14,000 years old.As he relates his life story to his friends, they begin to wonder if he is insane. There are lots of interesting philosophical and psychological discussions about religion, evolution, development of human civilisation and whatnot that I can't really do justice to by describing them. They kind-of have to be seen to be believed.It has a cool cast including sci-fi/horror legend Tony Todd and, for "Star Trek" fans, a few familiar faces. It's written by Jerome Bixby, who wrote several acclaimed episodes of Star Trek - including Requiem for Methuselah on which this is largely based - and "The Twilight Zone".</fullReview>

Could not have imagined that the science fiction movie can be shot in a single room with very few number of people in it. The only thing that bothers is, how many people would be open minded and ready to accept alternative answers or say unexpected, out of the box thinking? I think this movies is not for narrow minded people or who believe in God so strongly that they are not ready to here any alternative to it (like Edith (Ellen Crawford) shown in the movie ) Must watch for brilliant script, acting and unimaginable twist at the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not a comic-con guy. I'm just a lover of science fiction since I was a young child, writing stories and letters to NASA astronauts. Science has always been my first love in study.Of course when I saw this in a set of videos, I was unfamiliar with the author Bixby, and I didn't recognize the names of any of the actors. Still, the story was intriguing and I picked it up, ecstatic to see the 8.1 rating here because these are few and far between and it was the first of three movies I rented this night.I was so happy to have this story as part of my repertoire of watched movies and actually re-signed up to IMDb to make this comment, because my old personna, x111b3825, well, I couldn't remember the password or what e-mail I used last I typed here and I just had to recommend this.This is not typical sci-fi. It is a dialog driven drama, purely and beautifully woven from the lead character's experience and his defense of his first time revealed story to his current band of friends.There are no laser fights, no space ships, no battles for the human race, just the simple story of a what if...what if I were born in cave-dwelling times and survived until now at this apparent age and experienced thousands of lifetimes in just this one. What if? It's a great idea and like Philip K. Dick who gave us some really awesome stories over his years, I hope to see some more come out of Bixby and family.This one was definitely two big thumbs up and really deserved some better marketing even though the original budget I saw somewhere was only $200,000 dollars.In the extras, Bixby's son and the director told how they wanted to keep this low budget, but there are a lot of us geeks out here, who love sci-fi on so many levels, this movie probably made some money, but with a broad release, wow, no one could say it was not deservedly so...Watch and I think you'll agree. This is a great piece of work.</fullReview>

A woman remarks how he doesn't seem to age. All the women on campus want to know his secret. They all ask why he is leaving. Finally he tells them.The story has a budget of next to nothing. It takes place in one house. The cast barely had a dozen speaking parts. Yet it all worked.See it. See what great writing can do. It's better than all the make-up, CGI and costumes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had a promising premise , and it's what got me interested in it in the first place. But in spite of a good premise the execution was poor.The movie is about John , a professor. He is leaving the town for good because he has a secret. He is in fact a 14000 year old Cromagnon , one who has survived till today. At his leaving party he decides to tell his academic friends his secret , and a dialogue which lasts throughout the film starts.Contains bits of spoilers (marked) The intellectuals , the academics of this movie was not convincing at ALL. They are a collection of Hollywood stereotypes ( glasses, elbow patches , geeky, dry humor , student-professor relationship), one that I've to encounter after 2 years of college , and they appear to not know more than (or even less) than an average high schooler. Let me explain SPOILER : The biologist says that if the human body has perfect protection vs the toxins that damages cells and eventually mutates cells/DNA , they can live for ever. Seeing as he is a biology professor you'd think he would mention that cells have an expiration date and the hayflick limit ( it limits the number of times cells can replicate ). Now this isn't anything advanced , I learned it in biology in high school. Also no matter how protected you are against "toxins" , radiation and particle bombarding from space will destroy or hurt cells and cause mutation ( this I consider a lil nit picky). I guess you could say this is where the movie lost me. SPOILER ENDThe other "intellectuals" aren't as ignorant as this guy though , but they seem to know nothing more than a high schooler either.. Another thing is how easily baffled they are by John's story. And how anything John says can be found in very basic history books (which he admits himself at some point) + some fallacies SPOILER --- ( like Columbus sailing to prove the earth is round..wtf )---- SPOILER END . This is sloppy research guys.SPOILER Another silly thing that kills this movie is how many important figures John met. He met Budda and learned from him , he was Jesus , he knew Van Gogh etc. It's clichéd and unimaginative. SPOILER ENDLike I said, movie had a good premise but poor execution. I recommend it for anyone who's not all that interested in science/history , that way you might find it intriguing .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great couple hours of talking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can't handle people talking, you probably don't want to watch this film. On the other hand, if you're brain isn't so damaged or dysfunctional that you require constant car crashes, explosions, chase scenes or gunfights in order to stay awake and alert, then you might really like this movie.I preface my brief review that way because as interesting, complex, smart, funny, tense and intriguing as this movie is... it also is nothing more than a roomful of people talking the whole time. There are no convenient flashbacks or cutaways to illustrate some of the issues they discuss. You get to use your -- wait for it, wait... -- imagination for that part. Plus, it's necessary to the plot for you to remain in uncertainty.This is a great piece of science fiction, and a fun ride through a thought-experiment-made-real for this character's group of friends. Give it a try, if you're capable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Top Three Science Fiction Films Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most unique screenplays of the past forty years in any genre - in the league of 12 Angry Men for it's sheer brilliant simplicity. The Man From Earth is one of the best films I've ever seen and certainly one which makes you think, which is what sci-fi should do. Looking at the resumes of most of the cast and crew you could be forgiven for writing this film off before even viewing it, but don't - these actors perform at the highest level and seem to have a natural on-screen chemistry. The director was right to avoid flashy effects, car chases and Reality TV-age Smugness. The only science fiction film I can think of that attained the same level of excellence throughout is probably 1997's big budget Contact, written by the late, great Carl Sagan. It says everything about how 'safe' Hollywood production and distribution has become that The Man From Earth didn't even make it to the theaters, and it's a cinematic crime that it didn't get Oscars for Best Picture, Best Acting, Best Screenplay and Best Director, but who cares! Here's to you, Jerome Bixby, you left us with a flash of genius, light years ahead of the pack.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly A Thoughtful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first was told to watch this movie, I was honestly a skeptic at first considering it had no "action" and I hadn't hear anything about it. I was pleasantly surprised to find a mind-opening thoughtful script that was simple but dealt with many different complex questions. Many of them laid out and executed in such a matter that made you think about. The "action" wasn't needed at all to make this movie what it is. It was like sitting in a group of close friends, all with different views and ideals, and then having them say their honest opinions. Many of the ideas look at the big picture versus how influential a persons beliefs could be. This movie should be brought up for the questions asked and the ideas brought forth. I really enjoyed the fireside like chat and made you feel as if you were in this circle deciding with the actors. It was well done and a movie like this hasn't been around in awhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie to make one think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is seldom that movie is able to intrigue me in such a way as to wish it all to be true. The Man from Earth had me glued, unblinking, to the end. And at the end I was thoroughly satisfied, almost gleefully happy and childishly excited.Here is a movie that asks a rather interesting question, one that would keep your imagination going wild and hungry and your coffee table discussions going long into the night. The Man from Earth asks the question, "What if a man from upper-paleolithic survived until the present day?"And thus with that question I was taken in on a roller-coaster ride of fantastical imaginative proportions as 14,000 years of Earth's history, with rolling landscapes, thousands of languages, millions and millions of people being born and dying, great swathes of time creating and erasing cultures and the arrival of magic and supernatural and religions, were compressed into my mind in just 1 and half hours.But there are no super CG effects. No flashbacks or illustrations. Not even sketches. In fact, there was nothing but storytelling and dialog and that was all I (and the characters in the movie itself) had going, or indeed, had needed. The Man from Earth's story reminded me of some of the tales from the Sandman series of graphic novels by Neil Gaiman. A man living 14,000 years can meet many interesting people. Or even deliberately choose to meet them knowing that he shall outlive them and survive to tell the story.The premise for the plot of the movie took me almost by surprise. How could it be so simple and yet so profound - simple, yet astoundingly intriguing at a deeply intellectual level. Perhaps it is because, given our limited lifespan, we yearn to live the millenniums to see what the passage of time would reveal. It would indeed be something to meet a 14,000 year old living man. That's for sure.It would definitely make it easy to predict our behaviour as a species. Would the current religions die away a thousand years from now as did other belief systems before? Would there be another ice-age? Or even a nuclear holocaust that would send humanity to the brink of extinction? Will we leave our planet and start a migratory journey into space?To bear witness to the millenniums must be like being God.I highly recommend this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE thunderbolt of genius imagination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unbelievably, profoundly fabulous - THE best story I've ever heard, on film or otherwise - it hardly matters that it's a film, except for the superb acting that made it so real. Fast forward through it, and it's little more than a group of people talking all night. Watch it, and be drawn in, caught off guard and magically transported into an amazing and profound tapestry, a surprising synthesis of some of the biggest questions and deepest mysteries of the human race, of human history, of religion, philosophy, science, of life and existence. The dramatic premise is familiar and enticing - how do we react when confronted with the impossible, the unbelievable - and this is an evening with a very astute group of scholars and professors, nobody's fools. Yet that is just the beginning. To the pantheon of Verne, Wells and Clarke we should add Bixby, from whose genius imagination came It's a Good Life, Fantastic Voyage and the inspiration for Alien; but there's no aliens here, and no need...an absolutely incredible tour-de-force, masterfully wrought.A must-see for all who think, learn, and wonder.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reminds me of Albino Alligator.... in that it is a drama with a very interesting plot. It's also close quartered and quite intense. Contrary to the reviews,...this is not really an intellectual film as much as it is a religious film. Actually, that's the problem. The message. The initial premise is fantastic... one that will surely be remade by some BigTime producer on a 150 million dollar budget that wants to make an epic movie. Here....we have the skeleton of what could become a great movie. The message never comes across here. What we have is a great idea that put a filmmaker WAY WAY over his head. I think most would find it interesting because the main premise is extremely intriguing.... the question is whether or not the average acting, writing and the subpar production value outweighs the 'interest'? Like I said....Albino Alligator (54/100)..... a bit hard to watch but you just have to know the truth so you keep on watching. Other recommendations that are low budget, interesting....and perhaps a clear cut above this average film are 'Miracle Mile(75/100)', and 'Finder's Fee(68/100)'...... see those first!.... if you like those then give this a try....if not.....don't. . my rating 58/100</fullReview>

I believe the man who wrote the story line has great knowledge about the many realities of this Ancient Wisdom. I am so thankful for this film. It reveals a truth that is veiled by fear and control. In this story there are a group of PhD college professors who examine the realities of one man's story that spans over many many generations and human transformations. It is a wonderful examination of our beliefs about life, aging, religion and the human mind throughout many ages. This film should not be missed.Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.

		<fullReview>I have never seen an IMDb rating that made me as suspicious as this film's has. I believe someone like the film's owner created tens of thousands of fake 10-rating votes. It's the most economical explanation for the large number of votes that this straight to video, genre effort has collected, and the very high average of those votes, especially considering how much lower is the average of the votes accompanied by written reviews. If you're thinking of paying to see this because of the high rating, please be very suspicious.The movie is just awful. It's really bad SF on a really low budget but it does meet some basic standards of competence. Some people do go for any SF and they are welcome to enjoy it. It looks like a soap opera or an infomercial, shot on old video equipment. There's just one set, with just one big key light in each scene for quick camera setups without needing to relight. There's almost no sound engineering or music.I can only suggest that anyone who appreciates this film should try reading some good SF instead. It's a better vehicle than a low budget film for an author to explore an idea.The script is toilet paper in my opinion. The philosophical ideas are painfully simple. The religious ideas are idiotic, on the level of Erich Von Däniken, Dan Brown or other New Age heretical nonsense. I'm an atheist myself but I can at least listen thoughtfully to some serious thinkers in the Catholic, Unitarian, Episcopalian or Reconstructionist Jewish traditions. I have a special lack of respect for people like L. Ron Hubbard who cook up their own synthetic invention and present it as revealed truth. When this film suggests that Christ was neither human nor supernatural but rather a Buddhist with a natural lifespan of hundreds of years I file it under "kooky nonsense".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must be how this film happened. Someone was reviewing a time-travel sort of movie and The DaVinci Code at the same time. The scripts get dropped, put together again and sent on to the next reviewer who confuses them for one work. In the end we have 10 stars for originality but this movie is still painful to watch. The acting isn't bad and the story has some promise. But for starters the movie drags constantly with pointless repetition and too much empty space. Slow, slow, slo-o-w-w-w. The real problem however, is that it is completely agenda-driven. The entire movie is simply a vehicle for preaching an unexamined atheistic (and in particular anti-Bible) agenda, legitimized by a veneer of intelligence via a cast of academics. Unfortunately the simplistic pseudo-history, philosophical presuppositions and outright errors in biblical criticism move this film well beyond boring and deep into insulting. Think the intellectual equivalent of steam engines on the USS Enterprise, or again, The DaVinci Code. Even if one can stomach the shallow philosophical nonsense (and there is no other reason for this movie), the execution is too tedious for words. This movie is a profound waste of time.</fullReview>

It's central conceit -- it's about a caveman who grows up to be Jesus thanks to some extra nifty DNA -- never advances beyond flat speculation (most of the dialog is some form of "that's not possible!" and "maybe not... but what if it was?") and supposedly poignant familial connections. The acting is more or less solid, but all very television-y. Indeed, as the screenplay was written by someone best known for his scripts for Twilight Zone and Outer Limits, this probably would work better as a television movie, a trifle that HBO, Showtime or Lifetime would offer to fill out the programming day. But it's not a deep or particularly meaningful film -- unless you haven't seen 2001: A Space Odyssey, or even some of the better episodes of Lost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the cheesy dialog at the beginning of the meeting of John's friends and colleagues, the premise of the film becomes more believable. I would personally dislike very much to share a "going away party" with a bunch of melodramatic dramaqueen characters outraged at John's choice to move away. William Katt plays a very convincing jerkoff who dates his middle-aged students and threatens to have his friend or colleague committed after hearing John's life story. From his first line, you want to slap him. To his student girlfriend after pulling up on his badass- cycle: "So, do I get an A for Awesome?"Some might object or find John's claim being Jesus as ridiculous, but assuming that he's telling the truth, it seems self-serving. The part that ruined the movie for me was the ending. John is portrayed as a caring character, both before and after he "reveals" himself as Jesus, telling the psychologist to "come back inside" and apologizing for upsetting him, yet at the end of the movie, the psychologist overhears (either accidentally, or as part of John's plan) the past names John's used, one of which was the psychologist's father's. John's consolation after being accused of abandoning his family by his now elderly son? "Yeah, I'm sorry, I had to go." That's it?! You reveal to a bunch of your colleagues that you're 14,000 years old, with an in- depth discussion on history and other subjects, and all you can say to your son (one of many, apparently) is a brief and impersonal "sorry"?This is either: a) A weakly tacked-on plot detail, or b) A personality flaw of an arrogant and self-righteous character that actually ISN'T at all as caring as his earlier statements paint himself to be. The psychologist dies of a heart attack, and John leaves, seemingly unphased. If the psychologist had lived, I'm sure he would have regretting not killing John when he had the chance.Although John might have left the family when the psychologist was a small child, I don't believe the psychologist wouldn't have recognized his own father, unless there were absolutely no photos of him taken. It's a ridiculous and insulting premise in my opinion, both to the audience and to the psychologist's character.The movie would have been perfectly acceptable without this plot detail at the very end, after the audience has made a decision to accept or reject the character's persona. With it included, I can say this movie is a genuine piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was hoping for something intellectually stimulating. I do enjoy having my beliefs challenged, however this movie was totally disappointing. Tons of ignorant, tired out lines filled up most of it. One of the most important points of the film was that they were all college educated colleagues. However, the poor acting and middle school level pseudo- intellectual arguments used left me totally unconvinced. The relationships were also poorly developed which made it seem unrealistic that in the 14,000 years he had been on Earth he would want to say goodbye, as himself, to this one particular group of people. We are supposed to believe he wants to say goodbye but he doesn't care if he sees his girlfriend or not? It was hard to tell they meant anything to each other at all. Throwing in random famous people from the past to spice up the story got old quickly. I agree with others that the film was an unapologetic work of anti-organized religion propaganda. Which I would not even mind if the plot had better developed and if some new material had been used. Overall, the movie came off like something a smart-aleck fifteen year old would have made with a few of his friends. I mean really, people knew the world wasn't flat! I was seriously offended only by its stupidity. We were also supposed to believe that he was Jesus, but didn't want to be made King of the Jews. So we are supposed to buy into the whole "I'm just an unassuming guy, the real Jesus was a simple man, Christianity is a bunch of hullabaloo, I didn't want the attention....". So they drop in a Disney movie level misunderstanding and at no time in between teaching someone to "fish a little better" and being crucified does he realize the following he's created and try fix it? He doesn't realize he has "devotes" until they see him coming out of the tomb? Seriously? Watch it if you want to let your brain take an 87 min. long nap.</fullReview>

If you don't have a working knowledge of the Bible, the second half of "The Man From Earth", might leave you in the dark.

It provokes thought in such a way and belongs up there will films such as 2001; A Space Odyssey, The Quiet Man, and any series, including Star Trek.Considering the writer of the script wrote some of Star Trek:OS most memorable episodes, it's little wonder that the movie manages to resonate so much.The story focuses on a professor who, at his going away party, reveals himself to be a cro-magnon over 14,000 years old. The score is understated, which is fine, because the material doesn't require a musical cue to tell you when to feel or think something.

		<shortDescription>I can't believe this poor excuse for a film has such a high rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am amazed at the rating this movie gets on here, and the number of people who give it positive reviews who I assume are avid film lovers. This is simply not a good movie, and you should all be ashamed of yourselves for confusing it with one.First, let's talk a little about what a film should have in order to be considered watchable. WritingThis is not a well written movie. Yes, there are lines of dialog, and yes those are written in a grammatically correct fashion, and yes we understand why people are saying what they're saying, but that doesn't make it well written. None of the dialog serves any purpose other than to allow our main character to spin his tale, and the reactions they have to it are hardly realistic and only there to serve the furthering of this story. Not the story in the film, because the film has no story, but the story that the main character is telling about himself. That's essentially all there is, which might be fine in a lecture hall, but that alone does not a film make.CharactersThese characters are what I think most people would consider "paper thin". In a normal movie, you get some basic understanding of who people are beyond their job description and how they're dressed. Not here though, as there's very little to go upon besides some vague caricatures of "professors" who we're supposed to believe are working professionals with degrees and such (except for one caricature of a student) but we're not given any evidence that they actually have anything more than a cursory knowledge of any subject they talk about. Instead we have a couple half-assed attempts at giving them personality traits that don't lend anything to the movie and no real reason to care about any of the characters or why they're there. That goes for the main character too. We don't care about him except for knowing the fundamental premise of the movie, which is supposed to make his character interesting, but really doesn't. His character only exists to spit out this story, which save for a few interactions with the other people in the room all of which fail to convince me that he's actually known these people for 10 years, is exactly what he does. ActingMaybe it's the fault of the writing, but the acting didn't even come off as all that good. I know you can't do much when you'e given stereotypical characters delivering ham-handed dialog, but I didn't see anything noteworthy from any of the actors or actresses involved. It actually reminded me at times of a group of real professors with no acting experience trying to act, although no academic would ever be caught dead reading this stuff out loud, and I doubt the actual actors were trying to act like they weren't acting.DirectionThe direction is basically nonexistent. It's not because it all takes place in one room. It's not because there's a lot of talking. It's because there was seemingly no interest in doing anything interesting with the camera. That's okay because there's nothing interesting done with the music, or with the cinematography, or anything production wise really, so at least it's consistent. ConceptHere we get down to brass tacks, because everyone who loves this movie presumably does so because of the fairly original concept of one man living through all the ages of human civilizations. On the surface I have no problem with this idea as I've never seen it played out before, but as this movie progressed it became clear how very self serving this concept is. My wife calls this an "ultimate white male fantasy" second only to the "one of the last men on earth and needing to rebuild civilization" trope of dystopian fiction. In this case, not only do you get to be a part of every major era in human history, and in one case being THE most important figure in history (taught by another very important figure in history), but you get to stay 35 forever, be more knowledgeable than your peers, and then you get to EXPLAIN IT ALL to them, even thought they don't end up believing you but that's okay because you know the truth and they don't (exasperated sigh). Don't even get me started on the "twist ending" as it wasn't really unexpected or mind blowing, and didn't even seem to be all that important to the main characters as the movie comes to a close, which if I actually cared for the movie would have infuriated me. I am giving this film 1 star, not because I disliked the movie, but because it fails on all levels as a movie. Film is supposed to be an art form. Art is not simply telling your audience to think about something and expecting them to think about it. Instead it's supposed to use every creative tool it can to get people to respond to it and think about it the way you want them to. Was this movie supposed to be only shown in first year History of World Cultures classes and used for discussion purposes? Even then, the ideas are really only mind blowing to those who haven't actually studied any comparative religion and seen the commonalities and differences among them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS AHEAD**** Lets get the good stuff out of the way shall we: The characters made me smile and the man's story was cute. Despite the fact it was silly, I had no problem suspending disbelief.Now to the bad: The filmmaker's attempt to create intellectuals was laughable. He should have stuck them in a library wearing jackets with patches, smoking pipes. I felt bad for real professors the world over. The character development spirals into the realm of the absurd when one of them pulls a gun. It boggles my mind how anyone can take this movie seriously after that.The ideas put forth are old but feel very preachy. It was like a child getting a new toy and telling everyone, with enthusiasm, to "look at this!" Organic living, and especially religion seemed to be focal points, but without actually adding a substantive argument. Just a story. Which is fine if you don't read too much into it. If you do, you might feel intellectually insulted.Being an avid sci-fi fan, I search through various sites from time to time to find new movies, books and shows. After finding this page I was really hopeful about this film. I felt trolled as the credits rolled, and if the same thing happened to you, I feel your pain. I won't speculate on those that were profoundly impacted by this movie. If you want original ideas, try the twilight zone or classic sci-fi novels. If you seek philosophy, there are deeper concepts on the front page of youtube.If you're lucky enough to make it through the first few pages of 10 star reviews, you will find better reviews than this that go into detail on the failures of this film. I hope this lands there, middle of the pack, in the realm of reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The screenplay was was written by Jerome Bixby,who wrote some Star Trek's best episodes &amp; one of the best 'sci-fi' films of the 1960's FANTASTIC VOYAGE.Richard Shenkman directed this 8 character,one set,87 fast minute film. There are no special effects,no nudity or sex,next to no foul language.We have 8 very scholarly professors at an impromptu farewell to one of them..This intelligent,interesting script deals with ideas &amp; our concepts &amp; beliefs.(SPOILER HINT. One of the 8 may be over 14,000 years old.).The cast is all from Television, I am going to name them all they do deserve the credit,They all are first rate.David Lee Smith, Tony Todd,Richard Riehlie, Ellen Crawford, John Billingsly,William Katt,Anaika Peterson,&amp; Alexis Thorpe.The setting is a near bare living room.Like the characters pay attention to what is said so do we, These may be very smart people, but they talk to each other &amp; not down to us as other talky films sometimes do.Over 25,000 voters on IMDb gave this a very high deserved rating of 8.1.It played mostly at film festivals &amp; in Europe &amp; Asia. Somehow this very fine film has yet to play on US screens of on Television.Look for this DVD &amp; view it,I am sure you will appreciate it.Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 93 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, great plot, one distasteful detail.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now that sci-fi movies are becoming all about special effects and lacking a good plot more and more, this movie does the exact opposite. We have to give it some credit for that in a time when our screens are polluted with plot less stories like "The day the earth stood still" or "I am legend".I was a bit annoyed by the fact that the story is somewhat offensive to Christianity. Don't take me as a fanatic, I'm not like the blond woman in the movie. I did find the comparison of the teachings of Buddha and Jesus interesting and worth a debate. But I do wonder why is it that all movies tend to take it to Christianity. It is very rare to find a movie that is offensive to Judaism (I can only recall The Passion), Islam, Buddhism, or any other religion. But you do see movies offensive to Christianity all over the place. They could have said the guy was one of the apostles and tell more or less the same story about Jesus and it would have been more tasteful and would have added more subtleties. You can say it wouldn't make such a strong impact in the viewers, buy hey! this movie is intended to be subtle, if you want to see a movie that readily makes an impact on the viewer you can watch any blockbuster sci-fi.I think the movie fell short on the whole bunch of stuff he could have said. But well, the movie can only last so long.</fullReview>

This piece of exquisite art is worth more than 100 other of the so called "movies". This is a mind boggling idea presented in a location that pushes you to focus on the idea not the surroundings including the actors themselves. Do not get me wrong, the whole cast is superb, but the shining star of this movie is its idea.The more general knowledge you have, the more you will be impacted by this movie, because you will recognize instantaneously the authenticity of the information that are going around between its characters. This will overcome the normal tendency of dismissing the information as unconfirmed, which may distract you from the essence of the movie. Add logical capacity to the general knowledge, and you will be stunned by every word and dialogue in this movie.To keep a long story short, Watch this movie no matter what type of audience you are, if you have some of the gray matter this movie will find a chord there to hit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I didn't know too much about the film when I started it, just the simple premise was all. After seeing the film, I'd liken it a bit to the "What the bleep do we know" films, as it covers similar ground, albeit from a different perspective. The actors did a pretty good job and the music set the tone quite well. Not sure where the previous commenter got the millions of dollars to produce figure, as it was all shot in a single location, or room for the matter, and there wasn't anything that would have cost near that figure within the film.Anyway, if you want a thought provoking film that you can enjoy, see again at a later date and still enjoy it, check it out. You won't be disappointed. While I wouldn't recommend seeing it in a theater, this film is best seen on DVD so you can watch it again and give it further thought. Great story put to film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than most indie films out there</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although I had the luxury of skipping over a few minutes of the movie, here and there, I was left feeling this was a grade above the average independent venture we are so used to getting. First of all, the acting was above-par for the obviously tiny budget this project was put together with. I was impressed with a few pro-like pans and close-ups by the cinematographer, and the scene transitions were also quite smooth for the most part. The dialog didn't appear too forced and at times transparently natural. It was enjoyable to watch and I found myself wanting to see it through to the end. This is much more than I can say for a lot of other low-budget flicks out there.On the flip-side, however, was the soundtrack. Other than a small classical interlude played by one of the characters, the viewers must endure a very amateurish performance by whoever that is playing their synthesizer in front of their computer with cheap software. I know these guys don't have the cash to afford the top names in composition, but the music was too often distracting. I found myself focusing on the cheap soft-synths when I should be listening to the excellent banter between the actors.I hate to be so picky when the producers had so little resources, but for the average viewer this might be not the favorite rental DVD. I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of cliché science-fiction and is looking for a stimulating mind-probe. However, don't expect to have your world-view shaken as some other reviewers seem to have experienced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that I had great expectations about this movie. Every review seems to praise it. However, when I finally saw it, I was very disappointed. Awful acting, cheesy dialog. Me and my friends always have a debate over religion and universe and almost every time it ends better than what I saw in this film. It has no memorable characters. The plot is very childish. Also, there is nothing revelatory in it. And nothing that I haven't thought about. The dialog is very cheesy and made me laugh, instead of thinking about the meaning of life. I do not recommend this film, unless you are a 14 years old looking for a couple of bible references.Call me narrow minded but for me, this is just another low-budget pompous crap.</fullReview>

It managed to include every obvious pseudo-science/new age/sci fi cliché. This movie would have been better left unfilmed, or at least unwatched by me. That's 87 minutes of my life i'll never get back. This has really tarnished Bixby's legacy (Mirror Universe, It! The Terror from Beyond Space, etc.). Also, whoever that guy who played the intolerable Dr. Phlox on Enterprise has lost what respect he never had from me. "Woman one on one." is also the worst line ever. The movie had no sense of plot whatsoever, no pacing, and repeated itself continuously. Character development was almost non-existent and unbelievable at best. Artlessly filmed, without even kitsch value. Preachy and cloying at the same time. I truly feel sorry for the estate of Jerome Bixby for having this film to remember him by.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More like a rough draft than a real movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It feels a little bit like the sort of script written by an enthusiastic teenager. A lot of the dialogue is terribly corny and over-the-top, and there are so many holes in the basic premise that it is frustrating to watch. How come no time in the last hundred years had he investigated the biological condition that makes him immortal? Surely sometime in the last 14000 years he would have been in a freak accident that would have left him permanently injured or killed (the odds of being stepped on by a mammoth for example must surely add up over the centuries). Why does nobody ask about the biological side of things - one of these guys is even a biologist but he doesn't seem particularly concerned about any of that. If he can not scar, then surely this provides an easy mechanism for them to test his story - just cut his arm and see how it looks in a few weeks - similarly he could have tested this out with the other immortal person he claimed to have met. Perhaps the worst mistake of all is making the psychologist fellow his son. (I'm not sure if this is actually what was implied but I'm sure as hell not going back to double check). The psychologist would have surely recognised his father from photographs, why would John talk about his previous identity so casually knowing that he might overhear - and why, despite his experience and knowledge is he unable to save him from the heart attack. This underdeveloped idea seemingly tacked on the end of the movie like an afterthought is inexpressibly terrible to watch. yuk.There's a lot more problems besides but I'm not going to waste any more time on this abysmal movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget bulk acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a complete mystery to me why this movie is rated this high. Looking at the reviews the high raters don't tell much about the movie quality but instead mention vague things like "concept" and "idea" and "big questions" and "originality". Guess they're up for a treat if they're impressed by this movie.The quality of acting is comparable with bulk acting you encounter in series like "The Outer Limits" for example; A bunch of expendable actors reading their script and emoting according to their script. Each of them is a baby-booming old type. Actually they're not all old. They dress like old people. It's the directors attempt to handle wardrobe due to the low budget I guess. More on that later.The scene is set in a single room in the house of the protagonist. A bunch of people listen to the ramblings of their friend they thought they knew. And then they say stuff which clearly comes off a script. And they forcibly act like they are supposed to. Whilst typing this review I'm also watching the movie once again just to make sure. I mean it, it looks like the actors never had acting lessons. Is it their fault? Often it's the director who doesn't know how to make good use of the actors. But one way or the other, it looks like stage acting by amateurs in a play meant for forgiving friends only.It's about a guy trying to come clean with new friends he made by revealing the truth (before leaving to some other place forever): he's not aging, he is 14000 years old already! Yep, he's seen it all, done it all, been everywhere. Cro Magnums and Columbus, no biggie. So he tells all this and his friends are like: "Shall we believe him? Science doesn't know everything you know. Are you a lunatic or a caveman?" (Yeah really, those questions were actually uttered as if it's a normal reaction to a friends insane ramblings)Don't expect anything special about effects or music. No effects and the music is standard bulk piano-play when we need sympathy for our main man. Like mentioned before, almost the entire scene is set in a single small(ish) living room with too many people. There were old people, professors and young pretty people and a wise calm Negro. No Asians or Arabs tho. It almost was a political correct movie. The cast just made me wanna puke because of it's lack of realism. It was too easy to notice how the cast was artificially assembled - that's the gist I'm trying to bring across here.Also like mentioned earlier, the wardrobe is horrible. The clothes were bought at a second hand store. Or maybe it was lying around in the basement of Wallmart. The director should have told the actors to bring their weekend clothing. That would have crated a much more realistic effect. Now it looks just silly. More like: oh I can see you're an actor. Gosh that leather jacket and those ?20 Jeans, you're the non-complex working class cool guy right? Right. And gosh, you have a sweater without sleeves over a dull beige blouse. The sweater has every color of the rainbow in it but the colors are all pale, like you washed it too often the past 20 years. I guess you're the old lady. What other hints do I have? Your grey hair and wrinkles? How stereotype. Keep wearing that.The reality is that this movie is cheap and a cop out. A topic was created, and the rest of the movie tries (too hard) to build a story around that. In the beginning the friends of the protagonist are gullible and at the end they become more than skeptical. Exactly what the movie needs. Something to drag the movie on and something to end the movie. That's why I gave the movie 2 stars: it ends at one point.</fullReview>

The idea that a prehistorical man could live to present day, is mind-blowing enough to make this an amazing movie. Sadly it was not what I expected. Poorly casting, invalid arguments from historical and geographical point of view, acting was horrible in the case of some characters. In the first 30 min of the movie i was still waiting for that "something", that mysterious "something" this kind of movies have. Right until the last 20-30 min. of the movie it gave the impression of a under- medium movie. Everything looked very low-budget. Some characters pushed-it too hard, but the drop that filled the glass was when the main character admits to be Jesus, and that he learned everything from Budha. Even more,he also denys whole of Christianity and admits to be the father of one of the characters which turned out to be a awful placed plot twist. Overall opinion: Awful.

Why? Because they're so bloody insecure in their atheist stupidity that they cant feel good unless everyone else believes the bull that they do.Atheist reviewer "ian" even dares tells everyone not to bring religion into the reviews, yet he spends like an hour writing his own patented total ignoramus views on religion himself. Poser.Oh, poor boy, like you would know anything at all about the truth anyway. You even mention Russell's fallacious teapot argument. Amazing.Go suck up to that other atheist drone ignoramus Dawkins - count his stupid &amp; ignorant "friends" on that too.. Your atheist high priests of fallacious logic, ridiculously poor historical knowledge, outright fraud and inane drone theories are not required in your own movie "reviews"."The atheist risk everything for the present and the future, on the basis of a belief that we are uncaused by any intelligent being. We just happen to be here. That one is willing to live and die in that belief is a very high price to pay for conjecture." - Ravi Zacharias"To be an atheist requires an indefinitely greater measure of faith than to receive all the great truths which atheism would deny." - Joseph Addison,The Spectator, Mar. 8, 1711"The habit of arguing in support of atheism, whether it be done from conviction or in pretense, is a wicked and impious practice." - Marcus Tullius Cicero 106?43 B.C.atheists are for the most part imprudent and misguided scholars who reason badly who, not being able to understand the Creation, the origin of evil, and other difficulties, have recourse to the hypothesis the eternity of things and of inevitability....." - VoltaireStill, even the most admirable of atheists is nothing more than a moral parasite, living his life based on borrowed ethics. This is why, when pressed, the atheist will often attempt to hide his lack of conviction in his own beliefs behind some poorly formulated utilitarianism, or argue that he acts out of altruistic self-interest. But this is only post-facto rationalization, not reason or rational behavior. -Vox DayA disbelief in God does not result in a belief in nothing; disbelief in God usually results in a belief in anything."My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such violent reaction against it? A man feels wet when he falls into water, because man is not a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course, I could have given up my idea of justice by saying that it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too -for the argument depended on saying that the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my private fancies. Thus in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist -another words, that the whole of reality was senseless -I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality--namely my idea of justice--was full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple. If the whole universe has no meaning, we should never have found out that it has no meaning: just as, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. Dark would be without meaning." - C.S. Lewis =======================Keep your religious slime to yourself Ian or get lost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing Me...!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know if this movie made by minimum budget, but for me nothing special, doesn't fulfill my expectations.The movie run in slow tempo, the setting just in living room and porch for several times. Many says the actor and actress is good, but for me their just amateur, rigid, and boring (especially Harry).Like i say their rigid so the conversation itself, more worse because they just sit down in the living room until the end of movie. I thought there's some surprises like modern technology implementation into the movie, pass time scene while John Oldman telling his life, or something dazzle, but it ain't seen.Too good to be true if John Oldman was Jesus even for sci-fi movie like this, they should unpack the pass 17.000 years history to build the image so the unreal seem's very real, story telling just don't make sense, not well concept ed like Da Vinci Code that giving controversy but make sense if u see from science side.Last words... Rigid, boring scene, silly conversation, not well concept ed, the actress and actors just an amateur. It's Just Don't Make Sense at All...!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entirely spoiler driven review."Well Jesus was a man, who traveled through the land. A hard working man and brave" wrote Woody Guthrie in his folk song simply entitled "Jesus Christ". But was Jesus really a caveman who simply wouldn't die and just kept on living. Well, if so, even that Woody Guthrie song wouldn't be wrong.As John Oldman (Smith) gets ready to leave yet another place his friends and colleagues don't want him to leave without a proper goodbye. Touched by their gesture, and somewhat itching to reveal himself, Oldman discloses the reason why he continually keeps moving on every 10 years or so and never settles down; he's in fact a Cro-Magnum caveman who's 14.000 years old. Along the way he's met some famous people (Van Gough among them) and, oh yes, he was also that biblical guy we know as Jesus Christ.Naturally this doesn't go all that well with his friends and colleagues who fear John may have gone off the deep end. The entire movie takes place in John's cabin where he explains his life and slowly convinces the troupe of it's truth. Is this man in fact a 14.000 year old caveman or simply a terrific liar? Well, you'll never know. You either believe him or you don't. Like faith itself, it's not very logical but anything's possible, right? In fact, the film goes on for about 3 minutes too long with a needles revelation that sort of undermines the undeniably excellent dialog and solid performances that leave the viewer in deep thought."The Man From Earth" is a very simple and an entirely dialog driven movie and that's what gives it it's charm. The low-key approach, solid performances and interesting discussions make it a thought provoking little sleeper hit that deserves even more recognition. If only it had ended a little bit sooner and left viewers hanging even more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know... It's interesting for a start and is clever. I know a few people that would be interested by this movie I'll send them DVD's for Christmas.I only came to watch it after reading about how the director embraced P2P and other people liked it. I downloaded it and sent the equivalent of a movie ticket PayPal donation. Worth it indeed.Since he also asked me to rate and leave a comment I thought, sure :)I've thought about what it would be like to live for a really long time. To be around when things happen and then see the event evolve in its retelling as time went on. Like in the movie with the whole Jesus and religion thing. I reckon Jesus isn't what he is made out to be today.Cool movie, get it and watch it :D</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No plot holes, but ... "what's my motivation?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderful "what if"-drama. Intelligent script, with no plot holes.But, it somewhat fails on the characters: To quote the classics: "What's my motivation?!!" I thought the anger of the Motorcycle Professor and the religious Professor was strange and a tat unconvincing. Why would they be MAD at him? Why soooo mad? Remember, this was before he said he was Jesus. Irritated, yes, but so mad? In other words: "What was their motivation?" Odd. If a good friend, whose behaviour always has been perfectly nice and normal, suddenly starts making preposterous but otherwise harmless claims, the proper reaction isn't anger, but mere wonderment, worry and maybe irritation. But this anger? That was exaggerated. Maybe it's more convincing in the book, I do hope so.Another thing seemingly 'wrong' with it could have been the lack of curiosity in the group in general, but on second thought Bixby actually covered that nicely. Question remains, whether John could not have foreseen that revealing himself to his son, would cause a heart attack? Or was that a mercy killing?Of course, this is called Sci-Fi for lack of a better and handier label upon which to sell this film. It isn't really Sci-Fi, not even by the broadest definition. It's Fantasy, maybe even science fantasy, or Science Speculation. Or Futuristic Drama, although, with it's focus on the past, that seems a wrong label too. It's definitely of the same ilk as K-Pax, and it's in line with the old philosophical idea of: How would you know if you were talking to a person or a super intelligent computer, if you could never see the one you were talking to? Or with the notion that nothing can be proved for certain, only with a great amount of likelihood.It's rather sad, but also a support of of sorts, to notice that the ALL the negative-hater comments obsess about one of the following two things, or both: [1] The so called bad SOUNDtrack (yes, I'm serious!) I mean, WHAT DA F... is that, right?[2] The films' perceived attack on religion.It doesn't actually attack religion, but American Christianity is so insecure these days, that even the slightest remarks will be perceived as an all out, conspiratorial attack on religion!! ;)This extremely shallow level of criticism is yet another indication that this is a quality film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a person who says, "Sorry; don't like Science Fiction," then put your prejudices on the shelf for a minute and rent this.But, that said, I will also say: If the mere showcasing of a really thoughtful and artful script given life by largely unknown but undeniably talented actors--with basically zilch special effects--is not enough for you, then you *will* be disappointed; don't watch it.Nowadays, a story guy (or gal) comes up with a concept, perhaps writes the script, then that script is relegated to a script doctor. The results have been mixed; sometimes quite good. But I usually feel I can see the seams; you can detect the smell of a creative production line. Although it took its cues from a simple core concept, The Man from Earth doesn't feel like it. It feels organic and whole and genuine. This is true drama; and it's got a killer concept at its heart--one to have thoughtful viewers pondering for years to come.If you like great drama and fantastic dialog, watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Treatist On Human-Kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Oldman (David Lee Smith) has been a history professor for ten years and is now preparing to move away from the school he's dedicated a decade to. The reasons are initially his own until a group of his fellow friends and professors come by to say goodbye and he drops a bombshell on them; he claims to be a caveman who's lived eons and eons, witnessing historical events and even being part of that history that we thought we knew.The group of professors that come by to send him off are a complex group: a religious studies professor, another that's an English prof, a psych prof, and a few others that round out a pretty decent world view.Initially all of John's fellow colleagues challenge him, but his arguments are solid and disturbing. But is John for real? Or does he need psychotropic medications? The thing about THE MAN FROM EARTH is that it's a stage-play put into film form. The entire movie is pure character exposition and dialogue with no action, flashbacks, or other techniques most movie-goers have become accustomed to. And this is both a strength and a weakness. The strength comes from the strong scripting of the dialogue that keeps the viewer interested and wondering how it will all pan out. The weakness is that it makes for incredibly slow pacing. Thankfully the The Man From Earth is only 87 minutes long, not stretching out its length and thus causing great yawns from the watchers.The other strength within the movie is the acting. All of the characters were believable and the actors and actresses played their parts very well (being frustrated or angry or sad or scared, etc.). But the filming was tough to watch. Too many times the shots looked grainy or underexposed, giving it a B-movie feel; that was unfortunate.Even so, this is an interesting treatise on humanity and how we might deal with the unexplainable should a friend thrust a near impossible quandary upon us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all we make clarify what is ten point movie? If the answer e.g "Blade Runner", then this movie deserves just 2 or 3 points. Why? 'cos this looks like a documentary rather than a movie. Yeah, let's say I'm atheist and I've searched lots of religions (just two of them), science and mythology from a certain point of view and I developed a theory, oops I inspired then I wrote it... Let's accept that in terms of cinematography, acting, dramatic structure this movie is not worth to discuss about it. Please don't get me wrong, I am not against the idea of very low budget kinda technique... In fact I love it e.g Linklater's Tape. That's a brilliant work not this one. For that reason "the man from earth" has one thing to talk about that is the "caveman" theory. Yeah it's a interesting theory but not new! The idea and the twist (Jesus Christ!) weren't surprising for me 'cos I'm kinda used to it. In my country we have a specialist academician (M. Ilmiye C&#x131;g) about how ancient cultures did invent and influence religions and lots of things related (and I'm sure every country has...). For that reason for me, this movie's topic is so familiar 'cos I've eye-witnessed to this sort of topic in a discussion at many times. Cinema is an art and art requires creativity. This is just a reporting documentary. By the way, at the finale if john wouldn't decipher himself as Jesus, dramatic structure'd be better but again not brilliant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't for everyone. It is not a very visual(with that said, the framing is well-done and the editing is tight) film, it's rather simply done(not in a bad way) and there are no FX in it. This is driven entirely by story-telling and dialog. If you are open to having your perceptions challenged and to hear compelling ideas and arguments presented well, this will provide a ton of food for thought. There are "twists" to the plot, but it's really not the focus. I will not give away any of the concepts, though I will say that there are those that will find this offensive. The characters are credible and the acting is spot-on. This has a great cast, everyone is well-chosen. Todd is magnificent as always, in one of his least aggressive roles. This is the first time I've seen Katt in, well, not a B-movie, and his performance is impressive. The sense of humor is very good, and the amount is fitting. This has a very well-written and developed script. Unsurprising, as it's from a man who used to do Star Trek: The Original Series and Twilight Zone. The score is appropriate. Sound stood out to me a little, I can't quite place why; not in a negative way. This is largely scientifically and psychologically accurate, though it doesn't hold up to close scrutiny. The ambiguity is nice. There is a little mild language in this. The DVD comes with two fun and interesting commentary tracks(that have infrequent swearing), one with director and Billingsley and one with Emerson(Jerome's son) Bixby and sci-fi scholar Gary Westfahl, as well as four well-done, informative featurettes, coming to 11,5 minutes total. I recommend this to fans of the genre and everyone who enjoys intellectual pictures. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Promising content - somewhat lacking execution.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that I enjoyed this movie. It was a nice break from the mainstream action and thrillers, as it actually encourages thought in its viewers. However, it's clear to me that the movie would've benefited greatly from a larger budget.The movie focuses on the discussion that occurs when a professor makes a claim to be a 14000 year old man from before the bronze period. The others, also professors and experts in various fields, start to discuss the possibilities, the reasoning and the philosophical aspects of the seemingly impossible claim.While it focuses mostly on the dialog and interaction between the various personalities, it doesn't loose it's pace, and it has a strange captivating power that keeps your interested and makes it a movie to actually remember years later.It's drive, I think, can be traced back to the movies span of characters, and their intriguing interaction and mysterious past. When introduced to them, you want to know each one's background and personalities. They are somewhat stereotyped, but this is due to the lack of time to flesh them out - I could see hints to deeper things beneath the surface.The actors do what they can with the script, but I'm only half-way convinced anyway. Some may say that the editing and camera-angles can be partially blamed, and I can agree to that as well, but still I think the actors could've acted more multi-faceted - their acting comes though as somewhat one-dimensional.Now, I have to take on the script as well. The interaction between the characters is, as I said, one of the things that makes up the movies drive, but it's also got it's flaws. The reactions and actions of the characters often seems crude. In that, I mean that they do things that don't seem very logical at their timing. My brows furrowed more than once in disbelief of their reactions.I think the crude reactions can be traced back to the movie failing to give the impression of more time passing than the dialog gives. The movie seems to be in real-time throughout, and thus, the complete movie, to the audience, takes place in the same time-space - about one and a half hours.The story itself could also, in my eyes, been better. It has some detail, but the details could've been less straight forward, the theories and philosophical angles not as deep or meaningful as I would like.Finally, the sound was decent, with exception of the music that was distracting sometimes, at one point drowning out the dialog to the point I was expecting a frame-shift that never happened. The set, editing and camera-movement all show lack of proper professional equipment, but it's not worse than mediocre.The movie has an intriguing base, but it's budget hamstrings it. With a big budget, I can imagine that this movie could be a big box-office success, but this is sadly only wishful thinking. The somewhat crude script and simple theories that can, mostly, be found in elementary-school, makes me want to recommend this movie to teenagers more than the older guard. Still, it's a movie I found enjoyable, if only because of the personalities and its nature.PS. The movie includes a single swear-word as far I could tell. A little strange, and I reacted when I heard it.. why they chose to include it, I cannot tell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A science-fiction film built on ideas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a sad truth that the vast proportion of modern science-fiction films exist solely as visual-effects showcases, discarding any notions of intelligence in favour of the latest CGI technology. However, necessity is also the mother of invention, and, given a minuscule budget with which to produce a film, some filmmakers uncover enough talent to compensate for their monetary shortcomings, relying on good writing to make their film great. A film that emerged from nowhere {thanks primarily to illegal BitTorrent downloading, according to producer Eric D. Wilkinson}, Richard Schenkman's 'The Man from Earth (2007)' is one of the most intelligent, thought-provoking science-fiction films I've seen in a very long time. Overflowing with fascinating scenarios and revolutionary possibilities, it is a sci-fi film built entirely on ideas. The excellent screenplay was written by Jerome Bixby, a notable science-fiction author, who also penned the monster flick 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space (1958).' The concept behind this particular film was first envisioned in the 1960s, though it wasn't until 1998 that Bixby completed the story.It seems like a scenario that might have been snatched from the pages of a science-fiction novel: imagine that an unaging Cro-Magnon cave-man has survived for the last 14000 years, enduring millennia of dramatically-changing lifestyles and landscapes. This man has seen the rise and fall of leaders, empires and religions; the transition from nomadic clans to villages to towering metropolises. As the human race understood more and more about the world around him, so, too, did this survivor continue to learn. Now imagine that a fellow co-worker, whom you have known for the past ten years, suddenly declares himself to be such a man! On the eve of his departure from a college, John Oldman (David Lee Smith) hosts an impromptu farewell party at his vacated residence. To the surprise of his colleagues, given his reputation as an honest and sensible man, John begins to make these controversial assertions about his identity, raising countless irresistible scientific, philosophical and theological questions.Stylistically, 'The Man from Earth' most closely resembles Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men (1957),' in that both films take place, with a few minutes' exception, in the one room, and rely heavily on dialogue to propel the plot. The performers here are, of course, light-years away from the likes of Henry Fonda and Jack Warden, but, in a picture dominated by words over actions, each actor brings an interesting personality to the table. I was particularly impressed with David Lee Smith, who gives to the leading character a mixture of confidence, mystery and sincerity that is perfect for the role. The other actors, including John Billingsley, Ellen Crawford, William Katt, Richard Riehle, Annika Peterson and Tony Todd, do well at representing their given professions, evaluating John's outlandish claims using specialist knowledge of their respective fields. The weakest performance comes from Alexis Thorpe as student Linda Murphy, who is really given very little to do, and would have served the film better if she had been removed entirely.Though Jerome Bixby's screenplay is undoubtedly intelligently-written, I found myself dissatisfied with the conclusion to the story - John's relationship with Sandy (Annika Peterson) was too hackneyed to be taken seriously, and the final twist involving Dr. Will Gruber (Richard Riehle) was much too contrived. In my view, the film should have ended with John "admitting" to everyone that the story was merely a playful fabrication, leaving both the characters and the audience with a niggling sensation of uncertainty: was John telling the truth, after all? As it is, the current ending leaves us is no doubt that John is, indeed, a Cro-Magnon from 14000 years ago, but there are some things that we shouldn't need to be told with complete certainty. A more ambiguous ending would most definitely provoke intense further discussion, which is, I think, the most that any science-fiction film could ever strive to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While The Man from Earth is technically a Science Fiction film, it's also one of the most spiritual stories I have ever seen in my ENTIRE life! What a sheer delight to be caught totally off guard! I'll even admit I started sobbing!Having been raised as both a spiritual person and a devout member of a particular religious faith, this film triggered some very powerful primordial feelings I have never experienced before! Towards the end of the film - when one of the story's characters starts crying - (for reasons that are quite obvious to me) - I put two &amp; two together, and felt a very strong urge to prostrate my self on the floor! The act of prostrating one's self comes out of an ancient spiritual tradition to show one's adoration and respect in a most profound way!!Having studied many different spiritual l traditions, I would have to say the insights gained by watching The Man from Earth are nothing short of brilliant. Even though this is a work of fiction, one can certainly speculate! This is film making at its very best! Thank you Hollywood for a creating such a poignant masterpiece!

		<fullReview>Like many other reviewers my first impression was that there was something wrong with the acting. It seemed stilted and unnatural (not that I could do better!). Unlike other reviewers I don't think that it improved as the movie progressed - you just get used to it.The movie has an interesting premise which it explores in detail off and on for about two thirds of its length - if you encountered a man who claimed to have lived for 14k years, what could he tell you to prove it? The other third is typical Hollywood Christian bashing. It follows the usual template. First you introduce characters purported to be highly intelligent professors and scientists. This gives their sophomoric pontifications credibility with the audience. Then you throw in a hysterical "Christian literalist" to show what anti-intellectual idiots Christians really are. Sci-Fi books often follow the same tedious template. If they wanted to do something original they should have tried bashing a different religion for a change, like Islam. That would have been bold! And maybe even worth the price of a rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>movie watchers today for some reason go for special effects and explosions and razzle dazzle. followed by advertising budgets more than other films production. all of which can easily mask a rehashed same-old same-old with lots of technology. not so this story. the tension builds gradually at first, in an innocuous enough manner, and then the lead characters drops the bombshell. I look for realism in a story, even sci-fi like this. It is my opinion that the explanations and statements made by the characters are the kind of exchange that would happen in this situation. that he has only vague recollection of his becoming aware he was special, and historic events, and the fact it is impossible for him to ever 'catch up' to all the knowledge of the contemporary times. inevitably the film paints itself into a corner a little bit here and there, but it's called 'suspension of disbelief', considering the subject of the film. so if you can get past that you are in for a remarkable and unique and most entertaining story. the high marks on IMDb are well earned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will temper the many rave reviews with another perspective so you can decide if you think this movie would be for you or not.The title is prefaced with Jerome Bixby's name. This explains the high rankings it gets: People who watch it already know and care who Jerome Bixby is and are most likely fans. Those who already know they don't like Jerome Bixby's work will give the movie a miss. I never heard of Bixby and I'm not a particular sci-fi fan although I'm not completely ignorant of it. Who will like this script: (1) People who think Star Trek is deep and profound. (2) People who think Bertrand Russell is a great thinker. If you are neither of those, my guess is you are likely to think this script is sophomoric and tedious.I read that Bixby wrote this on his death bed, his last work. Seems obvious he needed a vehicle to make clear his views on religion before he passed on. What disappointed me was that after a life time of creative work this script supposedly represents the greatest depths of his thinking. The whole time I watched this I was thinking, "You're kidding. That's the best you can come up with?"It's nicely filmed and nicely acted. Good atmosphere. A couple of nice touches here and there. These are all due to the director and cinematographer. Sorry, but I just can't get passed the puerile philosophizing that supposedly represents the culmination of the writer's intellectual insight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I often hear the phrase Sci-Fi used alongside this movie, which put me off when I realized that there was none of the usual special FX hi-jinks and action I would come to expect from something billed as Sci-Fi. It would be similar to watching an episode of Star Trek only to see all the actors sitting in a cabin and drinking wine and talking and the viewer feeling gypped of his time and money. Reading the other reviews here helped me decide to actually watch it-- but I had to wait a day or two to be in the right mood to watch without prejudice.Don't think of this movie not as Sci-Fi, but as a Play.A Man admits to his friends and colleagues that he is nearly immortal and has lived throughout human History. Now what would their reactions be? There isn't anything wildly Sci-Fi about the concept. All it would theoretically take is a genetic mutation, a DNA fluke. No superpowers. No lightning bolts from the fingers. Just the ability of the body to continue to repair itself-- endlessly. What would such a person be like? Or would it be just as shocking to hear that he or she is as normal as You &amp; me? What would YOUR reaction, and those of your close friends be, if one of your own friends stood up at a quiet party and announced the same thing? And he was serious? What would you believe? What would you think afterward? What questions would you ask? What proofs would you demand? Would it matter?That's what this movie is about. Friendship, Belief and Disbelief. Intelligence and dialogue and questions taking place in a very ordinary house with everyone sitting around in the livingroom, wrestling with their own innate disbelief.The movie had a very ordinary pace-- like a discussion over a dinner table during a late afternoon with friends. Different. Mature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one good thing this movie has going for it is a very interesting story idea. The greatest American hero could have pulled back on his righteous indignation, they were supposed to be friends and all these people had turned up to see their supposed friend off as he got ready to leave for another town.The music was pretty average, especially that closing credits song. none of it did any good for enhancing the mood or flow of the song, but that still didn't stop this movie from being worthwhile. did I mention it had an intriguing story idea.the other good thing (make that 2 good things then) was the main character David lee smith. he did a very believable job of a guy who may or may not have lived through all that. good work.the whole thing feels like a stage play, but still, I was kept thinking well after the movie finished. top makes for bringing this story to the screen, if not for skill in film making.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A teacher's farewell get together with his colleagues takes a surprising turn when he confides to his friends that he is a 14,000 year old caveman.Sounds fun right? Well it could've been had it not very quickly turned into a coddling, new age Christian apologist fable.What we have here are the production values of a non-action 90s Star Trek episode, it felt very much like watching re-runs on the Sci-Fi channel on a rainy Saturday afternoon.What this basically boils down to is a second coming fantasy, where all the centuries of fire and brimstone are brushed aside by a handsome and just very misunderstood Jesus who was just a nice guy who studied under Buddah and somehow got his humble teachings twisted by the cogs of Empire. So far, so Zeitgeist - and they do cover much the same ground as the now creaky but influential pop-conspiracy documentary.The film felt like something well-meaning but naive American Christians can watch with their kids to show them what a righteous dude Jesus is. I'm sorry, but this doesn't excuse centuries of murder, abuse and subjugation by people in power who use religion for their own gain. At a time when such groups around the globe are STILL using dusty old Iron Age myths to justify their hateful ideologies - I say it's time to stop giving religion a free pass just because some people want to redact the bad parts and pretend the sole purpose of religion is just free hugs. I say it's time to throw the baby out with the bathwater - they both stink.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't dig into it. It's pointless. Watch it if you like the extreme polar opposite of religious fanaticism, i.e., atheism. Dealing in absolutes is equally silly in both directions. Bottom line, this film is absurd, illogical, horribly written, terribly acted and ultimately, sinfully arrogant. Militant liberals will love it of course, hence the "rave" reviews in contrast to my otherwise humble, perhaps more centered and calm observation. I too hate annoying CGI as well as any nonsensical dramatization atop what might otherwise be a good flick by written merit alone, but here, I would have taken shaky-cam + computer generated dinosaurs fighting with 8-legged aliens in middle-earth over this. It's that bad, just in the opposing direction on the scale of extremities. Those who might find this entertaining have failed to understand which books in life are a must read, although they have certainly read many of the nonsensical ones. I'm, sure! Simple as that. Details? No spoilers here, but imagine you and a small group of friends get REALLY stoned, and then gather in a room to discuss what might be the groundbreaking answer to why your mouth makes noises when you move your lips and push air between them, and such that others are able to then understand said noises and reply in kind, in the end, the entire group reaching a consensus that they have discovered the answer to human communication and the means by which to bridge all obstacles of such. That about sums up the genius of this little gem, albeit less entertaining than my analogy. If you have a brain then my advice is, stay home and roll one. While only idiots do drugs, only bigger idiots enjoy movies like this one.</fullReview>

The premise is extremely weak not to mention implausible that I had to roll my eyes more than a couple of times. The fact that anyone would believe this guy without proof was beyond annoying.I found so many contradictions and things that didn't make sense that I am surprised it wasn't listed in the goof section on this site. No surprise because apparently this movie could do no wrong.For one Jesus was born, a man didn't just come around and said I am 'Jesus' he was a baby than he grew up. As for Buddha this didn't make sense at all because they kept a lot of records about Buddha and no where have I read that he taught some white man named Jesus. I guess the western nation doesn't realize or chooses to ignore this fact but this was so teeth grindingly annoying that I had to stop watching it.Was so bad that I couldn't even finish the film.</fullReview>

I believe this film only appeals to SciFi fans completely and totally involved in SciFi-ness. I love SciFi but I love good film, more. The film should really not have even been filmed, it might be an alright play, a good book, who knows. The acting is mediocre, script is terribly dry and matter-a-fact, which I think is why SciFi-ers love it. It falls short because it's like a book narration, almost like a text book narration, ha, truly. This film doesn't deserve this much of a high rating for the simple fact that it's not a good FILM. This all said, it did suck me in in certain parts but it was mostly when I laid another window over the window I was downloading the movie on. Oh, and that guy who played the alien doctor on Star Trek (the last series) was not too bad of an actor, except he was a bit too exaggerated as was everyone else in the film.</fullReview>

Really, you would think that at some point these loonies would get tired of making up their silly speculations and of hearing themselves talk as much as the rest of us!

		<shortDescription>Science Fiction? Not at All. Just Fiction.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, after the first 20 minutes I had a hundred stumpers to ask this guy, and I'm to believe that all these college professors couldn't come up with anything? I barely passed high school, and I certainly don't have any degrees, but I could have easily produced some trickier responses to the nutcase in the film. Oh, and at no time did I feel like this guy was 14,000 years old. And the acting was poor all the way around - with no exceptions for anyone. Here's a sample of questions the "professors" could have asked:"Do you have dentures?" Teeth do not regenerate, so a 14,000 year old man wouldn't have a single trace of a tooth left. They would have rotted, or at least worn away. If this guy has any of his own teeth - he's a fake. It would have been one of my first questions.*******SPOILER******** *******SPOILER******** *******SPOILER******** If this dude was Jesus, speak me some Aramaic. Hell, give me 4 or 5 idioms in Aramaic. Those goobers didn't ask him to speak any languages, they weren't even curious. He would have known dozens of dead languages, and known them intimately. So, give me 4 or 5 idioms in 4 or 5 dead languages. Hell, language should have kept them bastards busy for hours and days. They could have stumped that faker a million times. But, no, they let him off the hook for some reason.Oh, and the biggest question to ask, "Did you learn a language in your first few years of life?" Science has long known that the part of the brain that controls speech must be developed very early in childhood. The study of feral children has proved repeatedly that they are unable to learn language beyond a handful of words, certainly not enough to form complex sentences or to get multiple degrees and teach college. By ascertaining if this cavedude learned a complex language in the beginning or not, well, everything would hinge on that. If his caveman language was only a system of grunts and not complex sentences, his brain would never be able to learn Latin or Greek, or any other language.See? Them be some real "science" questions, and the director totally avoided all traces of science. Indeed, throughout the entire movie everyone admitted that they stuck to the history books. History books are not science, thus this movie is not science fiction. It is something a child would have come up with, but only a child who hadn't given it much thought.There's tons of other things that could have made this charlatan "cave" in. I felt his constant excuses were very flimsy - he simply couldn't remember much of anything. Except being Jesus, of course. And that's what this movie ultimately ends being about. It's simply a jab at Christianity. Whoopty doo. I don't find jabbing a particular religion sufficient to make a movie worth watching. It certainly didn't cover up the poor research and amateur acting.Watch this if you're a boring person who doesn't think for himself/herself, and especially if you want to see Christianity debunked via a poorly worked bit of fiction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre philosophy, packaged in a mediocre film with a lackluster ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me say that, after watching this movie, I am fairly surprised to see that it has an 8 out of 10 rating here on IMDb. It started out slowly and was had to follow at times. Shortly after the beginning, once the plot and characters were fairly established, the film was somewhat interesting to me. There were some interesting intellectual points made in the dialog between the characters; certainly not things that I think about or talk about in the average day--and I suspect I am not alone in that--and so watching this movie was somewhat thought-provoking and interesting for me at times. I got the idea about a third of the way through the movie that the writer was interested in promoting an atheistic/agnostic viewpoint, at least as a subtext of the film. Then, about two-thirds in, the 14,000 year old main character drops the bomb: he is/was Jesus Christ. In the film, the character resists sharing that information, and only does so when pressed. But, it is clear that the writer of the film is/was at the time of writing a non-believer (or why would he have written this film?) and is interested in proclaiming that belief through this work of fiction. Just now, as I type this review, it strikes me that even the title of the film, "The Man from Earth", is clearly, after watching the movie, anti-Christian; that is, the title clearly implies that Jesus Christ was only a "Man from Earth", not God from heaven. I'm not sure why the writer didn't title the film, "The man from Earth", (lower case 'm') for a bit of pseudo-clever subtle emphasis of the apparent main thrust of his writing. From the point at which the title character revealed that he was allegedly the one called Jesus Christ during that part of his 14,000 year life, I kind of tuned out, but I didn't turn it off, because I thought the ending must be somehow particularly good for the movie to receive such high reviews here. Well, I was wrong. The movie puttered out slowly, just like it began. As I mentioned above, there is some dialog here and there that many would find interesting. And, if you dislike Christianity or Christians or you have an atheistic/agnostic world view, then you may well find this film overall somewhat enjoyable. However, I feel that this film was mediocre at best, and your time would be much better spent--whether your aim is entertainment or intellectual stimulation--on some activity other than watching this movie.</fullReview>

Then, when you, incredulous, unbelieving are amazed that I would say this stuff. I say forget I said it, but it's true and offer no proof whatsoever. This film does exactly that, it takes place in one location and is basically a bunch of professorial types debating the premise that a stone age man has lived 14,000 years and along the way met Buddah was Jesus and met a few well known famous artists. He also travelled east "towards the sun" over the centuries coming to the mediterranean sea and later arriving in India which seems to have moved since those times.His aces in the hole are that he likes to have a fire nearby because it is comforting and keeps danger away, and he can smell rain coming. Apart from that he knows something about his fellow colleagues work, life and some of there family history. Finally he recants and everyone knows he's lying, but is he. Very thought provoking my my thought was which one of these actors will ever work again.</fullReview>

This isn't a movie at, it's a persons attack on Christianity. A complete mockery of the Christian faith and the Bible.After a while the movie looses it's charm, because nothing is really happening at all. This isn't a science fiction movie at all, this is a religious themed movie, set out to confuse people. It's a shame.This movie could have been great, if it didn't have the twist it has. But without the twist this movie would not have been made at all, since the twist is the purpose of the movie. It's obvious the writer really has a grudge against Christianity and the Bible, otherwise you wouldn't go through such length trying to discredit it.If you want a good science fiction movie, skip this one and get something else. I really fail to see how this movie even can be considered thought provoking at all. It just follows the roads and reasoning we all heard before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILER ALERT! Although fiction may use real people and real events along with or instead of imaginary characters, my view is that it crosses the line and becomes an egregious act of slanderous defamation and calumnious denigration when it deliberately distorts the reality of a historically prominent figure and maliciously misrepresents historical events surrounding that person. So although I was initially intrigued by the unfolding of events in this movie, I eventually felt only disgust when I realized the multi-faceted implications of what they were stupidly suggesting...not merely smearing the ancestral origins of Jesus but venturing way beyond that to attack His teachings. Whereas modern Christianity has shifted the emphasis from the religion OF Jesus to a religion ABOUT Jesus, that is still not the same thing as a denial of His identity or a rejection of His words. Upon first hearing the erroneous accusation that Jesus used the term "Master" but not "Father", the first thing that came to mind was the first two words of The Lord's Prayer that Jesus authored: "OUR FATHER". The character of John Oldman never really offers any contemporary evidence that he was who he claimed to be. In my final take on the film, I realized that the author leaves enough room for personal interpretation (despite some of the unexpected revelations near the end pertaining to John's alleged family connection to Dr. Will Gruber that could have been loosely based on data-mining research) to at least allow a serious consideration of the distinct possibility that John Oldman is indeed certifiably crazy and as a deeply pathological liar, has convinced both himself and his professional associates that these grandiose delusions of divinity-flavored lunacy that have faithfully blossomed with the passing of time in the forever-fragrant garden of his psychotically-fertilized mind are indeed just as verifiably true as a caveman's encounter with pain when he sets his toes on fire to keep them warm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting and clever...but not exactly "sci-fi"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very well written film that is fascinating throughout, but I can't understand IMDb listing it as sci-fi--though there are very strong fantasy elements. What I liked best about the film is that it was made with an apparently minuscule budget and most of it took place in a single room (like TWELVE ANGRY MEN)--showing you don't need explosions, boobs or action to have an excellent film.THE MAN FROM EARTH begins with a professor packing up to leave. With little notice, he's decided to drop everything and leave--and he's told no one where he's headed. His colleagues are baffled--he is a good friend and yet none of this makes sense. Not only is his exit a surprise, but he's leaving a good job and they see no reason for this. Then, on a lark, he tells them that he's actually a 15000 year-old immortal--that he ALWAYS disappears every 10 years--otherwise people would wonder why he never seems to age.While this is an exciting premise, the film is highly philosophical in nature with very strong religious overtones. In fact, these religious elements are bound to offend many people. My advice is just to remember that it's all a story--it's not true and it's just a clever way to explain various religious dogmas. You can still be a good religious person and see this film! The film gets super-high marks for writing--with a story that grabs your attention and won't let go. It also gets very high marks as well for a great ensemble cast. While some of the character actors are quite familiar, it's likely you don't know any of their names. The film has no "big name" actors and actually benefited from this--heightening the sense of realism. Plus, the cast did such a great job, I can't imagine others doing better.The only reservation I have is that I can't imagine super hyperactive or many teenagers enjoying this film--you really need to sit still and pay attention and be willing to accept a film that is very "talky" and subdued. For these folks, try looking elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER* Good GOD this was awful! If someone has missed the basic point: it is about a man who's lived 14.000 years, and who is now about to move on. This he does every ten years, so that people won't notice that he's not aging. This time around, having worked as a college professor, he decides to explain his background to his former colleagues. The result is horrible, just horrible.The premise itself is like something out of a sci-fi short-story written by a fourteen year old (it IS based on a sci-fi story of whatever length, but apparently written by a grown and quite appreciated writer during like thirty years or whatever), so that's just unbelievably terrible already. The fact that this 14.000 year old person turns out to be Jesus, having been taught breathing techniques by the Buddha, makes you want to destroy the medium you're watching this on. Of course us being taught a valuable lesson about how we always "hate what is different" doesn't exactly heighten the feeling of originality and ingenuity you get while trying to force yourself to watch this.That the ACTING is on school-play level, and the style of lines being delivered can only remind you of playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons in high school does not make it better. Even worse is the retarded "philosophical" comments being made time after time, making "The Matrix" seem just like the deep, existential masterpiece dumb people think it is - "so, you're not talking about reincarnation, you're talking about living one life.... Quite a life" (this being said while they are discussing the HYPOTHETICAL question of eternal or extremely long life, as if this concept were completely new to a room full of high-level academics). This is bad in so many ways, and the popularity of this film reflects poorly on our entire species. I suppose one of the reasons people like it is that it takes place almost entirely in a cabin, and is based only on theatre-like interaction between a set of characters (in itself not a bad idea, something which could probably be done more often). The fact that this is somewhat more visually "unattractive" than many other Hollywood productions should however NOT fool us into believing that it is good. Because it is not. It really, really is not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a story telling film in the form of narrative and discussion. The story is told my a Man who claims to be 14000 yrs old since the age of cavemen (cro mag-nun). The discussion come from his friends on the day of his leaving, all are friends from his place of work, a local college. As he reveals more the scholars question him and get perfect answers in reply. This is the premise of the film. The premise is a good one but lacking great film making skills. The characters are stereotypical of there field of speciality. The psychologist looks like a smoke piping psychologist e.t.c. This i believe would be to detract the viewer from doing anything other than follow the narrative and discussion. The problem is i found myself paying too much attention to the fact that they were so wooden and stereotypical. They each could only talk about there particular stereotype. i.e the historian mainly discussed the historical facts. The acting therefore became a bit wooden. The exception being the storyteller who expressed subtly the pain of living and leaving and therefore always being alone. The music was not great either and that could have made it a more emotional event. The feeling of time was lacking also, You felt as though the film was in real time but i am sure it was over a course of 5 or 6 hours due to the events around the film but the narrative did not show this to be true. A bigger budget and a better director would have maybe dealt with these issues. Having said that for the budget and resources it was a good effort. Its the story and concept that makes the film good although i think i would have preferred to read it in book form. I don't believe it makes a great film, maybe it could with a bit of tweaking, maybe not !!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A group of college professors sit in a guy's living room and talk. That is 90% of the blocking for this movie. The other 10% is standing in the parking area talking. The group discussion is interesting but after 45 minutes I started to get bored. This movie is above average but, if you are looking for excitement, this is not the flick. I suppose it is somewhat intellectually stimulating to think of a guy that lived for 15,000 years, but only for a brief party charade. Someone needs to explain to me why this is a "thinking person's sci-fi movie." I just didn't see anything particularly profound or thought-provoking in the content of this movie. The story is enough to carry the movie for about 45 minutes but after that it becomes tiresome. The end is anti-climatic. The guy tells everyone except for two people that it was all a big joke and he drives away. Different but slow. If you dislike pretentious college professor types, avoid. Decent acting but the actors are not challenged in any way. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrible acting and the $200 budget aside, the thoughts portrayed here are adolescent. At best, something that a group of high-schoolers might debate over, not a group of Harvard &amp; Oxford educated professors.The attack on Christianity was so feeble that even as a devout Christian I can't say that I was really offended. I was more offended as an educated individual watching an undereducated person's less than discreet attempt at trying to persuade others on a concept that is far beyond their comprehension at this stage of their life.I watched the movie all the way through and can honestly say that everyone involved succeeded only in exposing their shortcomings. Weather those be acting, producing, directing, or basic comprehension of religion &amp; philosophy.Almost every Christian out there can understand the atheist and where they are coming from, but the atheist does not understand the Christian and this is where the passive-aggressive hostility stems from.As for the high ratings, it is obvious that they were all from the same person, who exposed their self in an earlier comment as a relative of the writer. The true ratings are back here at the end and rarely go over a single star.The fluff ratings given to this movie by the writer's grandson were about as convincing as the writers attack on the Earth's most practiced religion. I've heard much better arguments presented in chat rooms &amp; forums.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Idea, Terrible Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am unfortunately torn on this movie. If we are to rate this movie on its production values it would get a 1 out of 10. The acting isn't very good despite the appearance of a few well known B (probably C) listers. Furthermore the direction is poor. The dialogue is also a little forced, but this may have something to do with the editing. I had the feeling that if the actors would have worked for a percentage of the profits, I probably could have shot this movie myself using an old home video camera in 2 days, for about 10 dollars.If however I was to rate this movie on the concept I would have to give it an 8 (or 9) out of 10. It was really the only thing that made me want to keep on watching.I'm probably being a little harsh but I just feel that with a little more production savvy it could have been an amazing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this film two out of ten because the first 45 minutes were compelling. However, when he claims to be Jesus from teachings of Buddha it really stating turning me off. Although Im a Christian I do appreciate a good debate about historical facts but this movie had none! Hollywood seems to go through phases where certain genres are popular and different subjects are frowned upon but the Christian bashing has just gotten tired. Its to the point where I don't think its a genre anymore, but rather an ideology. From the proclamation of being Jesus this became a ritual in proving He was no more than a simple everyday man who said a few things that the Church later turned into a religion. It eerily reminded me of "The Da Vinci code" in that everything is a conspiracy to make us all feel like pawns in the Church/Governments worldwide control, another tired genre. What really bothered me is how much this movie comes off like a documentary, when its nothing more than a fantasy, filled with as many "theories" about how the real Jesus was not real. Not to mention the only "villian" (if there could be one) is the Christian lady. Whos only fault is thinking this guys story could not be true and he could not be Jesus....what a nut! Like I said in the memo, this movie is an ideological atheist college teachers favorite movie. I wont name them (Georgia Tech), but I guarantee they are the bulk of the "8 out of 10" stars this movie got in IMDb. Know-it-all teenagers and adult children who live in the basement and probably the rest are at the "occupy wall street" movement will get a kick out of this movie. Even "The Greatest American Hero" couldn't save this flick! - LOL!!</fullReview>

There could have been a potential to this movie, but sitting in a cabin for an hour and a half,discussing about total bulls**t kinda blows this potential. I mean, if your'e gonna bring up false assumptions at least make it exciting enough, put some mystery in it, make the viewer get anxious to see what happens next. In stead of that, all of sudden this guy starts blabbering about what happened 14000 years ago in such boredom that it seems as if he himself got bored from the script.

		<fullReview>The guy says he was Jesus Christ. Didn't act like one. Nor does he answer anything in any soulful way. Overall I didn't like this movie, the idea was interesting but attacking Christianity is not the way to go, had he attacked Muslims in the movie, the producer's fate would have been much different. They would have probably lynched him. Acting was very iffy at times, by that I mean it was cheesy looking but suited the low budget film that this is. Some character overreacting where there should have been none, or it's relatively believable at best. Can't say I would recommend this to anyone. Unless you're a Buddhist. Because this is what this movie is all about, it's pro Buddhism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Tell a lie enough times and people will start to believe it' The Anti-Christian brigade seems to follow this mantra of the Nazis. First Da Vinci and now this?It seems to be in fashion these days to abuse a religion. Outside Hollywood it's Islam and in Hollywood it's Christianity. While am not against a healthy debate, it's time for Hollywood script writers to think outside the box. Perhaps that's what the writer of this movie is doing right now in heaven(or hell perhaps).The film is an insult esp. to the Christians in Asia &amp; Middle East whose faith in Jesus hasn't moved despite the large scale prosecution in recent times. Indian Christians themselves are facing the worst ever anti-Christian riots by the Hindus.Some people here say only fundamentalist will oppose this movie but then what's the need to make a quick buck by abusing the sentiments of thousands('cause thankfully only that many people must have seen this movie.) The film itself is quite engrossing and hence i'd given it a 7 but I was totally turned off by the protagonist claiming to be Jesus and reduced it to 1.It's also an strange coincidence that the protagonist was always present at all the imp. historical times. I had to say 'aww...come on' &amp; laugh when he claimed to meet Buddha but then he drops this bomb that he's Jesus. That was a true LOL moment.Perhaps the director wanted something BIG to grab peoples attention (as it gets boring after a while). And who's bigger than Jesus...right?</fullReview>

And why exactly a so old man happened to know all the famous people in the word instead of being just a normal 'unknown' man? I think the author was searching for just a sensation. And I also think that there is no Science and no Fiction in this movie. This is rather a low-quality drama than a SciFi film. And the worst scene - that was the final - I will not gonna tell the story, but the end is just cruel and awful, and also unexpectedly sudden.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit I watched the movie with interest. The topic was fascinating, but I think the writer could have come up with more original ideas. He did nothing but repeated what we already know from our text books. The acting was - without exceptions - really bad. There was no chemistry between the characters. The dialog between the lovers was unconvincing. The end was forced and not quite clear. The protagonist looked like he had swallowed a frog. I guess he was trying to look dignified or inspiring.. Anyway, it didn't work. The whole thing was more like a speech or a dialog, rather than a story.It reminded me of the Da Vinci code. Both movies are based on (mis)interpreting the Bible. The positive aspect of it is the thought provoking nature of it. Judging by the reviews people are hungry for new ideas, and that is great!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You expect me to believed that professors would entertain the thought that an individual lived 14 thousand years with the only proof being that he may appear not to have aged in the past 10 years? The only proof offered is him explaining what he saw in those 14 thousand years and everyone deep thinking his comments and actually saying "well that would make sense". What actually would happen is that those professors would have said "well it's been quite a night I really must be going now". I would much rather see a movie like K-Pak where he illustrates to disbelieving scientist's where his planet resides in the cosmos and actually draws a diagram that proves out and even explains a missing piece that the same scientists need to complete a theory they had. This movie falls short in so many ways where others have succeeded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The initial put-off of stereotype middle aged--tattered pony-tailed--faculty with horrible lines dies out after a while and we get to some old philosophical blabbery with a great premise of the 14,000 year old man. The corny music should have been a little less prominent--actually threatened to drown out the dialogue in places (later, the Beethoven on the little boom box was even worse, cornier than the old bible broad was ugly). It's worth a watch to the end. Liked the old Buddha /Jesus Syrian/Moses business, but better was the idea to leave people to their own devices, no matter how repugnant. Was a lot more fun as a drawing room play than as a lot of volcanoes and swelling oceans (those long ago times) with the swelling music of another film maker. The old bible broad--forgot her name--added just the right negative touch; you hated her lines and her performance, but she kept the story going.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a discussion not a movie. I would summarize the movies as a look at religion from the perspective of a man who has lived 1400 centuries. In doing this the main character of the movie explains how religion started, evolved, was used to control and his reasoning as to why he is not religious.The fact that this was made into a movie really doesn't do anything it couldn't of done as a podcast drama. The movie was interesting but I wouldn't say entertaining or at least the way I expect a movie to entertain. If I was entertained it would be the same type of entertainment I get from listening to a lecture in classroom or seminar.The movie was intellectually stimulating, but that doesn't mean this is a good movie. A movie has many components to it and being interesting the only one. What little acting was required in the movie was passable. The visuals and sound was what it was, people talked in a room, not too hard to do.The movie never really climax's and beyond the hook that start the discussion that is the movie there is really nothing else to it. This is something I would never consider watching again and I would only recommend to those who like to debate the validity of relgion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAJOR Spoiler, You have been warned!This movie starts off well enough and immediately grabbed my interest, and as others have said begins to seem like a sci-fi version of "Twelve angry men" but near the middle of the movie takes a left turn that will cost it many viewers. Although I did complete the movie and found the idea of a thousands of years old man living among us to be a very thought provoking concept, the fact that he claimed to be Jesus Christ is far too offensive to many potential viewers. What the makers of this movie have failed to account for is that there are many Christians in the world today that like a good science fiction yarn as much as the next guy. The makers also failed to consider that there are many characters in the Bible that John could have claimed to have been without being offensive, yet who would have still provoked thought and discussion. Several characters that come to mind are; Enoch, who disappeared without explanation. Methuselah, who was the oldest man who ever lived. Elijah, who disappeared in a whirlwind. Lazarus, Who Jesus raised from the dead. Heck, he could have even claimed to have been John the Baptist. And many people such as myself, I believe, would have found the idea that John could have been one of these people thought provoking. But instead, John claims to have studied under Buddha and then that it was he, who while bringing Buddha's teachings to the Middle East started the myth of Jesus Christ. This is far too offensive for many people to overlook. Why? Christian belief teaches that Jesus Christ was more than a man by being the incarnate son of God, born of a virgin who, lived a sinless life and was crucified, DIED and then rose from the dead. John tries to tell the viewer that Jesus is just a cave-man who happened to live forever, who studied UNDER Buddha, and lied about himself and faked his own death. In essence what Iam saying is that John didn't have to be Jesus to make a thought provoking statement.I did find the reactions by his friends to be very believable. And I found the on screen performances by everyone to be very good. I hadn't seen William Katt in good role for a while and also really enjoyed all the connections to Star Trek by the actors. But in the end what could have been a great movie was rendered impotent by the writers decision to attack the personal beliefs of over two thirds of the people in America.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had potential, but disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a scientist I was quite intrigued by this concept and thought the movie started out on a strong note. As a Christian I found it disappointing that such lengths were taken to discredit Christ. However, my religion is not the reason why I thought this movie petered out when jumping the chasm from science to religion.Instead of pondering how statistically unlikely it is that a single immortal would live for so long and survive being maimed, killed in war, travel, accidents, or murder this movie chose to end by pushing an anti-religious agenda. It sought to give credibility to the favorite theory of agnostics that Judaism and Christianity is a retelling of pagan folk-lore. It did this by having what appeared to be very learned people push a single side of this debate; without any of these scholars(even the one that believes in the Bible) discussing the other side, or the fact that many of these theories have been disproved. Furthermore, between the unlikely events of sailing with Columbus and being Jesus, I found the main character quickly lost credibility.In the end, I found this to be a poorly made movie instead of the intriguing and entertaining scientific masterpiece it could have been if the writers did their research and chose to perhaps have John know a religious figure (like one of the Profits, or Apostles) rather than be Jesus himself.</fullReview>

We all lived in a thick fog believing that Jesus was the savior when he was in fact the cro-magnon (aka john oldman). How could we have been so blind? i think that we should all throw away our bibles and write a new holy book "THE BOOK OF OLDMAN". Isn't that the smart reaction? According to some of the posts here, it is. This is a movie for people with brains, you say? I never heard of a man without a brain, did you? maybe you were referring to those using their brains? Now i a ask you? Coming up with a story and making a mockery of billions of people believes, means that this movie was created for those with brains? i do agree with a debate about a certain subject but forcing me to debate about a cro magnon who lived on earth for 14.000 years and who was in fact Jesus Christ is indeed to much for my brain. if accepting a cromagnon to be the Saviour means "i have a brain?!", then with all my heart i say "MY BRAIN IS USELESS ANYWAY!"</fullReview>

Once this movie went into Christianity, the plot became so thin, it was invisible.The caricature of the "professors" was embarrassing.
