		<shortDescription>Memoirs of a Moron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've lived without a father my entire life. He hasn't passed away and isn't comatose or medically disabled. He just had no interest in being a part of my life until I turned eighteen. Then his view on me changed, but it was too little too late. Even when he was around the first few years of my life, he actively showed that I didn't matter to him. That entire experience is perhaps what helped me relate to Being Flynn the most. While drugs or alcohol were never much of an issue, the strained relationship between a father and son is something I understand all too well.Nick Flynn (Paul Dano) has always been in his father's shadow even though he was never around. Nick's father Jonathan (Robert De Niro) is a conman, a liar, and the self-proclaimed greatest writer in the world. As an adult, Nick is struggling to find his place in life. His never ending search to find a job that means something along with putting at least some effort into becoming a writer himself is taking its toll on him. He finally starts putting his life back on track; he finds a new place to live, he gets a job at a homeless shelter, and even starts dating a girl named Denise (Olivia Thirlby) who also works at the shelter. That's when fate intervenes and Jonathan re-enters the picture. Despite never being there for him growing up and only having over a hundred letters written by his father to fall back on, Nick struggles with either giving his dad one final shot or pushing him away for good.Paul Dano is rarely ever disappointing, but Robert De Niro has been slipping in his most recent cinematic outings. The great thing about Being Flynn is that this is the best De Niro performance in years. His anger and racism towards people he doesn't understand, his delusions of becoming a great writer and his slow downward spiral into violent dementia are really powerful and De Niro portrays all of it exceptionally well. Yet it's still bittersweet to see De Niro driving away in a taxi cab in the opening scene to the film. Meanwhile Dano's struggle with following in his father's footsteps is also fantastic in this train wreck kind of way. Their chemistry together (or lack thereof) is perhaps the biggest driving factor of the film.The dual narrative was a unique touch. This is very much Nick's story, but it's constantly jumping back and forth between his words and Jonathan's. Hearing the same story be told simultaneously from two different individuals was pretty fascinating. Being Flynn is a pretty gloomy little drama sprinkled with bits of messed up comedy throughout. The humor is dark and dry and nobody in the film is an upstanding citizen. It's as if the film is trying to tell you that everyone has their own demons and everyone has some messed up quality to them in some capacity.There's this one shot of Jonathan curling up on a grate that's blowing warm air on a freezing night that sticks with you after the film ends. You're eventually looking down at Jonathan; all bundled up as the camera slowly ascends to the heavens. The scene of Nick playing catch as a young boy with all of the boyfriends his mom had over the years was fantastic, as well. The way the camera goes back and forth, a different boyfriend being at the other end of the glove every time we pan away from Nick, and finally the way Jonathan was never there to do it himself. Mirrors are also really important as they not only cause these characters to look inward, but both Paul Dano and Robert De Niro have some pretty memorable scenes standing in front of a mirror. Lastly, the violins are astounding. Rhythmic and their tendency to start soft and get louder add this aspect to the film that wouldn't have been accomplished with different music or none at all.Being Flynn isn't an easy film to access, but will more than likely touch you in some way or form if you grew up with any sort of parental issues. With the expected strong performance from Paul Dano and the unexpected great performance from Robert De Niro, Being Flynn allows you to witness the troublesome times of an individual, destroy themselves because of it, and eventually rebuild themselves for the better. In a way, it's the most depressing self-help method to ever hit the screen, but that's what makes it so easy to relate to and unlike whatever you expected this film to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Being Flynn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the memoirs of poet Nick Flynn entitled Another Bullshit Night in Suck City, Being Flynn works thanks to the performances put in by Robert De Niro and Paul Dano, playing the father and son Jonathan and Nick Flynn, estranged for many years no thanks to Jonathan's life of a con artist catching up with him, communicating with his son through letters for the most parts of his life, never meeting up. Growing up alone with his mom (Julianne Moore), one might think this is yet another dysfunctional family story, but Nick has a lot more to tell, baring his soul to recount the painful absence and hard fought reaching out to the only close relative he's got, and this journey is one that reminds us on blood being thicker than water, or alcohol for that matter here.Under the direction of Paul Weisz, whose filmography included vulgar flicks like American Pie and The Little Fockers, which of course also starred De Niro, it was great that this film gets more closely aligned with his other narratively powerful films like About a Boy and In Good Company. While the book by Nick Flynn had a whole host of styles adopted in its various chapters, Weisz tried to capture the same essence in adopting different points of views in this film, as well as to lightly touch it with some comedy. But what it had set its sights on, is to bring out the pain of having to not grow up with a dad present and to be brought up by a single mom, and the struggles one has to experience as an aimless drifter until something clicked, and one puts the foot down to embark on a determined change of lifestyle.There were elements that I enjoyed in this film, one of which is the parallels drawn between the father and son's lives, both seemingly getting from bad to worse with nary a roof over their heads, and the dependence on substance abuse as a vice, be it the bottle or drugs, in the hope that these will help alleviate the severe discomfort brought on by not being able to have ambitions developed and met. Like father, like son, each of them dreams of making it big one day as a successful writer, but like the chip off the old block, this potential rarely got realized when their lives continue to be at the doldrums.It provides an inspiration to those of us who deem it impossible to pursue our dreams for a variety of reasons, and while it delivers that awkward feeling of having to reconnect with someone related to by blood, especially if that's a mom or a dad, it pushes anyone caught in similar dilemmas into the same direction of reconciliation, for bygones to be bygones, and that there's nothing more powerful than having to rediscover relations that once was, or even never had begun. Weisz adopted a rather fractured narrative, that tells of the present day with Nick and Jonathan's crossing of paths when the latter gets kicked out of his apartment, and having to live on and off in the homeless shelter his son volunteers in, and interspersed that with Nick's memories of the days being brought up by mom through a series of flashbacks, seen through a relatively innocent prism of a young boy growing up in harsh times.Subplots came and went without much fanfare, such as Nick's on-off romantic relationship with Denise (Olivia Thirlby), a co-worker at the shelter, and we don't really get to know the other co-workers with any depth other than they each come with issues but are volunteering time at the shelter. But there are moments that sneak in, to make you pause and take stock about whether similar situations with the homeless do exist in our own country, and wonder just what is being done, by others as well as ourselves, in contributing to make some change for the better, whether donation in terms of time, or in kind. And not to mention how bullies often target those without support that will make one seethe at the senseless violence dished out.Robert De Niro continues to prove to be a dramatic tour de force in putting up another fine performance as the cranky, and what I thought to be proud, man who thinks rather highly of his non-existent talent, and subtly shows how Jonathan is actually very proud of the son he should have made contact with many years ago. Paul Dano may have perfected playing laid back characters, but perhaps having to act opposite a veteran such as De Niro forced him to up his game as well, resulting in a natural chemistry between the two that carried the film from start to end. Recommended, with an eclectic soundtrack serving as a bonus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being Flynn looks at the thin line between madness and genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people are unaware that some of the best performances actors deliver are in the smaller budgeted lesser seen films. Being Flynn is one of those that got limited release and was getting some good reviews, but kind of just came out of nowhere. Sporting a great cast including Paul Dano, Robert DeNiro, and Julianne Moore, could this be another of those rare gems that get lost on the shelf or will it be one that's clear to why it got such a limited release.Being Flynn follows a father and son who haven't been in contact with each other in years. When the father reaches out to his son, he realizes he cannot outrun his fate and realizes that he has the chance to make a life for himself as well as for his father. This drama is filled with some interesting characters and great performances, most notably DeNiro who seems to be letting it all out in one of his strongest performances in some time. Paul Dano does a great job carrying his own weight alongside DeNiro playing off of each other to bring this troubled relationship to life. The story takes a deeper than expected journey into human emotion and the thin line of genius and madness. Everyone gives great performances delivering a powerful film that works really well. The biggest issue is the pacing. At times it comes off as really slow and long, and others will keep you interested. With an emotional film like this it's important to maintain a sense of cohesion so the heavier moments don't get lost in a sea of useless moments. That's not necessarily the case here; it just runs a bit longer than it feels it needed too.While not a film that will really deliver anything all that new, it does sport a great performance from DeNiro that is worth checking out. This film does sport some drug use and racist moments that while nothing you haven't seen are necessary due to the direction of the film. If you decide to give this film a shot, just make sure you are prepared for some heavy content.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderfully Raw Film That Makes You Feel the Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being Flynn (2012) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Touching and mostly depressing film about a young man (Paul Dano) trying to make his way into life but things change when he sees his father (Robert DeNiro) staying at the homeless shelter he's working in. The father and son haven't seen each other in nearly twenty-years but soon the son starts to realize that this might have been a good thing. I really wasn't sure what to expect going into BEING FLYNN but I came out extremely impressed and I honestly can't remember the last time I watched a current movie and felt more for the characters involved. Not only do we have the father and son relationship but there's also the flashbacks with the mother (Julianne Moore), the son's relationship with a co-worker (Olivia Thirlby) and other small characters that we meet. The amazing thing is that the screenplay makes you feel for each of them with all their problems. I think one of the greatest assets is of course the performances with DeNiro leading the way. It seems over the past decade "film buffs" have complained about the type of roles that the actor has been taken. Of course, whenever he does turn in quality work like here or in EVERYBODY'S FINE, no one goes and sees the film, which is a real shame as both offer the actor at the top of his game. The character he plays here is at times funny, at times hateful and there are times where you don't want to see him again. The character is a racist, sexist and there's no question that he's a drunk, a deadbeat father and a crazy person. The way DeNiro plays all of this is pure perfection and shows that the actor still has that magic. The way DeNiro not only delivers the lines but also watch the small things he does with the look of the character, the way he moves and even the expressions he gives. Dano stands right up there with him and the two characters are so different that they're both able to stand strong against each other. I was also impressed with Moore, although she doesn't appear in too many scenes. Thirlby is also lovely in her part of the girlfriend and I thought she nearly stole every scene in which she appeared. The appeal of BEING FLYNN is going to be small, I mean, after all this is a depressing, raw and open look at relationships and bad ones at that. The film isn't always easy to watch but the characters are so full and you want to love them so much that it's easy to be drawn into the story. BEING FLYNN is certainly a special little gem and best of all is that it features DeNiro at the top of his game.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Film of 2012 So Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im not going to get into the plot because it takes a while to explain, and you can already find it in previous reviews done on this film. Anyway, "Being Flynn" is an incredible film. There was honestly not a single thing about this movie that I didn't like. The only reason that I gave it 9 out of 10 stars instead of a 10 is because I think that it may seem a little slow to certain viewers. I am not one of those viewers. First off, this is the best acting I have seen from Robert De Niro in a very long time. This film goes up there with his best: "Taxi Driver", "Goodfellas", "Heat", etc. The same goes for Paul Dano. His acting in "Being Flynn" is on par, if not better, than in "There Will Be Blood". I will warn those who are very sensitive: you will cry at some point during this film. It is incredibly sad to see the deterioration of Robert De Niro's character. You truly feel for his son (Paul Dano) and what he is going through with this complete nut-case of a father. Paul Dano's character is treated very similarly in "Being Flynn" by Robert De Niro as he is in "There Will Be Blood" by Daniel Day Lewis. I guess he is just an actor we are meant to feel bad for. Anyway, I am so glad to see Robert De Niro doing good films again (The last one I saw him in was "Little Fockers" :P). It is a shame that most people will not see this movie and because it is an early 2012 release and is a limited release, this will get absolutely NO recognition at the Academy Awards.... Robert De Niro and Paul Dano truly both deserve best actor nominations and the movie deserves a best picture nomination. I know it is pretty early in the year to be saying this, but this film is going to be damn hard to beat. Go see "Being Flynn", you wont regret it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Again, I find it a challenge to write a review after reading the one by David Ferguson (ferguson-6); don't want to copy another reviewer. Read his review, hopefully after mine. I agree with David about the non traditional Hollywood ending. I also did not have the pleasure of reading the book by Nick Flynn and I don't plan to; I've had enough of the movie's realism to quench that thirst. The performances by De Niro and Dano are captivatingly dark, gripping and absolutely discomforting, when they are the most believable. You must understand the storyline before considering watching the movie.It's hard to tell if De Niro is overplaying the character or if the real Flynn was that bad of a drunk; either way that makes the veteran of the screen's performance a memorable one. I tend to believe the performance of Robert De Niro here, and like to think he does portray what Jonathan Flynn must have been like, as it feels too real not to be. Anyone who's known a problematic alcoholic knows the De Niro's role was very demanding. I have a soft spot for movies with narration and the one delivered by Paul Dano, playing Nick Flynn to perfection, was both well done and required, in the context of the story.The ending, after a roller coaster ride of the life of an author with unyielding self confidence, was guaranteed to bring a sigh of relief and it won't surprise me a bit if you exclaim 'son of a bit**' as I did. If I was an actor, I'd want to have played a part in this movie. It's not for everyone, but I recommend it for movie-lovers who crave intense performances now and then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How much we inherit from our parents doesn't necessary make us become who we really are. Some might take pride into extending the tradition while others might fight against any residue of similarity to prove otherwise."Being Flynn" is a beautiful drama based on a true story of survival and search for one's self. It is tragically positive as we grow with the character of Paul Dano, very nicely played, to discover new possibilities are always possible when you put your mind to it, navigating through your troubles and finding strength and determination within yourself. De Niro is absolutely amazing as an estranged father who thinks highly of himself, in spite of all his shortcomings. It's a rewarding experience that delivers a good message of the importance of finding out who you are and validating your existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Radiant, Touching Memoir of Nick Flynn Brought to the Screen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few films concerning father/son relationships have been able to produce the emotional impact of this masterfully written and directed and acted BEING FLYNN. Paul Weitz directs and adapted the 2004 memoir by Nick Flynn "Another Bullshit Night in Suck City: A Memoir" and brought together a superlative cast that just may be Robert De Niro's finest hour. Nick Flynn deserves the credit for this articulate tale of his own life: he was born and grew up in Scituate, Massachusetts, south of Boston. His parents divorced when he was young and his mother committed suicide when he was 22. He drifted through several jobs before starting work at a homeless shelter in Boston, where at age twenty-seven, he met his estranged, homeless father for the first time. That is the core of the film.The nature of the film works very well: we simultaneously meet Jonathan Flynn (Robert DeNiro), a man who believes he is 'America's greatest writer along side Mark Twain and JD Salinger, who lives life day to day in a drunken stupor, driving taxis, acting out con games etc until he becomes homeless, and after seeking shelter from old friends he has neglected, he ends up in a homeless shelter. We also meet his estranged son Nick Flynn (Paul Dano, in a breakout performance) who is striving to discover who he is, perceiving himself as a writer but unsuccessful with relationships: Nick's mother Jody (Julianne Moore) we see only in flashbacks because she committed suicide, and his only communication with his absent father has been through letters. Also homeless, Nick moves with with two characters (Eddie Rouse and Steve Cirbus) who manage to help Nick find a job in a homeless shelter. As Nick adjusts to working at the shelter he comes into connect with a potential girlfriend Denise (Olivia Thirlby) and begins to feel as though his life has some degree of meaning. The jolt comes when Jonathan seeks shelter in the homeless shelter where Nick works and it is this coming together of two bruised and pained people who happen to be father and son that sets in motion the resolution of the story. Both men are pitiful but both have redeeming characteristics and it is this struggling coming together that makes the film breathe. In addition to the brilliant acting of the main characters, there are also exceptionally memorable roles by Lili Taylor, Victor Rasuk, Thomas Middleditch, Wes Studi, Chris Chalk and others.Not only is the film pitch perfect in nearly every detail, but it also gives the viewer the opportunity to consider the plight of the homeless around us. How many tragic stories like this are untold or never will be known? When a film can produce that degree of involvement with the audience it goes beyond simply being a film and becomes art - art makes us consider, think, and change. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie with a good De Niro performance, but Dano really steals the movie. The ending is absolutely perfect. I say A-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"What do you do if both of you are lost and you both wind up in the same place...waiting?" Nick Flynn (Dano) has had a hard life. His father (De Niro) ran out on him and his mother when he was young and his mother killed herself. Trying to start a new life he moves into a new apartment and takes a job working at a homeless shelter. While working there he sees his long lost father and is not sure how to act. This is a very very good movie. De Niro is trying to go back to acting again instead of playing in movies like "Machete" and "Little Fockers". While he was good in this I never really got into it like I did with old De Niro roles. On the other hand Paul Dano is fantastic in this and in some scenes actually out acts De Niro which is incredible. The movie is a variation on the child feeling abandoned and father trying to explain why he did what he did story but it in no way feels repetitive. Little by little and simultaneously the father and son both hit rock bottom then build themselves back up into the men they want to be and watching two actors of this caliber really makes it fun to watch. I won't give anything away, but at the end De Niro keeps repeating the same word and every time he says it it has a different meaning and the movie is worth watching for that one minute scene if nothing else. I highly recommend this movie and I look for Dano to win an Oscar soon. Overall, a great movie with great performances and a perfect ending. I give it an A-.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Family systems and addictions: a good movie for therapists</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We had thought we were getting a comedy. The story however is compelling enough to maintain interest. Some of the sex scenes at the beginning are gratuitous and don't add to the story itself. The relationship between Jonathan and Nicholas is the central theme, and as Nicholas makes sense of his own story through his encounter with his father, and he gradually differentiates his own life. The relationship between Jonathan and Nicholas provide a good family systems theme along the lines of family systems pioneer Murray Bowen. The theme of addictions, single parenthood, and absentee fathers add to the poignancy of the story. Veteran Robert De Niro is masterful as Jonathan Flynn, and inspires the work of the younger and lesser known actors as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a bio, i must definitely say that it's a very interesting film about really interesting characters. Yeah, some will claim that a film without interesting characters is not an interesting film, which is true anyways. But fine: back to the main subject, 'Being Flynn' is an above average bio in my opinion.The story about characters without any hope and saddened by the life and the consequences of it, is a thing that happens everyday with . The situation and the why people turns to be homeless is a subject explored and showed in a clever and entertaining way, without any distortions to make it look more 'interesting' for the viewer. The editing, though very inconsistent in simple scenes, played a big part in the film's conception. The film wouldn't be as half as interesting without the good job done in that aspect.I loved Paul Dano and Deniro's performances. Both were very good. Deniro as the grumpy old man and Dano as the character without direction in his life.Overall, a flawed film, specifically the last twenty minutes or so, that really prejudiced a then fine film. Still, a solid 7.0/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat of a gem, thanks to an engaging story, and knockout performances from DeNiro &amp; Dano</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) Working in a Boston homeless shelter, Nick Flynn re- encounters his father, a con man and self-proclaimed poet. Sensing trouble in his own life, Nick wrestles with the notion of reaching out yet again to his dad.I saw this one a while ago. I rented it due to DeNiro's presence, and didn't expect that much. I was surprisingly engaged throughout, and it was quite a moving film. I was especially moved by the somewhat chaotic and sad relationship between Dano &amp; his mom (Julianne Moore) she was such a tragic character. I know the key relationship is the estranged relationship between Nick &amp; Jonathan (Dano &amp; DeNiro) but I felt the relationship between Dano &amp; Moore was just as effective. Paul Dano makes for a great lost soul, and I was easily able to empathize with him. Robert DeNiro gives one of his best performances in recent memory as an alcoholic. He's not very sympathetic, but his performance is a powerful one. This movie is very good. It has fantastic performances, and a great story. See it7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent movie that addresses difficult subject matter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for a light drama or comedy, don't choose Being Flynn. But if you want to see the masterful acting of Robert DeNiro and Paul Dano, and you're up for serious subject matter, this is an outstanding film. The script does not sugar-coat any aspects of addiction or homelessness. It tells it like it is. The key characters are multi-dimensional, and I found myself rooting for them at times and wanting to kick their butts at other times. Besides the obvious subject matter of addiction and homelessness, the film also address the challenges we all have dealing with whether we are or are not our parents -- or at least looking at parts of ourselves we don't like that we also don't like in our parents. And the feelings of guilt and shame experience by Nick over the death of his mother are palpable. The only thing I found disconcerting was that fact that it was supposed to be set in Boston and, with the exception of one recognizable Boston location, it was so obviously filmed in New York.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An antidote against the usual Hollywood dross</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really liked this film? a lot. As with a lot of movies based on life the story weaves about a bit. But I particularly like the way the narrative kept switching between son and farther, giving insights and snippets of past and present life. Very character driven storyline and this movie is a good antidote against the high budget, high gloss, special effect driven Hollywood movies? which I also like, don't get me wrong. But in the words of REM, "sometimes you need something more sub sub sub substantial." Both Robert De Niro and Paul Dano give strong performances, but I do slightly worry that Paul Dano might keep being typecast as the lost creative sensitive type. It was nice to see De Niro in a non-comedic role, which he seems to play recently. And it's a good reminder of here is an actor that can act.Well worth watching in my opinion. Don't expect the movie to be wrapped up nice and neat at the end. I couldn't see how they would be able to do that without resorting to Hollywood cliché's. I'm still astounded this is by the same director (Paul Weitz), who directed the frighteningly bad Little Fockers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Parental abandonment is something that many people deal with. Some never reconcile it, choosing to ignore it. But the fact is that abandonment early in life can leave scars that affect you for the rest of your life. Pretending not to notice or shrugging it off can seem like it works for a while, but as one ages, the gravity of the experience begins to take form. This film will most likely bring to light some of the circumstances surrounding a viewer's own similar situation.For me, it was realizing how the lack of a father has affected how I view relationships and as a result, my own choices. Young girls learn about male energy and how it can be beneficial from their fathers. My father abandoned me very early in life, surfacing only a few times, one of which was when he was in ill health. Fortunately for me, I was not faced with the situation that Nick was - my father had the means to live on his own. I also had a stepfather who never recognized me even as a family member. When he wasn't ridiculing me he was just ignoring me. Thankfully, my mother was a very strong presence in my life. But she was gone well before her time as well. Nick's mother committed suicide -- and there are many other more subtle ways to do this. Like ignoring your own health and well being and allowing yourself to become so ill that it is too late to repair it.It seemed early on that Nick decided to be a writer because his father considered himself to be one. That, along with providing much inspiration by way of their own story - is another contribution to Nick's life that I'm sure he has acknowledged. The one thing that Nick's father did was validate his writing. For a writer, that can mean more than just about anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performance By De Niro, In A Dark &amp; Depressing But Still Hopeful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie ends on a very hopeful note. Jonathon (Rebert De Niro) end up living in a subsidized apartment, and Nick (Paul Dano) ends up teaching and being a published author. So, basically, things seem to have worked out as well as you could hope for these two. And when this comes to an end, you are very, very grateful for the hopefulness of the ending because - in all honesty - this is for the most part a rather dark and sometimes depressing story.It revolves around the relationship between Jonathon and Nick - an estranged father and son who haven't seen each other for 18 years. Both are struggling. Jonathon lives a fantasy about being a classic American author who's written a classic novel - notwithstanding that no one will publish it. He's an alcoholic taxi driver really; and he ends up on the streets after being kicked out of his apartment. There's some play made of him being racist and homophobic, but those characteristics really didn't take centre stage for me. He was just difficult. Nick also fancies himself as a writer, but he's dealing with a lot of demons from his past - the fact that his father was never present in his life, and the fact that his mother (played in flashbacks by Julianne Moore) committed suicide (he thinks because she read an unfinished story about herself that he wrote, before he had a chance to add at the end of it how much he loved her and what a good mother she was.) He drinks, he does drugs, but eventually he lands a job at a homeless shelter, and - much to his surprise - into the shelter one day walks Jonathon. The story goes from there.While often dark and depressing, this is an interesting enough story, made even more interesting that it's based on Nick Flynn's actual memoirs. Aside from the father-son relationship, one of the most interesting aspects of it is the depiction of life in a homeless shelter. It also features magnificent performances from Dano, and especially from De Niro, who proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that he's still got it. His portrayal of the troubled Jonathon was superb.This is dark and depressing at times. But if you can work your way through that, it's also a very good movie. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flying performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Being Flynn" is an awkward, semi-detached autobiographical movie based on the memoirs of Nick Flynn written down in his acclaimed book "Another Bullshit Night in Suck City". Nick Flynn (played with true zest by rising quality actor Paul Dano) recaps a period of his life, when still uncertain of having any publishing future encourages him to take up a temporary post at a homeless shelter in Boston. Once there he comes across his estranged and increasingly manic father (a masterful return by Robert De Niro), a self-proclaimed classic writer, who approaches the facility after losing his apartment and livelihood in the form of a taxi business. Left during childhood Nick feels a need for attachment, but simultaneously cannot garner to trust the unfatherly figure. Instead this enhances memories of his mother (played by Julianne Moore), who worked two jobs in an attempt to raise him as a single mother, until finally committing suicide. The situation forces a collision in an extreme situation, as Flynn's father falls from grace with Nick reluctant to help pick up the pieces.A somewhat surprising entry by Paul Weitz, probably best known for being the culprit behind the "American Pie" franchise. Rarely comedic, instead it dabbles in the underbelly of both society and family life, engaging throughout mostly due to the terrific performances by its lead cast. The drama lingers creating atmospheric tension between the two main characters, so even if the movie fails to convey a powerful story and has its moments of prolonged lack of direction, the end result brings about a realistic dark portrait. Somewhat depressing in tone "Being Flynn" above all marks a return to greatness by De Niro and a further marked rise as a future great actor by Paul Dano. Despite some script frailties and occasional incapability for dramatic direction by Weitz, it is still a worthwhile watch and at least a very intriguing character study about generational relations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro's Best Performance in 15 Years, Film Doesn't Quite Live Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many men of his generation, Nick Flynn (Paul Dano) is defined by his relationship, or lack thereof, with his father, Jonathan (Robert De Niro). Jonathan is a racist, a homophobe, and a drunk and he abandoned Nick and his mother (Julianne Moore) when Nick was only a small boy, communicating with his son only through letters. The only bonds these two share are blood and a preoccupation with writing. But despite his disgust for the man, Nick never can quite shake the need to live up to his father's image, even if that image is completely fabricated. After nearly twenty years of silence, Jonathan reaches out to Nick in need of a favor and almost out of curiosity more than anything else, Nick lends a hand and suddenly finds himself interacting with a man he both hardly knows and knows all too well. Before long, Jonathan has been forced to take up residence in the homeless in which Nick works, forcing the younger Flynn to take a long and painful trip down the path to internal peace with both his father and himself.Being Flynn is based on the memoir of the real-life Nick Flynn, who worked as a social worker in a Boston homeless shelter in the late '80s where he ended up under the same roof as his father. The tale of the Flynns is a complex one to say the least and it is presented here in a style that pulls no punches. Indeed, Being Flynn is much more difficult to watch that I expected going in. Jonathan Flynn is, for lack of a better, family-friendly term, a miserable old coot, a holdover from a different time who has never adjusted to the world around him. On top of his vocal racism and homophobia, he is thoroughly arrogant in the worst way possible: he's never accomplished anything with his life and yet he expects others to treat him as if he has. In Jonathan's mind, there have only been three great American writers and he is one of them, despite never having had a work published. Worse yet, a life of poor choices and weighty entitlement have only aided in the speed with which his brain is deteriorating, leading Jonathan to lash out violently in both word and action. In short, he is an impossible character to love and even to feel pity for him proves difficult. In the midst of this stands Nick, torn between the childhood need for a father and the adult reason that tells him to kick the man to the curb. He simultaneously hates his father and desires his approval. This dynamic creates a tense, painful atmosphere that made it a challenge for me to sit still without squirming. To be honest with you, I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.On the one hand, it could be argued that director Paul Weitz's goal is to stick the viewer squarely in the middle of the awkward and terse central relationship and force the audience to engage. In this way, Being Flynn is a great success. But on the other hand, being this close to the fray, so to speak, also forces the viewer to react to Jonathan in a personal nature. For me, this led to the overwhelming feeling that Jonathan would deserve whatever fate befell him and stripped me of any emotional attachment I might have had to his plight. Being Flynn should be relatable to anyone who has ever struggled with his or her relationship with a parent but instead I found myself sympathizing some for Nick and feeling nothing beyond "good riddance" for Jonathan.That's a shame, too, because this is without question the most significant role De Niro has taken on in well over a decade. This might be his best performance since 1996's Sleepers and it is a fantastic, hopeful sight to see him go back to something worthwhile. Despite nearly 15 years of utter mediocrity, I am still of the opinion that when given a reason to invest, De Niro is one of the five best actors in the industry, only he keeps taking awful role after awful role. He does an excellent job of fully committing to Jonathan, creating a memorable character, even if it is memorable for being a wretched human. Likewise, Dano is very good in his role and brings a lot of realism to the part. In the hands of another director (not necessarily better hands, just different), Being Flynn might have turned into a showcase piece for Dano, for which I could see a world in which he would garner award attention. As it is, however, De Niro overshadows him and perhaps this keeps Dano (and Nick) from reaching his full potential. Being Flynn is an interesting film and one that is almost as tough to grade as it is to watch. At times it makes a push to point itself toward "great" but more often than not I felt it floundered despite the best efforts of cast and crew.

		<shortDescription>Frustrating waste of a great cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The prospect of two actors of this caliber-- Robert DeNiro and Paul Dano-- drove me to see this movie last night. Unfortunately,the plotting and narrative line of the movie were very disappointing. Whereas most films of this type have an up-and-down narrative arc, the relentless drive of these characters towards the bottom of their lives, with just a small bit of redemption by the end, detracted from what was otherwise a compelling story of an absent father and a damaged son circling their way back to each other. Julianne Moore, never disappointing, is similarly wasted as the single mother who holds the life of her and her young son together after DeNiro leaves the family. It's projects like this that keep DeNiro having to return for paydays in bilge like "Meet the Parents" et al.I know he's not Jake LaMotta in "Raging Bull" anymore. But surely he deserves better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about the story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When we watch and review films, we often critic the movie in relation to the actors, director and the story. Yet this movie has so much more to offer.Homelessness is not an easy subject matter to approach. Nor the people who end up working in these places. It is a theme we rarely question or consider. In most large cities, we brush past homeless people waiting for others to care for them.The foundation of this movie is about a father/son relationship. But it is also about the hopes, dreams, aspirations we all start out having in life. It is about how we lose our way, how we pick up the pieces and fill in the gaps.It is about the questions we ask ourselves, the answers we come up and what we do when some of those answers begin the make sense. It is about the coincidences that shape our life, from where we can jump off to a firmer footing.This is an incredible movie. Although the immediate beginning is a little disjointed, once it begins to find its stride, WOW! it develops to take on so much more.There are no emotional highs and lows, resulting in a happy ending. This movie is simply a skim through the chapters of the character's lives. And whereas the ending does see the characters settle into their lives providing comfort to the viewers, we should not forget that many homeless people or young men and women who struggle to find their way in life are not always so lucky.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal Father Son Reunion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This follows the unexpected reunion between an irresponsible conniving father, and his son who he's been totally estranged from for 18 years. The only reason he tracks his son down at all is for help vacating his apartment which the son obliges him with, telling you something about both of them. The son is emotionally scarred by the absence of his father and the cruel circumstances of his mother's suicide. Perhaps against his better judgement he reaches out to his father but is not surprisingly burned in the process. It becomes about the boy's battle with his demons, decoupling himself from his father's curse, and reclaiming his life.It's painful to watch the boy struggling with the urge to cling to the life buoy his father represents, but holding himself back because of his residual anger at his father's absence and negligence. If he handles the situation wrong he could end up going down with a sinking ship.You get an idea of what it's like going from living in an apartment to living on the street - not something I recall seeing on the big screen before, so worth watching for that alone. Really refreshing to see De Niro trying to act again after some of the vapid paydays he's been churning out over the last decade or so. I thought he'd totally run out of steam but clearly there's a bit left in the tank. He does a great job here anyway. Quite believable as the complex narcissistic rogue.Paul Dano turns in a decent performance but wouldn't have been my choice for the role. I think he may be a good actor some day but he's not there yet IMO. It all seems too deliberate and affected. Julianne Moore and Olivia Thirlby are pretty good in support.The film has an honest and believable quality about it; just lets the story tell itself without trying to be too sophisticated. There's no OTT horrific cold turkey scenes, no explicit sex scenes, no gratuitous violence. All pretty mundane and believable stuff, which worked well here I thought.All in all this is a superior father/son tale told simply. Definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strong movie with brilliant duo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This intense drama - based on a true story - deserves much more attention and praise it has received until today. Of course, the background is painful and ugly - homeless shelter and related places are not nice and customary places of action - but extreme places usually boost people's good and bad habits and attitudes. The plot is logical, reasoning and depravities have been smoothly incorporated; the ending is interesting as well.Robert De Niro gives one of his strongest performances of the decade, having a different part than he is usually known for. Paul Dano is no "weakling" either: he is definitely among the best 20+ movie actors - and even without having "cute" appearance! If you have not seen movies with Dano, it is time to begin now - with L.I.E., for example. Flying Flynn is no entertainment and hardly recommendable as a family movie, but it must be a strong experience for groups of like-minded.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of DeNiro's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick (Paul Dano) works in a homeless shelter and sees Jonathan Flynn (Robert DeNiro), his father there. He hasn't seen his father for 18 years. Based upon a true story.This is the type of story whereby the main character, Nick, had a disturbing childhood and decided to write about it and now we have the movie. Both Nick and Jonathan have the writing bug.We see Nick go through many of these disturbing events: was told his father was in prison and upon release abandoned the family, the many boyfriends of the mother (Julianne Moore), the death of his hard working mother, seeing his father in the homeless shelter, drinking and getting into drugs, the hard stuff. The acting performances all around are very good. Nick's father is con man without game, and thinks extremely highly of himself. It would have been too easy to feel sympathy for the father if he didn't tout himself as a writing genius (without portfolio) at every turn. But, keep in mind, his situation and deep down you feel Jonathan knows his condition, but outwardly refuses to succumb to it and claims he is a survivor.Sometimes this is hard to watch because we don't like seeing people in the homeless shelter in these circumstances, but if we look outside our comfortable world, we will see real tragedy, people with no hope and who are just trying to make it one more day. I would have thought that Nick would have been more caring, but he endures the father from a distance, something not lost on the father. His big fear is that he will become his father. However, maybe this was the way it really was. With these true stories we are really never sure how it was back then. I am so glad that Robert DeNiro has abandoned the so-called "comedies" he had been associated with as I never found him convincing or funny in them. In here, Mr. DeNiro is on his game and if you look into his character's eyes you will see the bottom. Yes, there may be an Oscar for him, but since the movie has not gotten wide appeal, this may be lost as his was truly a class A performance, and deserving of an Oscar.The ending is okay, kind of bland but tells us hope is alive. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes, male backsides. Language: A lot in the beginning, then it left us (includes f-bombs)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping family drama, not your usual "entertainment" movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this one on DVD from my public library. De Niro and Dano pair well in this father/son story, dirty and gripping at times, alternately sad and funny, it pays off if you watch it all the way through.Robert De Niro is Jonathan Flynn, by his own account one of only three great American authors. Problem is his book has not been published, he is estranged from his grown son for 18 years, and he drives a taxi in New York. He has a running conflict with his downstairs neighbors who play their live music too loud. After an incident where he starts an altercation he is evicted. Paul Dano is his son, Nick Flynn. His mother is dead, he knows that he is his father's son, he has been influenced by his father to become a writer, but when he meets up with dad again fears that he is following too closely in dad's footsteps, becoming a delusional failure and a drunk.Their chance to meet again comes a few weeks after Nick takes a job at a NYC homeless shelter. After Jonathan becomes homeless, lives in his cab for a while, then wrecks it, has to go to the shelter to get out of the winter weather. Jonathan and Nick have an uneasy time of it, but this eventually helps both of them see a way out of their respective plights.Julianne Moore is Jody Flynn , Nick's deceased mother.SPOILERS: Jody had killed herself after reading an unfinished story her son wrote, and he had carried that blame. At one point his dad assures him that no one can cause another to kill themselves. After several tense encounters Jonathan finally gets his own apartment again, seems to be coping well, Nick goes back to college gets his degree and teaches, and writes an award-winning book of poetry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro and Dano are both outstanding!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'BEING FLYNN': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Paul Weitz (the writer/director behind such films as 'IN GOOD COMPANY', 'ABOUT A BOY' and 'AMERICAN PIE', the latter two he co-directed with his brother Chris) wrote and directed this comedy drama film about a young man working at a homeless shelter who has to deal with the father he never knew staying there. Paul Dano plays the young man and Robert De Niro plays his estranged father. The film is based on 'Another Bullshit Night in Suck City' the memoir of Nick Flynn (who Dano plays in the film). It's pretty dark and emotionally detached but it's also somewhat involving and interesting in places and De Niro and Dano are both outstanding in it.The story revolves around writer Nick Flynn, who as the film opens is dumped by his girlfriend and moves into a loft with a couple guys in Boston. He befriends a friend of his roommates, named Denise (Olivia Thirlby), who he sleeps with while she notes she's not interested in a relationship. He then gets a job at the homeless shelter where she works and the two do become romantically involved (of course) shortly later (after she's impressed by his writing abilities). Nick continues to have flashbacks of his mom (Julianne Moore) who worked two jobs raising him as a single mother before committing suicide later in his life. His life is thrown for another dramatic curve when his father (De Niro), a self proclaimed genius writer, enters his life for the first time and moves in to the shelter where he works.The film is described as a comedy drama but it's pretty light on laughs. For the most part it's very dramatic and quite depressing. Dano gives a very emotionally complex and relatable performance in the lead and De Niro is very memorable as his extremely bigoted and somewhat delusional self centered father. Weitz's directing and screenplay are well done but the film is perhaps just a little too dark and therefore not as impressive as most of his other work. The performances are great though and it's definitely an interesting character study.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj0JA1sJBzw</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quite there....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the start, it was evident that Being Flynn was trying to achieve a certain status - it wanted to be a compelling drama highlighting the lives of a father and his son, both struggling with different aspects of their lives. However, it fell short in more ways than one.The cast was brilliant as Robert de Niro and Paul Dano were both dedicated to their roles and gave their best effort. Unfortunately, the characters were difficult to relate to as they continued to make poor decisions without any clear reason as to why they were making those choices. This made them both unlikeable and therefore I began to lose interest rather early on in the outcome of their situation.In addition, the plot left me feeling entirely unsatisfied. The development of the story was quite slow and I can't indicate any particular moment that served as a clear turning point. It was as if the viewer was only seeing glimpses but was never provided with the entire picture. Very frustrating indeed.I have no temptation to see this film in the future nor would I recommend it to others. Unless of course you are a die-hard Robert de Niro fan who is able to look past the weak plot in order to appreciate his acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro still has it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 'Being Flynn', Robert De Niro plays a taxi driver who resents the world around him. Yes, this is a clear reference to 'Taxi Driver', one of De Niro's best films. And no, 'Being Flynn' is not in the same league with this masterpiece. But yes, De Niro shows in this film that he still is a superb actor. It is somehow fashionable to denounce Robert De Niro as a has-been. True, he has played some parts that tarnished his reputation based upon his work in the seventies and eighties. But in 'Being Flynn', he does a great job playing a taxi driver who becomes a homeless bum but retains his dignity by convincing himself that he is a great writer. His homeless existence is in fact a blessing because it produces lots of 'material' for his great novel, he tells his son who works in the shelter where he spends the night. The confrontation between father and son is the central element in this movie. The son hates his father who left the family and never cared about his child. But at the same time, he realizes that he could become just as irresponsible as his father - his life is just as aimless. In the end, it all turns out well. Remember, this is a Hollywood product. That's also the reason the producers took the regrettable decision to change the title of the film. The book it is based upon is called 'Another Bullsh*t Night in Suck City', which in my opinion is a truly great title. Just say it aloud a few times. It has a nice rhythm, and of course it describes a whole mindset in just a few words. The title 'Being Flynn' is bland, dull, uninspired and meaningless. Is says a lot about the US that a relatively innocent word like bullsh*t can't be used for a mainstream film. (I have to write an asterisk instead of an i for the same reason). Still, there are not many other commercial concessions in this film. There's no sentimentality, nor any moral standpoint. It's a well-performed and efficiently directed father-son drama with De Niro's great acting as a cherry on the cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Taxi Driving King of Literature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are familiar characters within Robert DeNiro's Jonathan Flynn. For starters, he's a closed-minded TAXI DRIVER. And he's in his own world and fancies himself a famous author ? much like THE KING OF COMEDY dreamt of being a famous comedian. But this Flynn only pretends to be narrating a true story as he, after being thrown out of his apartment and losing his job, wanders the streets in the freezing cold New York City nights. It's his son Nick, a twenty-something who'd grown up with a single mother (Julianne Moore in sporadic flashbacks) with only dad's letters and pictures, whose narration is legit. Nick resides in a closed-down strip bar and works at a homeless shelter where his father, a barking, opinionated bully, eventually resides. The inter-workings of the shelter gives the viewer an involving, realistic yet somewhat watered-down experience of how the other half lives. But when Nick, played with dependable pathos by Paul Dano, morphs into a cocaine habit ? strungout one minute and clean the next ? the real story sidetracks. It's the relationship with pop that keeps the movie grounded and interesting. And for DeNiro fans, while this isn't one of his top-shelf performances, it far exceeds the mediocre grimacing cop roles he's sleepwalked through for the last decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacked the bonding elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is like a realistic portrayal of father and son bonding movie. Except it goes a bit too realistic to make it moving or touching for that matter. I mean it's difficult to see how the bonding can be difficult if the father leaves the family for 18yr without any good reason. But there just wasn't enough intimate moments between the father and the son, maybe just one scene that stood out. And the father Jonathan Flynn(Rober De Niro) is a conceited and detestable guy, he is also a racist. Not a extreme one but still a racist. Anyways he is a failed writer that is fool of himself and has nothing else to do but look down upon society and the people. While his son(Paul Dano) who also wants to be a writer has his life spiraling downward because he feels like nothing and because of his past scars. So he decides to work in a homeless shelter where he meets his father. The movie however lacked the bonding elements and just has the two characters having different perspectives and living different lifestyles although they are both struggling. Like how one is a alcoholic and the other a drug addict. Despite their differences there is one intimate moment between them that really stands out. And it's a shame there isn't more of those scenes in this movie. Paul Dano is good but Robert De Niro is magnificent and he pulls off a character that is detestable but you can't have that much hatred for the guy. It's nice to see De Niro at the top of his game again but the movie as a whole just isn't all that good nor does it pull on the heartstrings all that much.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memoirs of a Moron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Having done no research to determine how closely Nick Flynn's autobiography/memoirs entitled "Another Bull**** Night in Suck City" follows his real life, it is safe for me to say that there is some pleasure to be had from a movie that lacks the traditional Hollywood ending of redemption for rotten souls. We do know that in real life, as in the movie, Nick met his long-lost father while working at a homeless shelter. This happened after Nick's mother committed suicide.This story will strike a familiar chord with anyone who has experienced abandonment by a parent (or two). Hopefully, your story doesn't also include the alcohol and drug abuse, as well as the guilt of believing you were responsible for the loving parent's suicide. Nick's story does.Nick is played well with an almost detached passive aggressiveness by Paul Dano. He seems constantly numbed by the situation life places him in. Astonishment kicks in when he comes face to face with his father Jonathan, a self-proclaimed brilliant writer, but also con artist and racist. Jonathan, played by Robert DeNiro, is first seen as a taxi driver. Yes, Robert DeNiro as a taxi driver, almost 40 years after his iconic turn in Taxi Driver! It's a startling image for a movie lover, but one that doesn't last long. Jonathan loses that job as he has lost everything else.Nick's internal battle is obvious. He doesn't want to be his father, but constantly sees glimpses that they are more similar than he would prefer. Nick manages to mess up a good thing with his co-worker played by the terrific Olivia Thirlby. She experiences the frustration of trying to save someone who doesn't really want to be saved.Strong support work comes from Wes Studi, Dale Dickey, William Stadler, Lili Taylor (Nick Flynn's real life wife) and Julianne Moore. Ms. Moore plays Nick's mother, but really has little to do. Though she provided a strong foundation for Nick, this is really the story of Nick and Jonathan. It's DeNiro's best dramatic work in years and is a reminder that he is capable of more than the Focker movies (Paul Weitz actually directed Being Flynn AND Little Fockers, as well as About a Boy and American Pie).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a meh-worthy indie fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a compulsive completist of Ms. Moore (or basically any other prolific thespians), one is destined to face some meh-worthy titles in her immense body of work, BEING FLYNN unfortunately fits that category.Directed and written by Paul Weitz, the story is based on the true story of Nick Flynn (Dano), a young wannabe-writer works temporarily in a Boston shelter for homeless people, who is contracted by his father Jonathan Flynn (De Niro), for the first time after 18 years and later, Nick comes across him again in the shelter, Jonathan, a taxi driver and self-boasting poet and writer (in fact, he humbles himself to be just one of the three greatest American writers ever, guess who are the other two?), vexingly brags that he is float on the fringe of being discovered for his yet-to-be- finished novel, experiences a downward spiral in his recent life and is plunged into the abyss of vagrancy.A platitudinous plot of father-son's from-bitter-to-sweet reconciliation will duly pans out after their unplanned reunion, but before that, Weitz promisingly juggles with two paralleled narrations from Jonathan and Nick separately with considerable verve. Both contend to be the more proficient raconteur, Jonathan is the apposite re-imagination of what will happens to Travis Bickle after TAXI DRIVER (1976), still a cabby in his twilight year, ever so discontented, prejudiced and delusional. And Nick, seems to be stuck in a limbo reckoning with his future and relationships, who attempts a casual relationship with his co-worker Denise (Thirlby, whom by the way, seems utterly uninterested in their romance) after cheating from his air-hostess girlfriend (a cameo from Waterston), and is unable to pull himself together from his fond memories of his late mother Jody (Moore, underused in her single-mother cliché with subtle frustration and taedium vitae gnawing underneath her calm facade, it is a sheer crime that she doesn't share any scenes with De Niro! What are you thinking, Mr. Weitz?) and an oscillating resolution to shut Jonathan completely out of his life.As thrilling as to see De Niro return as a cabby with the unabated fervour (one of his most committed work in ages) and he even delivers another bombast in front of a mirror as a patent homage, woefully one finds his Jonathan comes off as overbearing, insufferable and nuances are extremely wanting, a radical, sexist, homophobic, racist, family-deserter, coward, egoist, it is a clumsy tactic to make him that abhorrent and hope empathy will smoothly ensue later. Granted, it seems courageous for Flynn to insist on an unadorned depiction of his's own father (since this kind of character does exist, everywhere), it is ups to Weitz that a certain dramatic license is required to smooth Jonathan's edges, not at the least because eventually, it is all about a heartwarming and hard-earned second chance of a long-lost family bond, in lieu of a justified broadside against an irresponsible father and an incorrigible daydreamer.Dano looks quite self-conscious in scenes shared with De Niro, but excels in rendering Nick's dithering frame-of-mind towards his personal dilemma. The depiction of the working conditions in a shelter dealing with hobos is both minutely re-enacted and consciously sanitised, dark corners are left undisclosed, lest it will avert many a fastidious viewer, that can be regarded as an encapsulation of the film as a whole, a character study could go digging into something more contentious and darker (for example, what is Jonathan's attitude about his abandonment? He never betrays anything even remotely contrite in front of his son), that's why the end result is neither consistently exciting nor awfully mawkish, nondescript seems to be the right word I'm searching for here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a kind of parable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>gray. touching. almost beautiful. profound cruel. and melancholic. a film with a rare, for last decade, de Niro. and an impressive Paul Dano performance. a basic story, like many others. a son, a father, the meeting. and the life like field of battle for each. it is a kind of parable. its virtue - the delicacy to present nuances of shadows , gestures and words.nothing else. nothing more. only reality in frame of a case. and the end as key of a way. it is a film about common existence. frustration, place in world, expectations, lies as forms of survive. seed of reflection. and force of actors performance, wise script , slice of common fact in different light.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If only they made this about Robert De Niro</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Flynn (Paul Dano) is lost but hopes to be a writer. He takes a job at a homeless shelter in Boston, and then later finds his father, Jonathan (Robert De Niro) taking residence.Jonathan is self professed great writer and master of all. He is an absentee dad. He is unlikeable, annoying, and prideful. Nick is a weak individual and just can't take Jonathan anymore.Paul Dano is once again playing the flustered guy. He is not likable and he is too pathetic. It is impossible to root for him.If this was about the mentally unstable Robert De Niro, it could be an award winning performance. It's somewhat wasted on a film about his son.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A circular story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have over 100 minutes of the same topic being told over and over! What was Director Paul Weitz thinking?We see over and over Nick Flynn's relationship with his over stressed mother and psychotic bum father. Dano is sadly one dimensional and predictable - even with all the evidence before him of how he will end up if he doesn't change his ways. De Niro is a wise old sage in one scene then a screaming maniac in another, then a boozed up drunk in another scene and all the while he says the same thing over and over to Nick (his son).We - the viewers - know how this story will end. Believe me, it's no surprise! The ending of the movie might as well have been the beginning! I was bored watching and now I'm bored writing about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very solid, watchable film.Great performances by Paul Dano, who is turning into one of the best actors of his generation, and Robert DeNiro, who more than gets the job done.The film loses momentum towards the end, and is 15 minutes longer than it needs to be. But this is a minor quibble over a film which is better than 95% of the schlock which is being produced nowadays.Thanks for making this.***************** But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>De Niro acts! Shock!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In what must have come as a shock to the poor old bugger, De Niro gets parachuted into a real film! For quite some time now De Niro has simply had to turn up on set, stay awake for a couple of hours and collect a handsome pay check. In what must have been bewildering for a man of his advancing years such vaguely familiar phrases from the mists of time such as "plot" "characterization" and "motivation" were being thrown at him from all angles. Could the venerable duffer rise to the challenge? Partly... Even though strictly speaking De Niro isn't the star he certainly carries this movie, his co-stars, stunned like dazzled rabbits caught in the headlights, don't really convince. Paul Dano continues to play the same disaffected teenager we saw in "Little Miss Sunshine" while the rest of the cast keep there heads down and make for cover. Julianne Moore takes the bull by the horns, pity there aren't any scenes with her and De Niro.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. DeNiro, I review movies by addressing a person involved. This is a first. You are the man. It is Your snake film.Here is what it meant to me. Some ten years ago I read about the ruins down south, how the two civilizations united their galactic mythologies. It seemed convincing, an exact orbital extrapolation corresponding with the centre in exactly 2002, Hendaye, France. Leaving the Earth out of this, I remember thinking about Christmas Eve, and all the magic my parents entertained uniquely around that time, thinking how much longer that would take with the illusion, about seventy years a degree would give St. Nick another 200 years or so, no end to the miracle.With respect to just us men, there is this idea I came across only yesterday, in a way You may agree could not be more appropriate, however childish [ BearPublishing ]. It is the idea of a "Guardian of the Threshold". Having thoroughly smoothed this bump over myself with Neil's metaphysical bulldozer and (more recently) a rationalization of my having destroyed the Venus pattern (do not think about it that way), I want to sincerely congratulate You on my awesome interpretation of Your offering the Soul with this, to the Catholic Church to possibly brainwash and transform the Priesthood with. What I want to point out at large is the virtue of Steiner's mental gymnastics about the "etheric body", especially those "warmth eggs on Saturn" he went on about. What is happening with this whole ExpectoPatronum is realistically a final necessary inflection of collective consciousness towards normal liberation, like humours crusting away the clown. I do not mean consciousness like Jung did, rather in a way of shared sensory pattern.PooYing, Tomasz Kapler</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An emotional journey for father and son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a young man whose father left and his mother killed herself. Years later, he meets his father again unexpectedly in a homeless shelter."Being Flynn" is an emotional journey for both Nick and his father. Their lives both spiral downward out of control, and they somehow have to find salvation. The story exposes their wounds openly, dissecting each problem for viewers to see. I feel sorry for Nick having to witness his father's deterioration, and ultimately his own downfall. It is an engaging story that can drag your mood down with it. Maybe that is why the film is good, as it provokes emotional reactions for the viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Being Flynn to DiNero's liking.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having sleepwalked through his last two dozen or so films Robert DiNero gives his best since the mid nineties as a washed up taxi driver in Being Flynn. It's no Bickle or La Motta but it's a worthy lion in winter turn that up until now was glaringly missing from the canon of an admirable career give or take thirty or so films.Nick Flynn (Paul Dano) trying to find some direction in his life begins to work at a homeless center when he get's a call from his long absent, dead beat father, Jonathan (DiNero) in need of his pick-up because he's being evicted. From there Jonathan begins to spiral and ultimately ends up at the center where Nick and dad fail to bond. Nick soon finds himself sliding as well.DiNero keeps Flynn at arms length from audience sympathy with a performance that softens only slightly at the end. Unrepenant, delusional (he considers himself a writer of the first rank) there's no getting close no matter how much Nick enables the old man with the only flashes of revelation for one or both driven home by director Paul Weitz with flashbacks of his deceased mother (Julianne Moore).Moore and Dano mold well to the film's oppressive mood with its setting of grinding poverty, drug use and the inability to connect but the plot's glum mood and Nick's passive response becomes leaden without much advancement. Weitz lays it on thick with some heavy handed flashbacks since their is little room to grow with father and son remaining at an impasse. Abandoning any hint of comedy relief his vision remains unremittingly dour and the nature of the films backdrop begins to limp along with monotonous montage before a semi- redemptive climax ties things together; perhaps a little too neat, though with the irascible Flynn you never can tell what the future holds.</fullReview>
