		<shortDescription>Extremely likable action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sharp knives, big guns, awesome fights, great dialog, wonderful characters and Selma Hayek looks better then ever. These are just a few reasons why I like this movie."Desperado" is more than an action movie. It has tons of fun in it which makes the movie extremely likable to watch. The action is way over the top but it works very well since the movie obviously doesn't take itself serious. It's fun and cool to watch at the same time."Desperado" is a kind of movie that really needs no story and basically there isn't really any. All the fun characters, dialog and action sequences make you forget that there isn't really a story. The Quentin Tarantino cameo is especially entertaining and so are almost every Mexican bad guy that are all in one way or another over the top.A must see, in my opinion.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard many people say that they couldn't follow the plot of this flick.I think they totally missed the point of this movie.ITS AN ACTION MOVIE.thats the whole plot.Its called lets find the bad guy,and his henchmen,and kill them.I thought it was absolute genius.Skip the plot,and go straight to the action.Banderas was pure fire.All his emotions smouldering just beneath the surface.The stunts and effects were first rate and extremely entertaining.Even the extras did great work.I would recommend this film to anyone who is wanting some great entertainment.Mark me don't go looking for some Oscar winning dramatic performances.But it is fun,pure unadulterated fun.Also the photography is absolutely first rate.As is the almost Kubrickesque atmosphere of the film.Ydnar</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can You Say 'Preposterous?" (But Lots Of Fun)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are so many adjectives one could use describing this film, I wouldn't know where to begin to start. I'll just try to limit them to a few. The headline here states one of them. Others could be "ludicrous," "fun," "amusing," "stupid," etc. You get the idea.Robert Rodriguez took the profits from his first film, "El Mariachi," and continued on with the story now with more funds, so he made it glossier, more explosive, added some name actors and, of course, way overdid it, making it almost a cartoon it is so outrageous. He continued this with the third film, "Once Upon A Time In Mexico" which is even more of the same. If something worked subtly the first time, filmmakers think that to improve on it is by bombarding the audience with it the next time. They don't know when enough is enough and, boy, does that apply to Rodriguez. He does keep you entertained, though, once you check your brains at the door and begin watching the show. However, all this excess makes it lose any credibility "El Mariachi" might have built up with the first show in this trilogy.Whether the movie is really dumb or its just tongue-in-cheek humor by Rodriguez, it has super-style and fun to watch. Talk about stylish! No wonder Quentin Tarantino and he are good friends and the latter has a guest appearance in the film. They both love having fun with the cameras.The first eight minutes let you know what you are in for: outrageousness. It's an 8-minute scene at a bar involving a story told by Steve Buscemi. It's one of the highlights of the movie.Antonio Bandaras and Selyma Hayek are the "good guys" but they aren't exactly Billy Graham and Mother Teresa. If they are the good guys, you can imagine how evil the "bad guys" are? Speaking of them, two of the toughest- looking hombres in the business are chief among the villains: Joaquim de Almeida and Danny Trejo.Some of the action scenes are so outrageous you laugh out loud. My favorite was a guy shooting rockets out of his guitar case! As that tells you, it's just a wild ride: 103 minutes of south-of-the-border Rodriguez-Tarantino lunacy and despite what may sound like a bunch of insults, I always have fun watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sinking us back into the gritty life of a tormented guitar player, Rodriguez sets the stage for an amazing film. This time, Antonio Banderas steps into the role of the troubled Mariachi as he continues his quest to rid Mexico of the corrupted drug lord that destroyed his life. Using friends like Steve Buscemi, he finds the town that is harboring his villain named Bucho. The Mariachi's form of questioning normally leads to several dead, a cinematic gun fight, and some classic Sergio Leone verbiage. Unfortunately, our hero does not escape unscathed and finds himself being healed by the likes of Carolina, a bookstore beauty played by Selma Hayek. Together they build a steamy relationship that will help our Mariachi reach his final destination.As more gunfights, explosions, and blood rock this independent blockbuster, we soon discover a hidden secret about our hero, one that could change the course of his destination.This was an impressive second outing by director Robert Rodriguez. While I was worried that Hollywood would have drained too much of his imagination, it was instead the direct opposite. Hollywood gave him the tools to build an amazing 'sequel'. While different, yet the similar to his independent feature 'El Mariachi', Rodriguez sets the stage for a roller coaster film that makes you hold your breath and pray for more. He has taken elements from his first film and expanded them to new levels. Banderas is perfect as our 'new' Mariachi and the chemistry between him and Selma Hayek cannot be contested. Banderas' ability to control this enraged man was spectacular. They worked as our two main focuses of this film. Coupled with some humorous moments with Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino, this film successfully stood on its own two feet thanks not just to the action, but the actors in their respective roles. Finally, Rodriguez is a genius behind the camera. He is able to give us exactly the right amount of action, drama, and comedy for our liking. He is the proverbial salad bar of cinema. While giving us this deeply rooted character hell-bent on destroying this drug lord, he also lets our imaginations wander with his comical and cartoonish action sequences. The scenes of men flying through the air after being shot are somewhat comical, yet completely Rodriguez. He has successfully created this world that is all uniquely his own. Rodriguez has done this by giving the world depth and outside characters. He builds suspense and also suspicion all at the same time.Overall, an amazing film (in case you haven't noticed) that should be found in nearly everyone's film collection. Grade: ***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true 90's cowboy movie, everyone who saw El Mariachi could foresee that this picture would take the concept to the top. Fast-paced, greatly shot, incredibly edited, this movie refuses to take itself seriously and is well-succeeded in so. Antonio Banderas is the perfect Mariachi, adding a new depth to the first movie's main character. He seeks revenge. Revenge for all the things they did to him. And he will get it, the easy way or the hard way. Fellow portuguese Joaquim de Almeida is Bucho, the villain, whose relationship with El Mariachi turns out quite surprising near the end. Until they both meet, there will be much gun-slinging action to fill the screen with anthological scenes, like the bar fight, the "Quedate Aqui" song and the final showdown. The movie is a comedy, even in the action scenes. I guarantee it, it's two hours of fun and a visible influence of the Westerns and B-Movies in someone's talent. Cracking good fun, which becomes addictive. Memorable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Rodriguez's sequel-cum-remake of El Mariachi.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Desperado (1995) was a fun and big budgeted version of Desperado. Robert Rodriguez has fun with the film and the characters from El MARIACHI. Antonio Banderas stars as the mythical El Mariachi whilst Salma Hayyek co-stars as his love interest. Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino are among the other stars who make guest star appearances.El Mariachi is hiding out in another small desert town. He's become a legendary vigilante who's still seeking out justice for his dead girlfriend. He has a companion (Steve Buscemi) who helps him out find those who were connected to the boss from the first film. During one of his hits, a hired gun from another crime family comes into town (Danny Trejo). He also fits the description of El Mariachi (somewhat). A local book dealer (Salma Hayek) crosses paths with the legendary crime fighter. Who is the man behind all of El Mariachi's sorrow? Why is he so desperate to single handedly trying to crush the crime in the area? How does he do it by himself? Is he that good? To find out the answers for all of these questions you'll just have to watch DESPERADO.A fun second parter to EL MARIACHI. Unlike most sequels, you don't need to watch the first film to enjoy this one. It's just another entertaining film that'll burn some time. Enjoy!Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best all-round film of the three...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching El Mariachi, it was easy to see the improvement in production values between the two. Not surprising, considering the difference in the price tag of the two films. But, as I pointed out in my El Mariachi review, money isn't everything.Although better visually, Desperado benefits from better actors who bring more life to the characters. The overall effect, given another reasonable plot, is to make a much more polished looking film that deservedly did as well as it did at the box office.The aforementioned plot is, essentially, the same as the first film when you boil it down - the Mariachi ends up killing a lot of no-good drug-dealers and warlords etc. - and there's the obligatory love interest. But although very similar, this movie was more enjoyable due to it's overall finish and style.I originally watched this movie some years ago, long before I got to see the original El Mariachi, so I suppose I am a little biased in preferring this one to the the first in that Banderas IS the Mariachi as far as I was concerned. But not to knock the first movie, which tells us the early history of the Mariachi, and is a worthy film in its own right.Desperado is good, if sometimes a little gory, fun. Nothing to analyse too much, just enjoy. If you have the opportunity, watch the original, then this one and things will make a lot more sense. Desperado has enough back history woven into it to make it a standalone film, but the overall experience is better watching the two back to back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch Out, El Mariachi Is Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rodriguez follows up 'El Mariachi' with 'Desperado'. Many seem to have preferred the raw look that 'El Mariachi' had and while 'Desperado' is more 'sophisticated' in the making and more polished, that doesn't prevent it from being an awesome action entertainer. For me, it was just as much fun as 'El Mariachi'. Rodriguez does what he does best. He already mentioned that his Mariachi films are a tribute to the western cinema that names like Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood defined and 'Desperado' works perfectly with its comic book story, quirky characters and over-the-top action sequences. Moving at a rapid pace, the direction and editing are top notch. The cinematography is brilliant too. Antonio Banderas does a good job taking over the role from Carlos Gallardo (who sort of plays his sidekick in this one). However, it is Salma Hayek that steals the show even though the story is dominated by El Mariachi. As Carolina, she is sensual, witty, charming and quite clever too. Hayek delivers a very natural performance and owns each and every one of her scenes. In addition, there are some wonderful cameos by Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, Steve Buscemi and Danny Trejo. Overall, 'Desperado' is full throttle entertainment. This is what an action entertainer is supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, but not as good as others would like you to believe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Credit IMDb. With this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film, "El Mariachi," director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of "El Mariachi," where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets mistaken for a hit-man and thereby entangled in a web of love, corruption, and death. This time, he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However, the plot is recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face-to-face confrontation and bloody showdown.Desperado is a decent but overrated installment in Rodriguez's infamous trilogy. Action scenes are stylish, Banderas is a bad ass, but I felt a bit cold when it was all done. Some of the scenes wowed me, yet some bored me. Banderas's and Hayek's chemistry was the real story here.Performances. Antonio Banderas is as cool as ice here. Unlike Once Upon Time in Mexico, he's able to roam free here. He was highly entertaining. Salma Hayek is easy on the eyes, no doubt, but she can also hold her own acting wise. She's sassy, sexy and credible. Cheech Marin has a cool role as a bartender, while Danny Trejo rocks it.Bottom line. A bit overrated, but the good outweighs the bad for the most part. Settle your expectations and you'll be OK. You might even think it lives up to the hype, but I didn't. Worth a watch.6 ? 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some movies are just brimming with potential, and it's not hard to see that they are a very short distance from being fantastic. I'm a big fan of stylish violence and over-the-top gun-play, but I can't help but wish that Desperado had more than that to offer.&nbsp;Well...it has that and ample helpings of Salma Hayek looking her absolute best, but thats not quite enough to make up for the fact that this movie doesn't hold up well to subsequent viewings. The first time around it's a blast, but the second time it could barely hold my attention in most scenes. File Desperado into the category of movies that start of really strongly, and then slowly lose steam as they go along. Some more humor, clever dialogue, or a stronger story, would have greatly helped to fill in the slow areas between the action scenes.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Important spoiler references: avoid reading this if you haven't seen the film.Why does the Colombian knife-thrower attack El Mariachi &amp; Buscemi? Why does Carolina decide to make love with him? How does he survive, at the end, when there are so many guns trained on him? (Not to mention all the earlier fights, of course)? Aren't there any police *at all*, even corrupt ones, to be worried about the mass slaughters? (Not having seen the earlier film) Doesn't he know about the relationship between him and Bucho? Okay, the fights are tremendous, and sometimes humorous (I especially liked the part where El Mariachi and the accountant are locked in deadly struggle and keep grabbing and levelling empty guns simultaneously), Salma Hayek is good value, the setting is evocative - but this really seems like a first-person shooter brought to life. The mark I give reflects the darkly humorous elements as much as anything.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do like action films. If you are going to make it ridiculous, then let it be funny. I felt like there was an attempt to make it serious- which failed miserably.Banderas has the guns with 3000 bullets. He only runs out of ammo when the script is setting him up for predictable scene. It wasn't as bloody as Kill Bill- just close.I was stuck at the airport with only one DVD movie left to watch, so I viewed this one. If I had any alternatives to watch, I would have ejected it within the first 15 minutes.If they had just showed a little more of a naked Salma Hayek, she was worth the score of 2.

		<shortDescription>A Classic (Just not sure why)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wouldn't say that "Desperado" is unwatchable but it didn't merit a second viewing for me. I saw that it was on TV and stayed up to watch it, then wondered why I bothered. It beats "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" into a cocked hat in terms of plot but it does rely on the screen presence of Antonio Banderas, Steve Buscemi and others to keep the viewer interested.The gunfights are ludicrous, with villains spraying rounds about like hose sprinklers and the good guys knocking them down with shot after shot. It reminded me of the "A Team" TV series, although Hannibal and co shared the poor aim of the bad guys. One word sums this film up. "Overkill". Too many guns, too much casual killing and not enough snappy dialogue. It also has a disappointing climax that makes it look like the producers couldn't afford another bloody and spectacular set piece to finish it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was highly recommended by some folks. i saw it in cinema with my brother and his 2 friends. At the end we were in disgust and regretting our decision to pay extra money and losing one weekend over this. From the start we did not understand what s going on , there was only killing with bullets firing in an unrealistic fashion. Quite a few action sequences were unbelievable carrying no weight. In one final battle cars were coming directly straight Antonio and his 2 buddies they spray bullets over bullets , not a single one hits the while his shot just inside from his guitar case is far more accurate. The whole film was lost during the process of mindless gun fights. I think its successor was way better than it. such movies can only be enjoyed very much teenage and some immature minds who only want to see violence with no proper plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comparing Rodriguez to John Woo is a terrible insult to the latter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rodriguez is quite fond of comparing himself to John Woo. But most of the "hip" American directors who emerged in the nineties, Tarantino and Rodriguez included, have not even understood what makes Woo great.For them, all of Woo's influence has been translated into an axiom of "violence is cool". From the playful nonchalant attitude of "Pulp Fiction" to the desperate attempts in "Desperado" to amuse the audience, these directors have tried to make violence funny, playful, exciting.For Woo, violence is anything but "cool". A violent action has motivations, meanings and repercussions. When a character dies in a Woo movie, it is never without reason. It dies because it has been defeated in a battle of ideals, or, on the contrary, it has fulfilled its ideal by dying. Compare this to the meaningless gore in "Desperado", when characters are introduced and then killed off without the slightest reason.In "The Killer", which Rodriguez has ridiculously compared "Desperado" to, the leading character's fate is a matter of crime and punishment, and he knows that. He kills others, and he accepts that the cosmic order of things dictates that he has to die - and not only to die, but in the same way he has hurt the one he loved most. Believing that he commits justice by killing others, now the killer needs to accept that same justice being acted out against him.Now, just compare this to the randomness and tastelessness in "Desperado". A character played by Tarantino is introduced, apparently because Rodriguez thought it would be funny. It is then killed without any real reason and without any emotional effect on the audience, maybe because it is not really possible to withstand such an idiotic and unrealistic character for more than a few minutes. Antonio Banderas is such an abominable actor, that even if his actions have some emotional consequences for him (as they obviously do for Woo's leading character in The Killer), he is completely unable to display them.The closest Rodriguez came to Woo is in "El Mariachi", if only because in that film, the leading character is interesting to follow: He knows that as a man who lives for music, he no longer belongs in this world which cares only for money. The movie had soul, if only because Rodriguez quite obviously thought of himself as a Mariachi of sorts when he wrote the script.And then came all the Hollywood money and ruined him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If there's one thing that Desparado does better than 99.5% of movies it's the gun fight sequences. Antonio Banderas is a man on a single minded mission. Much like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver only not as cool. Banderas does a great job as nameless man with a suitcase full of really cool guns. Great supporting performances by Steve Buscemi (great joke), Danny Trejo (cool with knives), Cheech Marin, and the super sexy Salma Hayek. Good action choreography, writing, directing. Special kudos to the cinematographer and his lighting crew for keeping Antonio Banderas in the dark at the beginning. Tons of great scenes and the afore mentioned gun play. Stole the sleeve gun idea from Taxi Driver. I kind of wish the Desparado's two friends at the end wouldn't have died, they rock. It was a good waste of cool characters. Watch this with Taxi Driver, El Mariachi, and Red Heat. 9.3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rodriguez at his Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Rodriguez, what happened to you? You're clearly talented. You have more imagination and creativity than the majority of filmmakers working in Hollywood today. You're not afraid to go ALL OUT with your style to make the movies you want to make without worrying about what the critics would think. And you know how to do a lot of cool stuff with limited budgets. So why do you subject yourself to making garbage kids'movies like Spy Kids and poor imitations of exploitation films like Machete? However, when Rodriguez was good, he WAS good, and Desperado is probably him at his best.The plot of Desperado follows the character of El Mariachi after the events of the first film where he is now going after Bucho, the mob boss of Moco, the mobster who killed the woman he loved, Domino in the first film. Along the way, he comes across a woman named Carolina, a kid playing guitar, an assassin named Navajas, and many more on his quest to end Bucho.From a pure storytelling and scripting point of view, Desperado probably isn't a very good movie. Rodriguez, even in his heyday, has never been a particularly strong writer. He's always been a style over substance guy and this film's script clearly shows. Now I'm not saying the script sucked because the characters lacked depth or there isn't enough meaning and subtext because not every film needs to have those things, but as in it's a little lazy in its construction. For one thing, the character motivation of El Mariachi is really kinda vague and confusing. He wants revenge on the man who was the boss of the guy who killed his love, whom, really can't be held accountable for what happened and probably doesn't even know why someone would go on a vendetta against him like this in the first place. The film also doesn't really make this clear to the audience until the very end so a lot of the time, you'll just be confused as to why he's after him in the first place. It's even one of the FAQ's on this site. So in terms of character motivation, this film is a little weak.There's also some things in the film that just come out of nowhere, with no decent buildup or explanation. Midway through the film, El needs help to fight off Bucho's men so he calls up two friends who both have their own guitar-based weapon which is a really cool scene, but those guys are just randomly introduced into the film with no buildup whatsoever. They were never mentioned beforehand so it just comes across as a bit of a deus ex machina. There's also an incredibly stupid twist at the end of the film where it's revealed that Bucho is actually the Mariachi's brother. Outside of the fact that it's incredibly cliché to have the villain be somehow related to the hero in an action movie, there's also no real purpose to this. It's just a cheap excuse for the Mariachi not to kill Bucho at one point in the film when he has the perfect chance to. It doesn't even add much internal conflict for the characters as he just shoots him at the end anyways without any regret or guilt over doing so. So yeah, it's a pretty dumb twist.But while the film has those flaws, this is an undeniably entertaining movie. Robert Rodriguez may not be a great storyteller, but in terms of action, he's off-the-chart. This film has some really creatively staged, memorable shootouts that are clearly influenced by the works of John Woo, but have a certain exaggerated, almost comic-book-like quality to them and a sense of humor that make them incredibly fun to watch. Nobody in this film just falls down when they get shot, they either get riddled with bullets or they fly across the room while getting shot. There's also a lot of grace and choreography going on here, with Antonio Banderas jumping all-around and shooting people in all sorts of creative ways such as hitting a fan on the ceiling for it to drop on someone or kicking a guy across the room and then UNLOADING his pistols on him. The only thing that disappointed me, was the final confrontation, which was JUST the Mariachi shooting Bucho and then... the end. But overall, the action was pretty sweet.While Rodriguez isn't exactly Shakespeare, he DID manage to write some memorable scenes here. The opening scene has this great, spaghetti western feel to it with Steve Buscemi telling the story of how he came across the Mariachi in a bar in this exaggerated, stylized way with a lot of slow-mo and stylized lighting used for the Mariachi's entrance, it's a really fun way to open the movie. The camera movement is very dynamic throughout, and the action is FLAWLESSLY edited. He even squeezed in some memorable dialogue here and there with Tarantino telling an elaborate pee joke in a cameo midway through the film.The performances are a little uneven here, but Antonio Banderas STEALS the show here as El Mariachi. While Carlos Gallardos did a good job playing an innocent man on the run in the first film, Antonio is easily the more charismatic lead. He's more bada$$, he's funny, he's witty, and he's surprisingly believable in the action scenes. But Selma Hayek is a little bland as Carolina, the love interest for El. She looks nice but she doesn't have much personality beyond that. Joaquim de Almeida is a really generic, 80's/90's action movie villain and that's all there is to him. He's efficient, but not particularly memorable. Steve Buscemi does a good job as El's accomplice and I wish we could've seen more of him.Overall, while Desperado isn't a particularly well-written film, the film makes up for it with an incredible entertainment factor. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very different and much livelier sequel sees a more known actor, step into a shoes of that mysterious guitarist whose case stores an arsenal of death. Yes, he's that mysterious stranger whose somehow acquired a gift for gunfire overnight, or was it a silent deadly talent. Whatever it is, this non stop spectacle of action, amidst explosions and bloodshed is just that, not to be taken seriously. Bubblegum escapist fare. Cool, sexy Banderas makes a name for himself as the new bad..rse, out to settle a score if you know, from watching the first, only to receive a thunderblow of shock as to the identity of the avenged. Joaquin De Almedia is fantastic as the deadly Bucho, (only film I saw him in before-The Honorary Consul, what happened?) who's entourage he sends to find this so called myth of a man, only results in them coming back dead or injured. Banderas is great as the new hero, you so much vouch for, one cool gunslinger, and this is his movie. The way those two pistols pop up from under his coat sleeves is so cool, as many other things in this flick are. A movie, did you ask? No. A non stop action flick, super spectacular, just to get lost in, as well as Hayek's beauty, a fitting song, in light of the head turning accidents she causes. Buscemi is likable and funny as Bandera's sender of bad news, through his carefully detailed stories, that send of hearts racing. QT's joke goes down as a killer in my book, and he's so well enunciated, as he tells it (you'll split your heels) lapping it up for the camera. We catch momentary frames of him that actually paint as a different bad dude character, where really sometimes directors should stay where they belong. Danny Trejo, adds great nasty menace too as one nasty ugly Mexican, 15 years shy of his Machete role, who you don't want to f..k with. A much contrast to his role in Heat as one of Deniro's posse. Too in these sort of escapist fares, we have scenes of incredulity, one including Banderas, falling backwards onto the roof of a much lower building and not braking his back. Check out the opening credit scene with Banderas and his mariachi's capturing the attention of a room full of bar patrons, playing a great guitar playing track. Action, action, action, action, and more action. I can't put it better. We have bits of humor too, adding flavour, but mostly it's in not so happy instances. You will admire, revenge filled Banderas's persistence and stamina too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect ride doesn't need a good story. Neither one at all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a Bar a sort of legend is told. The Mariachi who no longer plays a Guitar. You get to know hes old side as a amazing Guitarrist performing a live-show unlike anyone i heard of before and after. But hes life gets ruined completely. The tragic hero is told to be on hes quest after someone called Bucho. Which never makes true sense to be perfectly honest. But the love for the genre and perfection to all ideas fills Desperado as a ultimate fun action-film. Its never told to be anything more. Almost every scene and every joke are worthy of your time. All the characters are color-full as any could ever possibly be. The tale of the tragic hero is still sensitive. He goes from a clean, nice and peaceful. When forced to violence, a new look appear almost magically on him. The meeting with a kid from the new generation of Mariachis gives it all a deeper dimension. Mostly a fun straight-forward film, done in its own stile. Quentin Tarantino must be doing one of hes greatest achievements right here. The man seem to love jokes, and he perform my personal favorite of all time. Its correct that a movie cant possibly be perfect without a perfect story. But Desperado lets itself be in its own way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Style over substance actually works pretty well here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Rodriguez makes a smashing return to the screen after his Sundance hit El Mariachi, this time with a bigger budget and an A-list cast. Desperado continues the story of Rodriguez's man with no name character, El Mariachi. This time Antonio Banderas plays the gun slinging guitarist who is out for revenge against the people who killed his love and shot his hand, ruining his guitar dreams. He gets himself involved in some serious drug running, and his life gets wrapped up with the other various lives entangled in this illegal mess. But, armed to the teeth, El Mariachi fights off those who oppose him killing anyone who gets in his way. Desperado is a whole lot of style, with enough substance to make it worth the watch.Desperado is littered with incredibly fun scenes, that are overly graphic and excitingly glamorous. It is a major departure from the subdued and grittier style of El Mariachi, but it makes for a very different and equally fulfilling experience, at least in the action department. Rodriguez employs a whole new set of stylistic techniques that give Desperado a lot of glitz, but it is not lame glitz. The movie is insanely fun, albeit silly at times. I can't help but enjoy how wacked out this movie is. It's got plenty of full fledged, no holds bars insanity in its action to really keep it a consistently fun movie to watch. The action hardly ever lets up and none of it seems hackish or mediocre. It's all handled very well and keeps up an awesome and gory ride.Desperado is also filled with some great characters, or should I say caricatures, that are all some laugh out loud awesome cameos. Steve Buscemi and Cheech Marin open the movie with an awesome scene where Buscemi narrates an anecdote about El Mariachi shooting up a bar to Marin the bartender. The scene starts the movie off very strong and establishes that this won't be a serious film, but it won't be a tame one either. Other cameos include Quentin Tarantino as "Pick-Up Guy" who doesn't last long but entertains nonetheless, simply because of the fact that it is Quentin freaking Tarantino. I'm not saying he can act but it is hilarious to watch him try. Danny Trejo shows up as a hard boiled Mexican badass who has no dialouge but is still an awesome caricature of the ultra tough mobster. Carlos Gallardo, the original El Mariachi from the 1992 film even cameos as a Mariachi friend of Banderas' El Mariachi. He plays up the action in one of the most ridiculous and awesome final shootout scenes I've seen in a long time. If you enjoy ridiculous and fun characters, Desperado will leave you satisfied.Desperado's story remains very simple, and there isn't much complexity going on. It's not to say that the story is non existent, but it doesn't go much further than your typical revenge story, which is fine when you can back it up with the fresh exciting style that Rodriguez delivers. It's kind of silly to critique this movie brutally on its lack of intricate plot. It's much easier to just take the movie for what it is and enjoy the wild action the film has no shortage of.Desperado doesn't have the same style as El Mariachi, but what it does is very enjoyable. It focuses much more on its style than its substance, but it works for what it's worth. Overall I think I enjoy the grittier and more independent feel of El Mariachi more but Desperado is undeniably fun. The characters are great, the action is intense, and the story is a simplistic yet substantial tale of revenge. This is a worthwhile watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>derivative, but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An entertaining action film, but very derivative. One could go so far as to say plagiarized, but maybe they paid for what they "borrowed." Another user's comments mention the sleeve gun-play stolen from Taxi Driver, but I noticed one night that the entire hotel gunfight scene (every bit of choreography, from moving through stairways to ducking behind counters) is stolen from a lesser-known Steve McQueen movie, "The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery" (1959). Add slow-motion, put it in Mexico, and you've got a hit on your hands. After all, who would remember a movie from 40 years ago? There's a fine line between rip-off and homage, but it's no surprise that Rodriguez and Tarantino partnered up on his next film, since they both borrow so much from prior masterpieces of action, be it from unknown Chinese kung fu filmmakers or gurus like Sam Peckinpah. Desperado makes for a nice Saturday afternoon, just don't expect depth or originality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hugely underrated movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What most people see when they watch Desperado is the violence, the style, Antonio Banderas' hair, and Salma Hayek's breasts. However, there is so much more to this film if it is combined with its predecessor, El Mariachi. The two main themes that I can identify are listed below -- there are more, but I don't have the time or the space to go into them:1. Loss of innocence: The character of El Mariachi is first shown as an innocent. All he wants to do is make a living playing his songs, then moving on, as his father did before him. By the end of 'El Mariachi', however, he has killed a great number of people to survive circumstances that have little to do with him. There is also the youth who wants to join Bucho's gang. He starts off as a good-natured, chivalrous fighter, but is soon reduced to an aggressive killer by those around him. The innocents of Santa Cecillia as well, such as the young boy, are led into drug dealing. These things show how easily innocence can be destroyed, and also how much it needs to be preserved. Rodriguez shows that the only way to combat this is by having someone on both sides -- a man who is still good, but has lost his innocence -- El Mariachi.2.Fathers and Sons: In one of the closing scenes of Desperado, El Mariachi is shown at the hospital bed of the young boy who he took under his wing, and gives an eloquent speech on how everyone he has killed has been someone's father, brother, or son. Also, the main character wanted to follow his fathers guitar-playing footsteps, which led him down the path which he took, and also led his older brother, Bucho, into a life of crime because he did not have the favour of his father.So next time you watch this film, take in the style, relish the action, but also look for the hidden sub-texts of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperado</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mariachi(Antonio Banderas), whose reputation is of a mythic status, is looking for a drug kingpin, El Bucho(Joaquim de Almeida), the one responsible for the murder of his beloved. What is certainly troubling is who Bucho is to Mariachi and how he must come to terms with this startling truth. A sexy bookstore owner, Carolina(Salma Hayek, whose heavenly body is fit in plenty of dresses elaborating her delectable curves), is soon pulled into this war when she helps Mariachi with bloody wounds suffered at the hands of various hired assassins. I have always considered Robert Rodriguez kind of a Mexican John Woo in how he stages the art of gunplay and explosive action set pieces. Antonio Banderas is in many ways the Chow Yun Fat in RR's action flicks, how he holds and shoots his hand cannons as gunfire cascades all around him, balletic bullet sparks lighting up everything and bodies ripped apart in slow motion. As is always the case in these kinds of movies, the surroundings suffer as much, if not more, than the men themselves. A fleet of paid gunmen at El Bucho's disposal provide Mariachi with plenty of target practice. Yep, RR's "Desperado" is an "exercise in stylized violence"(like there's something wrong with this; I think not!)and I wouldn't have it any other way. The film is built to show men obliterating each other in highly technically efficient ways, Mariachi leaving the expected body count, yet on the receiving end of his share of battle scars(what would a decent action joint be without the customary grisly bullet removal from a gaping flesh wound?)as well. We even have our share of colorful heavies and others showing up to add flavor to the proceedings..Cheech Marin as a sleazy bartender, Steve Buschemi as Mariachi's only friend(and who lends a hand in building the mythos of his pal, RR using him to introduce Mariachi to us in grand fashion), Quentin Tarantino as a "delivery/pick-up" guy who helps traffic drugs, and Danny Trejo as the knife-throwing Navajas who has our desperado in deep doo-doo until El Bucho's own men ruin everything. Hayek and Banderas are as perfectly matched couple as you can find for a film such as this; in aesthetic terms they really mesh well, not to mention both are ridiculously attractive with the camera treating both very well. Made famous in how a guitar case is used to shoot rounds of amunition as well as missiles..also, how cool is a guitar which services our Mariachi as a tool kit to hold all his many weapons!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film in which Rodriquez really came to prominence, Desperado is a continuation from his low budget effort 'El Mariachi', which deservedly gained him recognition from big studies, and indie heroes such as Tarantino. The man with the guitar case full of guns is coming to town, looking for the man who killed the woman he loved. He sends a friend ahead of himself, Buscemi in another great performance, to tell the tale of an encounter with the man, to try and find out if any locals have knowledge of Bucho, the one he believes is responsible for his lover's death. When Banderas finally comes to town several bloodbaths ensue in glorious fashion, and he takes refuge with a local woman played with strength and guts by Salma Hayak. Naturally they fall for each other as The Mariachi gets to the bottom of the mystery.The film has good performances from all, is very stylish and funny, with excellent dialogue, and the plot admittedly takes a step back to let the action have centre stage. The bullets fly everywhere, the action is fluid and original, and the stunts are all the more impressive because of the tiny budget. The sex scene is memorable, not because it is gratuitous, but because of the lighting and cutting, like much of the film. Violent and loud mouthed, but brilliant fun, and one for aspiring directors who have small budgets, proving that it can be done. 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste your time . . . in style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine with me for a second. You're on a blind date. It ends up being the perfect date. A ridiculously sexy woman, at your all-time favorite place to eat. For the first half hour, the date goes great. You can really connect with this woman, and she seems into you, too. Then just before the food is served, she gets up, walks over to you, and?BAM!?out of nowhere, she kicks you in the groin. Over and over again. She professes that she has hated your utter being all along. You'd get up and walk away, right? Maybe file a lawsuit? Well, you can't walk away. You can't because you have to write a review. That's exactly how I feel right now typing this about Desperado. The first half hour of the film is great: great action, great pulp dialogue scenes, great sense of style. Then out of nowhere, Rodriguez feels the need to add a cliché, predictable revenge plot line and focus the other 3/4s of the movie about it. I felt betrayed. I wished I could turn it off, but, alas, I couldn't otherwise I couldn't be typing this. I wasted my time. I struggled hard to even stay awake. How could a promising director like Rodriguez take such a promising beginning, then completely ruin it by forcing a severely predictable plot into the awesome pointless action?People compare Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino as if their names and movies are interchangeable, and that's an absolute joke. Though they contentiously work together, Rodriguez never has and?judging by the synopsizes for his upcoming films?never will understand originality, whereas Tarantino has proved himself to be the exact opposite. I've never once seen a Rodriguez film that underlines this fact more than Desperado. The plot line is beyond unoriginal, and passes into the so-cliché-it's-laughable territory. Am I really the only person who is sick of revenge movies that all follow through exactly the same way, with the exact same scenes, and the exact same endings? If you've seen one, you've seen them all. There is no reason to watch this movie, because there is absolutely nothing you haven't seen before, and seen better. Go do the laundry or something.This painfully unoriginal, formulaic plot line is why the entertainment value comes to a screeching halt mid-movie. Instead of continuing the nihilistic mass gunfights?FUN?Rodriguez does what he does best, and adds a cliché plot that amounts to about as much entertainment value as a staring at a dead tree stump?NOT FUN. It's almost humorous, the joke that Tarantino's character says has a more complex plot than the film itself.And if creating a fun action movie wasn't the point here, may I ask what was? Nihilism is something that filmmakers don't understand, but it's something that the audience of this particular film wants. We didn't come to see a great opening, then a boring paint-by-the-numbers plot line unravel. As stylish and cool as this movie may be, it fails understand its target audience. Again, nihilism is something Quentin Tarantino has always understood, and it's most evident in Pulp Fiction. As much as these two work together, why can't Rodriguez just . . . get it? There is absolutely no excuse for him not to think of more original plots, and, if not, then understand and give his audience the nihilism it wants. Instead, he just rolls around in Hollywood clichés and puts out safe, predictable movies. What a sad waste of talent.The only sole good thing I can say about Desperado is that the Mexican setting is pretty cool. It's filmed well. And that's all.Overall, Desperado is one of those watch-once-then-forget-about movies, if not a little lower. It isn't the absolute worst movie out there, but it isn't anything that it could have been. It isn't fun enough to be a midnight movie with friends, and it isn't original enough to be taken as a serious story. It's just middle ground average. If I even remember a single generic scene in an hour from now, I'll be surprised.0/10</fullReview>

I can accept the fact that this librarian will take him in, treat his wounds, and put herself in extreme amounts of danger even though he is a complete stranger and, probably, is the last person you should trust, all because he saved her life. I'll accept the fact that almost every character in this movie is a clone/rip off of the entire cast of El Mariachi. I'll even accept the horrendous sex scene which is just as bad as the abomination known as Ninja Scroll Resurrection, which by the way had tons and tons and tons of sex scenes bent on being violent and there for the sake of getting some sick and twisted individual horny as heck. But I left this movie after seeing the scene after the sex scene, where the Moco clone somehow managed to find out, with nothing but Selma Hyak's strange performance when he gets to her bookstore, that El Mariachi is in the book store being hidden by her character. I am not even going to bother seeing anymore of this stuff. I mean, seriously, what the heck? It's like he's assuming we'll buy anything he tries to sell. Almost as if he assumed that we wouldn't see El Mariachi, even though Columbia, according to Robert Rodriguez' diaries in Rebel Without a Crew, said they'd package both movies together when they were negotiating for the rights. I mean, for the love of God, why the heck would she automatically know how to become a surgeon just by reading a book? Are you kidding me? And, now correct me if I'm wrong, but at the end of El Mariachi, didn't he have more of a fake hand than a real one? Seemed like it was almost robotic to me when he drove off into the sunset. Yah, this is a bad way to start reviewing movies, and I'll attest that I thought El Mariachi and Once Upon a Time in Mexico were excellent movies for the lighting, special effects, and storytelling. But you couldn't pay me to see anymore of the dribble in Desperado. Not a single cent, I tell you now.</fullReview>

The acting was generally sub-par, with the nominal star offering inappropriate grimaces preceding the idiotic, worse-than-cartoonish action scenes -- grimaces that could have indicated his wishes that he were somewhere else, which would be understandable. Cheech Marin, on the other hand, further demonstrated that he is a remarkable talent, apparently too often thought of as the sillier half of the drug-sodden Cheech &amp; Chong, but really a quite capable actor. Salma Hayek looked good, of course, but was wasted ... as was the time of anybody who watched this drek.

		<fullReview>Desperado has almost no plot, very little characterisation and it isn't very exciting. Like Batman &amp; Robin. However, unlike Batman &amp; Robin, it's very entertaining, almost painfully stylish and incredibly cool. Banderas just is El Mariachi - I'm gonna have that haircut, I think - Steve Buscemi is very, very funny for as long as he survives, and the latin Winona Ryder Salma Hayek provides the eye candy. Unfortunetly, the action scenes are actually almost all blazing gun battles (a shame for those who wanted to see stunts on horse back, Banderas thrown into a pit to do bull fighting, etc) with hordes of bad guys getting slaughtered, but at least El Mariachi knows what he is doing is wrong, and stops doing it. He's nice to everyone else, and even teaches a kid to play the guitar. So, Desperado is basically an entertaining adventure with bullets flying everywhere and a less than serious tone most of the time - some of this is really funny. However, when Banderas and Hayek go to the bad guys base, don't expect it to be the final explosive shoot-out, because it ain't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>El Mariachi returns? and he is looking for revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel to 'El Mariachi' opens with a man going into a bar and telling the story of another man going into a similar bar looking for 'Bucho'? nobody is interested in the story till Bucho is mentioned; then everybody hangs on the stranger's every word as he tells how the other man killed every person in that other bar. That other man is the former mariachi and he is looking for revenge against the man he holds responsible for the woman he loved. It isn't long before the Mariachi reaches this town and when he does those who get in his way drop like flies. He isn't invincible though; he is caught in the arm by a bullet. Book store owner Carolina helps dig it out and patches him up but by helping she has put herself in Bucho's crosshairs. Bucho sends his me into town to deal with the mariachi and Carolina but he too has help when a couple of old friends arrive.There are quite a few changes between this film and 'El Mariachi'; most notably the film is in English rather than Spanish and our protagonist is played by Antonio Banderas. There is also more over-the-top action and some witty dialogue? most notably in the opening scene where Steve Buscemi tells the story about El Mariachi and an hilarious, if rather crude, story told by Quentin Tarantino in the same bar. There is lots of fairly bloody action; this mostly takes the form of shootouts but there is also an impressive scene featuring Danny Trejo as a knife thrower. The cast does a solid job; Antonio Banderas is just right as the Mariachi; tough but with just enough vulnerability and Selma Hayek is suitably sexy and believable as love interest Carolina. Joaquim de Almeida makes a good bad guy; outwardly calm most of the time but with a hair-trigger temper. Overall I'd highly recommend this to anybody looking for a good over-the-top action film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Solely responsible for the English-speaking market success of director Robert Rodriguez and Antonio Banderas, this outlandish, action-packed odyssey of adventure is a spicy thriller with plenty of passion and bullets as it charts the rise, fall and eventual return of a vengeful hit-man, played to the hilt by Banderas himself.As the guitar-playing, softly-spoken, floppy-haired hero, Banderas is excellent in what is his best performance to date and he is truly unforgettable as El Mariachi. The film starts off with style featuring two shaggy-dog stories from some of modern cinema's quirkiest characters; the inimitable Steve Buscemi sets the scene whilst Quentin Tarantino shares a joke with Cheech Marin's bartender.From then on the action is pretty much non-stop, with shoot outs in the bar, in the street and in various sleazy back alleyways. There's fun to be had from a super armoured car and from Danny Trejo's insane hit-man who's a sure-fire hit with a knife. An engaging thrill-ride that's packed with real thrills and sheened with style, Desperado is a top notch action flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique action movie from Robert Rodriguez</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1992, Robert Rodriguez burst onto the Hollywood scene with "El Mariachi", a movie that grossed two million dollars despite a minuscule budget of about $7,000. For his next feature film, "Desperado", he had a modest but healthy budget of $7,000,000; literally a thousand times more than what he had at his disposal for his previous project.Although "Desperado" is a sequel to "El Mariachi", it isn't necessary to have seen the first film in order to follow this one. Personally, I have never seen "El Mariachi" and I found "Desperado" to be perfectly understandable. After all, the story is a fairly simplistic one. Basically, a musician seeks revenge for the death of his lover and will stop at nothing until he achieves his goal.Playing the mysterious musician at the centre of the story is Antonio Banderas. His glamorous look and facility with action sequences is well suited to the movie's stylized violence. Salma Hayek, in her first major role, provides a worthy female lead. In support, Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin &amp; Danny Trejo all contributed memorable performances. Lastly, watch for Quentin Tarantino in a small role.When it comes to Rodriguez's script, it's as sharp as his direction. The story's revenge scenario could have been strictly routine but Rodriguez threw in enough twists and turns to keep the viewer interested from beginning to end. Speaking of which, the movie features a great opening scene that really sets the tone for the rest of the movie. Musically, the movie is pretty solid as well, though I thought that a couple of the soundtrack selections haven't aged too well.Overall, "Desperado" is a stylish, action-packed movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, except when it comes to filmmaking craft. The final entry in Rodriguez's so-called Mexico Trilogy, "Once Upon a Time in Mexico", unfortunately doesn't quite measure up to this. I'd also give "Desperado" the edge over the somewhat similarly themed "Machete".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We heard stories about a guitar case full of guns"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about a Mexican guy who is out for revenge by hunting down his brother for killing his girlfriend! Until he met a beautiful women who took him in to care for him after being shot by his enemies, it almost change everything! But the guy is still on a mission to hunt his brother down regardless! On the outside "Desperado" may just look like a generic 90's action movie with Mexican flair (it may on the inside a little too), but what it really showed was the potential of a talented filmmaker and ultimately the world that he would create with his Mexican Western trilogy.This movie isn't big on plot. You don't watch it for the plot. Well, there kind of is, but it's flimsy. Also Banderas is a damn fine actor! He is perfectly cast as the nameless "Mariachi." Salma Hayek is looking' good as the love interest, but aside from being Salma Hayek (something no man can quibble over), she isn't given much to work with. Still, there is a hilarious throwaway role filled past the brim by the inestimable Steve Buscemi; Cheech Marin appears as "the Bartender." Quentin Tarantino even pops up to tell an obscene joke (can you imagine?). Plain and simple, if you're looking for an above-average action thriller with lots of goofy humor, this is the way to do it.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Desperado: It's not just a guitar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Desperado is the second installment of Robert Rodriguez' action packed Mexico Trilogy. A man known as El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) seeks retribution after the love of his life was killed by Moco (a drug lord who played a major role in the first movie). Enlisting the help of his American friend (played by Buscemi), he learns that the man responsible for his wife's death is a drug lord named Bucho (Joaquim de Almeida). On his journey to locate and kill Bucho, he meets Carolina (Selma Hayek) with whom he falls in love. The plot is pretty generic and it's the action sequences, witty dialogue, and storytelling, along with the production value which makes Desperado so great.The movie begins with the American entering a bar in Mexico in a manner which immediately gravitates attention onto him. He sits down and asks for a beer. The cleverness and wittiness of the movie becomes apparent as soon as Buscemi opens his mouth. He explains that he had previously visited another bar where he had a terrible experience. He exclaims that the people there were lowlifes who, unlike the ones currently surrounding him, had no class. He makes sure to clarify that he speaks of the other bar, and not this one. Now one might think that he makes the clarification in order to appease hostility that he might receive due to misunderstanding, but I say he does more. I say he's vague on purpose. In addition to complementing the bar, he also praises the beer, claiming it as the best he'd ever had. But we find out later that everyone finds the beer disgusting, likening it to the taste of urine. So why would Buscemi speak so highly of such a bad tasting beer? It's because of juxtaposition. He aligns his praise of the beer with his praise of the bar and the "high class" people inside. It's safe to assume that he's lying about liking the beer, but the fact that he's associating the "piss tasting" beverage with the rest of the bar indicates that his compliments are not only not genuine but insults. This is further supported by his admission that the other bar's beer is similar, but not as good. This means that the other bar was bad, contained lowlifes, and equally as vile beer. Reinforcing this claim is the manner in which he describes the lowlifes of the other bar. He proceeds by saying, vaguely, "and this bar," pausing and turning his head around and continuing with a raised voice "is full of real lowlifes." His tone indicates that he wanted them to hear the "lowlifes" bit. And like his other vague comments about "a bar" being terrible, he follows up with a clarification that he's speaking of the other bar. After planting the seed of mockery in their heads, it doesn't matter much that he clarifies himself other than to avoid violence. Both bars are equally bad, and he cleverly got away with insulting them.The rest of the movie is a series of action-packed bar battles, street battles, and even one at a bookstore. All have one thing in common, a guitar case containing all sorts of guns and grenades that made El Mariachi a living legend. The best, in my opinion, is the bookstore scene. It was the most violent scene, but not in the conventional way. Bucho had figured out that El Mariachi was hiding out at a bookstore which he uses for drug trades by bribing the owner, Carolina. Bucho's Men sneak to the top bedroom floor where they presume El Mariachi and Carolina were sleeping. Carolina is sitting on the bed, back faced to the wall door, eyes closed and playing the guitar while singing. She's clearly unaware of the men sneaking outside. Nor is she aware that El Mariachi is awake and senses the men. As the men approach from the left side (behind a curtained window), he grabs a gun and lifts it past Carolina's closed eyes and aims. Then he senses other men coming from the right side, prompting him to lift another gun past Carolina's head. As the men move closer to the door behind Carolina, El Mariachi continues to point at them, moving his arms in accordance with their movement. But as they arrived at the door, he found himself pointing both guns at Carolina, who's still unaware of what's going on. Finally the tension breaks, Mariachi pushes Carolina out of the way, and violence ensues. It's a brilliant scene putting together two contrasting things, emphasizing the beauty and peacefulness of Carolina's singing, in light of the very thing that will destroy it, not to eliminate it, but to save it.A beautiful film.

		<shortDescription>Pure entertainment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A spaghetti western in every sense of the word, "Desperado" is an exhilarating ride from start to finish. Stylish, humorous, and thoroughly engaging, it tells the tale of one mariachi's quest for revenge and redemption. Banderas delivers the performance that made him a star as the titular desperado. Smoldering and suave, he knows how to shoot up a bar as well as he masters the more romantic elements in the film, especially when the equally stunning Hayek comes into the picture. Their escape from a hotel together, resulting in the famous jumping off the roof scene, is pure pulp entertainment. Rodriguez should focus on making more films like this -- homages to great B- movies produced on an A-level scale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best ACTION Movies Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to action and action alone, Desperado is one of the all-time greats. Robert Rodriguez makes too many mistakes for this to be a timeless giant like Terminator or Die Hard. But because of how good the action and writing are, it is in the same realm of true action masterpieces.Desperado is the bigger-budgeted sequel/remake of Robert Rodriguez's first film entitled El Mariachi. This is one of those sequels where it might help watching the original one first. Even by watching El Mariachi first, it does not clear up anything flaw that Desperado has.The one and only flaw I have to give this is the poor transition between the two films. El Mariachi is about a talented guitar player (played in that by Carlos Gallardo) who comes to a town in search of work, where he becomes the subject of a huge case of mistaken identity and bears witness to drug lord, Moco, murder his girlfriend, Domino. He shoots El's hand and El shoots and kills him. In this El (now played by Antonio Banderas) seeks vengeance against another drug lord known as Bucho for murdering Domino. Bucho had nothing to do with the first film, and he already got his revenge against Moco, whom he knew was responsible. There's even a flashback scene with Domino and Moco. This unclarity was the main reason why this meant any sort of negativity. The most logical assumption was that Bucho was a high-ranking drug lord just above Moco, But that assumption does not give our hero a truly clear motive for going on a killing spree. This is a revenge story, but the movie never gives any point behind it all.My inference to this is like Hamlet. (This is just what I interpret). After El kills Moco, his hand is maimed, his girlfriend is dead, and he is out of work. He has no other reason to live. Carolina says to him: "I've heard of you, you kill drug dealers." Given how much longer the character's hair has gotten and how much he's improved in his shooting abilities, it is evident that some time has passed. So El must've gone on a killing spree, getting everybody underneath Bucho. How is this like Hamlet? Hamlet has no reason to live, until he plots to avenge his father's death. Avenging his father's death has given him a reason to stay alive, so he procrastinates actually going through with it. After he gets revenge, he has no other point in living. El is pretty much the same way. If he doesn't go after all of Bucho's men (then Bucho himself) he has no point in living. Revenge has consumed their entire lives, giving new meaning, which they don't want to let go of. Well, this is my interpretation of it anyway!El arrives in a new town in Mexico where he destroys Bucho's goons with the help of his special guitar case. The lack of identity has Bucho paranoid, while El falls in love with bookstore owner, Carolina (Hayak) who works under Bucho. The relationship between Carolina and Bucho is exactly like Domino and Moco. There's a few other details which give this a remake feel. Desperado is a modern-day spaghetti western. Our nameless hero, only known as El Mariachi, battles armies by himself, where clichés are always around. A bunch of guys shoot him at close range with machine guns and miss, but El shoots them once and they die. Although the clichés are noticeable, the action sequences are loud, intense, gory, and awesome. Although this was made long after gunfights became an art form, almost every action scene this has beats many classic action movies. When it comes to violence, I know good from bad and this is full of some of the best. The first time I watched this (before I exactly knew good movies from bad ones) I was blown away. Despite my knowledge in movies growing since then, it still rocks me every time I see this. Although the action is really what makes this, it is not the only redeeming quality. Whenever there is music playing, it fits. There's rock, blues, and Spanish music put in their respective places, making the scenes that much better. The love story between El and Carolina is even pulled off, despite being generic. And Rodriguez constructs each character to a high degree. He is able to do this by creating killer dialogue, including a hilarious joke given by Quentin Tarantino. So even though there is a big gap between this and the first resulting in a shallow general plot, Desperado is a dynamite tribute to spaghetti westerns with fill redemption which will remain one of the best action movies ever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film opens up as an action film should... with action and the right amount. My expectations became high after the first scene but this time Antonio Banderas made this movie boring. He did not do justice to his character. I always felt as if something was amiss throughout the movie and really there were lots of those things. Definitely there is the typical Mexican cowboy type action but having only that does not solve the purpose of a movie. I hated the lead actor the most followed by the romance or the love at first sight between the two main lead. That scene was nowhere . I mean that scene made me feel very terrible as if something came out of the blue.Well coming to other aspects, the music is okay, the locations are really nice. My final verdict the film loses its charm due to poor script and bad acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember I recommended this to a friend and he asked me for the plot. That was my answer. As such, my review has a misleading title, because I actually think there's a fair bit more to enjoy here than the action centre pieces. To start with this film was the first time I'd ever seen one of the world's most beautiful women, Salma Hayek in a film. On the strength of her scenes in this I have followed that young lady's career with interest ever since.First time I saw this I was not aware of Robert Rodriguez's work, and it was not until many years later that I watched El Mariachi, the film this one either follows on from, or re-imagines, depending on how you want to look at it, and fully appreciated what the director did with this film.Antonio Banderas stars as an anti hero gunman El Mariachi attempting to avenge the death of his lost love at the hands of the evil Bucho years earlier, armed with a guitar case full of weapons that any underground militia would be envious of. His helper in this crusade is Steve Buscemi.Over the course of the film we run into many familiar faces, including Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, Danny Trejo, and bizarrely Enrique Iglesias, but the real star is Rodriguez's style and direction. He is able to successfully incorporate over the top Hong Kong style action, lusty 70s exploitation and spaghetti western characterizations and ground them all in an innovative piece of 90s film making which does not look out of place with the other films of its era.Banderas is absolutely superb as The Man With No Name (mariachi is a job description) while Joaquim de Almeida is equal parts fun and menacing as the villain Bucho. Hayek is fine and is so stunningly beautiful you won't care if she isn't. All of the support players do a great job as everyone seems to "get" what type of film they are in, which is a key to the film's success.Desperado is a great 90s actioner that incorporates different film making styles, fine performances and a great soundtrack into one of the best action films of the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More money bigger actors flashier action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's sort of a sequel to director Robert Rodriquez's low budget indie "El Mariachi". Steve Buscemi comes into the bar and starts telling the bartender (Cheech Marin) the story of El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) who tore up a bar to get info on Bucho (Joaquim de Almeida). El Mariachi is seeking to avenge the death of his love. Buscemi was actually telling a fake story to help smoke out Bucho. El Mariachi goes shoot up the bar. On the street, he gets shot in the arm. Carolina (Salma Hayek) brings him back to her bookstore café. Navajas (Danny Trejo) is the knife throwing maniac.Rodriquez got a few more bucks to use in this wild gunfight action. He got some bigger names non-amateur actors. It's definitely flashier and more professional looking. The story and dialog still needs work but that's not the point of this franchise. The original has the joy of low budget indie discovery. This one is generally better looking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feels Like "El Mariachi" The Way It Should Have Been</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the sequel to "El Mariachi", and to me, it feels a lot like Robert Rodriguez essentially remaking "El Mariachi" the way he would have wanted to of made it if he had a big budget. While I rate both films equally, it's for two different reasons. I rated "El Mariachi" that way because I respect just how low of a budget it was for what it turned out to be, but for this one, I rate it that way because I enjoyed it. It's not perfect, but it's fun.This is the kind of movie that pleases fans of action. There's a lot of great shootouts and unique style to them. But it should be said that the film doesn't take itself seriously, and this generally works, but sometimes didn't for me. I just have never been a massive fan of that Tarantino style of humour in action/drama films. I guess i'm more of a fan of gritty violence. But that's not to say I don't ever enjoy it, and I would say this film does it pretty well. Something I noticed technically speaking was that the audio seemed a bit weird. It almost felt like perhaps it wasn't recorded well on set or maybe sound mixing was off. I'm not quite sure what it was. This wasn't a major issue, just something I occasionally noticed.Getting back to the idea of this being a bigger budget "El Mariachi", I felt that the story was very similar. While it was supposed to be a sequel, you can't help but feel like it's a remake with certain plot points running through both films. I just kept thinking "We saw this happen in El Mariachi". I guess if you really liked "El Mariachi", then you will enjoy this too. It's a fun action flick for sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing main character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie, and ever since watching it as a young boy, it has become a classic and a must have movie in any collection. Desperado is a film about a former traveling musician who seeks revenge for the murder of his lover, and the maiming of his guitar hand by drug dealer. The main character comes to focus his anger and hate on "El Bucho", a high ranking drug cartel responsible for much of drug trafficking in the community. This is made clear within the first 20 minutes of the movie, which I thought was awesome. The main character, El Mariachi, has already killed the murderer of his lover in the last film, yet he continues to kill drug dealers. I felt like this gave the main character a great opportunity to grow in the film, he was obviously still reeling from the loss of his woman, and the inability to express his love of music by playing guitar because of his hand. I felt that when he got revenge on the murderer he didn't feel the relief he thought he would feel, so he transferred his rage to the next drug dealer, and the next until finally deciding that maybe bringing down the leader of the cartel would finally bring him some peace. I think it was great how he eventually overcame his sorrow through the help of Carolina.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you've ever had a boyhood dream of making a movie, it would probably have looked something like "Desperado". The entire structure is basically this: a fantastic B-actor does a long monologue, then a gunfight breaks out. It's 70s exploitation with 90s skill and 90s Steve Buscemi. While predecessor "El Mariachi" did have a more raw feel to it, this one stands through the comparison because it shows how much more creative Robert Rodriguez can still get with a higher budget. The change of actor from virtually unknown Carlos Gallardo to the more bankable Antonio Banderas isn't quite seamless, but after a while you do sorta buy him as a bad-ass. "Desperado" is the salt and pepper of cinema, the little extra spice that lives by some of Hollywood's rules but stands out by how it breaks all of the others. We need to cherish movies like these, movies that go purely for the entertainment value and don't care about anything else. "Desperado" is action as it should be: anything goes, no holds barred so you're completely caught up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Desperado' has everything that i like to see in action films. It is not totally clumsy, it has a considerably good art direction and also good cinematography(just look at the insane action scenes) and it is fun and over the top. The film has perfect internal logic, even if the logic is totally absurd and messed up. Since assassins throwing knives to bazookas into guitars, this movie has it all. The possible is not limited in the film. And even in the most 'dramatic' moments, the film never take itself too serious. The cast is remarkably good, but the acting is totally left apart. No one even tries to be more than a cartoon char. It also satirizes himself within the film, when Butcho asks to his men: 'Is not easy? Just shoot anyone who carries a gun? Isn't that simple?'. Unbelievable.Anyways, the film is full of remarkable scenes, but between Tarantino telling a hilarious joke and Antonio Banderas jumping backwards from a building while killing three bandits at same time, it don't has that much of a story, so just don't expect nothing more from this than a insane action film and you'll not be disappointed. 6.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Desperado is written and directed by Robert Rodriguez. It stars Antonio Banderas, Joaquim de Almedia, Steve Buscemi, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin and Quentin Tarantino. Music is by Los Lobos and cinematography by Guillermo Navarro.The second of what would be Rodriguez's Mexico Trilogy, Desperado is enjoyable enough if just a touch disposable as well. It only really exists as a standard revenge driven action film, one that was made at the time purely as a sequel ? cum ? higher budgeted ? remake of the director's much lauded indie darling, El Mariachi.Desperado boasts handsome people, numerous different ways of offing someone, dashes of cool, pinches of humour, zippy music, appealing photography and nifty choreography, but these things are not enough to make it a great film. It's too long, bloated and unadventurous, and crucially it lacks heart and is emotionally stunted. It's spirited alright, just not in the big areas.Action fans are well served, but Rodriguez, in spite of some skillful touches here, is better than this. 6/10</fullReview>

El Mariachi is almost the same thing as Clint Eastwood's character being known as The Man With No Name in Leone's Dollars Trilogy.Salma Hayek puts her name on the map with her scintillating performance.

		<shortDescription>The Mexican version of the punisher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Desperado is a very interesting piece of film work. This was my first movie watching Antonio Banderas in rated R movie and I really wasn't sure what to expect - boy was I surprised. This movie is highly entertaining and packs a punch in multiple genres. For the most part, this is one big shoot 'em up movie. Although much of the action scenes are the same, they still somehow end up being exciting to watch no matter how many times you've seen it. This is not your regular western, where people have their little revolvers and twirl them with one finger, no. This is about a man getting revenge for the sake of his loved one using any weapon he can find.As I said before, Antonio Banderas stars as El Mariachi who looks to find revenge on the man who hired a couple of thugs to kill his wife and permanently damage his playing hand. Co-starring with Banderas is actress Salma Hayek. Although back then she was not well known, this is the film that started her career. I think these two actors really do a good job. Not only do they work well together, but also they look good together. Making things even more awesome are the action scenes. The way El Mariachi fires upon the bad guys, the way he leaps and rolls; is just really exciting to watch. The style of the film is done differently than the usual action movies. Out of all the people that are killed by El Mariachi, you would almost think that he's villain, but he's not. The bad guy's henchmen just keep getting in between the cross hairs.Although much of this movie is shooting people, Banderas has many moments of comedy. And it's not like, "Haha! That was a good joke". It's more of, "These guys better watch out, because they don't know who they're messing' with". El Mariachi says it himself, he's just looking for a man. And when he says the man's name, everyone starts shooting at him! He's just looking for a certain guy, why does it matter to them- ...Oh well...that's their fault. Those guys got what was coming for them. They just didn't know that.Finally for the music used in this movie was by Los Lobos. I think Lobos did a great job with the musical score. With the Hispanic tone in every part of the music, it really gets the blood flowing. Because the story is about El Mariachi, it has a lot of guitar. That is what gives the film its zest. Director Robert Rodriguez has recreated El Mariachi and made it into a high spirited "boom" "pow" movie that can make the viewer start jumping out of their seat. With fun performances, loud action and great music, this film is bound to get the attention it wants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a rather fun action movie starring Antonio Banderas and Selma Hyek and featuring a lot of other recognizable faces. The story is simple, a man who has lost his lover is looking for revenge. He carries with him a guitar case loaded with weapons with which to exact his revenge. General mayhem ensues and makes this movie totally rock. You have your basic shoot out in a bar, you have a crazed knife wielding hit-man who gets killed because of mistaken identities, you have Selma in the prime of her career and very hot, and you have one heck of a town shoot out where two other dudes with guitar cases come. One with duel machine gun guitars and the other with a rocket launcher one. The violence is a bit over the top and the conclusion is not quite climatic compared to the other scenes in the movie, but overall this film is a very nice trip. Never saw the previous movie in this trilogy and I have only seen bits and pieces of the next movie, but this one stands on its own so the viewing of those two movies is not really a necessity to enjoy this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one is my favourite of the "El Mariachi" series because it tells the best story without being too over the top or too pretentious. The first movie is good despite the resources Rodriguez had to work with but it still could have been more action packed and had less silliness in it. "Once Upon a Time in Mexico" was good too, still I think it went too over the top even by "El Mariachi" standards. "Desperado" is an excellent part of the "El Mariachi" series. Though, I've always wondered why being a mariachi is such a deadly occupation in this series of film. It is a great shoot 'em up, tells a great story, and is cheesy only to a point where it puts a smile on your face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A depiction of Mexican Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The way that the drug cartels are portrayed in this movie is rather two-faced. The drug lord, Bucho, displays this in his approach to running his underlings and townspeople. The first image of Bucho we are introduced to is a sarcastic yet ruthless leader. He shows no remorse for his top man's nephew, and forces him to fight his toughest man. Even upon witnessing this kid break his leg, he responds by antagonizing him. This leadership forces respect by way of fear tactics. Then later we Bucho as a sweet talking business man, who does not intimidate the townspeople. Rather, he buys them off with dirty money to use them and their businesses as fronts. Even further into the film we see Bucho as a scared, irrational, and even more ruthless person. He turned both on his peons, and the townspeople that he relies on. In one scene he is having a phone conversation with what seemed to be his boss. During this conversation we see Bucho, who is the most powerful cartel person seen in this film, get reduced to playing a peon to another. This shows the power structure that is contained within drug cartels, and the respect that is demanded by the "higher-ups." The journey that we see Bucho's character make throughout this film, from all-powerful and a whisper under everyone's breath to a defeated, scared, and ultimately just another dead cartel member. This seems typical of most cartel member's careers. They have a high point, but ultimately the struggle to stay the dominant power ultimately leads to their demise.A very prominent theme in this film is the use and importance of music. The background music in this film is very ethnically charged and helps to emphasize key moments as well as move the storyline along. Music and the guitar are used in this film to express the purity of the citizens (the little boy), and the struggle to fight back against the evil cartels. The main character is a musician who was once amazing, but now only uses music as a facade to accomplish his mission. We see this with his cleverly concealed weapons, hidden beneath the supposed guitar in his case. When the Mariachi is having a flashback he actually uses his guitar as a weapon to strike the man who had pulled a knife on the crowd. The absence of available work for a mariachi in the town controlled by Bucho alludes to the absence of purity and a lack of desire to fight back against the cartels. The people of the town have given in to the inevitability that in order to survive and keep their shops, they must comply and serve Bucho.Another theme in this film is the way that life in Mexico is portrayed in this film. This film uses clever techniques to set up the way life is in this Mexican town. The use of sparse generic Americans in this movie adds to the way this town should be perceived. The most memorable being Buscemi, Tarantino, and the unhappy tourist women. These characters display the ignorant view of superiority that they have for themselves, especially in the bar. The Tarasco bar is the central setting for the early part of the film. Here they have terrible beer, terrible service, and an even more terrible constituency. The bar is corrupt, with a business office hidden behind an unsightly bathroom stall, yet it still keeps its appearance of a local bar. The town itself flagged with election leaflets and flags, dirt roads, and uninhabited storefronts. It does not paint a terrible picture of Mexico, but a startling recreation of a typical rural town to anyone who has traveled to Mexico before. The film shows that the townspeople have rather good intentions, but have forced into surrendering to the all controlling cartel. Life in this Mexican town is not unbearable or unmanageable, but only because the cartel supports them and exploits their needs. This begs the question of what is right and wrong, can the townspeople's reliance on Bucho be justified? The external and internal struggles between good and evil are strewn throughout this film. The fighting between the mariachi and the cartel is plain to see. It also seems less apparently that each character in this film is going through some sort of struggle within themselves of what is right, and what is wrong. The Mariachi uses violence and gunfire to kill what seems like at least a hundred cartel members, just to find and face one man. Buscemi identifies this and reminds him that his tactics of killing everyone needs improvement. The mariachi responds that it is a means to an end. Another character that is struggling between what is right and wrong is Carolina. She achieved her lifelong dream of having a bookstore, only by taking drug money for holding drugs for Bucho. She justifies having taken the money by offering that she and all the other townspeople have no other option. Lastly, the little boy who bears witness to all of the goings-on of the town is forced into doing the Bucho's dirty work. The mariachi discovers the boy holding onto drugs, hidden within his guitar. Even this sweet innocent boy, who dreams of being a great mariachi someday, is being dragged into this corrupt lifestyle. The boy even attempts to justify this by saying that now his dad doesn't have to work. Each of these characters tries to justify their own evils by saying that they are helping in the long run. Good rewards do not cancel out or justify evil actions.The mariachi is a figure of hope in a time of despair; hope that one day someone will be able to put an end to the corruption of power in Mexico.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After being in the wrong place at the wrong time, The Mariachi's life is forever changed. He still has nightmares of what happened after losing his love and almost his hand. Now he looks for vengeance for the death of his love and has become quite experienced with weapons. He's back. El Mariachi.Desperado(1995) The infamous sequel to El Mariachi now enlist Antonio Banderas as El Mariachi. He carries the case of weapons and is now a famous vigilante bent on revenge. He has a partner in crime(Steve Buscemi) to tell the tale of the "biggest Mexican" he has ever seen to intimidate the drug lord's henchmen. The storytelling is really good.Desperado also has some nice supporting roles from Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo and Salma Hayek. Also, look for the original El Mariachi actor here. The acting is pretty good. The story of Desperado is good.The action is quite something. The gun battles are fun and sometimes over the top. Contains high amounts of energy and lots of reloading. Careful, sometimes the going gets rather graphic.The Last Word: Entertaining. Desperado is just fun to watch. From the story to the blazing action, you wont get bored. Good stuff.

		<shortDescription>Never bring a guitar to a gunfight</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty good flick that's chock full of over-the-top gun violence. However, the movie has a certain charisma to it that is hard to shake. The cinematography is quite appealing, Banderas and Salma Hayek are great together, and the ever-present strains of Latino-sounding music playing in the background, not to mention the guitar-playing sub-theme, are mind blowing. (The title track, "Cancion del Mariachi" by Los Lobos really makes you want to get up and dance.)I also like how the two characters played by Banderas and Hayek see the moral ambiguities of their surroundings. One quote by Banderas sums it up: "It's strange how pulling a trigger is easier than playing the guitar. Easier to destroy, than to create." Banderas even says a prayer that I swear I myself have uttered into the mirror: "Give me the strength to be what I was, and forgive me for what I am."In spite of the themes of violence and revenge, the movie never lets the violence take itself too seriously. It's hard not to notice the numerous uses of comedic relief in the movie. Which makes it all the more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was intrigued by the difference between the two movies. El Mariachi was like a Mexican soap opera; whereas, Desperado was more like a Mexican comic book...complete with supervillians (the knife thrower, the boy with the iron brace). Both movies were good.I see a lot of complaints that Desperado didn't live up to El Mariachi. It IS a different kind of movie; however, the style, humor and action in Desperado make it, for me, one of the few rewatchable movies of its genre. ****</fullReview>

Also, though there is a lot of witty and entertaining dialogue which is bounced back and forth between the characters, especially the joke that Quentin Tarrantino's character relays to Cheech Marin at the bar, classic and pretty damn funny. Oh yeah the action in the film was good too, all your necessary gun fire, fake blood, and explosions as par for the course. But dang that dialogue was sure memorable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great action flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought "Desperado" was a great action flick. And I found it to be a comedy too. On several parts in this movie I found myself laughing and I don't even think it was supposed to be funny. Like there was a part where a ceiling fan fell on this guy and it showed the blades hitting the guy in the face. I laughed at that part. This movie had quite a bit of violence and gore but not too much. I thought it was pretty cool towards the end when El Mariachi's buddies were shooting the guys by just holding their guitar cases. But I really liked the short performance of Steve Buscemi. He's always funny no matter what he plays in. And I was a little disappointed when he was killed. I didn't want him to die! Neither did I want Cheech to die either. The only part in this movie that made me cringe was when Salma Hayek was trying to get the bullet out of El Mariachi's arm. That was hard to watch! Anyways. I don't have much more to say about this movie except I liked all the action and the swift moves and Antonio Banderas gave a good performance. And I'm really glad I own this one now. Thanks for reading my review!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While there's not much going on story wise, Desperado has so much else going for it that for once that almost becomes incidental. I mean the core audience exists to watch the elaborate action sequences anyway. This is one of the few times I WON'T discredit a movie for not having much in the way of a plot. Robert Rodriguez is such a talented action director that I'm too in awe to care about what the film was missing because it's much easier to get swept up in what is there. Following "El Mariachi", Desperado is both a sequel and a remake of that film. This time, Antonio Banderas slips perfectly into the lead role. Other memorable performances are given by Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino. This film is one of few that survives numerous repeat viewings. It never loses its edge or impact. With fight scenes so heavily calculated that they play out with a ballet like fashion, it will leave your head spinning and your jaw dropped. It's just a fun, fast, movie. I for one cannot wait for Part III due out later this year. And! That one features Johnny Depp as well! My excitement is palpable. Anyway, I highly recommend this film. You should check out its predecessor too just to cement what an innovative filmmaker Rodriguez is. You'll be amazed at just how much he can accomplish with a miniscule budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The biggest Mexican you've ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood remakes of classic cult films are becoming increasingly common these days. Remakes done by the same director are not. Despite having the same creative brain behind it, this films suffers from the same problems as most of those remakes though.It is slick, it is stylish, its production values are orders of magnitude above the original. Yet, in this process the grit that made the original so enjoyable and compulsive, is lost.This is by no means the worst remake I've ever seen. In fact I think it's probably one of the best. Robert Rodriguez reinterprets his original with the same sensibilities and with emphasis on action. The rhythm of the film is just as latin as the location and the music, it ebbs and flows with the passion of the characters. There is humour in all the right places. Antonio Banderas is wonderfully sultry in the lead role, with his predecessor from El Mariachi turning up at the end to assist him with some highly improbable accompaniment on guitar.The flaw is still there glaring at you though. Story has been replaced by style. This is a one-bit Mexican town. Stories here should be as portrayed in El Mariachi dirty and real, not some glamorous Hollywood fantasy of the same.Despite my misgivings, this film is very watchable and fun. It's one of the better Hong Kongesque films I've seen and perhaps shouldn't be mistaken for anything different. The trouble is the director has already been here and done it better.</fullReview>

But soon I realized that the movie's sole purpose is to let people stare at the two leads. Buscemi's story telling at the beginning is marvelous, but when the rest of the movie fails to live up, it becomes apparent that he has stolen the show. Slow moving, considering there's very little story involved. The revelation towards the end is so text book it's almost funny. Some of the lesser characters need development.

		<fullReview>After I've read the other people's comments, I felt I just couldn't keep silent. Well, it seems to me that most of those who have provided their comments missed a very important point. They all say it's stylish never mentioning what they mean. It seems to me that what Rodriguez and the whole crew made is a purposeful exaggeration. Look, all and every cliche of recent Hollywood productions is present: the macho and the beauty, a shower of bullets hitting the bad guys and never hitting the good guy, the main hero walking away against the background of fire, love-making, the "deep psychological conflict" of one brother being the good guy and the other - the bad guy, love and revenge, true friendship and drug wars. Have I missed anything? The exaggeration seems both to show what is best in the genre and to kill the genre, too. What I admire in Rodriguez is his ability to press the cliches hard, to expose them but never to become a tedious moralizer. He ridicules different genres and the public swallows that ridicule for true attempt to look "like Woo" or what. I think that after watching Rodriguez's films in any genre one can't be as innocently absorbed in the films of the sort as he /she was before, criticism and irony will be there. Another thing I like about the film is that no detail spoils the general intended effect. That's why it's ridiculous to speak about Salma Hayek's or Banderas's physique as if it were the only attraction of the film. Well, they're both in the right place. But the Mexican boy with the guitar, bar-flies, gang apes are in their right places, too. The film is stylish, indeed. The style is in everything: in the character's clothes, in the setting, AND in the dialogue. One just has to have an ear for that talk. As for me, I think the film is great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Robert Rodriguez VS. John Woo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, I am a fan of John Woo through and through. I am also a fan of Robert Rodriguez through and through. I believe that Robert Rodriguez is an extremely talented director. Whether it's his $7,000 masterpiece El Mariachi or his blood-frenzied vampire flick From Dusk Till Dawn he always seems to shine through. But I am an even more fan of John Woo. I believe that he is a landmark to the movie industry with such jaw-droppers as The Killer, Hard Boiled, A Better Tomorrow, Bullet in the Head, Face/Off, Broken Arrow, etc. Now Desperado is a movie where when I think about it, these two directors come straight into my mind. Robert Rodriguez because obviously this is his movie and he directed it but John Woo because it's blatently obvious that Woo's belief's on how an action movie should be made affected Rodriguez's views on this movie. It's obvious that it's because of Rodriguez's direction that this movie made it all the way but it's also obvious that it wouldn't have gotten there without the Woo style action. So what this comes down to is "Who's views and beliefs made this movie so good?" I don't know nor do I really care but it gives you something to ponder. Either it's more of a John Woo movie or it's more of a Robert Rodriguez movie, Desperado comes out as a solid action movie that entertains greatly. Anyways, lets focus on the movie. Desperado is a sequel to 1992's El Mariachi which became an instant cult classic because of it's amazing quality provided so well by newbie independent director Robert Rodriguez. So when I first viewed this movie I was in the mind set of a spectacular sequel to a spectacular original film. And I got that and a whole lot more. This movie didn't surpass it's predecessor but it certainly is close. Both films contained a high amount of action camp to them but that just helps make the movie stronger. OK, this movie is basically a movie about an undying revenge brought about by the death of the "Mariachi's" wife. In El Mariachi the Mariachi was played superbly by Carlos Gallardo and the Mariachi is brought back to life in it's originality by Antonio Banderas in Desperado. I liked Antonio Banderas better than Carlos Gallardo but it's a close tie. So basically through this whole movie it's about a disgruntled Banderas trying to get even with the man who killed his wife. On his journey to find his killer he kills quite a large amount of guys but only because he had too. Throughout this whole movie a large amount of well known actors appear before your eyes such as Steve Buscemi, Quentin Tarantino, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek and Danny Trejo. These supporting actors add to the fun and camp of this movie from beginning to end. But don't forget where the movie's superb action scenes are coming from. It's from the mind of John Woo that these action scenes are coming from and I give my regards to Robert Rodriguez for including Woo's stylish gunplay into this movie. Especially the AMAZING bar shootout! Truly magnificent! Also another movie that comes to my mind when I see this movie is Braveheart (or The Patriot because there both practically the same). Braveheart's tale was one of one man's revenge for his lost wife. Desperado's tale was one of one man's revenge for his lost wife. Any similarities happening here? But actually they do differ in one way. The endings, at the end of Desperado they drive off into the sunset. Which I'd prefer to having my head skewered on a long pole by a bunch of p***ed off British nobles. What do you think? 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a HUGE fan of Robert Rodriguez, and I have to say that this is my favourite of his movies. Its got all his trademarks, such as the fading camera shots and the western-rock style soundtrack, as well as John Woo-inspired action sequences.Sure, the plots a bit thin: wandering musician comes to town to kill an underworld baron because he hates gangsters. But what it lacks in originality it more than makes up for with supercool visuals and all round godliness. Yes, Rob Rodriguez IS god!Excellent shoot-outs, great acting from Banderas and Hayek, cameos from Rodriguez's usual crew (Cheech Marin, Tito Laviras, Danny Trejo, etc) and also Quentin Tarantino, and also a cool script. Watch this now!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a must see movie ! Tarantino knows what´s he want and what he can, with this movie he has made a modern classic. He really understands how to fit the pictures with the music and besides that it´s a nice story. And for one time the soundtrack available on audio is the actual music that´s playing while you sit and watch it! Thumbs up to Tito Tarantula ! If you haven´t seen it yet i will surely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>el mariachi returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>desperado is the sequel of el mariachi and robert rodriguez does a great job by doing this movie showing that sequels can be better than the original. we could summarize this movie in one word, style. this movie is all about style, robert rodriguez uses in this movie a john woo style, that works beautifully. the change of the camera angles and slow motion, are an intentional rip off from john woo. the music score is great, really great. the main lead of this movie is antonio banderas that does a great job in the skin of el mariachi, the man is full of style. the villain is played by joaquim de almeida, that does also a great job (and i'm not saying that because i'm portuguese). the girl is played by salma hayek, that has a wild beauty. it has also other secondary cast that are just phenomenal. quentin tarantino appears to tell us a joke (it's a great scene), danny trejo throws same knives, steve buscemi is great playing a weasel and carlos gallardo (the ex mariachi) appears as campa. in short, if u didn't saw this movie, u don't deserve to live. kidding... go see it, it's one of the greatest action movies of the century.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If this movie wouldn't have nude Salma Hayek in it it would be a complete waste of time.not even close to the sincerity and originality of El Mariachi, it's a self-indulgent, overproduced, BADLY SCRIPTED quasi remake of Rodriguez' first film... It feels like he's just sold out to Hollywood, getting all these highly paid actors, replacing the lead man with a pretty boy Hollywood darling who can't act... so what's the big fuss about?no logic, no plot, laughable attempts at philosophizing... it's got a bit of humor now and then, but if not for a peek at Salma's tits it would be just a complete waste of time.

		<fullReview>One can probably get a good impression of this film from the other reviews, but for fans of the movie-making process, there is an extra appeal to this movie. Much like his previous El Mariachi, this movie takes low-budget to new heights. Sure, it's amazing that El Mariachi was made on 7 thousand, but it looked low-budget. At only 7 million, Desperado looks better than movies costing five times as much. Rodriguez is a guerilla filmmaking icon, and I highly recommend his DVD commentary to this film - basically a manual on high-style, low-budget directing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third feature film from Robert Rodriguez, and continues the story of the Mexican mariachi. However, unlike taking the subtle approach that 'El Mariachi' took, it goes for the all-out action approach.With a budget of $6 million, Rodriguez has created his mariachi character into a hero, and the film explores the boundaries between tragedy and love. It has some really cool acting. Antonio Banderas, in his first action role, plays the dark, mysterious mariachi avenger, Steve Buscemi plays his funny-looking side-kick and Salma Hayek plays the mariachi's love interest. As usual in Rodriguez movies, the direction is great, with some really cool camera shots and John Woo-inspired, well-choreographed shoot-outs.Rating: 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often spectacular, total thrill ride</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of Robert Rodriguez, I expected a fair bit from this film...I was not disappointed. For me the defining scene was the bar room gun fight, which both set the standard of the film, and made it worth the price of admission. Antonio Banderas delivered a very good performance as the marauding musician with the killer case. Some big names look a bit out of place in double hand gun battle scenes (see John Travolta in Face/Off), but Banderas carried it off beautifully. The delectable Salma Hayek delivered a smouldering performance as the love interest, and the cameos from Steve Buscemi, and Rodriguez staples Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo completed a decent cast. The dusty, bleak Mexican setting was perfect, suited the film and its themes down to the ground. No real plot to speak of, it got a little lost amidst all the fighting, but who cares? The fight scenes were varied enough to stay interesting (see the knife throwing loner) and even the modified guitar cases scene was good, the sheer craziness of the concept slotted in nicely with the exaggerated skill Banderas illustrated with his guns. All in all a most satisfying action film, kudos to Rodriguez, and may he keep producing films of this magnitude. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

Sure the violence is excessive but you are really cheering for Banderos as the avenging Mariachi and no one can tell me their heart didn't skip a beat when those two 9mm guns pop out of his sleeves in the early barroom battle. Special effects are minimal, but like the "zip-gun" scene just described, they are innovative and timed perfectly. The movie is really carried by the strength of the brooding Banderos who mirrors an early Clint Eastwood as the quiet outsider championing some lost cause against seemingly insurmountable odds.

He carries around guns in his guitar case, no longer able to play well. He gets involved with Carolina, played by Salma Hayek, and with her plots to kill Bucho, played by Joaquin de Almeida.I haven't seen the original film El Mariachi, but this film makes me want to. It isn't much plotwise but it makes up for it with some extra stylish action scenes which are very fun to watch. They are quite consistent throughout the film and the ending is good. Salma Hayek sparkles in this film, Antonio Banderas plays El Mariachi surprisingly well, and Joaquin de Almeida makes a convincing bad guy.

I especially loved the scene where Tarentino tells this really stupid joke at the bar. It is completely irrelevant for the story and takes way too long. Beside, the joke is really lame. But that is exactly why this scene is so funny. Another really funny scene is the one, where Salma does her nurse-thing on Antonio.

		<fullReview>For an action film, "Desperado" really delivers. Its scenes of gunplay instantly brings films like "The Killer" and "The Wild Bunch" to mind. The mariachi would be a wooden, useless caricature if the wrong actor was playing the part. Fortunately, Antonio Banderas shines in the role. With charisma, charm, and flair, he shows just what makes him a favorite among leading men. Salme Hayek more than holds her own here; the chemistry between her and Banderas is undeniable. Quentin Tarantino, in one of his few decent acting performances, gets laughs with a hilarious joke.All in all, the film balances elements of action, western, and comedy. It's a fun, fast-paced movie. Maybe too violent for the more sensitive, but the escapists should love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the moderately decent "El Mariarchi," Robert Rodriguez delivered this film, one of the most precisely executed action films I have ever seen. Every gunfight is choreographed as well as any musical dance sequence. Rodriguez masterfully shot and edited these scene for the maximum intensity possible. In fact, that one word is what really defines this film ; Intensity. Antonio Banderas proved to me longer before his critical acclaim for "Evita" (in which he is the only redeeming aspect) his ability to convey raw power and fierce emotion into every one of his scene. For a man who, at this time, hardly really had a grip on the language he was speaking, Banderas manages to push exactly the right amount of energy into every line he delivers. This man alone is just as exciting as Rodriguez's fast camera action. And so, I highly recommend this as my favorite 'popcorn ' movie. It may be little more than blood and bullets at times. But, blood and bullets have never been captured so well since Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A gunslinger (Antonio Banderas) is embroiled in a war with a local drug runner.Robert Rodriguez is an interesting character. On one hand, he has made the popular series of children's films, "Spy Kids". And then, he makes some rather gory, very adult, films like this, "Machete", "Planet Terror" and more... how does this work? I am not sure, but he does it very well.While the roles of Steve Buscemi, Quentin Tarantino and Cheech Marin deserve mentioning, this was Antonio Banderas' film beginning to end. He is stylish, a good hero, a good anti-hero in many ways (he is a mass murderer after all)... and a very talented musician. His every move is mesmerizing.The over-the-top violence borders on the humorous, but never quite becomes a comedy. And somehow this works. I could have done without the Salma Hayek romance. I understand films need a romance, but I think this slowed the pace down a bit too much, and the sex scene was simply gratuitous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Desperado is a very enjoyable movie. The action is very well choreographed and its important to note this because action directors don't get enough credit. They are too often snubbed for not being 'arty' enough. But good action scenes are very hard to pull off and they require a a great deal of invention. Rodriguez clearly has a detailed knowledge of action cinema, drawing on spaghetti westerns and Hong Kong action cinema styles. The comic yet thrilling set pieces, featuring criminals flying in the air and spattering blood, are one of the main sources of entertainment. These scenes were clearly well thought out, using inventive techniques such as the empty guns sequence in which Banderas and a criminal frantically try and find a loaded gun. Indeed, Banderas himself is key to the success of these sequences. Doing all the stunts himself he often makes the battles look like a beautiful dance. His acting is also worthy of a place among the great anti-heroes of cinema.The paper thin revenge plot is essentially an excuse for spectacle and suspense, but that's not to say there isn't good writing. Rodriguez makes this film an above average action comedy with the very witty and self knowing dialogue. The clearly Tarantino influenced script, full of references to cult films, is hilariously delivered, especially by Steve Buscemi and Quentin Tarantino himself.However, the almost interesting villain, Bucho, is only half-decently characterized. One feels so much more could have been done with him. There is an attempt to mirror him to Banderas's El Mariachi in the cut from Mariachi's steamy, romantic sex scene with book keeper Salma Hayek to Bucho's cold emotionless sex with an incidental woman. The lack of emotion wonderfully expressed in the barren and grey mise-en-scene. Maybe the cut to this barren mise-en-scene is suggesting that El Mariachi will become as bitter and cold as Bucho if he carries on his vengeful lifestyle. This scene was very well crafted but the film needed to explore this connection more and give Bucho more depth.The film does actually have something to say about revenge and doesn't merely present it as the cool, right thing to do, as Kill Bill does. Perfectly captured in a line near the end, after spending the film killing dozens of people, El Mariachi says "Everyone I have killed is someone's father, someone's son...or someone's brother". The power of this line and also the scene in the church brings home the seriousness of revenge and the damaging effect it has on the soul. El Mariachi's soul is certainly tortured by the acts he has done but it is only expressed in one or two subtle lines in the film.Despite the qualms about Bucho, and perhaps some more detail in the set design, this film has a lot to offer. As well as the action and witty dialogue the sexy Salma Hayek keeps the viewer's attention. Rodriguez is no genius as some have mistakenly labelled him but he is a very competent director and has here successfully crafted an orgy of violence, sex and pleasingly self knowing film references which will make any film buff happy. Scenes such as the explosion on the rooftop and Mariachi diving backwards onto another building have become iconic. Desperado does have interesting musings on revenge even if this serious theme is made fun of by the comic violence and tongue in cheek ending. The key to the quality of this film is the self knowingness of it. Rodriguez plays with the viewer, knowing you've seen the cult classics he's referencing, and this keeps Desperado a highly enjoyable and fascinating film.</fullReview>

He would probably be a cross between Blade and The Crow, always dressed in black, always carrying weapons wherever he goes and always getting into trouble.The Leading Lady (Salma Hayek) is the hottest Mexican bookstore keeper on Earth. She is both beautiful and dangerous and she won't fail to please the audience.This film aims to please and it has done an amazing job on me and my family.

		<fullReview>OK, so I love Robert Rodriguez. I mean how many people do you know sell their bodies for drug testing to make a movie? That spells out god to me. Yet, I believe that his first movie will always remain his best. When i rented the DVD and watched the extra's, I overheard that Rodriguez wanted to create an action film ala John Woo's "The Killer" and "Hard Boiled." These two are probably the greatest action films ever made. Don't get me wrong, Rodriguez's style is very fantastic to watch, but he need's to become a little more original on his train of thought. The good thing is he represents one of the good people in Hollywood. The bad part is he is not original. Sorry Mr. Rodriguez, I still love your work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this movie because Steve Buscemi was in it.Steve is OK, but the rest of the flick is inane horse bleep. The opening sequence music is good, but the movie goes downhill after that. Cheech is here as a bartender, and it was good to see him again. Selma Hayek is very pretty, but the nudie scenes were too dark to see much unfortunately. The protagonist looks like Steve Seagal with long hair. The violence shot are so bogus I couldn't believe it. The scene in the crapper stall was even more bogus, crap on the wall does not look like that! The meany with all the knives is so, what can I say, Oriental that it just makes you want to gag.The worst scene is where Selma Hayek is taking the bullet out of the Steve Seagal look alike's arm, that scene is so bogus; just cauterize the wound with a lighted cigarette, eh. Straight out of the 1500's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picking up where "El Mariachi" left off, Antonio Banderas takes over as the lead character, still out to further avenge his girlfriend's murder by finding the big boss of the Christopher Walken look alike who blew his hand apart at the end of the first movie. And along the way he gets Salma Hayek in the sack. I believe the original El Mariachi star appears somewhere in hear, though I'm not sure where, possibly one of the guy's who comes to Banderas's help towards the end.Robert Rodriguez's buddy Quentin Tarantino has a small role as "the Pick Up Guy".There's a twist towards the end but I can't say what it is right now.Slicker than "El Mariachi" and probably twice as violent, this is a probably a must see for all action fans. Not only that but you really shouldn't pass up the chance to see Salma Hayek unclothed/stripped naked. I mean it; all 5'2" inches of her shapely little body is on display here. Kind of makes me jealous of Mr. Banderas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Minor spoilers for this film and El Mariachi (1992) may follow*NOTE: This review was designed to be read in conjunction with my review of El Mariachi (1992).This film is everything that its predecessor, El Mariachi, is not. While this is usually meant in a good way, in this case, for the most part it is a bad thing.First problem: El Mariachi is now being played by Antonio Banderas instead of Carlos Gallardo. First of all, as a small-time filmmaker I find this incredibly disloyal (you stick with the people who helped you get where you are. It's an unwritten rule). Second of all, to me, at least, part of the point of El Mariachi is that he does not look like a tough-as-nails gunman. He looks like a Mariachi. I realize that by this time he's been a tough-as-nails gunman for a couple of years now, but still, he's WAY too good at it, and seems WAY too into it for someone who has spent his whole life trying to be a Mariachi, and is in this business against his will. The Antonio Banderas El Mariachi is like a completely different character in completely different circumstances. Which would be fine, except that they keep trying to connect it to El Mariachi. Which brings us to...Second Problem: Why, exactly, is El Mariachi after this guy, Bucho? Because his men killed his love, Domino, and ruined his guitar-playing hand, he says. But no... that was Moco, the villain in El Mariachi, who did that, out of jealousy, and completely independently of anyone else. El Mariachi killed him soon after, and Moco's men were fine with this (a scene that reminded me of a twisted Wizard of Oz, actually; but in a good way). We are even given a flashback scene of this, complete with Antonio Banderas in the Carlos Gallardo role. So where does Bucho fit in? We are never given an explanation for this. And the final confrontation between El Mariachi and Bucho, to me, seemed just ludicrous.Third Problem: Why is everyone speaking English? The first film was entirely in Spanish, which, after I realized this and turned on the subtitles, worked just fine. OK, I realize that in Hollywood movies, everyone speaks English no matter who they are and what country they're in... but in Once Upon a Time in Mexico, for the most part the Spanish-speakers speak Spanish, and the English-speakers speak English. It's quite a minor thing, but I just think it works better that way.Fourth Problem: Quentin Tarantino. The man is an appalling actor. The joke that he tells about urinating across the bar is one I have heard about half a dozen versions of. But never in my life have I heard a worse-written or worse-delivered version than that. I wonder if Tarantino himself wrote that scene. The dialogue is very Tarantino-esque (which, in my book, is not at ALL a compliment), in that it goes on forever and has absolutely nothing to do with anything. The scene is pretty pointless.Plus, it's overly violent. All the shooting and such really got old, really quickly. I believe that El Mariachi proved that you don't need that much blood and that many explosions to make a great action film.But despite all of this, the dialogue is pretty good, most of the acting is pretty good, and it's generally a decent, fairly enjoyable film. Just nothing special.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a tongue-in cheek movie modeled along the lines of the oriental fight movies, only set in Mexico. This is a follow-on movie to "El Mariachi", Robert Rodriguez" first movie, made for $7000 with borrowed equipment and no crew. The "Mariachi", this time played by Antonio Banderas, returns for revenge for the death of his woman. The cast is perfect for the movie, and be sure to listen to the director's comments the second time around. Robert Rodriguez had a small budget, but it looks like a big picture. The opening scene with Cheech and Steve Buscemi is priceless (note the toothpick action and facial expressions by Cheech). Antonio and Selma do a great job, and the movie is fun. To really enjoy the movie to the fullest, read about Robert Rodriguez' background, or better yet, get his book "Rebel Without a Crew".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gunslingin' guitar-player week Day 2: He isn't finished yet!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This sequel to the 7000 Dollar debut El Mariachi by Robert Rodriguez was released in 1995 with a budget that is rumored to have been a thousand times more than the budget spent on El Mariachi. With about seven million Dollars to spend, Rodriguez could do much more. There could be more action, better cinematography, a soundtrack and better actors (sometimes even ones with recognizable faces). None of the actors involved in this production had a big name back in 1995, although some would get one in later years. Antonio Banderas was perhaps the most recognizable face, remembered for his good performance in the 1993 drama Philadelphia and his appearance in the 1994 horror/thriller Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles. With Desperado and Assasins (also released in 1995) he made himself a name in Hollywood, which he has held onto until now (despite making only mediocre and bad films in the last years including the Spy Kids trilogy with Rodriguez, which did decently at the box-office though). Salma Hayek, was far from famous in 1995, but Desperado put her in the Spotlights as well. After this film she starred in some decent action flicks and began to get a name for herself. Last year she completed her dream project about Frida Kahlo and even got herself an Academy Award nomination. Other recognizable faces, for movie buffs and old stoners were the ones of Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong fame) and that of Steve Buscemi (of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction fame) and that of Quentin Tarantino. Now I said earlier, that none of the actors had a big name back in 1995 and I was expecting you to read between the lines there a bit. I mean, not many people knew Steve Buscemi and despite Tarantino being pretty famous for his 1994 Pulp Fiction, he had no household name as an actor. The good thing about all these actors was, that they were all pretty good, but rather cheap I say. Some were friends of Rodriguez (like Tito Larriva, Quentin Tarantino and Calos Gallardo) and others even family members (Angela Lanza and Danny Trejo). If you have seen El Mariachi look out for a cameo by Carlos Gallardo, who played the lead in El Mariachi. Also in Desperado re-enacting one of the final scenes from El Mariachi are Consuelo Gómez, Jaime De Hoyos and Peter Marquardt. The only thing that seems to have changed is the mariachi who now is portrayed by Antonio Banderas, of course. That did not bother me at all though, because he carried out his job well throughout the film, as did all other actors. My favorite parts of the film are the intro (until after the opening credits) and the bar-scene in which Tarantino tells a joke and . I just realized that I could go on like that for a time, but I'll spare you the bore. The thing I like about those scenes and several others (the whole film for that matter) is how it manages to be so cool and funny at times, without ever being too over the top. Watching Desperado so shortly after having seen El Mariachi, it occurred to me that Rodriguez actually revisited a lot of places in this sequel that he'd already visited in El Mariachi. The name of the city in Desperado is different than the one El Mariachi came down on, but if you look close you'll recognize that the city itself (where the shoot took place) is the original city from El Mariachi. Another thing that I noticed, was that Rodriguez copied some scenes from El Mariachi and used them again in Desperado (differently filmed though). This brings me again to the bigger budget Rodriguez had this time around. In El Mariachi, he had to watch his step every time, so he could keep the budget as low as possible, but in Desperado, he could finally take it one step further. He could finally do some real damage, crashing cars and blowing them up as well. The cinematography of the film also benefited from the bigger budget. There are some nice scenes in slow motion which are given a really cool edge by the soundtrack and in addition to that the shootout scenes are much more spectacular than they were in El Mariachi. The only thing that might have gotten lost in the making of this film, was the reality factor. What I mean is that El Mariachi could still be considered believable, but this film? Hell no! Did that bother me? Hell, NO! Did I love the film? Hell YEAH! Am I going to see Once upon a time in Mexico? Yes. In the cinema? After seeing the first trailer, it all depended on the word of mouth. After seeing the R-rated trailer the answer would be: YES!!! Unfortunately, Once upon a Time in Mexico plays only in selected cinema's in The Netherlands and by my taste they are too small to 'waste' 8 Euro's (about 10 dollars) on. Therefore Gunslingin' guitar-player week will only have two days and you'll have to wait for my comment on the third installment of the series until it is released on Video and DVD. 8,25 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers I suppose it's a bit unfair, but watching an action flick on DVD 8 years after its release isn't quite the same as watching it on the big screen when it is hot off the oven, so to speak. I wouldn't be too harsh, but if you've always been watching action flicks, Desperado is one big bundle of cliché. Moreover, it creates instant cliché: watching a rocket launched from a guitar case for the first time may be fine. The second time, it becomes rather tiresomeOn the other hand, there's Salma Hayek. I saw her the first time in Frida and the second time in Once Upon a Time in Mexico, and I thought she's OK. Then finally Desperado (going back 8 years), and Hayek is so beautiful that it's heartbreaking. I particularly love the scene when she is trying to remove a bullet from Banderas' arm. If Desperado is on the whole run-of-the-mill, this scene at least can hold up against any selected scene in any movie, and that is because of Hayek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Question: How many John Woo movies did Rodriguez watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Desperado borrows heavily in the style departments that Woo capitalized with A Better Tomorrow, The Killer, and Hard-Boiled. In many cases it is all-to-obvious that Robert Rodriguez is trying to infuse the Woo method with his own inferior techniques. For starters, Quentin Tarantino doesn't have any purpose in this movie. He isn't very funny and he rambles on, hammering your ears like a cinematic Oliver Stone. Antonio Banderas has never been a strong actor in my book and here he is no more than a showcase for Rodriguez's camera.The camera, after all, is what separates the men from the boys...and Rodriguez is still in the sand box. Most of his cinematography is only a half-step ahead of MTV, as is the editing, but most falls behind Woo in creating emotion. While this is marginally better than Hard-Boiled and the Better Tomorrow films, it falters in all departments compared to The Killer. No emotion is created other than what is pounded at the audience. The music is equally ineffective.Overall, less mythic than Leone, less styled than Woo, more powerful than Tarantino, but as shallow as George Lucas. 2 out of 5 stars. (minor spoiler: on the bonus side, Tarantino has enough sense to die in most of these films he's in).</fullReview>

The "classic" scene between Banderas and Hayek is excellent, excellent stuff. Here is the story thanks to Tad Dibbern.With this sequel to his prize-winning independent previous film, "El Mariachi," director Robert Rodriquez joins the ranks of Sam Peckinpah and John Woo as a master of slick, glamorized ultra-violence. We pick up the story as a continuation of "El Mariachi," where an itinerant musician, looking for work, gets mistaken for a hitman and thereby entangled in a web of love, corruption, and death. This time, he is out to avenge the murder of his lover and the maiming of his fretting hand, which occurred at the end of the earlier movie. However, the plot is recapitulated, and again, a case of mistaken identity leads to a very high body count, involvement with a beautiful woman who works for the local drug lord, and finally, the inevitable face-to-face confrontation and bloody showdown.Salma Hayek ROCKS</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of "El Mariarchi" with a bigger budget, bigger stars, and bigger bangs. For the first hour it is tightly directed and heading for cult status as one of contemporary cinema's finest action epics. Unfortunately, it runs out of steam on its way to infamy and suffers from terminal redundancy. The one-dimensional relationships amount to nothing and the final conflagration of gunpowder and emotional rage comes across as old hat. The early shoot-outs are staged with great skill and a controlled bloodlust. A dark element of humor threads its way through a number of these sequences, in particular the explosive exchange of bullets in the bar run by Cheech Marin. Rodriquez, who clearly knows his Peckinpah and Woo, injects plenty of energy into the action pieces, but he's all at sea with the dramatic scenes and is unable to build any real chemistry between the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's all been done before and done much better. Desperado is your standard Hollywood action shoot-em-up. All the clichés are there. The one guy with a pistol who faces a dozen guys with machine guns and somehow manages to kill them all. The cartoonish action where someone gets shot and then jumps in the air and does a couple of 360s before falling down dead. The villain who has our hero dead to rights but...he's out of bullets. Gee, never saw that coming. The huge explosions of fire which are there for no particular reason. The gorgeous woman who leads a seemingly ordinary small-town life but then suddenly becomes a pistol-packin' mama in the blink of an eye. All of this might be acceptable if Desperado had a good plot, a riveting story to tell. It doesn't.Antonio Banderas plays our hero, El Mariachi, a guitar player out for revenge. He is searching for a drug dealer named Bucho who is responsible for the death of the woman he loved. Of course the movie wouldn't be complete if Banderas didn't have a new woman to love and in that role we have Salma Hayek. Hayek certainly fills the gorgeous part of the job requirement but unfortunately her acting in this film is limited to two expressions...goofy grin and pouty frown. And let's just say that Salma Hayek, action hero, is a bit of a stretch. Turning in the best performance is Steve Buscemi who does a great job in an opening scene where he details Mariachi's murderous exploits. Quentin Tarantino shows up and his performance serves only to remind us he's a much better director than he is an actor.The film proceeds through shootout after shootout, explosion after explosion, all of which El Mariachi survives in mostly ludicrous fashion. Eventually we come to the climax and what is meant to be a jaw-dropping plot twist. Instead it comes off as incredibly lame and makes our supposed hero look like quite the idiot. You may find yourself saying, "Come on now, how could he not know THAT?" It's the final ludicrous moment in a film filled with them. Desperado looks real nice, filled as it is with impressive visuals. Visuals however don't make a film, plot does, and in that area Desperado is sorely lacking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen "El Mariachi" but I understand this is a continuation of the same story. And that's about all I could understand about "Desperado".When you make a small budget movie that strives to look big budget, a lot of times things will mesh and make it a hit, like "El Mariachi" did. BUT when a big budget movie strives for small budget charm, usually it ends up flat on its face. ...like "Desperado" does.I know; Rodriguez is aping directors like Woo and Peckinpah, trying to make a ballet of death with such instruments as guns, explosives, blood and emotions (loss, regret, revenge, pride). But whereas Woo and Peckinpah had great scripts to work with that made the flashy direction icing on the cake, Rodriguez thinks his cake should be all icing. Which it is.There are great things to be had here: Buscemi is always worth watching and Marin is good for a few scenes. And as the "Desperado" of the title, Banderas is effectively glowering and avoids death quite convincingly. And what can anyone say about Salma Hayek? She would cause traffic accidents in real life too, I imagine.But the story is as fitful and explosive as the special FX; there's nothing of any real substance here to get your claws into and when it's all over and done with, nothing's really been said that wasn't made a point of in "The Wild Bunch" or "Hard Boiled". When you're given bigger toys to demonstrate your storytelling prowess with, sometimes you play so much that the story is forgotten. Rodgriguez, play time is over.Three stars. Nice explosions and acrobatics. Nice Salma, too.</fullReview>

Don't bother pulling out of your pants your 9 mm pistol and shoot the guy ? hide behind a trashcan and wait for other bad guys to drive up out of nowhere and kill him for you.As usual Hollywood depicts the racist stereotype of the typical small town in Mexico ? backwards, no police, violent, primitive, with women that are whores and men who are drug dealers.Oh, but it's so hip!!

Yes the story is simple, yes it's a cliché in a way, yes the action is overdone, but it's all done with such style and originality that the movie is just brilliant! Acting is great, directing is great, writing is awesome, action choreography is just --- perfect!!! Robert Rodriguez has used all there was to use from the script and made a movie that you will watch over and over and over again and feel, every time, like it's the first time you do. While he was making this movie, at the time he was obviously very much into Sergio Leone. And he's managed to do what Sergio Leone has done a couple of times before. He made something simply terrific out of a script that didn't have much to give. Don't get me wrong, some Sergio's script's such as The Good, The Bad, The Ugly were perfectly well written, but than some other's weren't. But he still managed to make something great out of them. And that's what Rodriguez did with this movie.Desperado is a proof that the budget isn't everything and that a great movie can be made out of an average script, as long as the director is good at his job. This is all the director's movie. Rodriguez has prooven, as many other's did before him, that directing is fifty percent of the movie! This is a must see!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This bears striking similarities to El Mariachi, and this can be called a partial remake, the same way other sequels can be argued to be, like Terminator 2. To an extent, this gives us more of an idea of what the first might have looked like, if it hadn't been done for almost nothing. This is still low budget, if now mainly by comparison to other big studio action flicks. Again he makes it look like it cost a greater amount than it did, and puts something entertaining and exciting together for money that too many Hollywood directors couldn't pull off a single scene with. Characters, development and overall plot are somewhat lacking, and I maintain that Robert does best when he lets others take care of the script(trust me, I've read Rebel Without A Crew, granted, it was apparently put together of diary excerpts, but still, while the man is interesting, inspiring and worth paying attention to, he is *not* that good or compelling of a writer). The shootouts and the like are awesome, fun and memorable. There's just not too much else here. It's all pretty and well-produced, the only problem is that there's no emotional impact to speak of. He's a little too happy doing the cool stuff, and forgets to include substance. What there is that could be construed as such feels phoned in and half-hearted. He does make a convincing flick in the spirit of spaghetti-Westerns, through and through. And don't get me wrong, this definitely is enjoyable to watch. The pace is fast, though he does also slow down. This has comedy that fits Rodriguez' fairly twisted sense of humor, though this has less disturbing content than that of its predecessor. The opening of this is required viewing for anyone who considers themselves a macho type. Found on the DVD are two music videos, a theatrical trailer, and an informative Director's Commentary. All are worth the time. I recommend this to fans of RR, the prequel and/or the genre. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>El Mariachi: Souped up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually sequels will destroy or ruin a good small-time movie. This is not the case with "Desperado"."El Mariachi" was a low-budget, fun action movie. "Desperado" is the same thing...but higher budget.El Mariachi (the character) continues his quest for revenge on those who have destroyed his life. This time, he is played by Antonio Banderas. El Mariachi's girl in this movie is Carolina, played wonderfully by Salma Hayek. El Mariachi also has some good friends, like his friend Buscemi (obviously played by Steve Buscemi), whom he calls a "brother". There's also 2 mysterious Mariachi playing friends of his, Quino (Played by Albert Michel Jr.) and Campa (played by Carlos Gallardo, who played El Mariachi in the first film). Of course, there's the new bad guy on the block, Bucho (played by Joaquim de Almeida), his Right Hand (Carlos Gomez), and his main bodyguard, Zamira (Angel Aviles). There's a wide assortment of other little bad guys here and there, like the Short Bartender (professionally played by Cheech Marin) and his buddy Tavo (played by Tito Larriva). There's also the mysterious knife-wielding assassin, "Navajas" (played by Danny Trejo). There's even a small appearance by Quentin Tarantino as the joke-telling Pick-Up guy.With lots of over-the-top action, a solid story-line, and a lot of very interesting scenes, "Desperado" is indeed a great follow-up to the low-budget gem, "El Mariachi" 9/10. Fans of "El Mariachi" should see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has really gotten only better to me over time. I first saw only part of the movie on TV, then the whole movie, then I saw it after watching El Mariachi and awaiting the release of Once Upon a Time in Mexico. The movies have a feeling of Magical Realism to them, and the last two especially are beautifully shot. I really like the blend of reality with fantasy. An example that comes to mind is the way that every time after Antonio Banderas has a shoot out and has gotten sweaty and mussed-up, he no more than slicks his hair back into a pony tail and he is again sleek and clean(ish), albeit in a very manly, tough sort of way. The settings are lovely and the music is great-all around, a highly enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have not seen anything of Rodrigues and Banderas till that movie and this really was a reason to became much more surprised . this is a film you enjoy more than before every time you watch it because every time you pick something of directorial or acting excellence in the film. the moves, the camera work, the fight sequences and acting(which is perhaps the least concerning thing in an action movie, but in this film it is one of the assets of the movie) every thing is just too good. this is, by far the best action of 90's and no wonder that the action sequences of this film are still copied all over the world even after 10 years. A real treat to watch if you like action movies and it tells you that it is not necessary to blow the whole city apart and burn all the cars available in order to make a good action film. what you need a 6*4 inch head with a 4*3 inch brain in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is loaded with great action, humor, and style. Don't let the moody cover fool you, with Banderas holding the gun to his head, this film is not as serious as it looks. In fact, I found it quite comical.The action, as I said before, is fantastic. It's fun to watch, stylishly done, and just plain amazing! I can't get enough of it.The acting was good, the script was great, and just about everything is amazing in this movie.It's all about El Mariachi trying to take down one last drug-gang to avenge his girlfriend's death. Unfortunately, he has never seen the drug dealer he's after and is in quite a pickle as he is being hunted by this dealer and people are getting shot, stabbed, blown up, and beaten really bad everywhere around him.This film is pretty violent, but not to the point of you having to go to the bathroom and vomit - violent. It's mainly just blood and excessive shooting.And the humor is really great and funny. A real treat from Rodriguez, a great director.There's also a nice twist at the end. Ooh, I love twists! I give this a 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Desperado-1995-Antonio Banderas, Jaqueim de Almedia, Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin, Steve Buscemi, Tito Larriva, Quentin Tarantino, Danny Trejo and Carlos Gomez.Overall, this isn't a bad film, but it gets rather annoying. It's about El Mariachi (Banderas) trying to kill Busco (de Almedia) and meeting Carolina (Hayek) along the way while dealing with some unsavory characters. I'll start with the beginning. We start off with an extremely amusing opening where El's right hand man Buscemi (Buscemi) is telling a bartender (Marin) a story about the biggest Mexican ever. It is one of my favorite openings to any movie because of Steve's hilarious performance. We find out he was just trying to scare them for El Mariachi who is looking for Busco. I found the scenes with the supporting characters (Buscemi, Marin, Larriva, Trejo and Tarantino) to be much more interesting than the ones with the main stars. The thing that was missing from the main character scenes was humor. After about halfway through the film, you feel a little bored, until the end. So I do reccomed this movie, but it is not for everybody.My rating: 2 1/2 out of 4 stars. 105 mins. R for volence, language, drug content and a strong sex scene.</fullReview>

It is the funniest scene I have viewed since Dennis Hopper died in True Romance. If you haven't watched that little clip in True Romance you are missing out. It was hilarious in a dark kind of way. The entire movie was awesome. If you liked Desperado then True Romance is a perfect film for you. These two movies share that penchant for violence and dark comedy which I love in a good movie. Desperado was not a spectacular movie but definitely worth watching for the action and that joke in the bar. And don't forget that Selma Hayek is pretty easy to look at in this film.

		<shortDescription>Revaluation of the Western,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>first off let me say that this is one of my favorite movies, now many people would assume that means i have no taste, and maybe i don't, but my other favorites range from Citizen Kane, La Doltcha Vita, M, Batman Begins, Requiem for a dream, Crouching tiger hidden dragon, Old Boy, Sin City, The Breakfast Club, Collateral and The Seven Samurai. just to give perspective.now what i loved about desperado was its intricate simplicity. Rodriguez is a fantastic director, and all the actors in the film do they're jobs very well, this film is completely style over substance and knows it, but under all that style there's still a little substance here and there, if your willing to look for it. its sharply written, well told, and the action sequences are mind-blowing. without being hong Kong like, the action manages to be intricate and stylish, turning western- style gun-play into a sort of lead-spewing ballet, most notably in the bar fight. pretty much any flaws this movie has are either forgivable or work to enhance the film. its lighthearted, its fun, its cool as hell, and Selma Hiak is the sexiest woman alive. if you haven't seen El Mariachi, you don't need to have seen it in order to watch this film, but there is a DV D available with both films, you should check out, although personally i think the vintage feel of this film is best felt on VHS, i found my copy at a used book store for three bucks and could never consider buying it on DVD at least until my VHS copy becomes worn. now with El Mariachi, its best seen on DVD, its easier to find on that format and the special features include Rodriguez classic short film- Bedhead. the sequel, Once Upon a Time in Mexico is also best seen on DVD, as its visuals are absolutely stunning and are best seen in high definition. so in closing, see them, love them, and treasure them, because in an era of Micheal Baye, Jerry Bruchiemmer and Joel Shumaccer, its nice to remember when the American action film was something to be respected.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true 90's cowboy movie, everyone who saw El Mariachi could foresee that this picture would take the concept to the top. Fast-paced, greatly shot, incredibly edited, this movie refuses to take itself seriously and is well-succeeded in so. Antonio Banderas is the perfect Mariachi, adding a new depth to the first movie's main character. He seeks revenge. Revenge for all the things they did to him. And he will get it, the easy way or the hard way. Fellow Portuguese Joaquim de Almeida is Bucho, the villain, whose relationship with El Mariachi turns out quite surprising near the end. Until they both meet, there will be much gun-slinging action to fill the screen with anthological scenes, like the bar fight, the "Quedate Aqui" song and the final showdown. The movie is a comedy, even in the action scenes. I guarantee it, it's two hours of fun and a visible influence of the Westerns and B-Movies in someone's talent. Cracking good fun, which becomes addictive. Memorable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is without a doubt one of the best action films to of graced the big screen. Antonio Banderas puts in a convincing performance as the wronged mariachi seeking revenge on the mob boss who ordered the killing of his lover. Blood bath follows blood bath as he shoots and destroys his way through a small, lawless Mexican town.Salma Hayek, who is an awesome sight for sore eyes throughout, made her real breakthrough with this film. Robert Rodriguez script is snappy, funny and dark which some brilliant one liner's and a well structured narrative. But the multi-talented Rodriguez (who directed, wrote, edited and composed the music to name but a few things) shines especially in his framing of each shot, drawing the audience in and delivering exactly what they want to see.This is a stylishly executed, comic tale that everyone can enjoy whether you're a fan of action or not. Banderas must kill around 50 people in this film, and yet the violence never sees too gratuitous. This film is an eye pleasing thrill ride that never slows down or disappoints. Highly recommended to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect recipe for an action adventure flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not usually into gun-toting, high-adrenaline, ultra-macho action flicks, but I like this one. I think the reason why this normally isn't my genre of choice is because the films aren't very good. They're shoot-by-the-numbers flicks that are horribly predictable and difficult to embrace. Another huge problem with many action flicks is that the lead actors tend to be martial artists or hip-hop stars who lack a little thing I like to call... acting ability. Obviously, this isn't high art, and we don't need classically trained performers in the roles. But films do need charisma, the star needs to be interesting enough that I care whether or not he succeeds in his mission, and many action stars just aren't.However, in Desperado, Antonio Banderas has charisma to spare (in fact, one of the reasons why Once Upon A Time In Mexico fell so flat for me is that it seemed as though every once of Banderas' appeal had been eliminated from it). He plays El Mariachi with zeal, wit, and even a little vulnerability, which makes the film a fun ride. He exudes the proper amount of cool and sex appeal, which allows him to win over both the men (who want to be him) and the women (who want to be with him) in the audience. The raw chemistry he shares with the ultra-hot Salma Hayek in this film would easily contend for a ranking on a Top Five list for on-screen chemistry, were I to do one.The humour in this film is what makes it fun for me. Be it Steve Buscemi's fantastic opening narration scene, Cheech Marin as a crooked bartender, or just some of the hilarious moments during gunfights that Banderas finds himself in. The humour is effective, while not detracting from the mood of the movie the way many modern action and horror films do, by being too self-mocking and winking to the camera.Other than Banderas, the major credit for the film's quality goes to Rodriguez. For it is the style of the film that makes it work. It is not realistic, it is stylish. Bullets fly recklessly, explosions back light our heroes to create the perfect shot, bodies fly, guitar cases become rocket launchers, and El Mariachi shoots handguns like a kid pretending his fingers are guns. It's not supposed to be realistic, it's supposed to be cool. And it is cool. It's exciting, sexy, funny, crazy, cool, and fun. The perfect recipe for an action adventure flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing film that will encourage you to discover the whole story by watching the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Desperado is a film that will (quite literally) blow you away. The casting of Antonio Banderas as "El" was a fantastic choice as his appearance portrays a more Mexican character than that of Carlos Ballardo in the original El Mariachi film.The gunfights are brilliantly executed and the co-ordination is supreme. Having not seen the original film, the following comment may be seen as useless to others, however, I believe that Desperado far surpasses the original film due to better acting and cast. This is only based on what I have seen of the trailer for the original but the scenery looks darker and murkier, better suited to the atmosphere surrounding the film.This film deserves a 9 out of 10, the only thing that could have made it a complete 10 would be the inclusion of Ballardo in the final scene as Mariachi's friend "Campa". This at first confused me, questioning the real identity of El Mariachi on the whole. Who is the new El? Is this a story following a different Mariachi? Or was the original film a different story about Campa? The answer is obviously no, as the distinction of the gunshot wound in El's hand in "El Mariachi" is on Banderas' hand confirming his identity. It was just an interesting thought to bring back the original Mariachi of Mexico, but not one that I personally would have made.</fullReview>

In the process of this, he meets the enchanting Carolina (Salma Hayek) and eventually "thanks" her and they, i guess, fall in love. The funny thing is that in the sequel to this movie, Once Upon A Time In Mexico, they kill of Hayek's character. Yes that means El loses another wife but this time there was also a child killed. All in all, this is the better movie of the two. I highly recommend it. I thought I would get bored but it kept me entertained the whole way through. I give this movie a 8/10.</fullReview>

Knowing the two sides of El Mariachi is easy it depends on which side you take.His other crew was great as well. One has the bazooka case. The other has two gatlin cases. They were highly effective with him until their death.This movie is highly intriguing, sexy, dangerously clever, and most of all, very exciting from beginning to end.

Reminds me of the cartoon I recently saw where a couple is exiting a movie theater with a poster indicating they just saw a "chick flick," and he says she now owes him "three movies where lots of stuff explodes." Above all you have Man as Seducer, Protector and Avenger. Maybe it's all been done better in some Western from the 1950s. But as a guy myself, I just don't think so.

		<fullReview>Desperado is a movie where you have to put your brain on hold for about 90 minutes to enjoy it, because you're watching B-movie material at best. Antonio Banderas shoots people from every conceivable angle in a quest for revenge against Bucho, the man responsible for the murder of his wife. Improbable action scenes lose their punch after a while, and director Robert Rodriguez should have hired Quentin Tarantino to punch up the dialogue the way he did for From Dusk Till Dawn. And the only other players of any interest (played by Tarantino, Steve Buscemi, and Cheech Marin) are killed off too early in the film. Banderas is OK in the title role, but you get the feeling sometimes he's competing with co-star Salma Hayek for the "Best Hair-do" award.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overall this is a cool movie - some great black comedy, some slick action scenes, and some funny characters.The whole film is basically a flashier, cleaner (or dirtier depending on how you want to look at it), and funnier remake of El Mariachi. The bad guy is more ruthless, the hit-man is meaner (is anyone meaner looking than Danny Trejo?), the love interest is hotter, the bartenders are funnier, the soundtrack is better, the hero is tougher (for the most part), and the action has a budget.My only real qualm about this movie is the inclusion of boring (characterisation) scenes such as Antonio talking to the little boy, or the (non-sex) scenes with him and Salma talking about bullshit. Okay Antonio can't play guitar anymore, he is sad, i get it.Other than that, though, the lack of respect for human life present in this movie is nothing short of fantastic. The unchecked massacres of 'bad guy' hoards in this film is on a scale barely seen since the likes of the action classic - Commando.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler OK, is it just me or is there a MAJOR continuity error with the script to Desperado? In El Mariachi the bad guy is called Moco...yes? And at the end the Mariachi kills Moco (who has killed the woman he loved) and rides off into the sunset....yes? So why does the story pick up with the Mariachi seeking to avenge the death of the woman he loved when he has already done it? There's even a flashback to the final scene of El Mariachi complete with the original Moco and Banderas as the Mariachi. At no point is there any reference to Bucho and Moco being linked but suddenly.....Bucho is the one who killed his girlfriend......WTF?!...DID I MISS SOMETHING HERE?!?!?!?!?!?Any ideas anyone? Or are we simply meant to overlook this fact?Oops Mr Rodriguez....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Multiple automatic weapons firing at the hero at close range; enough firepower to make an assault on a dug-in battalion, but the man comes through with barely a scratch. He only gets hurt when the gun isn't pointed at him, or someone throws knives. I wish I had those powers; I could really kick some butt too, or in this case, ratchet up the body count.If you admit to it being totally fiction, its kind of fun to watch. Some notable actors make an appearance, and Salma Hayek is worth looking at. Banderas has a lot of energy and there are some good duels, explosions and flying bodies. All in all a fun if bloody movie to kill an evening with. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wonder if "El Mariachi" is based on a comic, im basically watching the 3 parts to this series backwards, 1st i watched "Once Upon A Time In Mexico" &amp; now "Desperado, but i haven't seen "El Mariachi" yet. So far both of them are awesome action/comic/black comedy movies, the violence is so detailed &amp; animated like. The whole movie has a nice peaceful scenery &amp; then outta nowhere you see heads being blown off, &amp; the stories told by Steve Buscemi &amp; Quentin Tarantino were hilarious. I can easily say that this is one of the best action movies ive ever seen, hardly any boring scenes &amp; the humor to this movie adds to the brilliance of enjoyable movie. I'd give this movie 9 / 10, This truely is one of the more entertaining movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Desperado! However, one must know that you can not take this movie seriously. If you do, you will think it is awful. However, if you want a mindless way to spend 1 1/2 hours, check this out. The action sequences are some of the best yet made in America, with Antonio Banderas taking over the role of El Mariachi (yes, the original actor was available, which was stupid, but still...). This movie has absolutely no storyline, but so many of the scenes are entertaining and beautifully violent. The part where Bucho's men are cleaning the bar is an excellent example. Add in the most pointless cameo ever(*spoiler*Quentin Tarantino shows up, makes a dumb joke, goes into a crap covered bathroom, and gets shot), and you have one of the best Mindless Action movies to date! And Buschemi rules, and deserves an Oscar.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Rodriguez gets a second take at his El Mariachi character, this time bigger and bolder, with Banderas and Hayek superbly playing out the larger-than-life story of revenge and blood.At the start of the film, El Mariachi is something of a legend, and we get it from Buscemi in so many words. Banderas proceeds to fulfill the legend in his relentless search for Bucho, the man responsible for the death of his woman. Low-key humor (well, low-key except for Tarantino's over-the-top cameo) and several high-impact set pieces set this film apart from all the action movies that take themselves too seriously.And yet the bad guys are pretty forgettable, and there is a lack of memorable dialog, both of which are the life blood of a good action flick. And Rodriquez adds one of the few twists to the story in Mariachi's discovery of the identity of Bucho, yet it is not clearly set up that Mariachi doesn't already know who he is.Still, the film features inventive gunplay, amusing interplay, and two of the most beautiful movie stars who have ever walked the earth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rowdy Guys In Rochester Liked Desperado</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, there was another meeting of the "Violent Movies for Guys Who Like Violent Movies" club Tuesday night. This time the movie was 1995's "Desperado", starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek's abdomen (Seriously, her stomach should have it's own agent). This movie received an enthusiastic thumbs up from all nine of us. With an IMDB rating of only 6.7, this film came in under our normal criteria of 7.0. However, it successfully proved out our hypothesis that "strong bloody violence and a strong sex sequence" trumps a 7.0.Not that the sex sequence was all that strong. It was very nice. It showed two good looking happy people rolling around on a bed naked. But realistically, it wasn't anything you couldn't have seen on NYPD Blue.And again with the "strong" word qualifying the bloody violence. There was a lot of violence, and a lot of blood. But I think for "Strong" bloody violence you need something like "Scarface" where they showed a guy getting cut up with a chain saw, and in the context of the scene, it was completely believable. Desperado bloody violence is more comic book like. This guy must have been walking around inside some sort of futuristic force field. How else could you explain 15 guys shooting at him with machine guns and he manages to take them all out with a couple of hand guns while standing right out in the open. And then there were the scenes that defied gravity. If you got hit with a real bullet it would probably rip a big hole through you, not lift you 10 feet in the air and throw you across the room. But; if it did lift you into the air and throw you across the room, that would be really cool. It would make a great movie, and this was.If your idea of a good time is to get together with a rowdy bunch of guys drinking beer, smoking cigars, and shouting out your own dialog as you watch violent action movies, give "Desperado" a shot.</fullReview>

His arrival is anticipated however, and he finds himself battling for his life against formidable gunslingers, expert knife throwers, and every other type of lowlife henchman who sees him as a threat. The only person he can trust is a local librarian (Hayek) who isn't too keen on violence. Some clever, amusing gags, and relentless, high-energy gunplay make this worth watching, but the film drags and really has no story.

		<fullReview>Contains ***spoilers***, but in my opinion, this movie is not worth the time.O.k. in "El Mariachi" it was cool idea a guitar case full of guns, but here we see a guitar case that contains a guitar that contains guns, but thats not all, we also see Banderas' sidekicks (Campa and Quino, who by the way, one of them is Carlos Gallardo, the original mariachi) that use guitar cases disguising a machine gun and a bazooka!!! I mean c'mon, which takes me to the next question, where did Campa and Quino came from? o.k. el mariachi could have met them between the first movie and this one, but why do this guys carry massive destruction weapons on their guitar cases? And what's with the main plot? Banderas is seeking this guy Bucho to kill him because he is supposed to be Moco's boss (Moco is the man who killed the woman el mariachi loved), but el Mariachi had already taken care of Moco, so where does Bucho fits the picture? but that's not all, it turns that Bucho is el mariachi's brother. It's bad stuff followed by worse.I think Desperado fits in the top ten of bad second parts, and if you were planning on watching this movies to see Salma Hayek nude, think twice or watch it frame by frame.Interesting performances by Tarantino and Buscemi.I loved "El Mariachi" but I think Rodriguez didn't took very well the hollywoodization. He made the movie that gave him a name with $7000, and a few years later we see this terrible big budget movie.But hey, give it a try, the worst thing that could happen is that you hate the movie just as I did, but if you like lots of bullets and lots of bad guys dead you may as well like it, like some of my friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A unique work of violent fiction. ***1/2 (out of four)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Desperado" can really be called one of two things: violent fiction or an interesting twist on western folklores. I vote for the latter. "Desperado" stars Antonio Banderas in the title role as a mythical gunslinger who has come to a small Mexican town to kill the same powerful drug lord who murdered his lover and wounded his hand. The success of "Desperado" lies not within its star-power or highly stylized action scenes, but in its ability to entertain a mass audience. I don't think that this films prequel "El Mariachi" did that, at least not on a large scale. "Desperado" was meant to be a sequel/remake of "El Mariachi" except with a new star and a bigger budget and a lot more blood. The biggest success, I think with this film, is its ability to be watched over and over again without it ever getting boring or loosing any of its flare. That being said, I've watched "Desperado" countless times since I first saw it back in 1996 and has not yet lost any of its potency. Plus it has always been said by many people that the mark of a truly great film lies in its ability to be watched repeatedly without getting boring. The uniqueness of "Desperado" lies within its characters and story. Take for example Steve Buscemi's scene in the beginning before the credits start. He walks into a bar full of several very shady characters and beguiles them with an interesting story of a lone stranger and the guitar case full of guns that he carries. The story frightens the Short Bartender (Cheech Marin, as that is who he is credited as playing) who immediately afterwards goes to see if the story checks out. This is meant to set the tone for the countless, bloody action scenes to follow and also establishes what many of the characters in the film are going to be like. The characters, which is the other half of the films uniqueness, is the best part of the film. Antonio Banderas is picture perfect in the role. He doesn't do a whole lot of acting here as many people have already pointed out. (His guns do most of the acting for him.) But it perfectly suits his character. The "El Mariachi" was meant to be played by an almost emotionless person who was good with a guitar and a pair of hand guns. Salma Hayek who plays Carolina, the bookstore owner and Banderas' love interest, is good here too. Steve Buscemi plays well, himself pretty much and is good as well. Joaquim de Almeida who plays the drug lord, Bucho, is great here too. The most unique character of course, is that of "Pick-up Guy", who is played by none other than Quentin Tarantino himself. He has one really hilarious scene in this movie shortly before meeting a bloody demise. The films action scenes, bloody as they may be, actually come off as being too cartoonish to be truly believable. For those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, just watch them. Take for example, in the scene after Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek have just gotten done making love. He finds himself on the roof with two guys shooting at him. He dives backwards off the roof and onto another one, while still managing to kill one of the shooters, all the while they were standing right in front of him and shooting at him. Or another example would be the shootout in the street between Banderas, his two "guitar" playing buddies, and many of Bucho's henchmen. And another thing, why does it seem that people in the film hardly ever run out of ammo? Strangely enough, the knife-throwing guy is the only person in the movie who doesn't kill people with a gun and is dispatched in probably the only least bloody fashion. Flawless, of course not. The films largest flaw lies within its plot. Since this movie is mostly made up of fast and relentlessly bloody action scenes, there really isn't any time for story. (Though if that was the intention of director Robert Rodriguez or not, I really can't be sure.) This seems largely why some characters come off as being better developed than others. Many of the characters, with the exceptions of Banderas, Hayek, and De Almeida, are only on screen for a maximum time of only ten to fifteen minutes and that's it. (Mostly due to the character being killed off in some very bloody fashion.) I would like to have learned a little more about Steve Buscemi's character, and how he came to be involved with the "El Mariachi" and so on. Get my point?To sum it up, "Desperado" is a unique and wild shoot 'em up that grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best action movies of the 90's, Banderas is ultracool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have noticed that there are lots of IMDb users who are more or less unaware if "Desperado" is actually a remake or a sequel to Robert Rodriguez's excellent low budget debut "El Mariachi". It obviously can be seen as a Hollywood remake too but if I had to make a simple choice I would definitely take a closer look at the storyline to find out that it clearly is a sequel. Mariachi, this time played by Antonio Banderas, comes to town to revenge what they did to him at the end of "El Mariachi". This is a movie that practically just tries to make violence and killing look like cool and sexy and guess what: it does the trick. Antonio Banderas makes perhaps the coolest performance of his career and the acrobatic, ballistic action scenes are simply wonderful.And just take a look at the first scene, the one right before opening credits. Outstanding acting (especially hilarious Steve Buscemi showing once again how gifted he truly is), marvellous dialogue and extravagant action makes it quite likely one of the coolest, funniest and the most unique and stylish beginnings to a movie in the history of action films. "Desperado" isn't quite as good as "El Mariachi", maybe Rodriguez had too much money to spend on it. Weird or not, with another 7000 dollar budget Rodriguez might have really made it work. Still, there's plenty of sensationally good moments like Quentin Tarantino's idiotic joke. I would almost have to say that "Desperado" is as close to a perfection as it possibly can be. It's without any doubts one of the most stylish action films of its decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Call It "El Mariachi 2" is an Insult</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "El Mariachi" shortly before "Desperado." Mariachi is not only a great independent film, but one of the best films of the nineties, easily. Robert Rodriguez showed a great amount of talent as both a Director and a Writer. Desperado, however, played out more like a music video than anything. It starts off with Steve Buscemi telling a story about a killer-mariachi, followed by Antonio Banderas shooting up a bunch of people. If it was supposed to be funny or violent (or both), I'm not sure: it came across as silly, and pointless. Anyone looking for a cool shootout should look elsewhere, such as Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch." As for Banderas' acting, it's not much more than shooting people. Those who do not like him will not start liking him from his performance here. Then comes a part of the film that made me cringe: the ending of "El Mariachi," re-edited to stick Antonio Banderas in Carlos Gallardo's place. Liking Mariachi and Gallardo as much as I do, and equally disliking Antonio Banderas, it was not much longer before I shut it off. I realize that being Robert Rodriguez's films, he can do what he wants. But why Banderas? And how come the scene from Mariachi that was flashbacked did not have the consequence on the mariachi-character that it should have? I think that this was about the point that some guys walked into a bar where Banderas was singing/dancing more like a rock band than a mariachi singer, and if I remember right, he either killed them, or they were hallucinations. Then, some of the other characters that were introduced earlier in the film get killed in a bar/restroom. Within minutes, I turned the vcr off: Desperado had no chance for redemption at this point. It was like a comedy that wasn't funny, a violent action flick that was cheesy and unrealistic, a sequel that was unworthy and illogical, and on top of all of this, a cast that was, for the most part, rank.</fullReview>

All the cast add to the films overall effects, Joaquim de Almeida is a good bad guy if a little over the top, but you love to hate him. There are nice cameos by Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin and Quentin Tarantino which give the film spice. The story can be a little disjointed but it does not matter, the special effects are of usual Robert Rodriguez quality. A great little flick which sequels Rodriguez's El Mariachi.

		<fullReview>This is basically a retread of "El Mariachi" with bigger stars and better stunts. Does this equal a better movie? The short answer is no. To some extent, "El Mariachi" worked because of its subtlety. There is precious little of that quality here. Both films are stylish, but not in the same way. "El Mariachi" felt like something you'd never seen before; "Desperado" feels like an old idea done better. Which one you prefer will depend largely on your taste in films. If you like 'event' movies, go for "Desperado". If your taste leans more toward cult film, check out Mariachi. "Desperado" is still a great movie to watch, but only if you do so for the right reasons. Watch for the amusing cameos, great action sequences and Salma Hayek. Don't expect anything intricate or particularly absorbing, because that territory has been covered by Rodriguez already.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Desperado, in my opinion, is the most incredible action movie of all time. I can't elaborate enough on the masterfully done action sequences.Antonio Banderas stars as El Mariachi, a wandering drifter who carries a guitar case filled with firearms. He is out to seek revenge for the death of his girlfriend by the hands of a mob boss named Bucho(Joaquim de Almedia). He falls in love with Carolina(Salma Hayek). As the movie progresses, the plot gets sketchy, but the scenes are spectacular.The bar scene(the one after the introduction), was in my opinion, the most exhilarating action sequence I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. This scene made my adrenaline pump and compelled me to watch more. Another action scene which was very well done but a little unrealistic, was when El Mariachi and his two friends took on an entire army of enemies.Robert Rodriguez is one of the most talented and artistic directors of our time. I believe that he, along with other directors(Tarantino, Scorsese, Stone) will go down in history as the best directors of our time.</fullReview>

Hard to beat that!!"Desperado" is an actual sequel, with different actors. Antonio Banderas plays the mariachi singer, Salma Hayek beautifully plays his love interest. Steve Buscemi does a great job as the sidekick. Even Queten Tarantino has a part. Also Cheech Marin.Obviously a more-traditional, large-budget film, with crew, with expensive actors, I expected more but didn't get it. Although it is an enjoyable movie, and has lots of really well-done action, I rate it only 7 of 10.Who knows, maybe Robert Rodriguez can only make one type of movie, and maybe he's already done it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rodriguez hits another homerun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This flick rules. With El Mariachi he show that movies coul be made with out millions of dollars, then with Desperado He showed Hollywood that with 7 million dollars he could make his movie look like one of their 70 million dollar movies. When I found out His first film was made with seven grand I was amazed, but when I found out Desperado was made for only 7 million my jaw hit the floor. This movie is fabulous with great stunts and a good story not to mention some great acting from Buscemi, Quetin Tarantino, Cheech Marin, Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, and Tito. Strongly Reccommend this film to anybody who fun and fast movies.</fullReview>

Ah, it must be a stupid HK director who copied everything from Rodriguez.Cool, now some dialogue! ... Yawn.. Hopefully Salma has some nice curves to keep you awake.Otherwise you'll get the same "boom you're dead - hahaha" Tarantino humor (including the man himself *acting* eeeek). It will make you smile at best. Just listen at the music when Tarantino is talking. It says it all.In the end... Empty, pointless, stupid, boring. Rodriguez wanted to break some clichés, but he reinvented new ones. Let's hope he's not already short of "ideas".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably only good for Tarantino's Joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Rodriegez is one of those directors that made one movie and it was so good that he was given money by Hollywood to make more. His first movie, El Mariarchi, is a very low budget movie that I have not yet seen; Desperado is the sequel. The movie is about a man, El Mariarchi, that is little more than a myth. He travels Mexico with a guitar case full of guns looking for a man named Bucho. Bucho murdered his girlfriend and shot him in the hand, and now he wants vengeance.Desperado has little much in the way of a theme except for that of vengeance and its implications. There is a slight twist to the movie, which really means little because it does not really impact the movie that much. The characters are reasonably one dimensional -- El Mariarchi wants vengeance and Bucho does not want to die. These are at the extreme where Bucho has all strangers in the town killed to discover that the Columbian hit-man that was sent to him was one of the victims. El Mariarchi is so obsessed with getting Bucho that he has become a legend and legends attract people who want to defeat them. Everybody distrusts him and he attracts gunfights regularly. Quentin Tarentino appears in this film as a drug courier, and tells a pretty cool joke. I won't repeat it for that will give it away. Cheech Marin (from Cheech and Chong -- and my housemate has never heard of them) plays a bartender. He is not the comic that he was previously, but he does stand out as the bartender. The other interesting thing is the use of guitars. The guitar cases are weapons, carry weapons, drugs, or are simply played. The guitar seems to be a very major focus in this movie, why I cannot say, but really this movie draws little comment. As a movie that Tarentino influenced, it does not seem to show that much depth. The end is interesting, he throws away the guitar case and drives off, and then comes back and says, "we might need this." It seems to suggest that even though he is driving off with the woman, it is not finished.</fullReview>

Now, with bucks in his pocket and a name cast, there is room for excellence. Some may say that the low budget effort is better, and I won't totally disagree from an artistic standpoint, but from an entertainment standpoint, this venture with Antonio Bandaras and Salma Hayek is truly a cut above many other films.The state-of-the-art special effects and polished effort Rodriguez put into this film make for an enjoyable and explosive ride.

Salma Hayek is one of the Sexiest Women in the Planet. She looks ever so Hot in this movie. This is packed with plenty of Action and Humour brilliantly picturised. It has a number of special appearances by Steve Buscemi. Quentin Tarantino is there in one of the funniest scenes of the film. Danny Trejo Looks Rough and tough as the Assassin with the Daggers.

		<shortDescription>Gratuitously violent, with hardly a plot in sight...I loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I go on, please take notice of this disclaimer: DESPERADO IS ONE OF THE MOST VIOLENT FILMS YOU'LL EVERY WATCH! I wasn't counting, but I'm pretty sure (excluding war films, where it is required to have 20 or more people die in a 3-minute sequence) this movie contains one of the biggest body counts in movie history. Basically, every character in the story--excluding the 2 main characters--is required to die. Is all the violence necessary? No. I'm not an activist when it comes to media violence, and how it's supposedly polluting the minds of the youngest children, but if there is one film to blame for such a reason "Desperado" would be it. Yes, the violence is glorified. However, this is an R-rated film, so if you parents choose to take that rating for granted, it's your faults. So as bloody and extreme as the violence is in this movie, it should be up to the parents to use discretion. And--parents aside--anyone who is NOT in the mood to watch an incredibly violent action flick SHOULD NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! If you're in the mood for a romantic or musical comedy, "Desperado" is the last movie you should see. But if not, you may read on...This is definitely an example of style triumphing over substance. The plot is cut-and-dry, with no twists and turns, and is just as intelligent as the plot of a Hong Kong martial arts flick. So if you're in the mood for a good story, do not watch this film. Only watch it if you're in the mood for entertainment. Sean Penn once said, in an interview on "Inside the Actor's Studio," "If you want entertainment, get a bunch of hookers and an 8-ball. Film is too powerful of a medium to be used for entertainment." Though I admire Sean Penn greatly, I have to disagree. This movie is about as shallow as they come, yet I loved it! It's great entertainment! I was blown away, all the way from the opening sequence. By the way, I have to commend Robert Rodriguez for opening the first scene with Steve Buscemi. Steve is one of the coolest actors, and the minute you see him enter the cruddy bar you just want to cheer! That scene, when Steve tells the story about this unknown fellow with a guitar case full of guns, just pulls you in and contains everything you can ask for in an action scene: humor, great upbeat music and spectacular stylized action. I guess all that's missing is scantily clad babes. And Steve and Cheech Marin are perfect in that scene. Steve's comic timing is perfect, with hilarious facial expressions and Cheech's reaction shots are just as funny. I remember a classmate of mine in my Development of Film class showed that particular scene for our final project, and ever since I saw that one scene I was anxious to check out this movie. That one scene should go down in history. I also loved it when Antonio slid those 2 guns out of his sleeve. When they found the guns in his guitar case, I honestly thought he was screwed. But then he pulls that beautiful slight-of-hand. Absolutely spectacular! If you've read my past review of "El Mariachi" I didn't think too much of it. Not bad, and I definitely have to give Rodriguez some credit for putting together a somewhat decent-looking action piece with a miniscule budget, but as a film itself--low-budget or big-budget--it was pretty lame. I don't usually condone it when directors think they can advance greatly in their craft by doubling their budgets with each film they do, but Rodriguez seems to have gotten better, as the budgets got higher (of course, excluding "Spy Kids"). "Desperado" is a hell of a lot more entertaining than "El Mariachi," and much better-looking. You may recognize many of the regulars who appear in most of (if not every) Rodriguez film: Cheech Marin, Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Tito Larriva, etc. Even Robert's buddy Quentin Tarantino has a cameo. But I do have to say, Salma doesn't look as hot in this movie as she does now. She definitely looks better with the straight hair. She looked most hottest in "Fools Rush In." Anyway...As I said before, if you want a wholesome plot that will leave you thinking, skip this movie. Watch "American Beauty" or "Magnolia" or something like that. But if you're just in the mood for mindless entertainment that requires NO thinking whatsoever, sit back and enjoy the show! I'm a film buff, I've seen most of Stanley Kubrick's work, I'm entitled to some mindless entertainment. But if you're on a steady diet of Schwarzenegger and Van Damme...read a book afterwards. My score: 7 (out of 10)P.S.: The soundtrack is spectacular! The songs fit each scene perfectly! It helps to have a director who's also a musician. Rodriguez has a keen ear for music.</fullReview>

Similar story to Mariachi with a few twists (better acting, better stars and lots of more realistic action) including such actors as Antonio Banderas, Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, Quentin Tarantino (his is the best part of the movie) and in her breakthrough performance (another breakthrough for her was her blouse) Salma Hayek, who plays a quiet Mexican librarian.

		<fullReview>I rented "Desperado" after taking the advice of movie reviewers who suggested I check out the prequel, "El Mariachi", first. The first film is a charming comedy / romance set in Mexico. It's quite original and with plenty of action.Desperado is not really a sequel, more a movie "inspired by" El Mariachi. Lots of stuff blows up -- hey, I'm an action movie buff, I like that -- but it's overly violent and nonsensical. I like Antonio Banderas ("Zorro", "Assassins"), but the tone of the original film is entirely lost, and without that there's little to differentiate this film from others. So much hatred and anger in the protagonist is a little off-putting. I like my action films to be light-hearted and flashy, not ugly and grim.Who should see this film:-- nobody, even action film buffs -- skip it &amp; see "El Mariachi"or "Assassins"I started off this film with a great attitude, but also great expectations, and I'm disappointed to give "Desperado" a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid, Mindless Fun... oh, and Salma Hayek is in it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I do a lot of reviews like this: mindless fun movies. It's not that I like bad movies, it's just that these are the most fun to review.Desperado is bad, and it admits so. The dialog is God-awful, the acting is sub-par, the action scenes (while fun) are tremendously stupid and unrealistic, and not to mention the terrible climatic fight scene (two words: Rocket launcher? HA!). So, why do I like this movie? Because it's fun, cool, and stylish.People have called Desperado "Pulp Fiction south of the border". Don't believe that. To compare these to movies is a sacrilege. Pulp is 100% genius. Desperado is 50% genius. Just because it has good music and the Q man makes a cameo doesn't give anyone the right to compare them.It is important to understand that the purpose of the movie is not plot, story, characters, yada yada yada. It's action. I consider Robert Rodriguez to be an immature John Woo.Let's make this simple, I'll list every good point of the movie then every bad point, followed by a conclusion. Simple, eh?Happy Premise Number One: The action. So pal, you think the Matrix is cool, do ya? Well, that doesn't compare... well, wait, maybe it does. Forget that, Desperado has some of the greatest fight sequences around. Happy Premise Number 2: Never have I seen any thing this bad look so good. Robert Rodriguez is a master editor. If any one reading this is in film school, check this movie out. It's an editing school in a box. The cinematography is also great.Happy Premise Number 3: the Testosterone. This is THE ULITIMATE guy movie. You got explosions, guns, Salma Hayek, blood, crazy ass fighting, more guns, Salma Hayek again, Salma Hayek NUDE, more guns, Steve Buscemi, the Q man, some funny jokes, and CHEECH MARTIN! Oh, and even more guns.Happy Premise Number 4: The Style. The angels, the editing, the action, ALL OF IT COMES TOGETHER to form Robert Rodriguez. The man is a genius. Too bad he can't write worth a damn.Happy Premise Number 5: Salma Hayek. Oh, Salma Hayek! Man, I won't tell you guys about it. If you haven't seen this movie, and you're a heterosexual male, just see the movie, and DROOL!Happy Premise Number 6: Though I feel that I might ignite, I probably won't.Whew! On to Depressing Premise Number One: this is the most obvious. This movie is so stupid! Antonio is standing there, with two pistols, taking on a room filled with Mexicans armed with Uzi's, getting shot at like crazy, AND NEVER GETS HIT!!!!!!!!!!!! These must be the dumbest Mexicans ever! This is pathetic. Sure, Uzi's aren't accurate. But a room full of guys should be able to take out ONE MAN!!!!Depressing Premise Number 2: The Penis Gun. What the hell is that about? If you look at it right, IT COULDN'T EVEN WORK! The bullets don't go into the chamber, period. It could only fire once, then you would have to reload it. And how do you aim and work a penis gun anyway? Well, at least they didn't use it. Can't say the same thing for From Dusk Till Dawn, though.Depressing Premise Number 3: the lame writing. I honestly didn't like El Mariachi. But it did have a few things going for it: decent writing. Hell, the plot was so original it won best picture at Sundance. But desperado is so high budget, that Robert decided to forgo the writing in place of the action. In some ways, this is a wise choice. The action is the best part of the movie. But the writing needs work, SERIOUSLY!Depressing Premise Number 4: The ending scene. If you've seen the movie, you know what I mean. The "relationship" thing is so stupid.Depressing Premise Number 5: The climatic "Guitar scene. This requires no explanation. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about, AND YOU COMPLETELY AGREE WITH ME. Ugh, terribly stupid.Depressing Premise Number 6: Antonio Banderas is in it. Women love him, men hate him. Though he actually gives a good performance, he's still Antonio Banderas.Conclusion: Desperado is stupid beyond belief. But it's a classic. My definition of a classic is something that will never die. Desperado is not a good movie, but no one can deny its style... or the sex scene (YES!)5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie ruined by Banderas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts with a cool scene in which Buscemi goes to a bar and talks to the bartender about some guy who is searching for a man named Bucho. His story is presented good and we can enjoy Buscemi's narrating. While Buscemi is narrating we see some of his flashbacks that are also good (mostly because Banderas doesn't have to act too much in them). We also love the reaction of the bartender and the people in the bar. Then there is a scene in which Banderas plays his guitar in his band. Although that is clearly not him singing or playing, this scene still is quite enjoyable. All is well until Banderas starts to act. Well let's face it: He can't act. He is always pushing his hair back and making that (supposed to be sexy) look. I think that he should be a porn star. That's what I think. He can't act to well, he has long black hair. He can't speak English so well and he is, to some people kind of sexy. That is why the sex scene with Salma Hayek is so...good. The scene which I hate the most is the scene where he finds out that Bucho is actually his brother. In this scene an actor should really be able to act. An actor should express a bunch of complex emotions (and Banderas clearly can't do that). But Banderas just gets this strange look and starts walking around like an angry gorilla. This is the scene I hate the most because of Banderas. It is well written and creates a twist in the movie that we first don't know of. But Banderas then ruins everything for us.But there are scenes which I hate because of the writing. The scene in which the three guitar players finally come together again is so tacky!! It looks like a Chuck Norris movie. The way that Banderas slowly walks away from his two companions and is missed by like 40 bullets is just dumb. People tell me that I shouldn't worry and just enjoy the scene. Well I can't enjoy the scene. Oh, and the scene in which Banderas and Salma Hayek slowly walk away from the explosion, holding hands... Is that supposed to be cool or something? And another thing that makes the movie worse is the killing of Buscemi. I felt awful when Buscemi died. He was our bond with us. He is the man that helps us when we are sick of all the (not very intense) shooting. He is the comedy of the film. Him and Quentin Tarrantino (who is also killed). But it's not all that bad. Although I can't stand Banderas I still like he story and the twist. Some of the scenes are very well written. And when I saw this movie I have to admit that I did enjoy it. Probably because the story really is good and most of the actors know what hey are doing. So it is watchable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Rodriguez's lesser efforts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Rodriguez is certainly one of today's most influential directors. While few of his films could be considered masterpieces (the cult classic "El Mariachi" being the possible exception), he has constantly turned out hits and pushed the envelope of digital filming and computer effects. With "Sin City" on it's way to becoming a minor classic, it's interesting to go back and take a look into Rodriguez's first foray into the world of Hollywood: the bullet ridden No-western "Desperado". More of a Hollywood update on his low budget "El Mariachi", "Desperado" stars Antonio Banderas as a revenge-bent vagabond. Carrying a guitar case filled with enough firepower to level a small town (which he ends up doing), he wanders around Mexico, looking for the man who murdered his girlfriend. Upon arrival in a town ruled by a local drug lord, El Mariachi begins a war against the drug cartel. As he is relentlessly hunter by hired thugs he encounters a local named Carolina (the smoldering Salma Hayek in her Hollywood debut) and inevitably finds time to become her lover in between shootouts and jumping out of exploding buildings. When it was released on the scene in 1995, "Desperado" was met with enthusiasm by many fans tired of the bland shoot-'em ups that Hollywood had been pumping out since the 1980's, and it's easy to see why. Rodriguez takes a high style approach to his action scenes that was rarely seen by many Americans at the time. It's easy to see the influence of John Woo in the shootouts, as Banderas takes on armed goons with double pistols and a ton of attitude. While choreography is inventive and at times exhilarating the action of "Desperado" has since been outclassed by other films, not to mention John Woo's Hong Kong efforts. By no means bad and still fun to watch for the first time, but it all seems a bit slow by today's standards. And when you take away the action, your of course left with the plot and acting. The revenge story is hardly original and the movie does little to vary the formula, but it's reasonably well done with an interesting twist towards the end. The acting is just about what you'd want from a film like this. Banderas screams bad ass with his getup and arsenal, and emits a dark, brooding charisma. Before she proved herself as a serious actress, Hayek's fame came from her looks, and it's certainly easy to see why. She's simply gorgeous and exudes sex in the film, and her chemistry with Banderas is immediately apparent. So when you add up the unoriginal story, solid characters and stylish (though dated) gunfighting your left with an average action piece. Some will be drawn into Bandera's Mariachi and Rodriguez's maverick directing, but ultimately it's nothing to get excited about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It cost 1,000 times more than 'El Mariachi', but it's only half as good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Desperado' despite still being quite low budget by Hollywood standards cost 1,000 times MORE than the original 'El Mariachi'! The big question is - is it 1,000 times better? Of course it isn't. It isn't even half as good. The main problem is that it comes across as more of a remake than a sequel, and a redundant remake at that. The best thing about it is the casting of Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek who are make a great couple, are sexy as hell, and show some genuine on screen chemistry. Banderas has made lots of dodgy English language movies , but he's very good in this, and does his own stunts and guitar playing. Hayek, who had previously worked with Robert Rodriguez on his little seen TV movie 'Roadracers', looks stunning. The rest of the cast includes several familiar faces like Steve Buscemi, Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino and Danny Trejo. Buscemi is the best of them but sadly doesn't get enough on screen time due to budgetary constraints. Tarantino's cameo is pretty pointless, and nowhere near as funny as one imagines he thinks it is. Interestingly he has done his most convincing acting work to date in another Rodriguez movie, "From Dusk Till Dawn" as the psychopathic robber Richard Gecko. Despite some flaws, 'Desperado' is still worth watching if you don't expect much. As far as dumb action movies go it's one of the best ones around. But I can't help but be disappointed after the knockout 'El Mariachi', a much more original and entertaining movie, and one which I recommend highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From director Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn, Sin City), it almost seems like a modern western, in American Italy. It starts with Buscemi (Steve Buscemi) telling a story about a guitar player killer that he saw, and most people have heard this before as a legend/ myth. But he is real, and soon enough trouble brews as El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) searches for his "girl's" killer, Bucho (Joaquim De Almeida). This is pretty much the main plot, the great moments of the film come from Bandares and his gun filled guitar case. I have not seen Bandares this good since The Mask of Zorro. Also starring Salma Hayek (who shows her breasts, very briefly) as Carolina, Cheech Marin as Short Bartender, Carlos Gómez as Right Hand and with no involvement besides acting, Quentin Tarantino as Pick-Up Guy. Banderas and Hayek returned in the 2003 sequel, Once Upon a Time in Mexico. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun - nothing else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a cast consisting of Quentin Tarantino, Cheech Marin, Steve Buscemi et al it seems like DESPERADO is the Q.T. Generation Get-Together - Rodriguez would direct Q.T. again next year in the cult "classic" FROM DUSK TILL DAWN and they'd be joined again by Salma Hayek...et al...the list goes on. Rodriguez uses a lot of the same players in his movies and I'd be willing to give DESPERADO more praise if he had actually refrained from giving Tarantino fourth billing considering his appearance is really just a cameo, and anyone who doesn't recognize him probably hasn't been watching any TV or movies over the past decade.The movie itself is pretty good fun - a sequel to EL MARIACHI with Antonio Banderas taking over the role of "El" the killing mariachi singer. The movie is never quite as clever or great as it could be but it is a good deal of fun in a sort of wink-wink way - you can tell it's just a big guilty pleasure for the cast and all involved are having fun...that would carry over into DAWN and again into the third installment of the Mariachi trilogy, ONCE UPON A TIME IN Mexico, which is (in my opinion) an even better action movie than this - which drags a bit towards the middle.No PULP FICTION or GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY, but still a decent amount of spaghetti-western-style fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Salma. You`re So Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely violent film with some absolutely ridiculous acts of violence in it . It`s also an extremely silly film too with Quentin Taratino camping it up in a cameo . If it wasn`t for a saving grace I would have hated it , hated , hated , hated it The saving grace ? Salma Hayek - She is sooooooooo beautiful , and there`s a sex scene with Salma and Antonio Banderas . I was going to say Banderas must have been the luckiest man alive to appear in that scene but he`s got my sympathy , after appearing in a sex scene with Salma Hayek the rest of his life must have been an anti-climax . Oh hold on he`s appearing in DESPERADO 2 with Salma ! Will there be a sex scene in the sequel ? No one deserves to be that fortunate in lifeDid I mention Salma Hayek`s the only reason I watched DESPERADO ?</fullReview>
