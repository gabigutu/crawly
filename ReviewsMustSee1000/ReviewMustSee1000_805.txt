		<shortDescription>The film Lynch has been working towards all his career</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this film at the New York Film Festival followed by a Q &amp; A session with David Lynch, Laura Dern, and Justin Theroux. I will try my best to recount my thoughts while they are fresh, and incorporate what the film maker and actors had to say. "I can't tell if it's yesterday or tomorrow and it's a real mind f---" This single quote from Laura Dern sums the movie up fairly well. It is also one of the self- referential moments of the film that explores the audiences very thoughts while providing some comic relief. Lynch's new film, INLAND EMPIRE, is similar to his other work, but unlike anything he's ever done, or I've ever seen before. As one reviewer aptly put it, it is a double reference to Hollywood and the inner workings of the human brain. Before I discuss the substance of the film I will briefly review the technical aspects. First of all, the movie is not unwatchable (because of clarity purposes) as some critics had said, although I did see it at the Lincoln Center which has a beautiful theater and top quality facilities. The digital camera works well for this film. It lose some of the cinematic flourish of film, but also brings a more realistic, gritty feel to it that is appropriate for the theme. The lighting and production were top quality as usual for a Lynch film and the score sets every scene brilliantly. Often times we can't tell if the sound is diegetic or non-diegetic, but it makes no difference. Lynch said that he used the digital camera to give him freedom. You can see much more movement in this film than his others, giving an almost voyeuristic feel. He also uses many close shots, and as always, obscure framing allowing ambiguity and confusion. Lynch really explores the freedom of movement and editing that is available with digital, and you can feel his energy and zest in the new medium. The moments of suspense and terror are so well done - there are several scenes that will literally make you jump - that I found a Hitcockian brilliance of using subtlety, indirectness, and sound to convey emotion rather than expensive special effects. Of course, there are other scenes that would qualify as downright freaky.The movie is completely carried by Laura Dern, and not because she is in 90-95% of the scenes. Her character(s) morph and change so often in identity and time that it is hard to believe it is her in every role. Her range and ability to work consistently over so many years and under the conditions of this film is mind blowing. It is one of the finest performances I've seen by an actress or actor. The film itself is hard to summarize. Most of you know the basic plot, but this really means nothing about the film. It has no type of linear story line and the converging and diverging plot lines are connected by only the most simple threads, time, location, memory ("Do I look familiar? Have you seen me before?") identity, and people who are good with animals. It would be a disservice to this film to try to find meaning or symbolism as I see some people already are. It is not a mystery to be solved, as Mulholland Dr. was (though that film never will be solved either). It is a movie that plays off of ideas, color, mood, it presents intangible emotions that we feel and internalize rather than think about and solve. Film doesn't need a solution to make sense, but it is typical for us to want solve things, to have closure. This film is better if you just let it wash over you and surrender the urge to find meaning.The three hour running time makes no difference because the movie moves in and out of itself with no regard for time. Using so many scenes allows time to effect the viewer much as the characters themselves. As the characters question time and reality, the audience does too. As the scenes slowly build up, giving us reference, we start to wonder where we saw that character, who said that line before, what location fits into what part of the sequence and how, leading up to the Laura Dern quote I used before. It doesn't ask us to think, but to feel, and it does this better than any film I've seen. It plays on our emotions with intense sound and cinematography, grasping fragments from dreams, sliding in and out of reality, exploring nightmares, and asking us what time and reality really are. The film is also very self-conscious as I said before, and also makes many subtle (and not so) pokes at the audience. It also has some truly surreal moments of Lynch humor. Explaining all this doesn't really matter because you will have to see it and take your own idea from it. I would recommend that you see it in a theater though, as it could never have the same impact anywhere else. I was skeptical going into this movie after what I had read, thinking Lynch had gone off the deep end. However, I realized nothing you read about it will make a difference once you see it, and that Lynch is in better form than ever. Ebert said that Mulholland Dr. was the one experiment where Lynch didn't break the test-tube. With INLAND EMPIRE he throws the lab equipment out the window. His freedom in making this movie, both with medium and artistic control, is unparalleled in anything he's done. He finally made a movie for himself and his vision, without any kind of apology or pretense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw INLAND EMPIRE at the Venice Film Festival world premiere last month. I want to keep this review short due to the fact that writing in great detail about this film is useless. INLAND EMPIRE is an experience. An experience not to be written about but to be FELT. It is David Lynch's definitive work. It's everything he has ever wanted to put into a film and it's completely free from anyone else's taming influence. The film is suffocating, dark and endless yet paradoxically contains some of the director's funniest and lightest scenes. I was frightened, uneasy, overwhelmed and moved. My emotions were thrown into disarray several times during which I lost all sense of appropriate reaction. Do not expect the mystery of this film to be solved, but expect it to be finished. Do not expect your head to understand the resolution but expect that your heart and intuition will.If you cannot decide whether to see this film or not, I implore you to get up and go. Whether or not you enjoy it, you will never see a film like this again. I also implore you to see it IN THE CINEMA. Do not wait to see it on DVD because the experience won't be half as extraordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much can be said about David Lynch but I think the mistake most people make is to think that he is trying to create a coherent and straight forward narrative structure. He is working on a subconscious level in his mind. The idea comes before the reason behind the idea. In many ways this is how art should be created because any other way will feel forced and pretentious.David Lynch is not just trying to f*k with you. Its not meaningless and its not pretentious. If you've ever seen his interviews he is one of the most humble and soft spoken directors I've ever seen. Justin Theroux did a Q &amp; A after my screening of Inland Empire and he described working with lynch as light hearted and fun. The complete opposite of what its like to watch some of his films which are often dark, terrifying, and disturbing.Inland Empire is a sister film to Mulholland Dr. As my wife put it, "Watching Mulholland Dr. helped me to understand Inland Empire." They are two sides of the same coin. Lynch still seems to want to take a stab at the evils of Hollywood. His concern for the well being of actors is strong but this time instead of a new comer (Naomi Watts) he deals with one older actresses come back role and like Mulholland Dr. their are the evil producers behind the scenes and even the added possibility of a cursed set.I am a huge Lynch fan. I don't find his films hard to understand. I am not a very intellectual person but Lynch's themes are so simple. The visuals are to be enjoyed on their own terms especially when they seem not to fit with the rest of the film. A lot of lynch's trademarks return, the dual personalities, time folding in on itself, gratuitous nudity, and another tragic murder mystery.While this film does feel like a retread of Mulholland Dr. it also stands on its own especially since it contains a much more upbeat ending and perhaps four layers of storytelling,good luck figuring out which is which. He also continues to experiment with sound and even sings the vocals to a song in the film.I got exactly what I wanted from Inland Empire. The downside to this is that Lynch is sort of repeating himself and I hope that doesn't mean he's out of ideas or perhaps Mulholland Dr. did not yet exercise his disdain for the studio system. The film is part murder mystery and part lucid dream. It has dream logic and has a lot of fun with some of its bizarre dialog and incredible visuals. This film also has much in common with Eraserhead in that he's completely free to explore his ideas. No one is telling him to shorten the film, cut out scenes, or that it doesn't make sense. Its uncompromising and truly art without boundaries.My only other criticism is that the digital video is just ugly at times. When the shot is static the amount of detail in the picture can be incredible but when its hand held and moving around its grainy and looks pretty terrible. I miss the polished look of his older films but I guess that is going to be another thing that sets this movie apart from the others. I highly recommend this film to the Lynch enthusiast and to no one else. If you aren't in on the joke then I cannot imagine you leaving the theater happy after three hours of pure, free from concentrate, unpasteurized lynch. I went to see this with my wife and my best friend needless to say only I loved it. Take that as you will.4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nightmare to remember: Lynch back on the edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire: it means Los Angeles, the place of Lynch's inspiration, but also the inward realm of the mind and of dreams, the surreal world of Lynch's imagination that uniquely inspires his visual poems. This new work, three hours long but unified by a savage and harrowing performance by Laura Dern channeling three or four or more overlapping personalities growing out of a lengthy free-standing monologue that was the film's starting point, is proof that the man isn't playing; hasn't lost his touch; still produces work unlike any other, work to be treasured.DL explores a universe reachable only by going past the rational mind. It is a realm where a character, in the present case particularly the characters played by Dern (the press cliché is 'career-defining performance'), turns into other characters and turns again. It's a realm where there's another world behind the sound stage and that other world is another life, another identity, another set of terrors. And we go there; we come back; and we go there again.After becoming the desperate monologist, Dern also became "Nikki," a movie star chosen with "Devon" (Justin Theroux) to star in a film, 'On High in Blue Tomorrows', directed by "Kingsley" (Jeremy Irons). And "Kingsley" works with "Freddie" (Harry Dean Stanton) a co-director who cadges money from stagehands and actors and apologizes saying, "I used to carry my own weight." On High in Blue Tomorrows turns out to be a remake of a doomed film, '4/7', never finished because both stars were murdered, and based on a Polish gypsy folktale. In the film Nikki, as "Sue," is cheating on her husband, and during the shoot Nikki's "real life"husband warns her not to do it for real. But of course she does: the film relationship parallels "real life," and the stars find they're confusing themselves with their film characters, just as it happens in Michele Piccioni's recent film, La vita che vorrei.That expletive-strewn 14-page ("single-spaced") ur-monologue that anchors the film was shot in the back of DL's house with a Sony PD-150 digital video camera he'd started to use in connection with his website, www.davidlynch.com, "a common midrange model" that sells now for $2,724. The monologue became the ground of being and the Sony became the simple visual tool that gave 'Inland Empire' its content and its visual style. Lynch has switched to DV for good, saying a sad farewell to the glorious beauties and cumbersome complexities of celluloid, and for this film embraced DV's limitations. He does not try to make it look like film. DL admits people say the quality is "not so good." "but it's a different quality. It reminds me," he says, "of early 35- millimeter film. You see different things. It talks to you differently" (NYTimes, Dennis Lim).This reversion, if you will, to a cruder visual medium (but one that's in many ways more fluid, both for the actors ? who can work through without pauses ? and the editor ? who has handy software ? and the crew ? who can be fewer, and work lighter), has stirred up the director's creative juices, brought him back in a way to the raw energies and immediacy of Eraserhead. Thus it's a return to youthful beginnings and yet something completely new. It's burning the bridges and rediscovering roots at the same time., which basically is what any artist to stay alive needs to do.Dern anchors the film, but it has many elements that need anchoring. There is the disreputable husband of the disreputable monologist, who joins a Baltic circus.There's a woman played by Julia Ormond, who's first seen in a sleazy backyard with a screwdriver in her stomach, and later reappears as Billy's wife. And there's a Polish thread ? which grew out of Baltic connections DL has forged and in the structure of ideas may trace back to the origins of the film of Devon and Sue (be the ur-'4/7'). There's a weeping Polish prostitute, watching a TV monitor on which appears a sitcom shot on a stage with people wearing rabbit heads; a laugh track creates a disquieting effect because the laughs come at "meaningless" points, giving the lines a sinister ring. Later the screen shows Sue. Slant magazine's Ed Gonzales smartly refers to the monitor as one of various "portals" through which characters merge into other worlds (go through the looking-glass; fall through rabbit-holes). Clearly it's all in the editing, and those who feel DL's creations are chaotic and portentously meaningless overlook his canny sense of structure.There's a group of pretty prostitutes in a motel room, who talk to Laura Dern's character and sing and dance, "Do the Locomotion," and then at the end lipsynch Nina Simone's "Sinner Man" behind the closing credits -- one of the great closing credits of recent decades, a rollicking, gorgeous episode, which cheers you up but still contains flashes (Laura's face) that haunt you with memories of the strangeness and terror that's passed.These are some of the interlocking boxes of 'Inland Empire'. DL mocks the idea of the "real" while using the concept to slide in between worlds.All this is gloriously cinematic.The film "technically" has no US distributor, though it has many European ones and the French Studio Canal signed on early at the stage when DL said he was using DV and didn't know what he was doing.The whole of 'Inland Empire' perhaps "resembles the cosmic free fall of the mind-warping final act in Mulholland Drive" (Lim), but on the other hand it has someone to "identify" with (if you can stand the ride) in Laura Dern, who dominates the film and threads it together. Her full-ranged performance is sure to gain much mention at year's end.After fifteen years of disappointment with and doubt about DL, it is possible to love his work again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's Best Film, Hardest to Watch, Yet Most Rewarding... A Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire is the Man with a Movie Camera of the 21st Century. It is the most experimental, surreal, and technically brilliant film I may have ever seen. Lynch proves that all he needs is a simple DV camera to show the world the entire range of human emotions and the human experience from the happiest to the darkest moments we must go through to achieve salvation and cleansing of the soul. This film is not so much about a particular story or narrative as it is about analyzing, exploring, and creating a visual palette for ideas about traveling to and from the past, present, and future as it relates to our constant journey back and forth into our own psyches and our collective unconscious. Each of Lynch's films explores the mind in terms of Jungian philosophy, focusing particularly on The Shadow; however, Inland Empire goes further in this direction than any film previous to it. If Mulholland Drive was 25% a dark and surreal suspense thriller ghost story and journey into the nether regions of the mind and 75% classical, yet not necessarily structural or connected narrative, Inland Empire is 10% straight narrative and 90% raw psychological horror ghost story.The journey is long and hard but at the end you will be rewarded with the kind of peace and serenity that can only come from a meditation this long, deep, and powerful. I was filled with only inner bliss as I left the theatre and slept like a baby, completely at peace. This is David Lynch's most powerful film and speaks volumes on the many unexplored topics of how this medium can communicate, terrify, and heal in ways we have not yet even begun to understand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this during a period of extreme emotional stress, probably the best possible mode. It was also surrounded by my listening to "Big Fish," Lynch's book, read by himself. The contrast is astonishing: Lynch's banal aphorisms in the book with rich, multilayered cinematic literacy in the film. Yet another lesson in relative articulation and the notion that an artist often is the worst authority on himself.Let's have no mistake: this film is important. I place it on my list as one of the two films of 2006 that you must see.There's a lot to say about this. I think I'll let others comment on Dern's attunements, and the general notion of the story having to do with guilt and sexual desire.I'll comment only on two aspects which struck me. The first was how Polish this movie is. Its Polish within the story of course: a good half of the action involves Poles. The plot device is a Polish curse that somehow bends time and causality. And there are some Polish locations as well.But the thing is shot using Kieslowski's mannerisms. Its a peculiar style that to my knowledge no one else has used. It focuses on two motions: that of the environment as space which governs and changes. And that of the characters in motion, but situated in the spaces. With Kieslowski, he literally splits these in the writer's mind by having his writing partner handle the noir bits, the controlling fate, and he handling the independently sprouting human seeds within. Lynch handles both sides by imposing schizophrenia.But its Polish in other ways too. The actor as Golem. The environment as interleaved worlds, each creating the others by being. Its a Kabbalistic concept. Both are characteristically Polish, usually associated with Polish Jews, but more deeply Polish. You can see how Lynch understands this because he quotes "The Saragossa Manuscript," a Polish film about interweaving of kabbalistic worlds and the causal confusion that it brings.The second thing is how he exploits this merger of folded narrative -- where actors write new worlds; layered emanations where worlds spawn others -- not parallel but linked in generative fate; geometric cosmology in which each act creates symmetries we encounter elsewhere.He does all this by elaborating on the symmetries of cause. Ordinarily something causes something else, never backwards. Here it IS backwards, forwards, sideways -- all the eight dimensions that an advanced student of the Maharishi knows... causal symmetries that have a geometry that doesn't quite merge with the geometry of causality. Oddly, the story does make sense if you simply relax the causality a bit -- its much more accessible than the "Twin Peaks" meander.I guess I should say that this is after the manner of the structure of "Finnegans Wake." Its not as elaborate of course. It didn't take 17 years and the deliberate intent of conflating all metaphors. But it is placed in a dream logic, a softening of the walls and hinges of what we make up as the logic of real life. Its Joycean through and through and not -- as some would say -- "surreal" as if anything not real is bent reality.I know of a few filmmakers who can work with these notions: Medem, Greenaway, Madden, Ruiz. This is the most delicate and focused I've seen in a long, long while. You really must spend time with it. You must.Here's a serious piece of advice though. See Lynch's "Rabbits" episodes first, separately, ideally a week or so ahead. Take them in as a standalone piece, a remarkable piece of film. Some of it is in this film, excerpted, extended, reshot and literally entered by all the Dern characters. But you'd be better having that anchor before starting this tempestvoyage.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw INLAND EMPIRE at the Venice Film Festival and I think it's incredible... surely the most strange Lynch's film. A terrible nightmare of about 3 hours! I love Lynch's films and I think that INLAND EMPIRE resumes his whole filmography! And I want to underline also the interpretation of Laura Dern. She's absolutely fantastic! You can't pretend to understand completely the story (it's more confused than Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive...) but you'll be captured by the sounds, the lights, the changes of rhythm... David has written the screenplay day by day and also the actors couldn't understand what they were doing... I think you should see this wonderful film of one of the best contemporary director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lynch, the visionary director who created unforgettable films revealing darker realms of life such as "Elephant Man" and "Blue Velvet" and who brought to mainstream TV a deeper aesthetic and consciousness with the "Twin Peaks" series, unfortunately went overboard with "Inland Empire" writing and directing the worst film of his career."Inland Empire" is arguably Lynch's most ambitious effort: a meandering three-hour dive into a nightmarish dream world where all his previous themes and obsessions convey. There are enslaved women (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks), women in trouble (Mulholland Drive), supernatural entities in other realms (Twin Peaks, Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive), dissociative fugues and alternative realities (Lost Highway, Mulholland Drive). As expected of a Lynch movie, the cast is top notch starting with Laura Dern and it even includes Jeremy Irons as a movie director. But the direction and the script fail to give us something of depth or a remotely compelling, entertaining story, therefore this Lynchean nightmare becomes endless, pointless, and ultimately boring. Each shot of dreary,dilapidated Polish buildings or empty and dark Hollywood sets become endless. Every time the character are hurting or menacing, the camera does a close-up distorting their faces or they behave histrionically as in the worst of the Mexican telenovelas. This is simply poor direction. These close-ups and long shots, among other cinematic pyrotechnics, are Lynch's filler to disguise the emptiness of "Inland Empire," Although both films are similar in plot and style, "Inland Empire" suffers compared to "Mulholland Drive." Lynch deserved the Oscar for that brilliant film which is memorable for its character development along a dark psychic ride, elements that are missing in "Inland Empire" replaced by a cheap thrills posing for art and profundity.The plot is vintage Lynch, but it is the most convoluted, longest, and silliest of them all. Lost Girl, an enslaved woman in Polish hotel/purgatory watches shows on a psychic TV: a sitcom with supernatural rabbit people, scenes from a Polish film that never got finished because the leading actors were murdered, and the life of an American actress who starts in the remake of the Polish film. Nikki (Laura Dern), the actress, begins an affair with her leading man and freaks out entering an alternative reality becoming Sue, the white trash character she is playing in the movie. Sue is having an extramarital affair with Billy, a rich man, and lives with Smithy in the house of the movie set. Sue is psychically connected to enslaved prostitutes who teletransport themselves from the snowy streets of Poland in the 1940s to present day Hollywood Boulevard. The prostitutes talk about men, love, and T&amp;A and suddenly burst into dance for no reason - they do a killer number with "The Loco-Motion" which is unfortunately too short. Sue's husband, Smithy, who is Polish, leaves for Poland to work with a circus. Sue goes to see Billy and Billy's wife beats her. Sue becomes a whore working Hollywood Boulevard with the dance-loving, space/time-jumping whores. The Phantom, an evil supernatural man who has Lost Girl enslaved in purgatory, kills an early incarnation of Smithy who was Lost Girl's lover. The Phantom hypnotizes Billy's wife who is the reincarnation of a Polish woman who was stabbed to death with a screwdriver by the original actress in the Polish movie. The rabbit people are also wise, older Polish men and have a séance with Lost Girl and they bring Smithy to talk to Lost Girl. The old men give a gun to Smithy to kill the Phantom. Sue gets stabbed with a screwdriver on Hollywood Blvd. by Billy's wife and dies. That is the end of the movie and it is a wrap. Nikki is congratulated by the director but she ignores everybody and walks away from the movie set remaining as Sue. She goes to the house where she finds the gun Smithy was given by the old men. She goes through some dark corridors and finds herself in the Polish hotel/purgatory where the Phantom is and as she shoots him his face becomes Sue's own distorted face. The Phantom dies and all the women are free and Lost Girl reunites with Smithy and her son. Then Nikki is back in her home and all the women have a big a party and some women shake their booties to a Nina Simone song. They are in a kind of good place, not purgatory. It is not clear whether Nikki/Sue was an invention of Lost Girl who had been the real murderer and was in purgatory or whatever; in the final analysis, it does not matter because the movie is empty and lacks any redemptive qualities.It is hard to understand why some of the critics and audience fail to realize that this is a very bad film, poorly written and badly directed. Lynch is a true artist and has done some remarkable films for which he should be praised, alas, "Inland Empire" is a disjointed, tedious, nonsense mess filled with pretentiousness. If you want to waste three hours of your life with a superficial mind-tease filled with pseudo transpersonal psychology and collective unconscious references, see it at your own risk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well..... here goes....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie this past Monday morning at the NYFF (New York Film Festival but I'm sure you probably knew that already) and I have to tell you, I'm at a loss at how to even begin writing this review. I gave it a little time to sink in and I'll just try my best to give you something.For one, as you probably already know, the movie is three hours long. It's one of those three hour movies where you really start to feel it about an hour and a half in. Now, I'm all for a movie of that length and sometimes even longer than that but really now, this movie should get cut down at least by a half hour. It's something that Lynch should consider but it doesn't sound like it's going to happen at the time of this writing. I don't mind watching a film where the director refuses to hold my hand and lets me work the details out for myself but watching this and trying to make any sense of it at all was like walking around in a dark forest with a blindfold on. After three hours of watching something like this, it does get tedious I'm sorry to say.I read a review somewhere describing the film as "impenetrable". I can't think of a better word to describe it myself. If you were to ask me what this movie was about, I really wouldn't be able to tell you. Now, that's to be expected from a Lynch movie usually but this movie is probably the most abstract thing he's done, Eraserhead notwithstanding. The movie seems to be more about the feeling itself you get from watching it, rather than having any kind of real story to speak of. This feels very experimental, especially considering the fact that it was shot on DV.I personally hope that Lynch doesn't give up on film completely because I think that while DV proved as an interesting choice in making this film, I think that very few people can give you beauty on film like Lynch does.The movie is loaded with those signature Lynch moments of menace that seem to treasure slowly approaching the corners of long hallways where something horrible may be waiting. Lots of tense, dark scenes with eerie music that suddenly becomes an assault on the senses. If you think of the diner scene near the beginning of Mulholland Drive, you'll know what I'm getting at. Now that I think about it, the film reminded me of Mulholland Drive in that it seemed to have it in for the falsity of Hollywood at times. I got that out of it, at least.The acting was superb. Laura Dern plays what feels like four or five different roles and her range is simply astounding. I've grown to appreciate Justin Theroux over the years and his character in this film is somewhat similar to the one he played in Mulholland, the cocky ladies man type but I really liked him in this. Also, this movie contains many of Lynch's old cast members and it was always fun to see who would pop out next.What I really liked about the film was the soundtrack. It's full of Angelo Badalamenti's dark work and there's a couple of great songs in there as well. I downloaded Beck's "Black Tambourine" after hearing it played in the film. I will definitely pick up the soundtrack for this one if it is ever released.There were surreal, beautiful moments that I should at least mention. There was a scene near the end involving a lighter that was really moving for some reason. There was also a kind of spiral, time warp, loop thing similar to when Bill Pullman answered himself on his house intercom (in Lost Highway). You'll see what I mean when you watch the film but it was definitely one of the better moments.I love David Lynch, I love just about everything he's done but in all honesty, this isn't a movie I'm necessarily dying to see again. I really want to tell you that I loved the film but I honestly can't. I do appreciate the effort. This is a film unlike anything I've ever seen before, that much can be said. It's just as weird as anything else he's done and if you're looking for a good dose of Lynchian madness, believe me when I say that you don't need to look any further. There are many of those strange moments where characters say strange things or act strange in general and wouldn't you know it, even a musical number or two sneaks its way in. I appreciate the man and I appreciate the fact that he makes daring, original work. But this was borderline frustration.I guess all I can say is that I liked a lot of it but at the same time, I really felt like I was wading through mental molasses trying to grasp what unfolded before me. There really is no sense in trying to make sense of this film but there's obviously some sort of story or message that Lynch is trying to get across that I couldn't get to and I think that's why I'm slightly put off. I didn't mind letting it engulf me in its strange universe but I think the length of it made it a little tough to appreciate fully.I didn't even mention the family of bunny rabbits. Or the random visits to Poland. Or the Locomotion dance number. Or the screwdrivers.

		<shortDescription>One of the few films to actually scare me - a wild, beautiful trip</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the NY premier of Inland Empire, and it was so refreshing to once again be transported in a way only David Lynch can transport somebody. Inland Empire is Lynch at his best - funny, thoughtful, eerie, beautiful, dark, deeply disturbing, and terrifying in a way that few horror films have ever affected me. The film is a slow burn, taking its time (about 3 hours), leaping through realities and bizarre encounters, continually keeping the audience asking themselves what reality they are experiencing, and what that reality means.Laura Dern gives an outstanding performance as the tagline's "girl in trouble." She goes to places I don't ever remember seeing her go, from the naive to the terrifying, truly exposed. I've heard Lynch is campaigning for an Oscar nod for Ms. Dern, so maybe this is the one. She really blew me away.This film - like all of Lynch's endeavors - is certainly not for everyone. It's vague, bizarre, jumps all over the place, and at times is deeply frightening (one of the few films in a long time to actually give me nightmares), but in my opinion it's also truly beautiful, almost serene. If you like a linear, clear-cut story, then don't see this film. If you appreciate non-linear, surreal drama/horror, however, then by all means go see it. Lynch is independently producing this, so I know he's banking on a lot of word of mouth for Inland Empire to be successful. Help him out. It's a fantastic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Art (Not really possible to write a spoiler, but there is an interpretation here)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lynch has very high artistic integrity. Lynch will never tell us what any of his films are about - if indeed he knows or would ever admit that a film might be about something in particular. There can be no evaluation of any specific interpretive approach. There must be such an approach, whether conscious or not. Lynch would likely disagree. He's right - and some of the disappointed reviews expressed here by his fans are nice examples of why this is so. I am sure he would also understand and agree with my rebuttal - "Who cares, it's fun" When fans either gush about the brilliance of a piece of work or resort to name-calling ("pretentious hipsters??"), the film is, like most works of art, not going to allow much of a middle-ground. A lot of smart and well-written reviews here on IMDb treat the technical aspects of the film. This review is not about HOW the film was done, but rather WHAT the film does. If you haven't seen the film, try this review on. If it doesn't fit, then I can't recommend seeing Inland Empire. If you do keep reading, get it into your head that there is no spoiler here, really. The interpretation offered below is not even an opinion -it is simply a facile, creative construct I use heuristically for talking about the film after my first viewing.If you have seen this film, you will probably view the interpretation below as too simplistic - that is, if you got it. That's fine. I do not care, but feel free to send me a note if you want to discuss it. Keep in mind - as I stated above - I am simply using this interpretation as a means for discussion. Don't take it too seriously, I really don't care to defend this. Laura Dern should win two academy awards for Inland Empire - for Best Actress as Nikki and for best supporting actress as Nikki's role of a lifetime - Susan. But she won't get nominated because this film will be systematically ignored by the mainstream. Why bring up acting talent so early in the review? Because this inherently non-linear film (though it is more linear and plot driven than Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway) offers one of many possible (possibly an infinite number of) linear interpretations - the film is/could be about acting and losing one's identity in a role. It could all be going on in Dern/Nikki/Susan's head as she comes to grips with what she is doing in the three levels of "reality" portrayed. If this particular interpretation were chosen, the free association between the roles played by the Polish actress/victim/perpetrator of the film "47" and that played by Dern's actress/victim/perpetrator in "Blue Skies" create a meta-text which, though unseen and unexplicated throughout the film, nevertheless identifies its subject as the disassociation and power of performance and creativity in the production of fiction/reality/drama. This interpretation is suggested by all of the many seemingly out of place and jarring details in the film - the usual red herrings Lynch throws at us to suggest that there may be some linear subtext in all of the sensual experience offered by his sumptuous, immersive films. - scenes from the Polish film - reenactment of the film by Susan - possibly in her dreams or fantasies- The placement of the Polish actress into a couple seemingly disparate and unconnected roles (which, in fact make the creation of "Blue Skies" and the folklore surrounding its predecessor "47" unite at a different interpretative level) -The rabbit people performing within the television with an incoherent but suggestive script and an absurd laugh track - and especially their audience (key to this interpretation because of its chronological placement in the narrative and the identity of the viewer). -Nikki's opening and closing scenes and Grace Zabriskie's foreshadow which identify closure for the meta-plot. - The seemingly anachronistic white noise and record-cutting scenes and sound-cues, which occur at crucial transitions between the alternative realities inhabited by Nikki's disassociated personalities.If any of you find this interpretation compelling and would like to hear more about it, feel free to send a note. It is, in my opinion, just as worthless as any other interpretation of art - probably better left unexpressed and unexplained. But if having something linear to talk about helps you, you are welcome to further pursue it. Do not mistake this interpretation as an opinion. I have no opinion concerning the plot of this film. For my part, I completely understand the film through and/or without the interpretation above. Which pathway to the palace (is it Alan Smithee's House on the set?) I might chose, whether through the back alley or the front entrance to the studio (as the interpretation above offers) - I get it - just as I always "get" Lynch more than most directors. For fellow admirers of Lynch: IMO, This is a more coherent film than Eraserhead, a more upbeat and enjoyable film than Lost Highway, a less commercial film than Mulholland Drive (though it does bear some thematic resemblances largely because both films are overt self-referential interpretations of American media culture). You might talk about it for hours afterward, but this discussion will mostly only help you to know the people you attended it with better. Let it pour through your mind and soul. No profitable comparison to Lynch's more linear films can be made, although, on a second viewing of IE I may wish to spend some time thinking about the connection between the exploitation themes in Elephant Man and this film. Of course, the directing, camera work, and especially the sound design are flawless. Goes without saying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant film if you're a Lynch fan, if not, you may hate it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, this is easily the most confusing and bizarre of all of David Lynch's films, even more so than Lost Highway. I think it's also the most bizarre film I have ever seen. The film is harrowing and creepy and Laura Dern is incredible in her performance. I never thought she was capable it. Fans of Lynch will love it, especially those who think Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway were his best. Average filmgoers will most likely be bored (it's 3 hours long) or think it is Artsy crap. Lost Highway is probably his most comparable film based on structure, technique, and bizarre elements, although it would not be entirely fair to use Lost Highway as a basis for judgment. One of the only things that keeps me from giving it a higher rating is that there are a couple scenes which seemed to drag on a little longer than necessary. Inland Empire at first is reminiscent of some of Lynch's older short films because of the way it is filmed. It is gritty, shaky, and even gives a documentary feel at first. While it is still not his best, it's among them and it's what Lynch fans have come to expect and love.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quintessential "women's picture" for the new millennium!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***** SPOILER ALERT!!! ******* Lynch's latest moved me tremendously. I was a big fan of Mulholland Drive, and as one poster here asserted, that earlier film helped me to "dissect" this latest Lynch masterpiece. Lynch himself might think it improper or "uninteresting" to discuss what this film conveys, but "Inland Empire" is such a significant work of art it seems criminally negligent not to, its depth and honesty as profound as it is.In every case Lynch portrays women's sexuality as powerful and without a shred of judgment, even if they are promiscuous, or prostitutes. Lynch acknowledges life's consequences, but without moralizing in any way. Laura Dern's actress character is a true heroine, an everywoman and bold protagonist.The character watching the TV screen throughout the film is the actress in the first version of the film being remade by Dern and Justin Theroux. That actress was killed making the film, by her jealous husband after he discovered her affair with her co-star, and she now sits in limbo, crying from sadness and guilt (another theme in recent Lynch films, brilliantly realized in the fever-dream death hallucination of Naomi Watts' spurned, suicidal starlet in Mulholland Drive). The film was never finished or remade because it was subsequently thought of as "cursed", and the odyssey of Laura Dern's character purges that curse.After consummating an affair with Theroux ("watched" by the suspicious, jealous eyes of her cold, threatening husband). Dern becomes haunted by the suffering spirit of the murdered woman, and all women judged and abused for their sexual choices. I loved the scenes with the women who slept with the actor, comparing notes - and with a real sense of solidarity, there is no cattiness or competition between them, they even admire each other's breasts. They are also stuck in a cramped limbo, their yearning embodied in their hip-swinging, yet robotic and joyless "Locomotion" boogie.Dern's dark odyssey is her experiencing the actresses' pain, the women's collective pain ? which she seems to choose to do, her character constantly revealing determination, strength, purpose. And the women heap their burdens on her, trusting her to save them. There are so many examples of this ? the Mary Steenburgen character talking about a "debt that needs to be repaid" by the man who lives in the strange little house, the Japanese street girl confiding in Dern's dying character about her junkie/whore friend with the monkey, the strange confession of Dern's white trash woman who climbs the stairs. It all concludes with Dern's suffering a horrible, lingering "death". Then, triumphant at the end of shooting the film, she refuses to accept the kudos directed at her, her victory incomplete if just for herself. She "rises from the dead" to find the first actress in the room watching the events unfold and kisses her, as if to say, "I have endured this and now you are free". The woman's face brightens, she ceases crying, and reunites with her husband and child. Then, during the marvelous closing credits, Dern is celebrated by all the beautiful women, who are now dancing quite joyfully, as she sits on the sofa, beatifically observing the fruits of her efforts as the women sing about "POWER".Dern is portrayed as almost Jesuslike in the themes of sacrifice, will, compassion. She willingly endures an odyssey of horror that leads to her "death" to save them all, whores, unloved wives and spurned starlets alike.David Lynch is a tremendously sensitive, soulful and brave artist, who is just getting better and better. He understands that its not enough to just tell a story, he has learned to make us truly "feel" the story. Three hours was necessary. The bunny people are there, just like the homeless man/monster of Mulholland Drive, to set the stage for a suspension of the laws of logic and linearity, to invite absurdity and magical unrealism into our awareness, so that we can experience pure emotions like a sense of triumph, catharsis, compassion, empathy, unconstrained by the expectations imposed on us by conventional narrative. This movie made me cry, it made me feel so much! What an achievement. Bravissimo David Lynch!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>when someone's work you love disappoints</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>{i checked the 'Contains spoiler' box with ironic intent: this movie has no plot to 'spoil'.} 'show business' is only an oxymoron to those who don't understand that unless there's a dialectic between what the audience wants (escapism without real consequences) and what the artist wants to convey (that he/she has a unique vision that must be taken seriously), what you wind up with is meaningless navel-gazing.if there's too much control by "the suits", you wind up with "Home Alone XX". with just the right balance between suits and a visionary artist, you may get masterpieces such as "Blue Velvet", "Lost Highway", and "Mulholland Drive". however, once the lunatics are in charge of the asylum, all too often the result is an incoherent mess like "Inland Empire." Woody Allen has made a career of dramatizing insights derived from Freud. analogously, the tapestry that connects Lynch's work is the mad interplay among the Jungian themes of Shadow, Self, Anima, and Animus -- but, however much (or little) dreams may illuminate our waking reality, dreams that have no referents besides other dreams, if that, merely obscure rather than illuminate.after a beginning that suggests we may be in for another fascinating closeup of the Munch-like horrors lying just beneath the surface of the Norman Rockwell reality we still cling to when our guard is down in a movie house, all too soon we find ourselves sitting through 3 hours of boring non-sequitors.the scary scenes don't scare, the sexy scenes don't arouse. because one of the most fundamental drives of the human psyche is to find meaning (something that artists of the absurdist school might pause to ponder), the viewer's attention winds up being riveted on Lynchian tics like light bulbs and overapmplified sounds of the background noise on a long distance phone call (or is it the sound of bathroom plumbing? -- who knows or cares?). the unintended result is that it feels like a parody of Lynch done by Mad TV. (it's too loud, too lacking in any subtlety, and just plain too ugly for SNL).one of the less commented upon features found in all of Lynch's films from "Blue Velvet" on is that they are visually gorgeous. "Inland Empire" looks like a video-to-film transfer shot on a cheap camcorder. (indeed, from what i've read, it WAS shot on a cheap camcorder.) it's sad, and disappointing, to see a great artist lose his way. Let's hope Lynch is back to his otherwise superb form in his next film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You were expecting another "Mulholland Drive?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying I've admired every single Lynch film to date, and I've seen all his feature films?not only all the original work, but also the non-auteur stuff (like "Elephant man," "Straight Story," and "Dune") as well.Moreover, "Mulholland Drive" is on my short list for best movie of all time?a hands down perfect piece of art. And I really liked "Lost Highway" and even found "Eraserhead" engaging.However, I must say the first 90 minutes of "Inland Empire" ranks as some of the most boring and pretentious film making in the short history of the art. I can't speak for the rest of the movie--as 90 minutes of unrelieved murky shots of Laura Dern looking distressed, while the dialogue-obscuring sound track of a B-movie organ drone desperately tries to create some kind of suspense--was all I could stand.Lynch's images have always been arresting, sometimes even pretty. But he seems to want to play against that here, creating choppy, grainy, bad-home-video-style visuals that just beat down the viewer trying to let them flow. Hey! art should require its audience to work for its pleasure and meaning; but the effort required here is just too much for me.I think film should tell a story with pictures?hopefully a complex story with emotionally and intellectually engaging pictures. But this film is just ugly chaos.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Alan Smithee Film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At least it could have been worse ... but only if it had lasted even more than 3 hours ;-).Let me get a few things out of the way first: I am a great admirer of David Lynch's early work, up to and including Lost Highway. I like movies that are not straightforward, that make you think and that leave space for your imagination and interpretation. And I consider myself to be open-minded and willing to wander off the beaten track ... Having covered this, I must say that this was one of the rare occasions where I was dying for the movie to (finally) end - I left the theater thinking "what the f***?" and quite honestly if I had to put a headline to the whole thing I would call it intellectual masturbation.Maybe Lynch is just having a laugh, viewing Inland Empire as an experiment to see how far he can go with audiences - or it is a revolutionary new concept in cinema where the director just supervises shooting and the audience explains what this is about in forums like this.One of my spontaneous thoughts after watching this was: had this been the debut film of a rookie director fresh out of film school, my guess would be that he/she would be continuing his/her career making movies at children's birthday parties or silver wedding anniversaries.Then on the other hand, maybe I belong to the minority of dim-wits who just don't get it - I can not rule this out. However, looking at the majority of raving reviews here, there is one thing that I would really like to find out: how many of those reviews are based on a genuine appreciation of the movie, and how many were written because it's just so en vogue to celebrate Lynch films and you better not admit that you came out of the theater thinking "geez - I didn't get it ..." I would love to do an experiment: show 3 hours of CCTV or traffic cam material, taken randomly from a department store, office building or a traffic light on a deserted road, and add some opening titles stating "Directed by David Lynch" - my bet would be this film would earn an average vote of 7.8 here and lots of interpretations/explanations, all starting with the statement how great the lack of narrative helps the deeper meaning of the movie.But maybe this finally is the ultimate Alan Smithee film - and I must admit that it left a deep impression in urging me to write this long comment ;-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch cheats</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fact # 1: Lynch is a genius and one of the very few filmmakers who have reached the point of image-perfection (others include Terence Malick, Kim Ki-Duk, Herzog, but also Wong Kar- Wai and maybe Nic Roeg)Fact # 2: I found Mulholland Drive completely comprehensible; in fact it is my all time favourite film (together with Kim's Bin-Jip), with Blue Velvet close on its heels and Lost Highway a bit further down the top 30. I saw MD 5 times the week it came out.Fact # 3: I *never* walk out on a film *ever*, but watch the thing till the very last closing caption.Fact # 4: After a considerable time of viewing Inland Empire, I glanced at my watch (bad sign in itself), saw we were 2 hours in and so had 1 more hour to go. I didn't hesitate, but got up and out of the theatre.Tons have been written about this film, so I'll keep it short: Rabbits dates from 2002.What do I mean by that:1 - The fact that it's utterly incomprehensible (well, maybe not totally, but hey) does not bother me, nor the fact that it's artsy - even though I think Lynch should stop meditating.2 - What *does* bother me is that he does not seem to be able to choose. He discovered the hand-held camera. Cool. He's created the most cut-up story ever. Cool. But (a) somehow he doesn't seem to be able to combine the two; (b) he seems to have little confidence in it himself. Some of the shots work, like the dancing scene. Some shots work with the hand- held. But sometimes he uses his old filmic language with the hand-held, and it DOES NOT WORK. It gives the impression that what you're seeing is actually the evolution that Lynch's style has undergone in the past 5 years, without him being able to take position. Emblematic to that problem is the fact that Rabbits-parts are included, which include Mulholland Dr actors, and which dates from 4 (four!) years earlier, filmed in his "moving painting" style.In short: I had the impression that Lynch has evolved, and that this would have been a great film if he'd been honest to himself and keep only the radically new bits, instead of keeping everything in, leading to an inconsistent hodgepodge.Maybe it's telling that in last year's DVD-issues of Lost Highway (or was it MDr?) he actually *explains* part of his storytelling technique. For a master of the non-explaining, this is an omen. Lynch should burn his old pellicule and start from scratch. Try to amaze himself with something he doesn't already understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An vastly inferior companion piece to Mulholland Drive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire is an interesting premise with an absolutely horrible execution. I've liked some of David Lynch's movies: Mulholland Drive was brilliant, Blue Velvet was good, Eraserhead was okay, and I've seen a couple of other of his movies that were not bad. I was eager to see Inland Empire but by the time I saw it I was disappointed and quite frankly bored to tears.As I interpreted the story (if one wants to call it a story) it was about an attempted remake of an unfinished Polish film which allegedly was cursed, and the new leading lady now gets to the point where she can't discern the difference between her life and what is being filmed for the movie and what happened in the unfinished Polish film- and we, the viewers, are not intended to know the difference either. But that interesting premise is watered down to nothing in its ungodly three hour running time, good acting notwithstanding. There are too many non sequiturs (the rabbits from an earlier project, the girls dancing while the Locomotion or what ever the hell it was was blasting, the seedy alleyway conversations behind the AXXON N door, the lengthy scenes of people brewing coffee, far too many close ups of ugly people whispering to each other, and on and on like that for three hours) to honestly say that there was any point to any of it. The camera work looked like something out of a direct to video horror movie filmed on a $100 digital camera, which doesn't help matters. Eraserhead looked good because of its low budget filming, it added to the atmosphere, not so in Inland Empire. Lynch overuses the quiet whisper immediately followed by screaming or loud musical score to the point of absurdity here. When that gimmick is used in every other scene, it loses its effectiveness, and merely becomes annoying. Almost all of the characters meander through bizarre living rooms, Hollywood sound stages and crumbling Polish factories, without anything to draw the viewer into what is taking place. Lynch's 'Mulholland Drive' was brilliant: it had suspense and was intentionally funny, often times simultaneously (Winkie's anyone?) with great acting by all involved, and well photographed on the streets of Hollywood. Despite not making sense on first viewing, there is a somewhat discernible plot which only becomes apparent in time and after watching it repeatedly, and it also leaves many things to think about afterward, and makes the viewer want to go back and watch it again. Inland Empire had none of these. Mulholland Drive starts off almost making sense, but then two thirds of the way into it, Lynch pulled the rug out from under the audience's feet, to perfect effect. Inland Empire never gives anyone a chance to grasp at any thread of a plot, it never gives the viewer anything more than badly photographed images. No suspense, no humour, nothing. Initially, I didn't understand Mulholland Drive but it stuck in my mind and I wanted to go back and watch it again to figure it out. I don't understand Inland Empire and don't want to understand it either. I don't have too much of a life, but still, I can't talk myself into sitting through this three hours of digital vomit again, just to try and figure out *if* there is anything to it. I feel like I should take another shower after having watched Inland Empire, and then watch Mulholland Drive again. * out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a Lynch fan I was disappointed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a fan of Lynch, I have a book of interviews on him, and a book he wrote about creativity. I thought Mulholland Dr was a masterpiece, and yet INLAND EMPIRE disappointed me.Its not that INLAND EMPIRE is bad, its just that after all the praise its received I felt that it should have been better. This is basically a Lynch experiment, not a Lynch film. He seems to be utterly fascinated by all the new "gizmos" involved with digital film-making, and thus instead of a story we get a 3 hour film of Lynch having a good time with the new digital era.For a short while, INLAND EMPIRE almost ALMOST has a plot. Laura Dern plays a washed up actress, Jeremy Irons is a film director, and they set about making a haunted film. I have to wonder, knowing Lynch's style, if this isn't just some joke on his part. Releasing an incomprehensible film and seeing just how many snooty film critics will proclaim it as a masterpiece. Ultimately I can't shake that feeling that this is just Lynch getting sloppy, rather than making a coherent film (which takes work) he instead opts to make an incoherent film (which takes absolutely no work).Considering I had to wait five years for the next Lynch film it is understandable that I was underwhelmed. Still I think Lynch is very interesting and I will be first in line for his next film, because when he gets it right, he gets it VERY right.</fullReview>

I am starting to have doubts.The film is badly shot, badly edited, badly scored and looks far more like a student film rather than a big director.The whole film is completely pointless, goes nowhere and does not allow the viewer to make any sense of it. The way I feel these kind of films succeed is if the director gives the viewer something to work with so that after the film has ended their mind is a maze of ideas trying to make sense of what has been seen. Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway all succeed very well in this but, with this film, the viewer is just left annoyed at having wasted three hours watching a film that went absolutely nowhere filmed painfully on a hand-held digital camera...Don't waste your time with this pointless film. Nonsense to the max.To use the phrase in a negative sense, YOLO so don't waste three hours of that life on this...</fullReview>

I can't believe that from all the people who had helped in this "film" none of them had the guts to say to Lynch that 'I'm sorry, you know that I respect you, your work and your artistic freedom, but I personally think that maybe you should change a few things because this is TERRIBLE!' I don't know, perhaps Lynch wants to retire and maybe he thought 'why not make my last film the worst film of all time so that people would be shocked?' Please, don't get me wrong, I'm not shocked (not even close), I'm just deeply disappointed in David Lynch and I truly hope that after this nobody will ever want to work with him again.

		<fullReview>It wasn't my idea to watch INLAND EMPIRE . I kind of got talked into by some very nice people who I respect very much . I respect them so much I will not embarrass them by giving out their names but they know who they are and they're going to the cinema to see Nuri Bilge Ceylan's IKHIMLER next week and because of their taste in film I think I'll stay at home because in my humble opinion INLAND EMPIRE is one of the worst pieces of dung ever committed to celluloid I'm not a great Lynch fan but I did enjoy THE ELEPHANT MAN and WILD AT HEART had its moments as did ERASERHEAD despite - or because of - its bizarre atmosphere . If you liked these movies you will hate INLAND EMPIRE . If you disliked these movies you will absolutely despise INLAND EMPIRE . If you loved these movies you will possibly only merely dislike INLAND EMPIRE !!!!! SLIGHT SPOILERS !!!!! The problem with the movie is that it feels like it's being made up as it goes along . That's because the movie is being made up as it goes along ! We start off with a man and woman their faces obscured speaking a Slavonic language about to have sex . We then cut to a situation comedy starring what can only be described as " Rabbit people " which is being watched by a weeping woman . The story then cuts to movie star Nikki Grace being cast in a film that was previously abandoned during the production stage because the male and female lead were murdered " Hey Theo I think I know where this might be heading . Nikki finds herself caught up in a dangerous situation ala classic Hitchcock " Yeah well that's where I thought it was heading but then .... well I don't know what happened because everything started going haywire . Nikki finds herself caught up in a kind of metaphysical universe with another visit to the rabbit people I thought I'd missed something so popped out of the cinema for a cigarette just to see if my confusion was caused by a lack of nicotine . I returned and instantly thought I'd walked into the wrong screening because the story now involved whores dancing around to a pumping soundtrack of Little Eva . More cuts to Nikki in a metaphysical universe , more cuts to the rabbit people sit-com . After two hours of this esoteric crap I decided that I'd had enough and decided to catch the last bus home . Sure as hell I wasn't going to endure a very long walk or an expensive taxi ride in order to catch the end of this vanity project And I made the correct decision because when we discussed the movie the next day everyone agreed on one thing - None of us knew WTF it was about . It's never revealed who the rabbit people were or who the weeping woman was , though I would hazard a guess it was possibly someone who spent ?4.20 for a ticket to watch this garbage which I can honestly say is the worst movie I have ever seen in a cinema . I wasn't all that keen on the last movie I saw in a cinema - OUTLAW but at least it had a story no matter how contrived and underdeveloped Nick Love's screenplay wasINLAND EMPIRE may work as a drug movie ( The audience were suspiciously quiet as in they might have been smoking a certain brand of tobacco that can't be bought in shops ) or as irony in that the writer /director is called Lynch which is exactly what I wanted to do with anyone who financed this rubbish . People may defend the movie by saying it's an enigma wrapped up in a mystery but take it from me it's excrement wrapped up in manure</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The same old David Lynch gimmicks ad nauseum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember in Lost Highway when one character inexplicably changed into another character and you were all "Whoa what was that? What does it mean?" Remember when it happened a lot more in Mulholland Drive and you were less impressed? Well David Lynch apparently can't get enough of this gimmick, and we see it happening again in "Inland Empire." He seems obsessed with the idea. Unfortunately, if you don't share his obsession with seeing the same plot gimmick played out over and over again, you may be less enthralled with the results. He seems to have stalled out in Inland Empire; like Larry Clark, who is forever doomed to living out his fantasies by making young, beautiful actors do naughty things, Lynch seems to be running in place thematically.Now it would be unfair if I pretended this was all there is to Inland Empire. But, like a high school creative college student who claims his final project is great because everything stands for something else, Inland Empire offers us two choices: the first is to be accepted into the Cinema Illuminati and say you like the film and have seen it multiple times to appreciate its nuances. The second path is to assert there is no onus on the viewer to prove themselves intellectually by indulging Lynch's every self-indulgent, masturbatory impulse.Unfortunately in today's cinema when the quality of a fanbase for a film seems to be how well they engage in pseudoacademic doubletalk, we lose sight of what makes a film great. A great film *can* be complicated, twisted, maddening; however, this does not mean in turn that every complicated, twisted, and maddening film is great. I think in the case of Inland Empire, time has caught up to David Lynch. Unconventional structure, plotting that doesn't, to borrow a condescending phrase oft uttered by many fans of the movie "spoon feed you all the answers" (which could just as well mean doesn't exercise enough discipline or courage to actually commit to anything, preferring instead the safety and intellectual badge of honor of leaving it "open ended" or "left open to interpretation"), and hallucinatory imagery are more standard fare than ever these days. I need more of a connection, more of a wry little twist to what has become something of a Lynchian formula. I didn't get that in Inland Empire.My recommendation would be that you not see this movie but tell people if asked that you loved it. If you don't care for the movie, you'll be the cast into the pit of "If you didn't like it, you didn't understand it" or "Go back to your Fast and the Furious movies." Oh, the horror!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>crime against humanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Releasing this film into the world was a crime against humanity. David Lynch should be tried in the Hague. It wasn't so much a film as it was a 2 hours and 50 minutes bout of emotional vomit onto the screen. Dark, disjointed and incoherent. The sound recording was physically painful to hear. Half the dialog was either whispered or mumbled contrasted with screeching and roaring background noises. And don't look for help understanding the words from subtitles unless you speak French. It had two sets of French subtitles and none in English or any other language. This may have been done as a favor to hearing impaired non-French speakers. Many scenes were too dark to see anything at all. In a film of this length the DVD came with no scene selection.(really) It did however come with a video calibration feature which allows the viewer to fine tune his picture so he can see the dark, intentionally blurred and black and white scenes just as the the director intended. I may now understand what it would be like to have a very bad LSD trip while in a mental institution and suffering from Botulism. The talent of Jeremy Irons, Harry Dean Stanton and many others was completely wasted with no plot or meaningful dialog. Laura Dern did demonstrate great acting ability in a series of disjointed scenes. Shame it was wasted in this stream of unconsciousness. I would like to see her do more actual movies. I have followed David Lynch's work starting with Eraserhead and have kept watching because his films are strange and different. I think he reached back into his Eraserhead bag of tricks here but this time pulled out a turd. The difference is that in Eraserhead the characters suffered. Here only the viewer suffers. We all would have been better off if he had just colorized Eraserhead. This film was so bad that it retroactively ruined most of his previous work. At this point I would say that only Wild at Heart and Twin Peaks are worth watching. Every copy of the rest of David Lynch's films should be destroyed. Not turning this thing (whatever it was) off after 10 minutes was one of the worst mistakes of my life. Worse than dropping out of college. Worse than not marrying my high school sweetheart.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is it brilliant or rubbish? Well, for my money it is both and worth seeing regardless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whenever I saw Mullholland Drive I enjoyed it because it was such an experience but yet had much for me to try and figure out ? as hard as it was to do so. Funny then to watch Inland Empire and think that in the future, if it continues this way, that we will look back on Lynch's earlier films as his pre-weird period, which is strange when you watch Wild at Heart, Blue Velvet etc. However this is the place we now find ourselves with Inland Empire, a film that not only shuns narrative tradition but behaves as if such a thing has never existed. And to watch the film, well, you just need to accept this and deal with the fact that if you have even a slight grasp on the story then you should consider yourself lucky.If you can accept this then the film is flawed genius; however if you cannot accept this then the film is a shambles that will make you hate it almost as soon as you realise you will not be able to get to the bottom of it just by watching it tonight. The funny thing is that both camps are right in their comments on this film because it is at once brilliant and terrible ? Jonathon Ross summed it up surprisingly well when he said it was a "work of genius ? I think" because the impression left on me was just this.On one hand the film is almost impossible to follow and it is not just a glib remark to say that this does make Mullholland Drive feel like an episode of Eastenders in regards accessibility. The plot starts out as a mystery but pretty much disappears into a series of semi-connected fantasy (?) sequences where characters complete switch worlds and identities, terrifying characters loom large but yet are invisible to the viewer and a sitcom featuring rabbits is watched by a girl crying in her room. There is little here to help the viewer and there is simply no foundation for you to put one foot one and say "right, no matter what happens I know I am on firm ground here"; the film doesn't pull the rug from under the viewer ? there is simply never a rug to begin with. To many viewers this will be the end of discussion but for my money I already suspected this would be the case and what I actually came for was the experience.In this area the film is both brilliant but yet flawed. It is brilliant because it literally does feel like you are falling through worlds of dreams. Lynch manages to shoot his scenes with the air of them being slightly (or totally) unreal. The effect is completely unnerving and an example of the power of cinema that he can move the viewer into such a place mentally that even a static shot of three people dressed as rabbits is quite terrifying. It is a skill he is famous for and he shows no sign of losing it. As an experience I found it engaging to a point and, unfortunately, that point was not 180 minutes. It is ironic to praise the film for its freewheeling experience but yet criticise it for being undisciplined but yet here we are because it does feel very much like a film where Lynch needed someone to say "look, you need to make it as tight as it is exhilarating".Nobody said this I think and as a result it outstays its welcome at times and the dips are just that much more pronounced. Fortunately it is not consistent but it does come and the conclusion of the film is worth staying for. Not narratively you understand (even though the threads do come together) but some terrifying scenes give way to closing credits of beautiful women dancing to Nina Simone's Sinnerman; does it make sense? Well no, but again it is all about the experience and in this regard it is fairly consistent. Another reason for seeing it is a performance from Laura Dern that only begs the question why she didn't manage to get an Oscar nomination. OK it was a tough year for actresses with Cruz, Mirren, Dench and Streep filling out the list but for my money Dern is as good if not better than all of them. Lynch plays out so much confusion and emotion in her face, with this making some scenes a story without a single word being said. Given how hard it is to understand what is happening in the script, it makes Dern's convincing performance all the more impressive. Below her nobody is as good but everyone does suit the material and Lynch's approach.Of course aside from Dern, the star is Lynch and his fans will come to this way the same Bruce Willis' fans come to a film because he is in it. His direction, editing and cinematography is masterful, which only really leaves his writing. Superficially he does fall down but yet he also produces a flow he understands as well as some brilliant specific moments ? a line where a black homeless woman says "It's OK, you dying is all" is a wonderfully insightful remark that is all the more impacting for the throwaway delivery of it, a matter-of-fact summary of life on the streets in a tiny part of a bigger film.Overall then this is an impressive film that is as brilliantly bewildering as it is frustrating. Some will find meaning but the vast majority will be best served to treat it as an experience rather than a "film" as one would expect from any other director. Even on this basis it is not perfect and is easily too long to sustain but in this regard it is still worth seeing. Not sure if it is entirely enjoyable but for sure it is an experience I'm glad I had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The biggest waste of time...ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>INLAND EMPIRE exemplifies everything I hate about cult films. It's a shining example of the 'Emperor's new clothes' syndrome, a lengthy, supposedly artistic production that ends up being absolutely worthless on account of its obscure plotting and almost entire lack of reason, sense or purpose.It's a truth that when it comes to writing books, it's very easy to write something that only you yourself understand and identify with. Getting something to appeal to the masses is a lot tougher. Well, the same principle can be applied to film, with the result that David Lynch makes films that appeal to him and others in his little group of right-minded friends. To be honest, I'm flabbergasted that he found funding for such a pretentious outing.Laura Dern plays an actress who finds herself becoming mixed up in the alternate reality of the movie she's appearing in. Or something like that, anyway. There's lots of wandering about in dimly lit rooms, sub-plots and sequences that seem to have little bearing on the supposed plot, and a whole lot of boredom. In fact, this is one of the most boring films I've had the misfortune to sit through. It's as if Lynch goes out of his way to alienate most of his viewers.I certainly won't be in a hurry to watch any more of his work - aside from THE ELEPHANT MAN, which I remember being very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not even promising enough to ever become disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen every David Lynch film known to man. Why? Because, like many others, I was captivated by the driven, innovative hybrid of beauty and horror, good and evil that is evident in Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks. These films blew my mind. Between the story, the music, the visuals, and just the downright bizarre nature of these pictures, I was spellbound. David Lynch is a master of atmosphere, and as a painter, he has moments of cinematic genius. I was so moved and amazed by Lynch's earlier works that I found myself watching films that I wasn't even interested in, films that I knew may not be good, just because he directed them. I kept getting disappointed, but I didn't give up. I bought the best of davidlynch.com, I saw his short films, I listened to his CD, and I even sat through every minute of his very slow, very experimental three hour movie...Where do I begin? This film tries so hard. It actually tries to recapture some of the horror and the oddness that made his earlier films so engaging, but it never feels the same. The eerie atmosphere is there, but there's never any plotting, or any substance to support it. It starts off with possibility, but it ends up feeling forced, and even arbitrary at times. I normally try to give a plot summary in a review, but what we have here is simply a very dark and strange movie about an actress. That's it. There's no continuity, there's no logic, there's very little justifiable conflict, and there's no story arc. This film is literally an incoherent, episodic jumble of weird scenes.It's kind of like Eraserhead in a way, but guess what? Eraserhead was only 85 minutes. It feels like 120. By this particular scale, Inland Empire seems to go on interminably. Eraserhead was equally surreal, abstract, and disturbing, but unlike Inland Empire, an intelligent viewer can actually make connections with the scenes in Eraserhead?not inherently logical connections, but connections nonetheless. Even among fans, I think it's pretty much unanimous that Inland Empire is so utterly disjointed that it's futile to even attempt an analysis. It is simply devoid of any traditional story whatsoever. I can see what the movie was trying to accomplish; it is meant to create a very bizarre viewing experience unlike anything else, and it does do that, but it takes far too long to do so. I will admit this movie had its moments. It has a couple scenes that made me jump, and one more that made me regret watching it while I was alone in the house; however, these few moments of terror are wedged between hours of plot less, stagnantly paced scenes that require too much patience to sit through. I appreciate artistic films, but I like artistic films to get their point across within a reasonable period of time. I think some reviewers, me included, wouldn't have been so hard on this movie if it were about 40 to 60 minutes shorter. I enjoy odd films as well, but I like odd films to make sense, and if they don't make sense, if they break the bonds of logic, they need to justify this decision with something intriguing and original. I like the idea of an experimental film. I am even interested in a film that imitates the flow of dreams, and I admire a director for trying; however, as far as I'm concerned, this is nearly impossible to pull off, as, too often, ambitious filmmakers abandon the tried-and-true effectiveness of a classic story, and instead get carried away and ultimately drunk on their own meandering vision.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brave New World</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So how do you even begin to review this film? 'INLAND EMPIRE', like most other Lynch masterworks defies categorization. You don't review a Lynch film. You probe it, analyze it, consider it but definitely not review it. So here goes.My initial impression is that this film is a mess; unstructured, deliberately confusing and overlong. However, after many hours of thoughtful consideration by yours truly, some glimmers of light begin to shine through and some kind of logic is at operation here. The most surprising realization is that 'INLAND EMPIRE' is a continuation or mirror image of Lynch's previous film, 'Mulholland Drive', and is essential viewing prior to enjoying 'INLAND EMPIRE'. Many elements and scenes are recreated here, sometimes directly with the film within a film plot, a forbidden relationship between actors, identity changes of actors, etc. Sometimes the linkage is more tenuous, like in a similar coffee drinking scene, a script reading scene, the principles actors seeking refuge at the play/performance near the end of the film.The first question is why recreate the plot of 'Mulholland Drive' in this film? And specifically the film within a film plot device? Both films force us to question the reality of the film we are watching. We are deliberately kept aware that we are watching a film but also we are ignorant if the actors are in character or not. This brings on a common theme in latter Lynch movies, namely identity shifting and role reversals, dreaming/hypnosis/dementia states, and of course acting/'living' states. As an aside, why is it required that the film being created with the film is always so cheesy and clichéd? Is it Lynches way of ridiculing the film making process of today? This film is Lynches most surreal since his 'Eraserhead'. An obvious link to this film is the rabbit people mirror the woman in the radiator in his first film. Both may represent an ideal yet unattainable state, whatever that may be. The surrealism in 'INLAND EMPIRE' comes from the machete job on the editing deck. Lynch stated that moving to digital was the most liberating aspect of this film and that he will not be going back to standard film. Watching this film gives the impression that the projectionist has the remote control and is flicking channels at will. Attempting to decipher the multi-plot lines is futile. So why do this in the first place? I believe that the scope and ideal of this film is to breakdown our resistance to film conventions that were previously written in stone. While this is dangerously close to boring or alienating the paying audience, the effect can be profound if received with the right intentions. For me the point was arrived suddenly at the comical and bizarre scene when Laura Dern's character describes painfully how her husband left her to join the circus (a possible clue to the meaning of the films title??). The scene itself was so jarring and yet funny that all previous attempt to tie it all together dissolved into the ether. I stopped analyzing and started just watching. I realized it didn't matter if it does not make sense, just enjoy the experience. Enjoy the concept of sitting in a dark room with a bunch of strangers watching the flickering screen and recreated sounds.The length of the film at 3 hours is critical to attaining this state of film karma. If you resist you will exit cursing the $10 and 3 hours gone from your precious life. If you open up to the possibilities that film really does not matter, then many gems are there to be savored. The principle enjoyment of the film is the irrepressible acting of the amazing Lara Dern. If acting perfection is attained through breaking down barriers and opening your soul to the elements (and director) then Lara has attained something special in the film. How many times did you wish to look away from the level of uncomfortable display by Lara repeatedly? I wondered if her fragile love-making plea to 'look at me' was the polar opposite of Dennis Hoppers rock hard 'Don't look at me' rant from 'Blue Velvet'? Lara looked relieved but shattered at the ebullient final scene. I knew how she felt. The final song and dance routine was almost a reward to you the viewer for surviving the film. You have passed the test. You are a film goer reborn. Rejoice and be happy. Nothing will ever be the same again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreams of a Dying Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Taking the murderous jealous husband theme of "Lost Highway" and melding it into the dreams of a tortured actress theme of "Mulholland Drive," David Lynch fluidly immerses his recurring dark fantasies into a story revolving around a Polish-Gypsy legend and a cursed movie production and delivers his most experimental film since "Eraserhead" with his epic three-hour "Inland Empire." The most experimental part of this is Lynch's use of a hand-held digital camera to shoot the entire film. While I personally prefer the deep texture of film over the superficial sharpness of digital, much of Lynch's trademarks translate surprisingly well to the new medium. Lynch's hyper manipulation of lighting, fading in and out of absolute darkness, super close-ups, transposing of images over one another, and making some scenes literally dissolve into the next frame, all come across sharp and artistically satisfying. There are points, however, where Lynch so repeatedly shows Laura Dern walking down dark hallways and dimly lit staircases into moody savagely lit rooms decked out with weird lamps that I half expect the director's next project to be a home decor line for the film-noir enthusiast.There will be those who wish to discuss the plot of "Inland Empire" and insist on figuring it all out. Upon first viewing, I decided to simply enjoy the ride. At three hours, there's lots of filler involving chatty and dancing prostitutes (who play the role of a post-modern Greek chorus and at one point do a rendition of "The Locomotion" that is both horrifying and hilarious), a sitcom staring talking rabbits, and some sort of complex story involving a Polish carnival, while inter-spliced into the madness is a wicked little psychological thriller about an actress who literally gets lost in her new role. The best morsels are the interwoven scenes of Laura Dern (beat-up, harrowing, and with a cool Southern drawl) waxing poetically in monologue fashion about her tragic love life to a man (presumably a therapist) and some beautifully shot scenes that take place on a dark snow-covered street in 19th century Poland that seem to have been exorcised from a completely different and dreadfully thrilling film. Lynch, however, gives many clues for those wanting to dissect the piece: 9:45, room number 47, a magic watch (similar to the ring from "Twin Peaks: FWWM "), the "LB" tattooed on Dern's hand, the letters "AXXONN" appearing repeatedly on walls and doorways, Grace Zabriskie's bizarre telling of an "old tale" when we first meet Laura Dern's character, and perhaps secrets hidden in the dialogue of the prostitutes, the rabbits, and Harry Dean Stanton. The film is so long, and so jumbled, however, that I think it's better to digest it as is, unlike "Mulholland Drive" which was exhilarating to examine "between the scenes."Lynch, forever in love with Hollywood as a city of dreams, is again master of the disembodied scene. Like Naomi Watt's mesmerizing audition scene in "Mulholland Drive" (which in no small non-ironic way launched Watt's career into the stratosphere) there's a killer line-reading about thirty minutes into the "Inland Empire" where you don't really care what Laura Dern is talking about or what film she is in, it's just you watching her playing an actress getting totally lost in her lines, and it's beautiful. Lynch's masterful juxtapositions of the profane with the profound, light with dark, beauty with pure terror, no matter what non-linear incomprehensible way they are presented, are true cinematic treats to experience for those willing to open their minds to the ocean of possibilities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>INLAND EMPIRE. A David Lynch Odyssey.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was said that the Orson Welles flick "Citizen Kane" taught people how to watch movies. I am convinced to many people wants to drill down to the truth in David Lynch's movies. Build it like a kid's puzzle in other words. DL jokingly said that he does not understand them either, and that all the interpretations valid are. But at the same time, it is not very original to conclude that the film is ? the dream of a women waking up around the end. I do think Inland Empire is dreamlike, but dreamlike mostly in a metaphysical way. It is fun to grapple with the illogical elements in the film, to look for what Alice found in the rabbit hole. One is confronted with unexplainable events every day. For example, the other day, as I walked behind x I had the intention to tell her that she appears a bit 'white' in the face, but I decided not to. At that point she glanced over her shoulder and asked, "What did you say?" For me, it works to decide which parts of the movie are true, and let the rest of the understanding spin of from these premises, using metaphor, parallel realities and surrealism. But I believe one should enjoy this film solely on the impact the spectacularly related scenes deliver in it selves, without concocting meaning to it. Storyline: An actress (Nikki), casted in a movie "On high in blue tomorrows' is playing (Susan). Nikki is married to a very prominent Polish Hollywood player and on the point of betraying her husband with her co star, Billy (Devon Berk). It is secretly a remake of a Polish, cursed movie. The movie transgresses into surrealism almost immediately after Nikki doesn't realize that a line she played in a scene is only part of her role, and not in 'real' life. She walks thru a door with some kind off curse in graffiti written above, and grapple for the rest of the movie with madness. In a way the film pokes metaphorically at the movie-making industry, which can be viewed as 'filmed life' threaded parallel to 'real life'. I think the group of dancing girl's portrayed different personalities of Nikki (watch her expression while they talk); they also emerge traumatically after Nikki had sex with Billy. One of them pointed out to Nikki, "It's strange what love does", a phrase, which tunneled a mysterious energy, and probably has something to do with Nikki falling in love with Billy, invoking the curse, getting some kind of split in her personality. I think the Polish actress who appears at the start of the movie deciding to watch a movie is in fact dead, in limbo, locked up in time, half born, in some minimalistic place where she mostly watches a TV program with 3 rabbits in a room. This room is severed with a feeling of what only they seem familiar with, of a deeper knowledge: What they are not going to tell us, but what we might find out. I believe this metaphysical plug in point is INLAND EMPIRE. She is likely the lost girl in the folk tale "A little girl went out to play, lost in the marketplace as if half-born...". She makes contact with Nikki, which is "a women in trouble", and seems to lead her in a good way, wanting her to escape the curse. For example, when the parrallel life Nikki saw ketchup on her husband's tshirt, it appears as if she could be dreaming his murder, and the Polish actress, who appears to watch this, murmurs "Cast out this wicked dream that has seized my heart". (My favourite line of the movie). At which point a murder with a screwdriver took place somewhere else. I think she also summits the psychologist (who appears to be one of the rabbits) to help Nikki. Nikki's split parallel identities are a fantastic concocted mesmerizing mesh, but I think it symbolize mostly her schizophrenic adjustments to the situation she faces on a cursed set in a city of dreaming. And troubled the movie "On High?" is. This has likely something to do with the Phantom, or evil, who looks for a way 'into Inland Empire". I think the Phantom is the other coin end of the folktale "When the boy left the house evil was borne and followed him". Such is the haunting mood of the movie. Look out for a 'lewensmoeg' Harry Dean Stanton, and his hilarious ways of getting some spare change from crew and actors. "I know I've got a lot of nerve, but it seems just like the other day I was carrying my own weight". And a terrifying scene with Julia Ormond, closely interviewed by a sweaty police officer, about a murder she is going to commit after being hypnotized. And also, this is a first rate performance by Laura Dern. I really liked the scene where Nikki's husband put his arm around Devon and give him some honest advice about the sacred vow of marriage. I hope the decision of shooting the film on DV is not the actions of an old man getting a bit lazy (with all respect), because, for me, its lacks the cinematic grandeur of Mulholland Drive. In other words, it is not going to produce the same quality posters as Mulholland Drive. But it is a brilliant work, brilliant in its spectacular victory over the obvious, and brilliant in its portraying of the many dimensions we live in threaded closely next to each other. Do we want to 'break thru'? Do we want to dive into alternative realities, or force away the doors of perception? I think we do. Then maybe we should burn a hole into a thin piece of silk and fold it double and peer thru. And we should remember to wear the watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's magnum opus is unbelievably disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Inland Empire" is undeniably one of Lynch's most uncompromising works. I've enjoyed everything the man made previously (heck, I even liked "Dune"), but I absolutely hated this one. Its three hours long, shot on digital video camera, and has absolutely no point. If there is a point, its far too obscure and I'm really in no rush to rewatch this to try to decipher it. There's been a great divide over this film, with some calling it Lynch's finest and others calling it his worst. I'm with the later group.There's many reasons why I couldn't stand this movie. First off, the digital video camera was completely unnecessary. Digital video simply doesn't have the same look that actual film does. While its forgivable for lower budgeted films (such as "Session 9"), it often looks like crap. Why Lynch, a director who is capable of getting a large budget, would choose this format is beyond me. "Inland Empire" is very ugly to look at. Even more though is the self-indulgence of the whole project. "Eraserhead" and "Lost Highway" were often incoherent pieces of extreme surrealism, but they have an emotional core nonetheless and a dreamlike resonance. Even if they aren't about anything, the viewer is convinced they are. "Inland Empire" is certainly weird, but its alienating and often pointless. Instead of hypnotizing this viewer, I just felt bored and frustrated.There are a few positive aspects. Laura Dern does what she can with so little and turns in a decent performance. Plus, its always nice to see Harry Dean Stanton. Despite all this, "Inland Empire" is pretentious, pointless, and ultimately boring. I have a feeling that if it wasn't directed by David Lynch, it wouldn't be getting all the acclaim and people would see it as a laughable attempt at an art film. (3/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Broken Dreams On High In Blue Tomorrows of Inland Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw "Inland Empire" last night and I am totally overwhelmed. It is brilliant, amazing, mesmerizing - you name it. I love every one of its 180 minutes and I did not want it to end. Both, "Eraserhead" and "Mulholland Dr." pale in comparison. "Inland Empire" quotes them, references them as well as "Blue Velvet" and "Twin Peaks" and Lynch's short films but it goes further and looks deeper. I wonder if it will be possible for Lynch to ever surpass "Inland Empire". It is his crown achievement. I watched it last night alone, in the dark, and at some point I suddenly realized that I was wired to its hellish Universe, that I was transported to Inland Empire of horrors, and I was surrounded and almost swallowed up by its infernal/internal fears, nightmares, guilt and regrets which I had to face all alone just like Laura/ Nikki/Sue did. I am not sure if I understood the meaning of every image or every frame or every scene of the movie or even what movie I was watching every given moment, "Inland Empire" or "On High In Blue Tomorrows"? Or maybe I was watching "Broken dreams On High In Blue Tomorrows of Inland Empire"? I don't care - not everything should and can be explained. The following is the quote from the review of a Russian film critic, Marianna Shaternikova, the longtime loyal Lynch's admirer. She was not swept away by "Inland Empire" but I found her opinion of David Lynch and his world very close to what I think of him:"David Lynch possesses rich imagination and strange unusual talent. A figure of international fame and admiration, Lynch believes that life is very complicated and the movies should be equally complicated. His is the world of magic and mystery without any explanations. Very often, the plots of his movies are perplexing but Lynch would never offer any interpretation. According to him, "people can't accept the fact that the life, the existence has no sense, no reason. This fact makes them nervous and uncertain. Perhaps, Religion and mythology had been created as an attempt to make some sense in the existence." It is quite obvious that "Inland Empire" would split even Lynch's devoted fans. Some of them believe that their favorite director "lost it" and indulged himself in three hours of "Blatant narcissism", "Self-Indulgence or "Self Importance" while the others think his latest film is a unique amazing work of a master and transfixing movie watching experience. I fail to understand why it can't be both? Does it really matter that Lynch returns over and over again to the same themes, that the same memories and images stuck with him and he has to explore them in his every work? As long as he possesses his magic power and is ready to experiment with the medium, to create the brilliant, uncompromising, and even sinister films with creepy gloomy yet darkly funny atmosphere, I will be happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Cast out this wicked dream which has seized my heart."First let me say that I think this film is a major achievement in the history of cinema. Hopefully to be considered thus in due time. Lynch moves on in his exploration of the "Real", where linear Time collapses and moves both ways (forward and backwards), the coherence of identities is abandoned, and "Place" is just an opening into a different one, never a constant in itself. If Lost Highway and Mullholand Dr. violated and experimented with Time's linearity and the coherence of identities, this movie is confident in its use of "slippery time" and "reflected selves". And, for the first time, accomplishes the same for "Place" as well. We are dealing with reflections here, some mirror-like or upside-down, others - a deeper version of the surface. Lynch entirely abandons the basic grid of "modern" narrative, yet manages to tell a story. I will try to retrace some of the reflections. There is a woman; she has agency, she acts freely. She pursues Love, Sweetness, a Palace. She finds death, becomes a prostitute, she has to fight against some "Phantom", she will see the end of her world. There is yet another woman, she is "bound", just like a circus animal, someone controls her. She has a Screw-Drive-er (in her stomach), she bears a child, she is lost. She wants to kill the free woman. She is instructed to annihilate that freedom (When she will manage to do it, they will merge for a moment in a kiss. It is exactly midnight - both hands of the clock have finally met). There is this Phantom, this "something", he controls the woman like a puppet on a string. Once she'll find him, she will try to kill him. Which will only make him happy, maybe even give him an orgasm. She'll be able to catch a glimpse of herself as the stupid clown she really is, and go backwards into room #47, her blind spot (the second half of an AK47, the first half of which is echoed backwards in the letters written on her fist). But in order to do that, she'll have to try and go against the current, to get deeper "Inland". Because there is always some "Crimp", some blind spot, someone's hiding just in front of you. She'll unfold that crimp, but if she'll push too hard, the light she shines on it might go out, like an overcharged Light Bulb. Then there is a deeper version, in polish, in the past. Once again: a prostitute, a violent man, a cheating woman. And at the heart of it all - the barest version (reality? humanity?). Tamed rabbits (implicitly sexual, like PlayBoy's logo) living in a place where everything is completely uncanny, made up, dreamed up, some weird sitcom (who watches it?). Perhaps there is some way out still, into Sweetness, to The Palace, to Pomona (a city named after the Roman goddess of abundance). Perhaps not: the bright future will only reveal a past of violence ("Ah, but there has to be a murder in it," says the visitor and smiles). In Pomona the girls will sing about a sinner-man and dance. Then there is also the director, King-sley, shouting "Action!" ("Axxonn", "Axe On"), he directs her to her death, then applauds her (you might say the horse has been brought to the well, but drank of its own volition). It doesn't stop here, everything is reflected on the male side as well. An excellent and in depth exploration of these themes could be found on the message board in the official site.Lynch offers us a glimpse of the empire that rules the In-Land, where the Screwdriver meets the Crimp (to produce Truth as an offspring), and a woman gets in trouble for having the American Dream hardwired as her personality.Finally, I'd like to point out that this is Laura's Best as well (perhaps that is what is written on her fist?). Her acting is breathtaking. She even betters her confessed roll model - Deneuve in Repulsion.My only caveat would be that Lynch seems to have dreamed up his own private Pomona in the shape of Eastern mysticism, which seems a bit naive. Had he researched it, the amount of violence hidden beneath these scriptures (the Gita, Upanishads, etc.) would have been easily uncovered (Brahminism, State Vaishnavism, Militarism, not to mention the English translations/interpertations originating as a tool for colonial rule). But all this should not distract from the fact that this movie is a masterpiece. A genuine and timely expansion of the limits of Cinema and Narrative.In a way, I keep imagining Lynch as constantly watching Sunset Boulevard (as the gaffer, offering a Light Bulb), asking himself, "how could this come to be?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*Some statements may be viewed as containing spoilers.*I saw "Inland Empire" at the AFI Festival and feel it is simply phenomenal. I have no idea what it is about and at the moment it doesn't matter. I actually made an effort not to analyze it and just watch it and enjoy the ride. And a great ride it was.I was afraid what was to happen with the new medium but David Lynch really succeeded in pulling off some beautiful DV. I was impressed. The description of DV he gave at the 20th anniversary screening of Blue Velvet was, as it turns out, accurate: "It looks terrible... but it looks beautifully terrible." It was just so interesting looking and so perfect for the movie that it wasn't distracting in anyway. I left the experience of watching it feeling it couldn't have been done any other way. And although I will admit that I will still miss the look of a David Lynch movie on film, I didn't find anything to be lacking at all.The acting! Wow! I'm almost speechless about Laura Dern's performance especially, but we need to give credit to several people here. One must keep in mind that none of the performers had any clue as to the purpose and meaning of Mulholland Dr. And yet Laura Dern, Grace Zabriskie, Justin Theroux, Harry Dean Stanton, Julia Ormond and a few from Poland I'm not familiar with succeeded in giving such interesting, dynamic and subtle performances. Dern especially was chameleon-like. So often did she go from one emotion to another while maintaining control of all of the nuances one would expect from reality. Mr. Lynch's ability to extract the perfect performance, never ceases to amaze me. That ability shows through scenes from his work that run so well with actors that are not know to be nor do they prove to be exceptional. There was some of that here but the spotlight was really on actors that know their trade very well.Inland Empire was unmistakeably Lynch but it was far more expressionistic than anything we've seen. "Lost Highway" was a situation comedy compared to this. At least with that and "Mulholland Dr." you somewhat know where to begin. "Inland Empire" doesn't give you that. It is longer and has more angles and doesn't allow you to say "Ok let's start here and work our way out." As a matter of fact, I'm not convinced there is anything to get. Well, that's not true. There is something there for sure but I think it may be something that will eventually break down. Like the farther you walk down a street to see the stores, the thicker the fog gets around you. The reason I say that is not purely because of the experience of watching the movie's chaos but also because of the process he went through. I have no doubt that everything you see has its place on the same quilt but why was "Rabbits" there? This is something that was it's own project. A stand-alone endeavor. And yet the same performances were used in "Inland Empire". But then again, we saw new camera angles we hadn't see before. Were they filmed simultaneously with the footage originally presented in "Rabbits" because he saw it moving out of that world all along or were they filmed recently to bind it to "Inland Empire"? "Axxon N." allusions were also a surprise. That is also a stand-alone (though unproduced) series that has been completely written for quite some time. Why allude to it in here, especially when people can't refer to the series? Who knows? We can also question the connections since David Lynch said he got a lot of the ideas separately and serendipitously and only after it had begun did he understand why his brain was giving him these ideas. That's not to say there is no common thread. He is not a common filmmaker and I certainly do not believe he would just do things meaninglessly for the sake of being weird though many are quick to believe such a thing -- after all, attention spans and mental growth potential have been left in the womb by many a film-goer. But because of the change in medium I will grant myself the freedom to toy with the idea that it may not be just a puzzle to piece together. That plots were built around subconscious connections. Like a Miro painting maybe. The common themes and common moods and common chaos of the different threads presented may be as much part of the movie's purpose as the actual plot elements.Anyhow, it's going to be excellent seeing it it several times over in theaters. All three hours of it. Because it will take many viewings and coffee shop discussions to get even a greasy grip on the essence of this piece. And then maybe we can see if it reveals itself to be even more than the exceptional movie it seems to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's most challenging film... and that is no easy feat.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lynch is the master at creating surrealism and at painting vivid images in our heads, even if we don't quite understand them. He has done that with his past films- Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, and his greatest film to date, Mulholland Drive. However, making Inland Empire was a bold move, even for him.The beginning of Inland Empire is completely engaging and frightening at the same time. It is perhaps the best introduction to any of his films yet, and perfectly sets the mood. The film starts off very atmospheric, and only for around 30 minutes the film drives through a mostly straight-narrative path of a woman working on a remake of a film. However, starting at the 50 minute mark (or even before that) it starts to wander around in Lynch's darkest mind for quite an amount of time. It never truly lets the audience stop to go over what has happened, because as much as you try (and believe me I did) you can't. Lynch has us where he wants us the most, where we can experience a journey that only he can take us through. The film goes through maddening scenes, vivid and beautiful images, some amazing cinematography with digital video, and it all fills up in your head like some of your most vivid nightmares. That is not to say it is a nightmare, simply since it can be quite scary at times. Laura Dern, who is at center of the film, is to be given respect for having to give herself up for Lynch this way, even more so than Naomi Watts in Mulholland Drive. She gives an excellent performance, the only performance I have ever seen her do where I can say she blew me away. She was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Once again, I think this is Lynch's most maddening and challenging film because there is really not much where one can make sense of. But like I said before, Lynch is the master at this because he is not afraid to let out his ideas from the deepest end of his mind. He bares to make film as abstract as he wants, and he feels the need to put feeling over reasoning, which is what a true artist does. But this is the only Lynch film where I can say that I really have not even 20% of an idea of what it was about and what it all meant, even after Mulholland Drive (which I know many will wonder how that is). For that reason as well it is destined to not get universal acclaim and will indeed get a lot of hate from any source of media. But I think that is what a true artist does, even when his film is indeed flawed. Yet a film like this you wonder what are flaws and what are not, considering the 3 hour mark. But one thing is for sure, only Lynch could ever make this film. No one else would dare try.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's about a woman in trouble?but, which woman, and what trouble?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following Lost Highway (1997), and Mulholland Drive (2001), Lynch now treats us to Inland Empire (IE), another exposition about the human psyche. It has a multi-layered plot ? but I think only one real story; 'real' in this context meaning the core story that Lynch wants to tell. There are so many plot threads and devices, in fact, that many reviewers use words like 'impenetrable', 'beyond explanation', 'surreal' and so forth. Like Lynch's previous two above, however, in my opinion IE's narrative is understandable, despite the apparent chaos that batters our visual and aural senses.Because, batter it does, from the opening scene of an old phonograph scratching out a barely discernible message, as though foreshadowing the difficulty of understanding all that is to follow...The film then continues with a literally fuzzy episode between a prostitute and her client discussing terms, all in Polish with English subtitles, and in black and white ? or smeary gray, to be more precise, another metaphor, perhaps, for the shades of gray that permeate all our understanding of the world, ourselves and each other.Then a quick scene change to a weeping woman, sitting alone on a bed, in what appears to be a hotel room, watching a TV screen with snow and static. She's distraught; she seems lost. Her eyes fixate on the TV screen... Suddenly, an image of another woman walking towards a house flashes briefly on the TV, then the whole scene changes to a parody of a TV sitcom, but with giant rabbits and canned and inappropriate laughter: an obvious symbol for the inane and vacuous nature of most TV programming. After a few minutes, another quick scene change again to that woman approaching a house...which is now the house of Nikki Grace (Laura Dern), the star of a movie to be produced, called 'On High in Blue Tomorrows'. The director Kingsley Stewart (Jeremy Irons) soon reveals to the actors that the new movie is to be a remake of a Polish production in which the female and male lead actors were murdered before the film was finished; and remained unfinished?And so, Nikki and her co-star, Devon Birk (Justin Theroux), begin the process of making the movie, during which they find themselves drawn to each other, to the point where they begin a torrid love affair outside of the fictional love affair between Sue (Dern) and Billy (Theroux) within the story being filmed?with tragic results, because Nikki has a very jealous, Polish husband. But Nikki is now enmeshed in something beyond her control; and the horror increases as she begins to confuse her identities, leading to a worsening nightmare of different situations, people and places. There are apparently disjointed, unrelated and impossible scenes ? for example, the Rabbit characters, Nikki/Sue suddenly assuming another identity, as a downtrodden housewife, as a prostitute, or being transported instantaneously to Poland ? that appear at odd, random moments; there are, seemingly, nonsensical scenes of violence; there are time transpositions that offend logic; there are numerous characters; and, there appear to be direct contradictions about who is who. Occasionally, there is a cut to the weeping woman on the bed, still watching the snowy TV and, much later, Nikki/Sue appears on that same TV and seems to look directly at that woman...Complex barely expresses the point: this is Lynch's most challenging film to understand. So, what's really going on here? Lynch uses every trick of the camera and sound to subvert our perceptions of what's actually presented. And that's precisely what happens in our dreams, where so often nothing seems to make sense. So, is it only the weeping woman who is in real trouble; or is it Nikki, with her love affair, spiraling out of control? Which is the real story? When Nikki and the weeping woman meet for the one and only time, you can decide for yourself. That meeting suggests to me, however, that dreams can indeed come true.Beyond the narrative, however, this film is arguably the most introspective and self-referential story about Hollywood and what it means to be a star. It implicitly explores the degree to which an actor can be overtaken by a role to the point of obsession or madness. Unlike the prior two movies, however, IE ends on a note of hope ? real hope ? that the whole acting process need not end in personal disaster (as it so often has, for some hapless actors). The closing scene of a most beauteous Laura Dern, as herself, is exquisite proof, and a direct counterpoint to the horrific end of Mulholland Drive. At three hours, this is a long movie, so some may feel that length. But don't give up on this film: it's the type of movie ? like all Lynch efforts ? that invites repeat viewings because, make no mistake, Lynch always has a message and a real story to tell. He's an artist of the highest calibre and all artists want to make a statement with every work of art they produce. Otherwise, the art is fake.This is also Laura Dern's best performance. When you see her transform from Hollywood star, to downtrodden suburban housewife, to sleazy streetwalker, to femme fatale ? all in the same narrative, you'll appreciate her skill, one worthy of an Oscar but which, unhappily, never came. Kudos also to the supporting cast, even the brief few seconds that William H. Macy was on screen.The cryptic title may refer to Riverside and San Bernadino counties, as some say. I think it simply refers to each body as being an 'empire' for the persona within, and for each of us to explore throughout life. Lynch had a lot of fun making this film, no question. Join his fun by watching it, right to the dancing girls as the credits roll...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Good Movie, but Ditch The Digital, David</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching "Inland Empire", having long awaited a Lynch film since I was so completely awe-struck by "Mulholland Drive." Let's get one thing straight here. David Lynch is probably my favorite director. He is certainly one of the most innovative minds in film and deserves to be on the same plateaus as Kubrick and Scorcese. However, Inland Empire is not a film. It's a three-hour long digital journey, and I honestly think that if this movie had been on film it would have had more of an impact on me.Making a three-hour digital film is a very daring thing to do and the movie is very impressive in that sense. But I never felt myself entirely engaged with the movie as I had with Lynch in the past. Whereas I usually am on the edge of my seat and overcome with feelings of dread that no horror movie can accomplish, I laid on my couch through most of "Inland Empire" and maybe sat up straight for two whole scenes.I'm going to attribute this to the film being on digital. For one, the shots and footage are so dark at times that the film feels like you're looking at a black box on the screen for a lot of the movie. In a theatre that may be very different, but on a television set that grows very tiresome.Secondly, "Inland Empire" is a very ugly film. It is very reminiscent of Lynch's earlier works like "The Alphabet" and "The Grandmother" where the films were very dark and made them even more frightening for those reasons. And yes, those films are very good films, but not pleasing to look at.This is probably my biggest complaint about the film. Despite Lynch being such a dark and creepy character, his films were always contrasted by moments of serene beauty. The scene in "Mulholland Drive" where Naomi Watts and Laura Harring go to the Club Silencio is one of the most beautiful scenes in a movie I have ever seen. "Inland Empire" has no beauty in it at all, which makes it difficult to sympathize with anyone in it.Lastly, this is still a problem with the digital nature of the film, but Lynch's style lacks a lot of edge when on digital. Part of what I think made Lynch so impressive is that the shots and takes he got on film most studio executives would have a fit over -- "Is this guy a bloody amateur?!", etc...And yet that was what made Lynch so special as a director. He managed to capture the things that people were afraid to capture because film as a medium is so costly and most wouldn't waste it on eerie inserts of lamps, and lips, and eyes, etc. He managed to capture discomforting things and show audiences a side of the world they had never seen before. With "Inland Empire", I would argue that any film student or amateur could have done if not the same, the equivalent. The digital style is overall not very Lynchian.The performances on Laura Dern, Justin Therous, and Jeremy Irons parts are wonderful. Dern is especially brilliant considering she's not playing much of a character but more of an abstraction and yet still is very convincing. The "Locomotion" dance number is worth seeing alone. In the end, I give this film a 7 out of 10 because I am a die-hard Lynch fan and know that those who are not as die-hard as myself will probably be less critical and enjoy this film -- I mean, movie, a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's most disappointing work...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch's mystery film, Inland Empire (2006), is like sitting through a chaotic nightmare that will never end. It exhibits the experience of an up-and-coming actress in Hollywood, named Nikki Grace (Laura Dern). The film begins with a storyline that appears relatively easy to understand for a David Lynch film. Nikki is cast as the lead role in a Hollywood film and lots of quirky characters are formed in the surroundings which make for a typical eerie but intriguing story to follow. The semi-cameo role from Jeremy Irons as the film director gave a shot in the arm of entertainment and Justin Theroux's character, Devon Berk, was intriguing and entertaining to follow. But when it becomes apparent that Nikki is sent some sort of parallel universe, the plot develops into an utterly confusing, unsettling and uncomfortable experience for the viewer. It is made very unclear as to who many of the characters are and how they came to be in the story. For much of the film, I wasn't sure how anything on screen could be described as relevant in any way. Only until later in the film do we come to understand what it was we sat through for two and a half hours. Even after that discovery, I still felt very unsatisfied and didn't really come to terms that this film has any relevance to anything at all. The film consisted of low-budget cinematography yet it demonstrated high efficiency in getting the best out of its technology with some uniquely engaging shots. This was particularly evident throughout the frantic scenes of Laura Dern's character in the dark. However, on the whole, I was disappointed with Lynch's most recent film. His previous work like Mulholland Drive is a much greater demonstration of the talented work that Lynch is able to produce.</fullReview>

But that's about it.Let's face it, David Lynch is a legend. He made some quality original stuff. When you have a status as a legend, at a certain point people like everything you do. Same goes for musicians, painters etc. Furthermore, liking this movie can show to others that you're very artistic and definitely not-mainstream.For me, this movie doesn't make any sense. Of course I could also make up all kind of theories how things are supposed to be connected, but that's just too much wild guessing. If you WANT things to be true, you make it true, just like conspiracy theories.This script is just easy in my opinion, too random. And art should be more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lynch once made Eraserhead as an experiment in what works when combining sound and image to create a certain atmosphere. Every other Lynch movie uses the unique tricks developed in that movie. But Eraserhead was relatively poor on structure, so ever since he developed not only a grammar, but also some interesting semantics.Mulholland Drive for example was largely a dream, combining several worlds but still clearly distinct from each other. Now Lynch goes one step further and mixes all worlds in time and space to create possibly his most complex movie to date, comparable in structure only to Medem's Lucia y el Sexo.Inland Empire is also his least accessible. It will take you at least the first hour (of three) to figure out the structure. And you have to work hard on that as a viewer, otherwise the rest makes no sense.Basically, it tells the story of a troubled woman in a troubled part of Inland Empire. Her life is the lowest level in the movie, and all worlds are stacked upon this one. She dreams she is an actor acting in a movie. This movie is a remake of another movie, which is based upon a gypsy tale. But these 5 worlds also interact and interfere. And what happens in the movie is sometimes the reverse or the complement of the story of the original movie (stabbing of 2 actors vs. stabbing of Nikki). On top is the meta-world of the rabbits, commenting all other worlds (see for example how the canned laughter is used).Lynch studied in a depressing area of Philadelphia and this must have influenced his life, contributing to the dark movies he usually makes. And Inland Empire (San Bernardino especially) is no happy place either. Despite the layered setup Inland Empire feels more realistic than other Lynch movies, so I also find it more depressing.I saw this on one of the largest screens available and the DV showed its obvious technical limitations. For the worlds Lynch defines I do prefer 35mm.Note: See the shot with the Lolita poster: It's the movie he recently mentioned on TV as one of his personal favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shot, in its entirety, with a simple digital video camera, Lynch's 'Inland Empire' isn't different from his other films but it is completely something else. The hand-held DV cinematography gives it a less polished look but works in favour of the film giving it a raw, voyeuristic and gritty feel. The shots are brilliantly clumsy with effective close-ups and long shots. The camera beautifully captures that element of fear, chaos, somberness, isolation and hate. The lighting also works excellently, as it does in almost all Lynch films and 'Inland Empire' too is very colourful like 'Mulholland Drive' and 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me' but notice the different use in all three films. The soundtrack is mesmerizing and, at times, haunting.This may not come as a surprise but one should not expect a linear story from 'Inland Empire' (but that's not to say that there isn't a story). It's pretty much like being stuck in a manipulated time capsule until one is finally released after having 'completed the task'. In spite of the almost 3 hour length, one does not notice the spilling time as 'Inland Empire' jumps from moment to moment and back with no concern for time. The audience, like the characters in the film, also experience deja-vus, losing or rather questioning the sense of time and reality. There's also the Lynch humour to provide some laughter (at times the audience would be laughing at themselves).'Inland Empire' is about Nikki/Sue's journey. Lynch bravely paints the picture of his protagonist with passion, sensitivity and delicacy. Centred around Laura Dern's character(s), we pretty much go through what she experiences which is a real mind f***. After a long time, we get to see Laura Dern in a role of substance. In terms of performances, 'Inland Empire' is a one-woman show that belongs to Ms. Dern. The actress is phenomenal and it's a real shame that one of the finest performances in recent cinema has gone ignored. She displays a range of nuances as we get to see her with shades of Betty Elms, Diane Selwyn, Rita (from 'Mulholland Drive') and Laura Palmer (from 'Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me')and more. The rest of the cast that includes a charming Justin Theroux, a barely recognizable Julia Ormond, a scary Grace Zabriskie, a 'humble' Harry Dean Stanton and an ambitious Jeremy Irons are all impressive too.To say it in a few words, 'Inland Empire' as an experience and an experience can be best understood when a person goes through it rather than read about it. Therefore I'd suggest that one just go and watch it, rather than read about it. I must also add that this is a film that will not appeal to everyone, especially those who do not particularly like this kind of film (duh). It is one film that requires (and deserves) repetitive viewing because the more one watches, the more discoveries to be made. Another terrific achievement of Mr. Lynch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 3 out 10 I rated this film is for the performance of Laura Dern; when she was given a chance to play a recognizable human character doing credibly human things, she was excellent. If there is any sense to be dragged out of this movie, it's because she put it there. In most other respects, it failed to impress.It gives me no pleasure to say this, because I very much like most of Lynch's other work. I have a feeling that IE is the movie that Lynch always wanted to make, but was at least to some extent constrained to follow the conventions of mainstream film-making by the studios. In IE, however, the brakes are off. It's as if the studio bosses said: "Go on David, do whatever you like." And, oh boy, he did. What we've ended up with seems to be a jumble of all the least comprehensible bits of his other movies, all stuck together in no particular order.Even though we haven't always been able to follow the plot of Lynch's films -- if they even have one -- we could generally rely on exquisite visual artistry. IE, however, lacks even that. I'm told that it was filmed on a mid-priced camcorder; I don't know if that's true, but it surely has the worst technical cinematography of any serious movie ever made by grown-ups. I assume that this is intentional -- it takes work to make something this unappealing. I mean, a bunch of school-kids with a Handycam will sometimes succeed in creating a scene that is properly lit and in focus, even if by accident.And the characteristic, understated humour of Lynch's other films also seems to be missing here -- it's relentlessly grim and gloomy from start to finish.If this movie had been made by anybody other than Lynch, I would have given up after fifteen minutes, and just assumed it was a heap of self-indulgent, pseudo-intellectual nonsense. But because I know that Lynch can make a great film, I toughed it out. I'm not at all sure it was worth it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Bizarre, Nightmarish Feast For The Senses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Inland Empire" is David Lynch's most recent film, and follows a desperate actress, Nikki (played by Laura Dern, of "Jurassic Park") who lands a role in a Polish film that was apparently cursed, and the two previous leads died before production was finished. Not only that, but Nikki begins falling in love with her co-star, much to the dismay of her possessive husband, and she begins to lose all hold of reality. What ensues is a hallucinogenic, bizarre mind trip through Nikki's fears, dreams, and fantasies - but where is reality?For starters, this is my first David Lynch "experience" - I've never seen any of his other films. And from what I've heard, this is one of his most difficult movies to decipher a meaning from. The storyline, while it may sound fairly clear in my summary, is told in a very non-conventional manner and at times is a bit hard to follow. In fact, I have a hard time making sense of most of it. Going into watching this film, I knew to brace myself for some pretty bizarre stuff, because that is Lynch's nature of film-making. Even when I felt prepared for it, this was one intense movie, and is unlike anything I've ever seen before.Even with a tangling plot-line, I'd say this movie is worth seeing because of the effect it has on you. It's shot with a DV camera, which at times looks good and at other times is a little grainy, but it's fairly effective. The sound, music, flashy editing, and bizarre imagery gives the film a nightmarish sense, like a horrible dream that you can't wake up from. The cinematography also invokes a sense of claustrophobia with many close-ups on the actors, and it's overall essentially flawless. The sound design is impressive as well and gets a good reaction, especially during it's scare moments. The imagery is the most frightening thing though, there are some things in this movie that I won't ever forget.Acting-wise, there is a pretty impressive cast here with some big-name actors, which I wasn't anticipating. Laura Dern leads this movie, and is truly stunning in her role. She plays a slew of multiple 'characters' and is great in all events - her performance truly is powerful. Harry Dean Stanton and Jeremy Irons are also notable, as well as Jordan Ladd, Julia Ormond, and Grace Zabriskie. All the acting in the film was on-par, as obscure and bizarre as these characters are. This is a pretty lengthy movie too, running at 3 hours, so be aware of that. But the last half of it is pretty darn intense. As for it's ending - well, it's weird. The entire movie is weird, but you have to appreciate the style and the cinematography which is really great.Overall, "Inland Empire" is not a movie for everyone. It's so complex and bizarre that your average moviegoer will likely not enjoy it, but Lynch fans probably will, as will those of extremely bizarre, nightmarish horror. I can honestly say I've never seen anything like it, and the trippy visuals and strange storytelling are something you have to see to believe. If nothing else, it's a nice exercise in style and a true feast for the senses. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yeah, this is quite good. I'm completely re-editing this review now because I did something different this time around. 3 or 4 times, I tried watching this on the recliner, in the living room, at night, on the large flatpanel, and feel asleep every time. This time around, I used my computer, a high quality office chair, a Bluray disk, and a high quality 1080p computer monitor, first thing after breakfast and coffee. It's like night and day -- actually, it IS night and day, isn't it! This is ART. Precise, almost psychic, in a way. The HD helps in the dark scenes, introduces a completely different intentional "distortion", so to speak. This is more like surfing the web for information, you have to pay attention. People may not like these type of movies -- it's not like Wall-E or Saturday Night Live where you can just recline back and "be" entertained. This is about the precision of the message, a love of the art, this is about a clarification of ideas that permeate our collective conscious and perhaps subconscious minds. It's about Hollywood, dreams, and fears. You have to pay attention, and do it with an open mind. If you like Lynch at all, this is brilliant. If you don't, maybe don't bother. But for anyone that feels like they like Lynch but hate this one, try what I did. I've been there, done that. I couldn't believe this could be the same director, but now, watching it during the day on the computer, I see it is. It's an intellectual thing, not an amusement park ride. Grab a bluray disk if you can find one, watch in on your computer (if your computer supports Bluray), in a comfortable office chair, on a decent 1080p computer monitor. Pay attention. If you're a Lynch fan, definitely give it another chance. In the morning, seated upright in your work space, along with your coffee or tea. The 2007 movie "Lynch" might also be helpful to understand. This is really an awesome film. It's just not "entertainment" in the dumbed-down, baked-out, brainless mindless fashion one might be used to. Definitely a 9 to a 9.5. No recliners allowed. And remember -- coffee. Lots of coffee. Don't miss it -- seriously, if you're a Lynch fan, give it another chance the way I described, and you might see it in a different light. I tried at least 4 or more times the standard living room way and never made it through. Another thing that might help is to imagine that it's dreamy in a sense like a flow of thought, so the "plot" is taking place in a virtual place, like a video game or brain device or something. It's virtualized, these are images and concepts and things like that, not concrete happenings. It's not an action flick or military strategy. My take on it is that nothing in the film ever actually happened, like fiction within fiction or something. Give it another chance, if you like Lynch's stuff, you'll probably be glad you did. I'm glad I gave it another chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undeniably a unique experience, perhaps the most authentically nightmarish film ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw "Inland Empire" in early 2007 and opted not to write about it mainly because I really didn't know how I felt about the film (or video, if you're into semantics) after I saw it. I went to the late night show, was almost certainly inebriated, went with a group of friends (at this point I still had a social life), and remember little about the screening except that I enjoyed the film and appreciated it on some level or the other. Well, I'm glad I didn't attempt to write about "Inland Empire" based on that viewing because my feelings are drastically different this time around. What I found to be a fascinatingly incomprehensible nightmare-on-video the first time I saw it, what I found to be an extremely nonsensical film overall, I now feel is one of the most important and greatest artistic works of the decade, and nowhere near as flawed and incomprehensible as I initially thought. I'm not going to attempt an analysis of the film, greater minds have done that already, so I'll stick to a simple review of it.Perhaps "Inland Empire" does recycle elements of Lynch's previous work. I find it a less powerful experience than his 2001 masterpiece "Mulholland Dr." which with every viewing comes closer to toppling "Vertigo", my favorite film since I first saw it at age 12 or 13. I do think the video is used badly at some points in the film. It's a testament to Lynch's skill as director and cinematographer (and camera operator) that he was able to achieve this sort of thing with a dated, mediocre digital camera, but on rare occasions in the film, particularly during outdoor daytime shots, the poor quality of the camera itself isn't conquered by Lynch's creativity and skill in using it as well as it can possibly be used. However, other than that very small problem I really struggle to find anything I would cut out of the film. Considering its length, that's really something. In fact, I'm dying to see "More Things that Happened", one of the DVD extras which features over seventy minutes of footage shot for the project and not included in the final cut of the film. The film is, surprisingly for something shot with such primitive digital technology, formally elegant and consistently well-shot. What would Van Gogh have done with a set of cheap crayons and color pencils? The film makes fascinating use of color and light, and boasts possibly the best use of close-ups since Leone. These are even uglier, in a good way.The most common criticism of "Inland Empire" seems to be that it's a total mess, a bunch of nonsensical weird goings-on strung together and put out for pseudo-intellectuals to dissect in their setting of choice (the average pseudo-intellectual favors either the internet or the great coffee shop which isn't a chain... yet, the cool pseudo-intellectuals enjoy the sort of bar which frequently doubles as an art gallery, but that's besides the point). This is both true and untrue, and I suspect the more times I see the film the more I'll see it as untrue. Where the truth of these claims lies, mostly, is in the fact that, as a fellow IMDb user notes, the film doesn't just shun narrative tradition but acts as if such a thing never existed. However, to say there are no themes or emotions being expressed, to say there are no stories being told in the film, seems to me not a matter of opinion but simply incorrect, and indicates an extraordinarily narrow-minded and simplistic view of cinema as a form of linear storytelling and nothing else.While it does not have a 'plot', "Inland Empire" has a story. In fact it has several stories to tell, including that of actress Nikki Grace (Laura Dern), that of a battered housewife (Laura Dern), and that of a hooker working Hollywood boulevard (Laura Dern). There's also a giant rabbit sitcom and a Polish prostitute. Most of these strands start out relatively linearly and the film is mostly overall quite easy to follow for more than an hour of its running time, standard Lynch surrealism excepted. The film grows gradually more bizarre as the stories interact and occasionally merge with each other, the themes they have in common becoming clearer in some instances and less clear in others. The narratives all have great payoff as the film draws to a close. I didn't understand everything in "Inland Empire" and I'm pretty sure we're not supposed to, but it's really not even close to being the sort of deliberately distancing, deliberately obscure sort of thing Godard sometimes does. It doesn't mistake obfuscation for art. I can safely say I can't recall one dream I've had which didn't do exactly what "Inland Empire" did: start out as a linear narrative and then spiral out of control (my dream last night about Kirk and Spock's love lives in Starfleet turning into a spectacular time travel government conspiracy Tribble-centric crossover with "Star Wars" and "Lost" being just one example). The brilliance of Lynch's work here is that he was able to capture that and to control it, to explore themes with it, to express emotions with it. That's rare talent, that's rare skill at work. It doesn't hurt that his is a more interesting and freakish mind than most of ours. "Inland Empire" doesn't seek to tell a simple, straightforward story. Criticizing it for not doing so indicates either misunderstanding or a narrow-minded view of cinema. As a formal experiment and as an overall achievement "Inland Empire" is up there with Lynch's very best and as a result with the very best of cinema in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's magnum opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I've become more of a movie buff, I've developed a taste for those few films that explore the dark and haunting underbelly of the human psyche. It was through Eraserhead that I discovered David Lynch, and I then proceeded to watch Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway. Nothing, however, could have prepared me for what Inland Empire had in store for me. This film is three hours long and the pacing is slow (which makes it seem even longer), but the patience it takes to watch this pays off in a big way. As a jaded film buff, I thought I'd seen it all and that no movie could get under my skin or scare me anymore. I was very, very wrong. This movie provides the most compelling proof of what I've been saying ever since I first saw Eraserhead - Lynch is the new Kafka.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps not?I'd say Lynch goes further than an exploration of the subconscious. I think he explores insanity - where the trauma of an event is so intense that it distorts memory, time and meaning within the mind.In Lost Highway - a murder causes the onset of the delusional fantasy world. In Mulholland - its the loss of a great love due to rejection (betrayal by another). In Inland Empire - its the loss of a great love due to infidelity (a betrayal of/by the self).The first half of the film is the delusional fantasy of Nikki's traumatised mind. It should be interpreted in terms of feeling and symbolism. Her feelings for Billy are initially controlled - she is strong and resistant. Her feelings develop into trust and respect which creates a comfort to then open up the doors of the subconscious - the feelings give way to a titillation, temptation, desire, passion, guilt (not sure of the order of the last 2 actually - perhaps guilt before passion). Billy also seems to represent love. He seems to be combination of both the feelings of love for her husband and feelings of temptation.The result of the infidelity is the end of her marriage/family. This is the unfinished story/film that has been told many times through the ages. The guns, screwdriver etc could be taken literally although i think they are more symbols of the pain / loss. I don't think the trauma is from a murder I think its from the guilt.The whore element represents the guilt she feels toward herself and there is a desire to kill that element within herself. (The stabbing).I also take the whore element as having actually occurred with the laughter and indignation of the other working girls towards her aging looks exacerbating the pain and leading to the onset of the delusional fantasy where the mind shuts off completely to try and figure itself out.Lynch films reconstruct themselves in your mind upon reflection. Like the theme's through the film about memory and time you gradually remember scenes you've forgotten and parts of scenes you didn't take notice of the first time around.It also seems that she was abused as a child by her father which was the birth of her feeling of impurity that emerges to the surface in later life and causes the disaster. Their are strong ties between the room of her abuse and home of the whores.The rabbit scene represents the dark depth of the mind / subconscious. Its the happy family with the secret of abuse. Her mind eventually returns to that "room" and she deals with the pain that originated there. Once this is reached the mind experiences the release and final understanding. Bliss follows.For the vast majority of the film I thought it was her husband that betrayed her. (and I'm not sure if this is deliberate by Lynch or accidental) but by the end I think you have to change your mind.Anyways, thats my take on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that exists within the spaces between dreams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire, like much of the work of cult filmmaker David Lynch, is cinema in its purest sense; i.e. a trip into the unknown; filled with horror and wonder, pain and emotion, riddled with riddles and worlds within worlds and question-marks that weave in and out of layers of self-reflexive nightmare, drama and imagination. If you're familiar with Lynch's previous work, specifically his loose trilogy of psychological metamorphosis films - Fire Walk with Me (1992), Lost Highway (1997) and Mulholland Drive (2001) - then you'll already have a vague understanding of what to expect from Inland Empire and how to best interpret its seemingly formless and meandering plot. I use the word knowingly, as many of the most vocal criticisms of Inland Empire centre on its overall lack of focus compared to the preceding Mulholland Drive or his earlier works such as and The Elephant Man (1981), Blue Velvet (1986) and Wild at Heart (1990).However, this is clearly a deliberate decision on Lynch's part and as thus cannot really be expressed as a genuine criticism; with the confusing twists, multiple characters, alternative film universe and disturbing swerves from (dark) comedy to horror all being intended to disarm the viewer and create a sense of paranoid confusion that mirrors that of the central character (or characters). It can, I suppose, seem dense and obscure; more of an ordeal to get through than even Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive combined, but still, try to approach it with an open mind and the disarmingly naive idea that Lynch has described the film as "the story of a woman in trouble". Now, note the significance of "the lost girl" that appears in the vague and initially confusing scene at the beginning of the film and the idea of the actress and the significance of the role that she will eventually play. As with Mulholland Drive (or any of Lynch's work for that matter) the film is chock full of clues that point to the specifics of the actual story at hand - however, that said, there is still much room for acres of personal interpretation, thought and analysis.What the film means is ultimately down to the individual, and as such, the amount of enjoyment you get out of it will probably depend on the amount of work that you put in. So, if you wanted to watch it five times in a row to work out all the various "ins and outs" of the cryptic dialog and sketchy characters, then so be it. Likewise, if you wanted to dismiss the film after a single viewing; criticising it for a lack of clarity and sense of story then again, that's entirely up you. However, don't assume that just because the film didn't work for you that it must be an unmitigated failure (and likewise, anyone who doesn't enjoy the film should not be treated as an idiot). Still, there is plenty here to enjoy for those willing to appreciate the film with the right frame of mind. Unlike many filmmakers, Lynch always strives to produce great art; and like all art his work is entirely subjective, elusive and open to interpretation. As a result, this isn't the kind of film that can be justified by an arbitrary rating; it will either be a film for you, or it won't. Some films are like that.In my own opinion, Inland Empire wasn't something that I enjoyed quite as much as say, Eraserhead or Mulholland Drive, with my natural aversion to incredibly long films kicking in during the half-way point (this is almost three hours in length, half of which is in Polish and I watched without subtitles due to a problem with me DVD player - D'OH!). That said, there is still a lot to appreciate; from Lynch's bold use of digital film-making techniques and the incorporation of his own short-films and art-installations to offer further sub-textual depths to an already warped and fragmented story. In actual fact, the film often feels more like an art installation than an actual film, with some scenes merely revelling in arcane moments of reflection and visual expression. Other times the story manages to break through and actually drag you in; something that is mostly down to the riveting performance from Laura Dern; who dominates much of Inland Empire and really manages to embody the physical and psychological space of perhaps three to four different characters (adding further self-reflexive dementia to the idea of an actress, playing an actress, playing an actress, etc).As I've discussed, Inland Empire isn't my favourite Lynch film, but like all of his films to date, it feels like something I SHOULD watch; something I should invest my time with in order to properly pick apart it's various supposed mysteries and experiments with the visual narrative. Like anything of this nature it feels somehow above criticism, though I know deep down that there are elements I didn't quite like or, indeed, understand. But still, who am I to say? Perhaps this won't be the most helpful review ever written - maybe I should have offered some of my own interpretations of the events and scenarios depicted herein? - but I think, by this stage, you will know quite well whether or not this film will be to your personal tastes (yeah, that's a close to three hour experimental art-drama about psychological dislocation! I'll get the beers in then!). Obviously don't watch it if you've never experienced another David Lynch film beforehand, and certainly not if you're looking for something to zone out with after a hard day at work. It might just drive you insane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>General musings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My feelings about this film are very, very mixed, and almost as hard to figure out for myself as any Lynch film is thematically to the audience. The thing is, I'm a pretty big Lynch fan, but I know that not everything he makes is divine. This movie seems to fall all over the map in terms of quality.Here's what I can start off with with certainty: Lynch has officially fallen into doesn't-know-when-to-end-it mode. This trend tends to afflict many directors mid-career, and considering Lynch's current self-imposed removal into ultra-independent mode, it's not that surprising. Luckily, even though this movie is way too long (and even tedious), it isn't exhausting nor boring. So rest assured, while you may find yourself looking at your watch every now and then, it won't be painful.This movie was shot mostly on-the-spot using DV, and it shows it. Unfortunately for Lynch, his movies already have enough difficulties expressing themselves without a clear sense of preproduction to compound it, and to be sure, this movie doesn't begin to strike a cord until about a half an hour into its run-time. That's not good, but we Lynch-fans tend to be patient and, let's face it, who else is watching? In fact, Lynch's work with Laura Dern is ultimately what pulls this movie together... any other actress, and I just don't see it working. So let's give Dern what's due, she saves the show.The story, if you must have it, is about an actress who gets a break-out role, only to get too immersed in it that she begins to confuse her role with reality (roughly... abstractly... you know). Multiple personalities is a common thread in many Lynch movies, but this time Lynch layers on even more confusion: the script the actress is in reveals another layer of identity itself, and the entire process of discovering that hidden layer of meaning within the script causes the actress to question her role as a woman in Hollywood society. In other words, before the movie's over, we not only have Laura Dern's character confusing herself with who she is, but both characters she's playing confusing herself with everything from prostitutes to housewives, with pretty close to everything in between. Meanwhile, the same story plays itself in reverse in Polish (nice of Lynch to at least help us along with changing the language so we know when we're switching narrative space).But that's not all. See, there's a woman who is watching this whole thing through a television screen. And there's a room with three people in rabbit-suits. And there's time travel. And gypsy curses. Best I can tell, the woman who's watching the television screen is an art-trigger to force us to ask "Which woman is in trouble?" based on the tag-line. The rabbit-suits seem to be making fun of the whole spectatorship affair. This movie is through and through a satire on Hollywood, though to a much more opaque and self-involved level than Mulholland Dr. (nothing wrong with that).I don't think this movie should be watched by anybody but those who are generally familiar with at least some of Lynch's other works. It contains a lot of similar imagery... red curtains (pretty much every movie he makes), black-and-white lines (Twin Peaks), a room full of ethereal non-characters that seem to be commenting on the show (Twin Peaks again), video-tape messages (Lost Highway), a creepy person delivering a foreboding message (Lost Highway again), character confusion (every movie he's made), and so on. These symbols should reflect more his attempt to familiarize ourselves with what he's trying to do rather than falling into self-repetition... after all, this movie is very oblique.I also think that it has a very different feel than other Lynch films, partly due to its DV cinematography but partly because I think this is the only Lynch film that actually tries to be in the horror genre rather than being arbitrarily placed in it. Hilariously enough, it's less effective at horrifying than his other films, mostly because so much of it doesn't actually fit in with the rest. When I watch one of his movies, I'm almost always compelled by each frame, each scene, and feel the need to question what every little detail and minutia means. Not so with Inland Empire. There were at least three shots that I can claim with absolute certainty have absolutely nothing to do with anything. There are other shots that are repeated that needn't be, as the symbolism has already made itself apparent. As this movie is too long, it is also not very concise, and I think somebody should have gone in there and parred it down a bit.As a work of its own, though, removed from being "a Lynch film" and being comparable to other Lynch films, it is quite enjoyable. Again, Laura Dern should get the highest praise for her sometimes calm, sometimes reserved, sometimes panicked, and sometimes hysterical work, while the general film itself seems very curious and exploratory. I also don't think it's rather less difficult to keep track of narrative changes this time around because Lynch is very good at keeping certain color coordinations to certain states of mind (pay attention to that red and that blue, people) and the different languages help.So those are my long and decentralized musings on what I got from this film. What I can say in terms of recommendation is that I will be buying this movie on DVD (I like it enough), but I don't think its his best and if you're not familiar with Lynch, it's not something you should see until you familiarize yourself with something a little less epic, preferably start out with Blue Velvet and Mulholland Dr.--PolarisDiB</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two parallel stories intertwine in David Lynch's new and shocking independent film where rabbit costumes and Polish gangsters are some of the ingredients.The beautiful middle-aged actress Nikki Grace lives with her wealthy and powerful husband in a Hollywood apartment. For the time being she's high on life after getting the main part in acclaimed director Kingsley Stewart's new movie "On High In Blue Tomorrows", a remake of a Polish film that was never finished. When Nikki turns up for the first day of shooting she's introduced to her hansom co-star Devon Burke. Eager and motivated they begin rehearsing lines in front of the director, but are suddenly interrupted by strange noises. Little do the actors understand, but there is something the director has neglected to inform them about. The Polish film was according to myths and rumours never finished because the story was haunted by a spell. Nikki and Devon are surprised by this new insight, but decides to continue filming. As the shooting of the film proceeds, the two actors find themselves attracted to each other and a relationship develops. A relationship that leads Nikki into a personal psychoses where the difference between reality and fiction is erased.What lies in the place between dream and reality? What is the unconsciousness trying to tell us? David Lynch has yet again created an aesthetic, hypnotic and nightmarish universe where it's best not to judge the book by it's cover. In his direction he uses extreme close-ups, slow-motion scenes, moderate use of hand-held camera, esoteric dialog, absurd characters, romantic music and colorful imagery that contrasts the sombre and descending atmosphere, and gives the film a wholehearted and complete style where every frame connects in subject and color. Through tight corridors, long staircases and claustrophobic rooms, he mixes with genres such as art-film, drama, avant-garde, psychological thriller, parody and horror. As usual David Lynch is exploring themes like longing, love, dreams and mental confusion. Laura Dern who played one of the lead roles in David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" (1986) shows her diversity as an actress in her emotional roller-coaster-ride where she is thrown into one absurdity after another and delivers a tour-de-force performance as Nikki Grace. The films strange and brilliant script and the atmospheric music by amongst others Nina Simone and Beck, slowly drags the viewer's into the main character's paranoid mind. The films poignant aura of mystery, romance and magic are some of the elements that makes "Inland Empire" one of the most amazing and artistic movie experiences in recent years.</fullReview>

Anyone who tells you it does? They are just too pretentious to admit this is a nonsensical pile of dog sh*t.Also, bear in mind, the film is absolutely interminable. I am aware that Lynch films are often quite long, with slow pacing. This one goes above and beyond. 3 hours of bizarre, inane stupidity. Sure, it's surreal. But it's surreal in a way that is actually just boring. In this film, nothing happens. Nothing. I mean, seriously: Nothing. Happens. At All. Ever. It's weird for the sake of being weird, and even attempting to decipher its deeper message will make your brain bleed. There is no deeper message, other than "Wow there went three hours of my life I will never be able to retrieve." So don't bother. Go watch Blue Velvet instead. Or anything before Lost Highway (the epic shark jump of Lynch's film career, in my opinion.)</fullReview>

I have a habit of finishing movies I start, even bad ones. I was hoping along the way that this movie would eventually make sense, but alas, it never did. Laura Dern was excellent, but that is all I can say that is positive. The movie seemed to start out with a story, and then degraded into a bunch of random and unrelated scenes, mostly meaningless or nonsensical. I read the comments that is the the psyche of someone losing sanity, but it is painful to watch. I reminds me of a layman's attempt at something similar to Fight Club. That was good, this is not. Without a story to tie everything together, there is no point and that is what you are left feeling.Lack of story aside, this movie has bad lighting, boring scenes, meaningless scenes, noise, bad camera work, and jarring transitions. I can't imagine the agony experienced by the editor, or maybe he is the reason it's so bad. Anyway, watch 10 minutes, if you don't like it, it doesn't get any better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lynchiest of them all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Inland Empire in Seattle; David Lynch introduced the film (with a cellist playing an improvisation, followed by DL saying about 2 sentences) I knew only a few things about the film: it was shot all on digital video, and it was 3 hours long. Having seen all of Lynch's previous work I knew that I was in for a ride. I also knew that there was no way to know what kind of ride it would be: I was strapped in and ready. I heard the woman sitting behind me say, 'I've never seen a David Lynch film before. What are they like?' And I thought, 'She is either very lucky or she is going to have a horrible night.' Or both. I remember the first time I saw Eraserhead. It was playing on the midnight movie circuit when I was in college. After I stumbled out of the theater I realized that my perception of the world had changed, perhaps unalterably. The movie knocked on some of the darkest doors in my psyche, and I didn't like that one bit. At least at first. Then I noticed that there were times in my life when I could sit back and say, 'This is life imitating Eraserhead.' There was a bizarre comfort in that. A friend persuaded me to see Eraserhead again about a year later. The second viewing revealed a deep level of comedy I had completely missed the first time. ("Do I just cut them up like regular chickens?") By the end of the second viewing I knew I would seek out whatever this guy might put forth. And I am ever so glad I did. Okay. Back to Inland Empire. The only thing I can say, really, is that the best way to see this movie is to just sink into it. Let it wash into you. Don't try to figure it out. Don't try to find linear threads, clues, connections. The movie exists in its own space, dimension, world, and time. It is, at times, too close. It is, at time, achingly beautiful. It is, at times, exceedingly funny. It is, at times, unutterably dark. If you have seen a David Lynch movie in the past and have stomped away from the theater saying, "It doesn't mean anything! It's stupid! David Lynch is just being cryptic for no reason at all!" then I suggest that you stick with movies where the hero is easily recognized as such, his girlfriend always wears pretty clothes and everything turns out just right in the end. Because you are not going to get that in a David Lynch movie. Things will not be spelled out for you in block letters. Today may turn into tomorrow, and there may be no way the beginning of the movie can exist in the same world as the end of the movie. There may be images that are startlingly disturbing, but with no clear explanation as to why they are there. You need to be willing to let the images be the images, let the sounds be the sounds, and let the experience be the experience. That is the way to enjoy a David Lynch film. And this one is the Lynchiest of them all. I loved the fact that the comments David Lynch provided after the movie were not explanations, or a key to symbols, or anything that would tell us how to interpret the movie. Someone asked him point-blank: "Will you tell me what it means so I don't have to go to the internet to find out?" And he said, "It's on the poster." ("A woman in trouble") She said, "Is that all I'm going to get?" And he said, "That's all you're going to get." There was a round of chuckles in the audience. I think DL may have felt a little bad for being that terse, so he went on to say, "Everyone sees a movie in his own way. No one's experience is any more right or wrong than anyone else's. I don't talk about my films after they're finished, because I don't want to turn film back into words." I think I know what he means. After you spend so much time conveying thoughts - via words - into actions, sounds and images, it seems backwards and pointless to reverse that whole process.So.Watch Inland Empire. Go with your mind empty. Don't expect anything. Let the movie carry you along on its own tide. When the movie is over, get out of the boat and go home. You don't need to know any more than that.I think this film is one of the purest expressions of art that I have seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>there's never a lynch mob when you need one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it - Lynch has lost the plot! Better still, Lynch should be lynched. I mean he had already lost the plot to a certain extent in films like Lost Highway, maybe Mulholland Drive, definitely Twin Peaks, but at least there, there was something interesting going on in the background.Inland Empire, conversely, can only be described as, what one of my more eloquent companions said to me as he walked out after a whole gut-bleeding seventy minutes, 'utter w*nk'. It is three hours of cerebral masturbation on Lynch's part. However, my eloquent friend did mention as a plus to the film, the opening credits which were rather enjoyable in their technically efficient 30 second display.Lynch has like many 'auteurs' of his age progressed towards the 'self-deifying' stage of his career. No wonder he had to go to Poland. It's a lot cheaper there, and God is a superstar. The language barrier no doubt helped too when trying to offer a (non) plot synopsis of what was going on. Is it any wonder Lynch had to fund this project on his own? That no-one with a right mind would contribute towards it? And Jeremy Irons, what can we say, for a hammy has-been who wishes to ingratiate himself with the Lynch mob? Desperate stuff! The film (at least the first seventy minutes - but I think I can safely speak for the ensuing unseen 102 too) is an absolute catastrophe in every way. The digital camera-work (a significant way of cutting costs) is a disaster (too many close-ups) too much haziness, very unclear, jittery, unsteady, overly didactic (it is after all Lynch's first outing with the thing); the old repetitive accented 'room tone thing' and industrial drone in the background (c'mon David, we've been here before in practically every outing, let's shake it up a bit and move on shall we), the shifty pauses, the menacing eyes - the formula is done and dusted, and yet back he comes, derivative of himself (oh, what avant-garde wonders await us?) with what is arguably a cheaper nastier looking product of his previous (virtuous) Lost Highway, and at twice the length. Insinuating his own shorts like 'Rabbits' into the flesh of the film for no obvious reason whatsoever is akin to admitting they were so utterly devoid of any cinematic quality in the first place that this was the only way he could have them published (apart of course from subscribing to his website where such wonders await in abundance).The problem with making plot less non-sense like this is that it fools or perhaps cheats the unknowing audience into thinking that it is they who are stupid, that it is they who 'don't get it', and yet somehow should, that in amongst it all there is an Ariadnic thread that if followed will lead to the exit and an understanding. But there is no exit, or else every door is an exit. In other words, it's a cop-out from someone who perhaps has found the thread in a threadless mind and is so overwhelmed at his own magnificence that he surely must make a three hour film of it and show everyone just how bloody clever he is. The audience doesn't understand that it is supposed to not understand. They don't get the fact that the fact that they don't get it is the whole purpose. If he isn't having a laugh Lynch is almost certainly certifiable, with these deluded musings of a puerile mind.As a footnote to the above, the tricky premise of not getting the story also craftily creates the possibility of repeated viewings, thus doubling, tripling income for the makers. In the era of crass capitalism why get someone to simply watch a film once (at the cinema) when you can get them to watch it five times (at the cinema) and four times on DVD? The irony of it all, and this is the true beauty of this imperious landlocked effort, is that despite Mr. Lynch's berating of a Hollywood as a place, as a methodology, he forgets that Hollywood is more than this - it is a state of mind, one which craves and thrives upon publicity, attention, fame, notoriety. As far as this is concerned Lynch is Hollywood, and could not be anything other than Hollywood.For readers of this, stick to the blue velvets and lost highways, and even some wilderness at heart, (no-one can deny him these little triumphs) but forget any inland empire. It is a travesty, and an embarrassment to an otherwise respectable cinematic catalogue.</fullReview>

Pour and drip a la Jackson Pollock all over a blank canvas...and there's INLAND EMPIRE.This is easily Mr. Lynch's most esoteric film since Eraserhead, but much more intense. Imagine the last 40 minutes of Mulholland Dr. expanded over three hours, folded over and over on itself...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch's Digital Video Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exhaustingly ambitious, mind-bending and deliberately ugly-looking 3-hour Hollywood satire/horror epic, shot on super cheap digital video by madman filmmaker David Lynch and starring Laura Dern in complex dual roles, is the kind of once-in-a-lifetime movie that seems to have been crafted in another dimension entirely, where traditional narrative rules don't apply and basic visual language has been vomited up into nerve-wracking anti-cinema. It is a truly maddening, singular experience, and one most audiences would never want to subject themselves to. But it is fascinating, filled with bizarre thrills and an incredible lead performance that somehow manages to anchor the entire film, even when it is impossible to logically comprehend.Laura Dern plays Nikki Grace, an aging Hollywood actress with a sinister Polish husband who is cast in the lead role (alongside Justin Theroux) in a corny drama about adultery that is discovered to be a remake of a Polish film based on a cursed gypsy folktale that was never completed because the lead actors were mysteriously murdered. It's not too long before Nikki is confusing herself with her character Susan Blue and the film essentially free-falls into intense insanity for two straight hours. Nikki/Susan become trapped in some terrifying, unstable version of the film she's making, where time collapses in on itself and its story (which is never even made completely clear) winds and twists around itself endlessly, yet with new details and narrative strands constantly emerging, as if its own plot has become a cancer. Sometimes she can witness previous incarnations of the story set in Poland if she burns a cigarette hole through a piece of silk. Other times she sees or runs into other versions of herself. Her shady husband, who remains her spouse in the movie universe, seems to be up to no good, but is he actually helping in some way? She hangs out with a group of young prostitutes at her house, two of which act as guides through this terror. In an inter-cut future time line the film eventually catches up with, she sits in a dank interrogation room clutching a screwdriver, talking about her life and making even more of a narrative mess out of the head-spinning story in stunningly performed, foul-mouthed monologues that prove Laura Dern is an acting powerhouse. Also people keep getting murdered with screwdrivers. And there's a sitcom with people in rabbit costumes spouting non sequiturs (laugh track and all) relevant to what is going on only in the most abstract way. And there's a scary Polish man, The Phantom, or maybe his name is Crimp and he's Susan's neighbor, or maybe he's a man who once worked at the circus, who seems to be controlling all of this for nefarious and unexplained reasons. Oh and there's a crying woman trapped in a hotel room watching all of this on a TV.That's about as coherently as I can describe the plot, and that still doesn't touch on like half of the mammoth thing. It is dense and gnarled and unhinged in exhilarating ways that modern cinema rarely strives for. With crude tools, game actors and endless imagination, there's a freedom present that is refreshing, even when it's a debilitating experience. Lynch, continuing his fascination with unanswerable mysteries (see also Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr.) has crafted his purest expression of narrative implosion, in which the fearful and confused feeling of being lost in a terrible waking nightmare is more important than piecing together its myriad threads (which is frankly impossible). That being said, there is an easy tendency to throw ones hands up and declare the thing to be random nonsense, when it really isn't. It actually sticks rather close to itself and its premise all of the way through; this sense that it is nothing but random scenes and images ignores the connective tissue running between every sequence, even when it isn't progressing in order. And in a dazzling third act, after its chaotic ever-changing middle hour, the film adopts a sort of real time perspective that follows Susan/Nikki, almost like a video game, as she fulfills her requirements in her "role" and breaks the cursed story chain. It doesn't necessarily make "sense", but there's a progression here, a story that runs forward even as it's concurrently running in every other direction. It is an amazing cinematic feat, about the power of stories and the performances inside of them. It's often hideous digital video photography, at odds with all of Lynch's previous gorgeously shot films, works when you consider he is attempting to literally break free from cinematic constraints. To make a film about film and Hollywood storytelling shot in a deliberately un-cinematic style and breaking all storytelling rules creates something truly transgressive and unique. When it was released 9 years ago, it was criticized for its murky, often hideous photography, but it actually seems kind of ahead of the curve now, considering the prevalence of sloppy looking hand-held digital films now on the mainstream market. And even with such low resolution and clearly cheap production value, it can still sometimes look rather beautiful in a harsh, unpolished way. It's one of the most experimental and thought-provoking American films of the 2000's and worth watching from any serious cinephile or adventurous film-goer. Having seen Lynch's previous films certainly helps, otherwise you're really in for a shock.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surrealism at its finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dali loved confusion and believed it was necessary to surrealist art. David Lynch has truly succeeded in communicating that in this film. The story revolves around an actress who has an affair with her co-star and begins to lose touch with reality. Well, that's the plot on a surface level. Lynch has created a movie that has a plot that you can pick up on while watching the film, but is completely impossible to fully explain afterward. He bombards the viewer with an unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere and reoccurring images, words, and sounds that are only very loosely connected and mean nothing besides what you give them in your own mind. The viewer makes connections and draws inferences and conclusions subconsciously while his/her very confused conscious mind tries to make sense of the film. This makes each viewing of Inland Empire completely subjective.This movie is only what you take from it. A true surrealist masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A VERY Important Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest stab at surrealist film since the Cremaster Cycle. For Lynch, just after filming Mulholland Drive, to go all out and make three hours worth of non-interconnected, abstract, surrealist, subjective vignettes is bold. The experience of this film, as long as you do not try to make sense of it is absolutely mesmerizing. The best recent exhibition of a dream sequence that I have ever seen. It is unlike anything else released to the main stream. Its as if Lynch took all of his little abstract scenes from his most famous movies and compiled it into one. It cannot be made sense of, it is purely small fragments of someones recalled consciousness. And oh so beautiful. It is just pure expression and no director but Lynch would dare make it today. If you want to see how far the medium of film can be pushed, watch this goddamn film. It's so beautiful and yet at times so terrifying and thrilling. This film changed what I thought a film should be. What, oh what a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inland Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some David Lynch fans, Inland Empire will be the ultimate Lynch movie. It takes the non-linear, abstract style of storytelling he tested in Lost Highway and perfected in Mulholland Drive and stretches it as far as it can go. If those two earlier films teetered on the edge of incoherence, Inland Empire absolutely takes the plunge. It is a 3-hour, amorphous odyssey - a primordial soup of Lynchian themes and images. This is unfiltered, unrestrained David Lynch, so be warned - if you were not a fan of his previous bizarre movies, stay far away from this even stranger, more cryptic piece of work.If someone were to straightforwardly ask me whether or not I like Inland Empire, I would have no idea how to reply. I don't like that it's 3 hours long. There really is no reason for Empire to be so epic in length - the same mind-bending effect could have been achieved with an hour cut out. Long sections are tedious and add very little to character development or atmosphere. I also have mixed feelings about the digital images - one of the main strengths of Mulholland Drive was the velvety richness of its images. Inland Empire is too often grainy, ugly, or incomprehensibly dark. There are times when the digital images are stunningly detailed and clear, but I still yearned for the visual beauty of past Lynch films. However, sections of Inland Empire roar to life. Lynch's surrealism ranges from darkly funny to downright terrifying - there are scenes and images to be found here that I'll never forget. Also, Laura Dern gives a fearless performance. Like Naomi Watts in Mulholland Drive, she is called upon to play multiple different personalities in the span of one film, and she is more than up to the challenge.If you are a Lynch fan, by all means see Inland Empire. Classic Lynch moments abound here, but for me they did not cohere into a satisfying whole.</fullReview>

But for me it's not really better than 'Mullholland Drive' or 'Lost Highway', maybe it's an attempt to exceed this last perfect movies.The art of movies in Lynch's understanding is better represented in this two movies, i think.

On another note i think it is atrocious that Australians have to wait so long for the release of films. Back to the film though, If you've made it this far, you are most probably a lynch fan. Laura Dern has come a long way since blue velvet, she is so fantastic here. I love the DV cinematography, the lighting, the music, and Jeremy Irons is also fantastic here. The film is remarkably scary and unpredictable. It's like a drug trip through hell, which only Lynch can provide.Recommendation: For lover of Alternative Cinema</fullReview>

To appreciate the disjointed complexity of Inland Empire, imagine splicing one-hour segments of three totally unrelated films together in any order or any number of splices. Then try to explain the resultant 3-hour mix to someone. Now you have an idea of what it's like to experience Inland Empire. "Experience" is the operative word, because you don't watch it, but you sense it. I could watch this DV countless times and would still not understand it, but that's not important in this case.

		<shortDescription>The film is a pretty interesting thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So you have the director, played by Justin Theroux, who is obviously supposed to be Cameron Crowe, and you have the actress, longtime Lynch companion Naomi Watts, who is obviously supposed to represent Cameron Crowe's ex-wife, Nancy Wilson. Cameron Crowe writes a film for her, to win her over, and casts her in the lead role. Pretty straight forward where this leads off to, some interesting twists, paranoia, a couple of Jungian dream sequences, maybe a dance interlude, I can't remember. Then at the same time, a victim of the sex-trade industry in Poland is kept captive in a motel room for the night, and the film playing on the television is the same film that is being filmed by Naomi Watts. Through Lynchian logic, the Polish girl summons Naomi through her image on the television into the room, and the two of them attempt to solve a murder mystery that has a peculiar similarity to another case going on back home in LA. It's all very easy to follow, though byzantine, Lynch has struck gold with his ability to tell a cohesive story and still be sadistically erotic. A good Hollywood meta-thriller, with great production values all the way across the board, from Lynch, who is filming on a hand-held camera, to Lara Flynn Boyle, who some might say reprises a "version" of her role from "Twin Peaks", even down to Terry Crews from "Everybody Hates Chris", making his dramatic role debut as a clever conman on the streets of paradise in the film within the film. Look no elsewhere for a solid block of fun, a little long in the expositional dialogue, but it's so snappily edited and framed you'll look back and go, huh? How could I not have seen that coming? Sort of thing. 10/10 A+ murder mystery</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like to approach Lynch films by asking, "What's real?" One key to Inland Empire is the recurring question, "Look at me and tell me if you've seen me before" If we keep in mind that the film is not revealed in normal time order, then we can try and assemble what this expression is all about.Who says it? We see prostitutes say it first in a mocking way. Who are they mocking? Later we see the prostitutes answering the question by saying, "Yes. We will do that?" And laughing. Again mocking.The Dern character is the only one who is in earnest when asking the question. Inland Empire is a journey of madness and when Dern as prostitute emerges from one of her flights of imagination, she finds herself among a group of strange women she doesn't recognize. This is when she asks them, "Do you know me? Do you recognize me?" The prostitutes have heard it so many times they can see it coming and sometimes beat her to the question.The life of prostitution is real; everything else is prologue or fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inland Empire (2007)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "The Mind Of The Maker", Dorothy Sayers likened a writer allowing free will to his characters to God allowing free will to mankind. No filmmaker has taken that premise to such surrealistic and beautiful lengths as David Lynch, that Annie Sullivan of consciousness, who still, by his own admission, has nothing but the vaguest of ideas of what some of his unanimously brilliant films are even about.Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) and her co star, Devon (Justin Theroux) learn that the film they've just been slated to star in is actually a remake of a feature that was never finished...the two original leads having been murdered. The plot of their film itself, in fact, is revealed to be based on an ancient legend of the old country. It is a tale that is reputed to be cursed...to mean death for those who take on its roles.A love affair may or may not be taking place. A subplot involving prostitutes may or may not be crossing through time from sepia tinted 1930s Poland to materialize on a harsh Hollywood street in the 21st century. Infidelity...with nemesis, self, or lover...may or may not have culminated in a succession of horrific crimes of passion.The characters who populate "Inland Empire" are living in the moistness of a nightmare, so dissociated and terrorized that they move about brightly in its smears like blurred lights. There are hollow, empty shots of harsh, iridescent late night inner city streets...that sickish, slick sheen streets have when one has nowhere to go, and is very tired. Other scenes...filtered through a strange, muted, unearthly sunlight (as in "Mulholland Drive" and "Lost Highway") seem to be hung ...to borrow a phrase from Flannery O' Connor...behind cobwebs. At other times, the graininess of digital video works perfectly for Lynch."Inland Empire" could be said to be about reincarnation, karma, or a Tibetan Book Of The Deadesque trip to heaven via various stages of atonement (like a series of seemingly impossible tasks given to a princess in Grimm); like most of Lynch's films, it has an overriding message of redemption and an extraordinary, schizophrenic religious beauty. It is also (&amp; surely unknowingly) a very profound exploration of the nuances of post traumatic stress, though in a way that's virtually impossible to classify: it's much like one would imagine being under hypnosis would be. There are multiple layers in the film, and each viewing peels back another. Laura Dern plays two, three, possibly more characters overlapping themselves, sometimes simultaneously; and she does it nothing short of brilliantly....this is, hands down, the performance of her career. Grace Zabriskie....best known as Mrs Palmer in "Twin Peaks".... is terrifying as a garbled persona exuding a malice absorbed by broad daylight. Her eyes...bulging, homicidal....seem to roll the house call she makes on Dern in the film's beginning around in their irises like lost marbles."Inland Empire", however, is not quite effortlessly seductive: it's a commitment. If you're not prepared to see the film a minimum of three times, you will miss 90 percent of it. Like Charlie Kaufman's "Synecdoche, New York", it is so crammed with sensory imagery &amp; subliminal messages, it's simply too much to process in a finite viewing. Its only downside is that it does suffer from serious editing issues in the upper to mid first half of the film (which 2 hours and 50 minutes long) the interminable tracking shots of corridors and superfluous footage of the making of "On High In Blue Tomorrows," the story's film within the film, quickly become tedious, but they're more than worth waiting out.The DVD is a gem, and contains 75 minutes of deleted scenes, several of which absolutely should have been in the film in lieu of the aforementioned gratuitous footage; they essentially constitute a second movie unto itself. There's also a making of featurette (much of which was later used in the recently released "Lynch 1" documentary). A couple of whimsical side tidbits including a cooking lesson with Lynch &amp; a spin with a ballerina and you've got yourself hours of viewing that's "wspania&#x142;y."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>INLAND EMPIRE. I was disappointed. I am a fan of David Lynch. However, this movie really is taking his experimentation out of the realm of any entertainment. The movie is far too self-indulgent. Laura Dern plays an actress who is desperate for a new role in an upcoming movie, and we learn the new movie is cursed. The last two lead players died. That was interesting enough, but then it just goes into total chaos, with Laura Dern just walking around through different corridors and hallways. She plays an actress, and then also a hooker and a housewife and she carries these off well despite having little to work with.The music is okay but over the top most of the time. Too many dream sequences so it becomes hard to care about the character. The worst part is how long it is. If it had just been 90 minutes, it might have been far better, even if it was shot on DV. But at 3 hours long, it was impossible to keep awake all that time. In conclusion, a few good scenes by Lynch, Laura Dern was good as usual, but the movie itself is too boring, hard to understand, and long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch's "Finnegan's Wake"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What on earth can be said about David Lynch's possibly most disorienting and mind-bending film? First of all, I must warn you not to approach this film if: a. You have never seen a David Lynch film before; b. You are looking for some lifeless romantic flick with Meg Ryan; c. You want to see a movie with a tangible and linear plot. Having said that, I can now say with confidence that this is David Lynch's second-greatest film (I find it very unlikely that he will make something that tops Mullholand Dr.) Full of red herrings, red lampshades and a bizarre Waiting-for-Godot-like sitcom featuring talking rabbits (voiced by the beautiful Naomi Watts, Laura Elena Harring and Scott Coffey) it is not an easy movie to digest. I do not suggest watching it in sections. Make time during the week, or maybe reserve a Friday night, and watch it in a dark room with order-in Chinese food. As I said in the title, this movie can best be described as David Lynch's "Finnegan's Wake". What I mean by that is that the movie is full of references to other films (both by Lynch and others) that, outside of context, seem very perplexing indeed. INLAND EMPIRE is essentially a labyrinth of (highly disturbing) images, ideas and dialog, which, when combined, make for a wild and puzzling experience. But , despite the disorienting plot and creepy atmosphere, INLAND EMPIRE is a profound film that pushes the boundaries on conventional cinema, and explores the idea of the creation of dreams (in the much larger, philosophical sense). David Lynch spoke in an interview of a quote from the Hindu text the Upanishads: "We are like the spider. We weave our life and then move along in it. We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives in the dream." It is this theory, the idea that we create our own destinies and live it out, like actors in our own play, that drives the film, and what, at its core, it explores. David Lynch has created a thing of beauty. It is truly a work of art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like David Lynch, but I thought this was really dull. It's the only film of his that I haven't loved. With his other movies, even if you don't get them, they look great, but this looks so ordinary, and the dialogue is comically cryptic. It seemed like a parody to me, and the one nude scene was really gratuitous. Laura Dern was fantastic, though, as were the other cast members. But, I don't know, call me a philistine, I just didn't like it. And I really wanted to. For me it was a case of The Emperor's New Clothes, what with the hype and all. I want to give it another chance, and I've seen it three times now, but it's really tested my patience. David, forgive me...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Way to Watch - Lynch's Exercise in Empathy (***Warning - Spoilers***)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We are about to delve into the mind of someone who is in a life or death struggle and must make some very important spot decisions if she is to survive. Perhaps she has been drugged beforehand; perhaps she must do something unspeakable and degrading to protect someone very important to her; but she is in great danger. She must muster all of her strength. Part of her is terrified. How does she do it? How does she survive?Lynch likes to ask this question: "How does he/she do it?" He is fascinated by the states of mind that allow individuals to behave in certain extraordinary ways in unusual situations. He wants to understand. He is very empathetic. In earlier pics, he has tried on the criminal mind: "How can a man brutally disembowel his wife and still look at himself in the mirror?" ("Lost Highway"); or "How does a woman who has taken a hit out on her lover cope with the guilt?" ("Mulholland Drive"). He gets right into the heads of these characters, to see, to show us. Now Lynch considers the victim's perspective: How does she do it? How does she survive?The trauma is very dissociative for our heroine, like an out-of-body experience. She is frightened enough that whatever happens, whatever she does, it is almost as though she is watching someone else have these experiences. She is just with it enough to focus on certain details that might help her should she survive - what does he look like...what is he wearing...green...a green coat...the hotel room...must remember that number...where does he keep the gun.....How does she do it? Part of her just walls itself off. It is almost infantile, this part, but she will keep all of her goodness and hope and love in this place - in her "Lost Girl" - safe from that SOB. Part of her feels guilty and dirty. This part tells her that she is "bad" and that perhaps she deserves whatever her tormentor has planned for her. Perhaps something happened to her long ago, something she has never confronted directly, something that was not her fault but that she blames herself for nonetheless. But she has this angry, victimized streak - her Sue - and she will either use its wrath to her immediate advantage or allow it to subsume her into despair.But our heroine is strong. She will overcome these feelings of guilt and shame. There is an actress she adores and admires and who always seems to pull through at the end. What would she do? What did she do in her different films, in her various roles? What has she done to hold together in her personal life as a tabloid starlet? What would Nicki do in this situation?So scary for our heroine. Maybe it'll all end just like that grisly story, the one that scared her so much as a girl.....but she can imagine herself as her idol and maybe just get through it. And so, to cope, she casts herself as her Nicki, playing the new role of Sue.Lynch digs right down into this character's head. Her mind races yet time seems as though it is molasses. Themes, plans, stories, fears, dreams, desires flood into and through her psyche, and Lynch imagines them for us exactly as he senses she would, in the same seemingly incoherent order and with the same distorted sense of time and place. That he is able to do so with such astonishing empathy and in ways that touch on so many other themes - well, welcome to the world of David Lynch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Japanese girl???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The greatest talent of David Lynch in my opinion is that he makes certain scenes so strong that they are seared into my mind for days (and sometimes for years and years). In Inland Empire that scene would definitely be the scene where Nikki/Susan lies on the street with a screwdriver in her stomach, and the tramps start talking about the bus to Pomona. It's something in the sad looks and the cluelessness of the Japanese girl that hit me hard. That whole scene is filmed in such a prolonged way, that the whole situation, the hopelessness of it all and the way Nikki dies almost looks utterly meaningless and normal. It's genius. David Lynch knows the human mind very well and he knows how to 'visualise' it in a way almost nobody can (except for Roman Polanski of course.) Alhough I would have enjoyed this film even more when it would have been shot in 35 mm, I could see the advantages of digital video in the loose result. (BUT WHY DIDN'T David LYNCH USE HD VIDEO.

		<fullReview>"Awesome" and "blown away" spring to mind...(i AM a David lynch fan, and i think its true, he won't win any new fans with this movie)***Possible SPOILER*** Everything seemed perfect, right from the opening frame, the light in the darkness and the title, huge and dark. Hard to comment on the plot, such as it is, but I did find myself thinking halfway through, that Inland Empire shares a lot with Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive - Lynch's psychogenic fugue trilogy? Now maybe you could argue that he has essential made roughly the same movie three times in a row, or you could just go along with him using the same themes (actually, it didn't strike me til last night that LH and MD do share the same premise - the protagonist does something bad, suffers a breakdown and builds a mental world to escape the consequences, a mental world that soon becomes corrupt and begins to crumble).As with most of Lynch's work, it seemed to me that absolutely nothing was wasted or inconsequential. There's a measured quality about the things he does, measured and meaningful and precise, every shot, every frame, every line, glance, pause, the camera angles, the use of music... it all MEANS something (at least within the context of the movie). Dialogue lines that might seem like a non-sequitor, that might seem like nonsense, are all written and placed exactly how Lynch wants them (I don't imagine there is much room for actors to ab-lib in his movies). Of course, these lines can seem puzzling to the outsider - early on in the movie I had the feeling of watching secret agents giving passwords, speaking in codes that only they understood. But as with Lynch's other work, if you just let yourself go with it, submerge yourself within the experience rather than watching the movie as a direct story, beginning-middle-end, then it all works.My only criticism at the moment would be the choice of using Jeremy Irons. Maybe that's because I don't particularly like him as an actor (although he is a good actor), he seemed a little out of place, his performance not as considered as would usually be found within a Lynch movie.Laura Dern, however, was fantastic, a really powerful bit of acting. And I don't think I have ever seen her looking as pretty as she does here, at least in the first part of the movie.It has been said before, and I think will be said with any Lynch project, but if you like him, then you'll like this. If not, avoid.I like him, and I love Inland Empire.</fullReview>

Think of Lynch at his most bizarre and then play that backwards at 30% speed. Then accidentally drop all the rushes on the floor and randomly put them back in the projector so they're no longer even remotely in order. This is Inland Empire.Remember how obscure his story lines in Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway were? Well they're Enid Blyton compared to this.In short do not go and see unless you really enjoy Lynch at his most obtuse. This is a three hour nightmare and every single moment is sheer horrific genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After four viewings I am certain: Inland Empire is a 10-star movie. I think that every time I watch it, I love it more. This isn't just a movie, it's an experience that puts you in a dream world, and it's oh so good. If I have to compare it to other movies, I'd say it's a raw version of Mulholland Dr., Eraserheadstyle. And these were also great and dreamy and kinda scary.Honestly, after my first Inland Empire, I was mostly stunned, thinking: 'what did I just watch?' and still I... wanted more. That's the strength of David Lynch's work, it draws you in and if you put yourself to it for several viewings, it's so rewarding. Everything he makes is so layered and you discover new things every time! I think Inland Empire is the most layered film I've ever seen. It's not about the plot at all, it's about the experience. I've read comments from people who are frustrated because they can't explain the movie, but this is irrelevant. It's surrealism. It's about the feeling, beauty, disturbing thoughts. It gets you in a buzz, 'on high'.Cinematographically, it looks a bit less perfect than most of Lynch's movies, due to the way it was filmed, but this really adds to the dream feel and increases the raw emotion a lot. The soundtrack is, of course, amazing. Every sound is perfectly matched to the pictures and emotions. When she walks outside in the cold: 'Ghost of Love'. The 'Locomotion' hookers. 'Black Tambourine' on Hollywood Blvd. The ending credits!Laura Dern deserves loads of credit as well, her acting is so raw and disturbing, there's no words to describe it. She quickly became one of my favourite artists after seeing her as Nikki Grace (and co).If you're either a fan of Lynch or surrealism or you like to be overwhelmed by atmosphere and you don't mind putting some effort in a movie evening, do yourself a favor and go for the experience, preferably more than once. Go to this place both wonderful and strange, it's really worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're able to watch Inland Empire in it's entirety it will be obvious that this is the movie David Lynch worked towards since Twin Peaks. This might have started earlier but is irrelevant for my review.What has been a non-linear narrative of Lost Highway and purporting surrealism of Mulholland Drive took full control of Inland Empire. Whether this has been a natural progression or David Lynch finally loosing it is subject of debate.The average viewer will have problems in sitting through the whole thing whereas a movie aficionado will be delighted. Since i count myself to the former group, my vote would be one star. However, Inland Empire hasn't been made with longing for Luke-warm reception, which adds one star for the artistic merit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slow Torture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years ago I went to see "Eraserhead" at my local flea-pit. The screening was late at night. Around midnight. Slouching into my seat, I counted the audience. There were eleven of them. After about 20 minutes one of them got up and walked out. I soon found myself repeatedly asking myself: "Why am I sitting here, watching this, alone, at this time of night?" There was no answer, but I sat through the entire flick, to the bitter end. An achievement, of which I was proud.In the case of "Inland Empire", I asked myself the very same question, although I was watching it at home, via DVD. I got quite a similar answer: ie none at all. But I failed to achieve what I had managed all those years ago, and simply couldn't last the distance. But then "Eraserhead" is only 1? hours long, whereas "Inland Empire" is a full 180 minutes. That's three hours. I just couldn't make it. In fact I gave up after only fifteen minutes. Although I did zip back and forth for spot checks here and there. It availed me nothing. The pacing of this movie was next to stationary. I also felt pain.Both these films are dogs, of the Andalusian breed. "Eraserhead", however, has a story, of a sort. If "Inland Empire" has one, it eludes me, and I don't feel tempted enough to find out what it might be. I know I couldn't sit through any more of those hours, desperately seeking to unravel meaning. On the other hand, Bu?uel had made it quite clear that he and Dali had had only one objective, which was that no idea or image should lend itself to a rational explanation of any kind. Good for them. That makes perfect, logical sense. It's a rational explanation.It is arguable that Lynch, in these films, uses cinema the way it should be used. It's a naturally surreal medium. It doesn't have to have meaning. I seem to remember even Hitchcock saying, somewhere, that he was just making pictures. He certainly didn't bother too often about plausible plot-consistency. I've read that Lynch has said in interviews that he thinks of the image first then works it into the movie. Well, I still miss the story. "Inland Empire" is for those who do not need one. They can perhaps find one, inside themselves. You will like this, if this is the sort of thing you like. I hope this verdict has been helpful.Three stars, in case the star system isn't working.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>big troubles in Inland Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of the people label this film as "meaningless" and "ugly". I see the exact opposite. It's loaded with symbols and meanings and some of the shots were amazingly beautiful. Other than David Lynch, I don't know who else can pull that off with a camcorder... Laura Dern deserved an Oscar but sadly she didn't get nominated. That's Hollywood for you. There're so many brilliant moments in this movie that it was a bit overwhelming for me. The conversation between Sue and the old woman was really gripping and it set the tone for me. As far as the rabbit sitcom was concerned, well, I've always felt that way towards sitcoms: fake and creepy. I think that scene was simply there to carry the audience deeper into the "rabbit hole", so to speak. TV programming essentially is the programming of the mind. When the mind falls into pieces, you have Schizo, or MPD, which unfortunately was/is the underlying mental issue for a lot of the Inland Empire dweller. Nikki was one of them. She fell far into the rabbit hole of being someone else. "A woman in trouble". Well, what more trouble can you have than mistaking YOURSELF for someone else? The same trouble happened to the Polish prostitute...Mulholland Drive touched upon the same theme but it was more sugar coated. This time I guess David decided to go all the way and it came out just fine. He's been trying to say one thing in his entire career and he finally said it in IE, with volume and beauty. The fact the film was deliberately overlooked by the academy suggests something. What is it? You have to watch it and find out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just stopped the DivX player at exactly the mid point, there's still 90 minutes left. I'm giving it 6 stars as a movie experience, but it rates 10 as a personal experience. Why the difference? Well, it's simply not my experience, it's David Lynch's. It so completely springs from, reveals, respects David's personal unique psyche, with no concessions to anyone else's concerns. I respect that. However, its jarring, shocking rhythms have me very guarded and closed down. At this point I can't see myself trusting the director, his film, or myself enough to lower my defenses and fully experience its intense moments. Apparently David is trusting his cinematic mastery enough to have its sublime horror freely flow into me, but it doesn't quite seem to recognize the extent of it's intimidating, off putting method. It's not so much inviting or coaxing me in as it is taunting and heckling me... ......OK, after pondering what I wrote in the above paragraph, I've just re-watched the first 90 minutes plus the next 51 because I had what I'm sure is a revelation. I can't reveal the details of what I've discovered, but I will say that the first 3 scenes - the two in Poland, and then the one at Nikki Grace's home, especially - are absolutely crucial for grasping what occurs thereafter. There's a trick, a device at work there that sets the viewers awareness at just the proper focus. If you miss it, and it's very easy to miss it - at least it was for me - you'll be floundering in a macabre vortex. Having now caught that early subtle clue I have gotten "on track." Before my moment of clarity, this film was an incessant assault of jumbled neurotic drama. But now it's a gently unfolding, elegantly catered cerebral banquet. No, I'm kidding about that. It's still a threatening nightmarish voyage, but now I'm keeping up, grasping and intuiting the cryptic changes and obsessive motion and not suffocating under dense layers of hysteria. IE without a doubt, if you manage to "get on board", is the most logical, rational, entirely explicit film David has yet crafted. It's as though I've gained passage onto a meticulously engineered psycho-sexual roller-coaster. And so far, it's been an absolutely harrowing ride; creeping up, rocketing down and swooping through the labyrinthine caverns, galleries and cupboards of Lynch's formidably Gothic psyche. David Lynch is now proving himself to be a clinically deliberate conjurer of the most elusive but formidable terrors. Franz Kafka, Francis Bacon and Russ Meyer have transmogrified into a hideously effective maestro. Also, a nice slab of Hitchcock's in there, too.The following paragraph I wrote before my "revelation", when I had yet only seen half the film, and have decided to not delete it because it still holds water for the points it makes...It's not that I can't handle Lynch's brand of grotesque delirium, "Eraserhead" is one of the most intense, complete cinematic experiences of my life. I think in all his following features he's gotten more mature, obscure, and slicker, but I simply don't trust these qualities as much as I do the more naive, direct, raw ones of his first feature. "Blue Velvet" was more accessible, theatrical, and therefore much more popular, but suffers in comparison from an excess of style. It's lurid imagery, freakish characters and graphic dialog are unique to David's work, and indelible aspects of American cinema, but I think the cumulative effect of "Blue Velvet's" carnivalesque eccentricities ultimately undercuts its guiding tone of wondrous horror. "Eraserhead's" frightful oddities, quirky players, and oppressive discomfort combine to accurately express a more vague, terrible reality. "Blue Velvet's" method of a series of choreographed sinister tableaux pays homage to the great tradition of Film Noire, and it's very fun, but this concession to traditional cinematic conventions pushes it into the realm of parody. Parody can be powerful. The sitcom parody "Rabbits" that appear "on TV" here is so wonderfully, horrendously disturbing on its own, but any of its parodic impact is diluted into the rest of this film's frantic currents......Again, having written the above paragraph before having "adjusted my awareness" I'd like to stress that so far, 141 minutes into it, "Inland Empire" absolutely towers above all of Lynch's previous efforts. The unity and integrity of its elements, the fresh "right now" harshness of digital video, the outrageously masterful exploitation of Laura Dern's persona - largely the creation of Lynch himself - all in the service of a devastatingly profound experience. David Lynch has produced his slickest, obscurest, most mature film, but this time it's all working magically. Even if the next 38 minutes take an unforeseen disastrous turn, the film still will be a monumental cinematic achievement, a remarkable accomplishment. Chief among its many virtues is that it has artfully exposed a genuinely unrecognized, repressed, but essential truth of American society. I won't say what this truth is because it's the ultimate spoiler, the best part of experiencing this graphic exorcism. The paradoxical clarity of this film deserves doctoral theses, its mastery of form a MacArthur Grant, and its penetrating and revolutionary insight into the American psyche a Nobel Prize of some kind (pause for thunderous applause). A very important realization is now that I see the film as much more linear and cinematic, those horrendous "Rabbits" are no longer a queer irrational addendum, but rather an essential element whose deviously absurd presence serves a "sacred" purpose. I hope to soon attend further sermons.Finally, once keyed into its wavelength, it is in fact that wondrously horrible experience that all his other films have reached for. A seductively familiar yet menacingly alien parallel world. Soul Shattering. Utterly unique. Notice that I have now awarded it a full 10 stars. This misunderstood film will terrorize the psyches of Lynch fans for a long time. Now, back to the final 38 minutes of Axxon.N...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Empire of the Mind' ...makes perfect sense!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lynch's most recent, enigmatic movie tells a touchingly powerful story and is his best work to date. He uses characters, settings, dialog and sounds like a graffiti artist uses coke cans to create art on a street mural. You have to step back from the movie and see its parts as a mosaic of a bigger picture to "get" this movie. The main story isn't hidden.A woman commits adultery, becomes pregnant and is found out because, unknown to her, her husband can not father children. The matter comes to a head in a struggle and she kills him but loses her unborn child. The woman pleads self defense and is exonerated by the police but her guilt follows her for ten long years, eating away at her mental stability causing her to be less and less functional until she arrives at a state of catatonic schizophrenic confusion.This is the point at which we encounter this 'Woman in Trouble' and the movie is Lynch's portrayal of her experience in the most complete 1st person narrative style ever. I believe Lynch takes us into this woman's mind, not at the time of the events, but presently! As she sits alone in front of a continually on TV. She is recalling and imagining this affair and betrayal over and over again in her head, searching for a better end. Her thoughts are aided by the TV so we see different genres of TV shows manifested. Theses thoughts are what are part of the longest "running radio play in history..." Longest running because that is all she has been in her mind for a decade.Along with her memories and fantasies we also see certain elements of her psyche which have arisen over the years and represent different aspects of her personality struggling to control her actions. These Jungian archetypal elements include the Phantom, LG and LB among others.Seen as an entirely first person look into the "thoughts" of a guilt ridden adulterer and murderess, the movie makes perfect sense.INLAND EMPIRE is indeed the Empire of the Mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The safety net is now taken away from everyone: from the actors, the audience, the director himself, and from Hollywood! All recipients now are conditioned as hostages, and no one will attempt to rescue anyone! The dream and the nightmare start now! Inland Empire is not a remake, although it has earlier unmistakable marks registered by its auteur, and as an auteur, Lynch never intends to end his work. Dream or nightmare, both collide within his poetry! A remake is made for several reasons, but the main one is to review its original idea and after its accomplishment, most of its originality is gone. Inland Empire is the most truthful review of David Lynch's life as a movie-maker and a person. The movie drifts into multiple dimensions between reality and fiction. Variations of this multi-dimensional views of reality are shown by how Lynch's characters degrade into a sort of life's multi-dimensional-prostitution, or the so called degradation of capitalism in Hollywood. Laura Dern dives down into this multi-dimensional and desperate worlds where she plays most of the suffering women characters through the film. The first dimensional character is a Californian actress who gets to play as the lover of a married man (Justin Theroux) in a remake of an old Hollywood picture. In a second dimension (like a nightmare) Laura plays an American wife of a Polish immigrant, where she talks to a mute psychiatrist living more a reflection of an agonized world. One the multiple-dimensional character Laura Dern plays is killed by the cheated wife of the Hollywood picture, played by Julia Ormond. And then, right over the Hollywood Hall of Fame, the character of this Californian actress dies! For Lynch, the scene where Laura dies is meant to be the death of the American Dream and Hollywood. Suddenly, the remake where the Californian actress dies, seems to return to a whole new dimension. Lynch creates a moment of complete emptiness and darkness by slaughtering one of his characters surrounded by the Walk of Fame stars! The most frightening moment is yet to come. When Laura enters the world of the American-polish wife, she also enters the Rabbits scenario (the one with the triangular love scene), and then she kills the Polish pimp (which is the start point and the end as well). And for that she frees the polish prostitute for good, from the pimp and the polish husband. Laura plays a figment of several women under David Lynch's perspectives. It seems that Lynch is trying to portrait his understanding of what he could see from his childhood till nowadays in various situations how much women suffered. This film is his most personal and most truthful homage towards art, women, and social beliefs!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching a Lynch movie is not an activity one takes lightly. One must prepare for this event. This is not a movie you take your significant other to for a relaxing escape or adventure. This is not a movie that you can do research on to find out what it is about -- the tagline reads simply "A Woman In Trouble", and that is about all you can gleam from any attempt at a review of the plot. Indeed, after a screening of the movie at some venue, the director was available for questions. One viewer took the opportunity to try and find out what was just witnessed by asking Lynch directly to which the response was that it was about "A Woman In Trouble". So, how does one prepare? One approaches the movie with an open mind and lets the movie invade one's own Inland Empire -- how you react is up to you, but the point is that you do react, you ask yourself questions, and you find the movie playing in your head days after the actual physical act of watching the movie is over.The movie itself provides one hint as to how to reflect: put on the watch, light the cigarette, fold the silk, burn a hole, then look through all the way until you find yourself immersed in the images on the other side. This provides the connection between you, the movie watcher, and the movie. But what happens when the movie you are watching is watching other movies and things start to fold in on themselves? You go along for the ride and see where you end up.Yes, it is most easily recognizable as a film by Lynch. Certain scenes take you back to most all of his previous works, not in plot, but in atmosphere. Lynch's characteristic elements are present: women in trouble, moody music, the red curtains, and actions taken to the extreme.At this point, how I view the film is as follows. Lynch is a master at challenging the viewer -- challenging the viewer to watch a movie in a different way and challenging the viewer to continue to think about the imagery after the fact and its effect. Lynch chose to shoot the movie digitally which magnifies certain aspects that are not present otherwise. He chose a way of making the movie that was less structured than any other form of movie making. I think to some degree, Lynch's form of meditation is invading his Inland Empire.Lynch is very guarded with explanations about any of his films. I think he would say that the more you talk about what was meant, the less power the movie has for the viewer. With Lynch's way, you can view the movie in a different way each time.So, I think with respect to direction, the movie is exceptional. With respect to acting, I think Laura Dern provides an exceptional performance as much of the movie is concerned with her perceptions. Jeremy Irons, Harry Dean Stanton, and Justin Theroux all provide well-done supporting roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch is insane, INLAND EMPIRE is insane, and *I* am insane. And loving it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you thought Lost Highway (1997) was stretching the boundaries of narrative cohesion, David Lynch's INLAND EMPIRE makes it look like an episode of Diagnosis Murder. Lynch has now completely surpassed the boundaries of producer-influenced cinema, to present a film completely under his own terms. And whilst Lynch has never been one to make particularly audience friendly films (his debut was Eraserhead, after all), watching all three hours of this terrifying mind-maze of a film will do nothing to entice anyone other than die hard Lynchians. And speaking as a die hard Lynchian myself, frankly, who cares? Because INLAND EMPIRE, in as insane a way as possible, is one mind-maze you will not want to miss.The tagline of the movie is "A woman in trouble", and the plot of the film, as much as it can be explained, centres on Nikki Grace (Laura Dern in a fantastically demented performance), a Hollywood actress who has seen better days. She gets role in a remake of an unfinished Polish movie called 47, which was abandoned after both leads mysteriously met a grizzly end. She is soon visited by a strange neighbour (played by Grace Zabriskie), who tells her that the film is not a melodrama, but a murder mystery.Whilst INLAND EMPIRE is three hours long, it appears to exist in some sort of breach of the space-time continuum. At one stage, Nikki is on set, when she and her co-stars, spot a "darkness" in the set. Curiosity desperately getting the better of her, she wanders over to it, and vanishes into it. For the next 2 ? hours, the narrative jumps between scenes of a girl crying in a hotel room, whilst watching an existential sitcom about rabbits (which was actually taken from David Lynch's website), and Laura Dern herself who appears to have become several different characters. At one point, she may be a hooker on Hollywood boulevard, and in other scenes she appears to be the victim of an abusive husband. She even manages to wind up in the original Polish movie, which is where the film is at its most enigmatic.INLAND EMPIRE is like a being trapped in David Lynch's nightmares for an evening, with everything making perfect sense to the nocturnal mind. This is not to say that there isn't meaning to it, but the film's meaning, and deciphering it, is completely subjective to most people. Everybody sees their own film; whether that means being so weirded out after the opening ten minutes or being so perplexed, as to be compelled to carry on with the journey, it would be completely spurious to suggest that INLAND EMPIRE was not effective. Lynch films don't have to be about anything other than the moment, and INLAND EMPRIE is a movie of moments. They may add up to something, it is your choice whether you choose to look for meaning, or simply embrace the surrealism of it all. It may never make sense to you. But then, nightmares don't make sense. They jump from place to place, and the people in them say things that don't necessarily apply to conscious thinking. See it once to take it all at eye view's length. Then see it again to try and comprehend the mind-maze Lynch has constructed. Unlike his masterpiece Mulholland Drive, there are no clues this time. And being in that cinema, you feel nothing but the vibrating terror of INLAND EMPIRE's industrial soundtrack. Whether it arrests you into a state of aesthetic wonder, however, is entirely upto how far you dare venture into Lynch's mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I love this movie. It has been said that women don't like this movie.This is easily the most inaccessible Lynch film but also the most memorable movie I've seen in a long time.The only perceived "flaws" are that it sometimes drags and it was super grainy, home video like. But i totally forgot about those as the movie went on. Like Kubrick, Lynch has a way of commanding your respect and ensuring you that you are in the hands of the consummate auteur. While I don't pretend to have understood the film upon first viewing, I felt that everything, including perceived "flaws", were there for a reason.Some of the most original images and sounds ever committed to film and also some of the scariest and shocking things I've seen in a long time, watch it if you embrace the unknown and take comfort in being challenged.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly any words to describe how bad this is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By Lynch I adored Mulholland Drive (seen it countless times), loved Lost Highway (repeated viewings also) and liked Elephant Man. I didn't like Blue Velvet. I've never quite fallen to the assumption that Lynch's movies are supposed to have a certain meaning. I think that's his intention, to confuse viewers and make them talk about his movies and making various theories about what was the true meaning of one of his films. As far as I was concerned, his movies were creepy for the sake of it and thought they beautifully succeeded that, this is good enough for me. It's not like if they did have a hidden meaning, that would be revealing the recipe to a live forever potion. I was mindfuck*ed, creeped out, and that's good enough. However, after seeing this (or rather, just half) of this absolute pile of turds, I've lost all respect for this director and won't be seeing any of his films ever again. And I'm doubting the movies I have actually liked by him. After my boyfriend told me this has a 7 rating and Lynch made it, I knew it had to be some overrated nonsense. If it were a good movie made by Lynch it would have been at least an 8. I knew from the first 10 minutes what bullshit this movie is but I sat (albeit not very still or attentive) through one hour and 25 minutes of it, just for the sake of it, to see how bad it could get, and than turned it off an went to sleep. I can't even begin to describe why this movie is so bad. It doesn't make ANY sense (unlike his other creepy movies that had somewhat of a story line, however broken it was) and it's NOT CREEPY. It's just stupid. I feel sorry for Jeremy Irons to have played in such a waste of time of pretentious nonsense. There are two possibilities to this: either Lynch has lost his mind OR he made this just to play a prank on people and laugh his a$$ off at the good reviews this gets just because it's signed by him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never jump from being startled. It is a quality which I am quite proud of and which has been tested countless times in my day to day life by a huge number of friends and co-workers in an infinite variety of situations. I jumped three times during this film. Struggling to piece together the clues being thrown at me, I feel as if I reached a heightened state of awareness, but also a vulnerability that I have not felt since adolescence. While I feel like a have a vague idea of what transpired during those 3 hours, I cannot shake the feeling that on some level I know exactly what happened, and that scares me more than any horror film ever did. My old friend terror is back after a 20 year absence, and in the small hours when my defenses are down he stares at me, expressionless, with knowing, deadpan eyes.Excellent film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Likely Lynch's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. This movie really rips the horror genre to shreds. Lynch masterfully splices and dices the narrative and never lets the viewer take a breath. It contains all the cliché elements of a cheap slasher movie; the nubile young women, the rusty weapon, torture, voyeurism, veiled threats, the creepy guys lurking around corners, the close up of the woman shrieking and even the dolly zoom (how the hell did he pull that off with a video camera?), but it shuffles these elements and their respective realities to such an extent that you find yourself inexplicably laughing at the whole deluded and hackneyed concept of a horror film. This isn't horror- this is America- which is even scarier. Dern is magnificent and it's a shame she doesn't work more often. Unbelievable that Lynch shot this on a $1000 video camera. I wonder if the numerous shots of 35mm Panaflex cameras (used in the shooting of the movie within the movie) represent gentle swipes at the industry, as if to say, "If I can make it look this good on video, what the hell do I need you schmuck producers for?" The atmospheric lighting effects and the sound seem grittier, more real than much of Lynch's other work. Also, while the film shares some plot points with 'Mulholland Drive', it ends up feeling more optimistic and freer, maybe just owing to Lynch's working sans the scrutiny of a studio. I'm reminded of Godard and Picasso. I think a revolution is intended here. If Lynch can do it, why not us?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been looking forward to this since I first heard about it and I was really not impressed. I do consider myself to be a David Lynch fan so I'm surprised that I don't like it myself. In the middle of watching it I was trying to figure out what was wrong. Was it the quality because it was shot on DV? Maybe. But then I thought it was the first time with him where it seemed like weirdness for the sake of being weird. Like David Lynch was trying to make a David Lynch movie just like some many others do. And then I thought maybe it's Laura Dern. The only other Lynch movie I don't really like is Wild at Heart. Then I thought about it some more and the star of a 3 hour movie about a woman in peril needs to be someone you can empathize with and I guess I have a problem with her in that way. I don't connect and when Julia Ormond appeared I realized that I do connect with her. So I thought what if she was the star? But you can't do that.As to the story, as I said I'm a Lynch fan, the storyline barely matters. But some things he's been over so many times it's just too much. Time doesn't really count for much in his universe I've known that for a long time. Her character blatantly saying as much made me feel like he was trying to suddenly be obvious. In fact it almost seemed like he was trying to redo Mulholland Dr. only uglier with reincarnated hookers and more of an Eraserhead feel to it. Cable has been showing his movies lately and Lost Highway was on again the other night. I rewatched it and maybe that was a bad thing leading into this because, comparatively speaking, this movie was downright awful. LH was so lush and dreamy with interesting characters. And this was rabbit people and Laura Dern. By the time the locomotion broke out it almost had me throwing things at my TV. I was actually considering going an hour out of my way to see this when it was in theaters. I'm glad I didn't.So if it's so bad why a 6/10? Because it's a David Lynch movie and the fact that he's still doing his own thing means something with all the other nonsense out there. It's still better than half of that stuff. But man, what a letdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost in Lynchland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who felt Lynch's last film, Mulholland Dr., was too easy, I present to you Inland Empire. The director takes the whole dream (or nightmare) narrative a step further and makes the narrative even more fragmented and impossible to follow. There might not really be much of a narrative at all. The recognizable plot begins with Laura Dern as an aging actress, having spent a while as a housewife, trying to re-enter the movie industry. She wins a role and, during filming, she starts to fall for her co-lead (Justin Theroux). Which is strange, given that the film is about a straying housewife. Soon, real life and screen life become completely blurred, until the actress only exists in her fictional life. Maybe. God knows at this point. The film becomes completely incomprehensible by any conventional standards. Which doesn't in any way mean that it's worthless. Like all Lynch films, Inland Empire is deeply hypnotic, often haunting and occasionally downright scary. I wish there were a little more sense to it so I could connect a bit more. And the fact that the film runs for nearly three hours; it's easy to get restless. I think a good number of people are going to find this to be Lynch's folly. It is disappointing, especially as we've waited five years since Mulholland Dr., probably his best film, but there are a few of Lynch's movies that I like less than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Defy Anyone to Write a Spoiler for this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway, etc., you'll like Inland Empire. There are some similarities to those previous films, but Inland Empire is a new departure, or maybe a culmination, for David Lynch.Anyone who thinks they can write a spoiler for this movie doesn't have a clue what they saw. This is not a plot driven movie in any sense. It's a film about the nuts and bolts of reality and the human mind -- among other things.Laura Dern has finally been given a role to expand into, and she doesn't disappoint at all. Her white trash trailer wife monologues are stunning. There is also a street kid monologue (with subtitles!) towards the end of the film that is likewise a classic, and performed by a totally unknown Japanese girl.I thought the ending credits sequence too precious; we get Laura Herring and the usual suspects trotted out. We learn that Naomi Watts did voice-overs. But this is classic Lynch that will have you pondering for a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unified Field Theory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood. To me this sprawling, chaotic, disturbing, uplifting, and humorous film is just like life itself for all those same reasons. It is a visual cinematic representation of all the elements that exist behind the curtain of human ego and existence- dream logic, interconnectivity, subconsciousness, and most importantly the things that cannot be understood materially, but only felt spiritually. This might be strange, but I love David Lynch's movies for their inherent spirituality, and in an even stranger sense, being familiar with Buddhism and Eastern philosophy makes his work very clear to me. He works with the idea of the Unified Field, where everyone is anyone, and we have all played each other's roles at one time or another. What was new to me in this film was the idea of karma, "a debt to be paid", which seemed to drive a lot of the action and leads us up to a very terrifying, yet spiritually cathartic climax. I loved that after the trip through hell, we are left with one of the most uplifting closing numbers... very sweet indeed. Which kind of shows that this guy (Mr. Lynch) really knows what he is doing... but that is just me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inland Empire: Weirder, Longer and Very Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is one of the most detail driven directors when it comes to disquieting atmospherics, symbolic enigmas and puzzle box plots, and here within the tantalising sub-reality of his latest concoction he achieves a magnificent feat; a three hour story that's not the slightest bit interesting. Okay, so it's a true saying that you either love Lynch movies or hate them, but to make this easier on those of you out there still undecided on which camp you fall in, if "Mullholland Drive," was the kind of film you immediately wanted to see again and enjoyed thoroughly from beginning to end then Inland Empire might just be for you.It's good to see the wonderful Laura Dern back in a leading lady capacity even though her performance is a very twisted, dark and disturbing one it's still a pleasure to have her back in front of the camera. It is also a brave choice on her part to be the only character that appears in almost every pivotal scene for the three hour duration, a testament to her skill and daring as an actress whilst also a bold move for Lynch giving her that opportunity. Jeremy Irons, Justin Theroux, Harry Dean Stanton, plus various others, are essentially just bloated cameos although Theroux does get the most screen time next to Dern, delivering a warped incarnation of two very 'different' leading men, one a fictional character in the film-within-a-film structure, the other the actor playing the part of that fictional creation. If this all sounds like nonsense that's because it is, and especially if you are not a fan of Lynch's earlier works like "Blue Velvet," and "Twin Peaks." I personally find seventy percent of his output often very pretentious in tone and especially when it comes down to his intentions for meaning.This effort feels distinctly empty, being surreal to the point of abstraction, and overly elaborate to the point of artifice. The whole endeavour seems designed for a bunch of wanky film intellectuals to muse about meaning and subtext using superlatives in the cinema foyer. The twisting fantasies that the story conjures up as excuses for scenes and sequences can be interpreted in the eye of the beholder, but ultimately the film is hinting at something very specific, and unlike he did with "Lost Highway," Lynch's script never winks about the whole thing being inexplicably bonkers for no reason, it simply drones on and on. A few sequences hit the jackpot, more notably the musical song and dance routine to the "Locomotion" of the prostitute elite, Dern running through her movie set into another time and place seemingly trapped inside her character, later on getting lost and going insane on the harsh streets of Hookersville, and a terrific dance number over the end credits to Nina Simone singing "Sinnerman." (the best part of the film is this time literally when the credits roll.) Okay, I can accept this art house drivel at just about two hours, but when this "Mullholland Drive" follow-up rambles on for an extra hour, rivalling "The Godfather Part II" in length, and lacking anything remotely resembling coherent substance to justify such a running time, I do weep quietly about the state of American 'artistic' cinema. This surrealist guff is really about a pretentious filmmaker wallowing in his own nightmares, being indulgent and excessive with his ideas, trying to dig for depth in shallow material to the point where 'film as art' becomes driven purely by his own sense of egocentricity. It's over elaborate weirdness is simply for the sake of weirdness. Somewhere inside this tangled web sits a very good story, but not much of it is left standing once you pick through the pretence of Empire's construction, and bloated length.Inland Empire finally substitutes any genuine analysis for painfully prolonged nightmarish visions and dreams that try to string what little plot there is along. David Lynch is an extraordinary visual craftsman who can create terror in a sudden flash of light, or at the strum of a musical chord, and his exemplary direction here does leave the 'film school-appreciation geek' in me feeling impressed, but his usual captivating sense of mood is altered by the sheer tedium of events unfolding and ultimately the subtext gets lost in a maze of trickery, pretension and overly-stimulated directorial creativity. It's at times overwhelming, mostly overbearing, relentlessly dull, and if it were not for the powerful centre stage performance from Laura Dern, it would be near unwatchable. There are moments of finely tuned foreboding and drip-feed fear laced throughout the ensuing madness, even clever, wry comic moments (Harry Dean Stanton please stand up) but not enough to give the rest of the film a burst of life until the last five minutes. And it's too much like "Mullholland Drive," to be considered entirely original. The notions of identity, myth and reality being challenged have been done much better before, and often by Lynch himself. Cut down to ninety or so minutes Inland Empire could have been tighter, stronger and far more captivating than as it stands in its complete form.A major disappointment.</fullReview>

The critics just sit through it nodding and smiling as if they've got a bloody clue what Lynch is one about. When asked what it was about they say "oh it's a film to be felt, not understood". Does has anyone else think they're being had? Perhaps he's not on about anything at all. Perhaps he just messes about for a few weeks, filming whatever he feels like, then when he's bored, he throws it together. It doesn't make sense, and it's 3hrs long (2 hrs film, 1 hr pauses). Is it crap? No you fool! It's clearly genius. The cast, crew, and nobody else, no one, not a single person understands it. But they all say it's fantastic. Why? Perhaps it's because it's so beautiful to look at? But Inland Empire is not. In fact, it looks shite, it's full of student film ultra close ups and (presumably) intentionally bad focus. Apparently it was shot on a cheap camera. Why? What's so cool about shooting a big budget film on high street cameras?

		<shortDescription>Penetrating to new artistic vistas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever wondered how actors create amazing performances out of thin air? The leading character of Inland Empire is Nikki Grace (Laura Dern). She's an actress who gets a part in a film called On High On Blue Tomorrows.If Nikki is a Method actor, she has plenty to draw on for her character, Sue. She needs to immerse herself in her character's feelings then connect those emotions to her own experiences to realise the performance. And at the studio, the director casually goes all Blair Witch Project on her and says the film is not only based on an old Polish gypsy tale but the story is meant to be cursed. The first time it was filmed, the two leads ended up dead. Only the day before, an unpleasant Polish gypsy neighbour has foretold that Nikki will get the part. Faster than you can say Stanislavski, Nikki is caught up in what seems parallel reality.On High On Blue Tomorrows includes a plot line about Billy (who has a wife and kids) trying to seduce Sue. We already know that Nikki's husband is (conveniently) murderously inclined towards any co-star that gets too friendly. Nikki, at one point, tells her co-star she is worried her husband will kill both of them. She breaks off suddenly - "It sounds like lines from a script". Which it is, as the director calls 'cut'.Since any film from the David Lynch surreal canon comes with a guarantee to fry your head, you have probably already guessed that the two realities get a bit blurred for us too. The scenes-within-a-scene are almost like a broken record - an image which is obligingly interlaced (with a nice scratchy record sound). The psychological cues (for us or the 'actors') pile up . . . a dark staircase, Polish whores who 'act like whores', and an unsettling, humourless TV comedy where people wear rabbit-heads.Folk tales, as we find in Jungian Psychology, work on the subconscious in different ways for different folk. They take symbols that express or trigger archetypes within all of us. They 'mean' something to us before we know what they mean. And does this film. Lynch uses abstractions not just for their own sake but to take us deeper inside a character and their world.The storyline that is beyond debate is the emotional journey of Nikki, but the actual details of what really happens probably depend on viewer perception. "In the future you'll be dreaming," they tell her. "When you open your eyes, someone familiar will be there" We get to know the inner Nikki, but who she actually is may well take a bit more work. The parallel strands, her real life, her movie story, the folktale elements, her unconscious, can all become confusingly familiar.Me, I like a nice materialistic, Hitchcockian conclusion that ties up the loose ends. Other people will find a supernatural explanation or a purely symbolic tableau. Websites are springing up to discuss the film even before its release. Maybe in six months people will accept my explanation (which I won't mention for fear of spoiling it), maybe they won't. People didn't agree on Mulholland Drive overnight. But just as people draw different inferences from great works of modern art, so will they with this film. If you're not allergic to the experimental, the surreal and the avant-garde in cinema, you may well even think it's a masterpiece.Inland Empire is at once the most abstract of Lynch's films but also more accessible than Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway. He has become very good at what he does. The more you concentrate on any tiny detail, the more it makes sense, and often on several levels. One of the elements of this particular Polish folk tale is that when a boy goes through a door, evil follows him; when a girl goes through, she becomes lost. Dern's character, or character within a character, becomes increasingly lost - a favourite theme of Lynch's - whereas evil seems to flow from the male characters.At one point, she tries to phone Billy. A character from the 'bunny' shows answers. Jealousy and frustration are never far from the surface. How would you feel if your husband deserted you to travel to the Baltic with gypsies in a circus? Maybe kick him in the nuts so hard they go crawlin' up to his brain for refuge? The mix of Polish and American slang can be unsettling, as much as chorus line of prostitutes singing 'The Locomotion' or a girl hypnotised to kill someone with a screwdriver. (The soundtrack also features beautiful songs by Nina Simone and Etta James.) For a three hour movie, Inland Empire is still a roller-coaster ride. Lynch fans avoid it at your peril.</fullReview>

This metaphysically meandering, hodge podge of a movie, rehashes many of the concepts (and cinematic devices) he has trudged over in previous works. Intentionally contrived to the point of boredom is how I would describe it. Do I really want David Lynch to give me lessons in "reality", "causality", and "relativity"? it's fairground philosophy at it's worst. I should have just smoked some DMT, that would actually have been meaningful, lasted only 15 minutes, but left me with something worthwhile to think about. Oh yeah, the Pendereki, cheap, really cheap using this music as he did - same with the way Kubrick milked Ligeti for what it was worth in the Shining. Textural dissonance does not necessarily equal "scary"; contrary to what so many film makers seem to think. Lynch fancies himself as a so called sound designer: so use your fricken imagination dude, instead of using the same old tactics to create tension. And the whole jolting scary face thing, give me a break, how many more times is he going to roll out this cheap trick. Earth calling David, earth calling David, come in David.......................

		<fullReview>Perhaps the Gita poem recited before the opening of the footage best describes the essence of this film: time is meaningless...indeed totality of "reality" is subjective....all we have is our own fabric to deal with and what we make of it is our own construction...like the web the spider weaves is his own though he knows nothing of it....... that's the best we can do .... ideas of time and space are spurious at best so why try to pin them down, why try to impute logic onto a system that is so elusive that even our "finest" minds come up with quantum fluctuations that are subject probabilities and absurd contradictions ....... logic and linearity giving way to Gödel, Schrödinger, Einstein, and finally Lynch ..... may not that be precisely the action that screwed us to begin with? The "horror" is the audacity of claiming yes i understand.....yes that makes sense.......because ultimately of course you don't understand and of course it doesn't make sense at all does it? so the best you can do and better be satisfied with is weaving your web and recognizing it for what it is: a virtual construction in a virtual world subject to complete annihilation by some chance swipe of a hand ............ what we are reminded of here, dramatically, is that we indeed know nothing................ so we should pray, like the sinner man, for redemption from our arrogance of intelligence....our arrogance of knowing .....which SEEMINGLY leads to destruction.......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch Responds to Feminist Critcism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch has long been attacked for his treatment of women in his films. INLAND EMPIRE, the last feature film he made (and, it's beginning to look as though it will be the last feature film he ever makes) responds to these criticisms with a brilliant, 3-hour epic on the treatment of women around the world.At one point, a homeless woman on Hollywood Boulevard tells one of several Laura Dern characters, "Woman, you're dying." In a hodge-podge of what look like unfinished David Lynch projects, INLAND EMPIRE explains exactly how and why women around the world suffer. The most prominent storyline in the film, if such a masterpiece of abstraction can even be limited to the term film, is that of a movie production in which a cast and crew attempt to film a movie that was filmed decades earlier with disastrous consequences. The trials and tribulations the Laura Dern characters go through represent all the hassles we horrid, patriarchal s.o.b.'s put them through (yes, I'm a feminist who was accidentally born with testicles...)The film ends brilliantly with Dern assaulting her masked, unknown assailant, and then a joyous musical number featuring women of all shapes and sizes, clapping their hands and singing along to a Nina Simone tune (not much more radical than that, eh?)The only part of the movie I struggled with were the scenes that took place in Poland (?). One has to expect a certain amount of confusion when watching a Lynch film, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is an absolute mastermind! His films have a memorable, nightmarish atmosphere that have truly given Lynch a place in cinema history."Inland Empire" is (at the current time) Lynch's last non-documentary full length feature film, and it seems like an interesting work to end with. It's very long (3 hours, in fact), which is my biggest complaint with the film. I just thought it was simply too long! There were scenes that just went on and on, and didn't really affect the film in any way (I refuse to use a word like "plot" or "story", since this film is more of an avant garde nightmare than anything conventional). However, I still thought "Inland Empire" was pretty great.While shot amateurishly, one can easily tell this is a film directed by David Lynch. It has the Lynchian trademarks of surrealism, horror, and a really dark mood. There's various images throughout "Inland Empire" that will likely stick with you because of their shock value and overall memorability. I mean, it's hard to get the image of the family of rabbit suits all together in that one room behind the roar of canned laughter.It's far from Lynch's best (both "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet" are in my top 10 favorite films of all time), but it definitely is pure Lynch, so if that sounds really good to you, it's very likely that you'll enjoy the film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horrible mess of a wonderfully constructed story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first major hurdle in talking about Inland Empire is how exactly you are looking to judge a film. I'm generally not a David Lynch fan but there's few other people who push the ideas of film-making to their limits quite like him, and you've got to take into account what exactly the purpose of the film is when discussing how good it is. Lynch's films should be considered art like few others and so, unlike most other films, it should perhaps be reviewed from a totally different checklist.Of course to judge how well he has constructed his film, you have to guess what he is trying to create, and, unlike the rest of his films where there is a roughly accepted consensus, audience interpretations of Inland Empire all vary wildly. My interpretation was that a married woman had an affair with a married man and fell pregnant, with her lover now looking to end the affair, she has an abortion and must come to terms with it, so my review essentially comes down to how I think Lynch constructed this interpretation.Lynch's trademark crossover between real and imagined is ramped up to eleven as the protagonist retreats to the world within her head. The narrative starts with the protagonist living comfortably in a big, plush house as an old Polish woman visits her. The woman asks about a film the actress has applied for, asking whether it involves marriage (I believe the protagonist and her lover to both be married to other people) and murder (the abortion). The protagonist appears troubled and the old woman moves the dialogue on, commenting that if today was tomorrow (the film she has applied for is titled On High in Blue Tomorrows) she would be sat on the couch where the woman is pointing. The film then jumps to a scene where the protagonist is sat on the couch with her friends and is informed she has won the role - from a straight narrative perspective, it is possible that the film has simply jumped a day forward, but bearing in mind the title of the film and what the old woman said, I interpreted it as that this moment is part of "Tomorrow", the film, despite the scene still being about the actress outside of the film. It's the first moment where the line between what is real and imaginary is blurred, and a sign that our narrator for the film isn't quite being clear with what is actually happening.The protagonist then begins working on the film and, despite a denial on an unnatural-seeming talk show, starts an affair with her co-star, only for things to get weird and a completely different story starts.She believes she has a wonderful life as Nikki, living a comfortable life of riches as a movie star, as she begins her romance with her lover Devon. She denies the affair publicly (the talk show) but carries it on behind the scenes, then this constructed world is shown to be not quite right when she ventures down an alley and sees herself rehearsing weeks earlier, retreating into the house of one of Tomorrow's characters. Her lover Devon goes to investigate the disturbance but finds only a wooden backdrop - he sees only a wooden façade while the protagonist sees a fully fleshed out house; a metaphor for the characters' feelings towards the relationship.At this point, the protagonist ceases being the glamorous actress Nikki and becomes the much less glamorous Sue. I interpreted this turning point as when the protagonist fell pregnant and her lover decided to end the relationship. She built up this wonderful world for herself but Devon didn't see things the same as her (the wooden set/house) and her world collapses around her. She reveals a history of sexual abuse, showing that the protagonist's life wasn't so perfect, and begins hanging around with a troupe of prostitutes, representing that she considers herself to be a whore for her affair and pregnancy.Eventually Sue is stabbed by a woman in the stomach, representative of her abortion - her lover's wife the reason for her child's death (although she uses Sue's own tool, the screwdriver, showing that it was still Sue's decision to abort that ended the life) and dies in the street. The director then yells cut and it is revealed it was part of the film. Now with the baby gone, the protagonist can go back to her happy life and restart her affair with her lover. She then wanders off and sees "Tomorrows" in a theatre, only with footage of events that are currently occurring - she can't just go back to her old life, the two have crossed over now. Shot with a horrible cheap-looking camera, her life as Nikki was proved to be a lie.She must now confront what she has done. She kills The Phantom, representative of the bad that the protagonist has done, sees the anthropomorphic rabbits, representative of the twisted love triangle, and embraces the Lost Girl, the child she aborted.The issue is of course that, while a complex well-rounded story with excellent use of symbolism, it is extremely difficult to tell if this is what Lynch wanted to create. How exactly are you meant to decide on how well Lynch has constructed his story if it is so cryptic that no one can agree on an interpretation? The film is incredibly difficult to watch, often boring and frequently ugly to look at; if you consider film to be entertainment first and foremost, it's pretty terrible. Nevertheless, like all of Lynch's work, it is something that has to be seen if you have an interest in film, and the whether or not you consider it to be good could come down entirely to your interpretation of the muddled goings-on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fans who know and appreciate these kinds of movies will willingly go for this, but it needs more to make casual viewers care.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything you'd come to expect from a David Lynch film, and in that respect this doesn't disappoint. But before Lynch die-hards feel so content spouting their over-pretentious praise of the self-indulgent, this film relies and counts far too much on the establishment that it's supposed to be deeply surreal and requires committed thinking, and it expects that audiences are just going to go with that automatically. In ease of this, it forgets to make you care about what's going on to begin with, which Lynch familiars won't mind, but casual viewers will raise the question of if it's really worth decoding this impossibly interpretive thing without anything to make them care in the first place. It's undoubtedly a very artistic and enjoyable film, but accessibility is definitely a considerable issue here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dark side of the rabbit hole</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Inland Empire" is dangerous stuff. If you decide to continue watching after the first weird minutes (where you see among other things rabbits ironing and talking nonsense), you'll get three full hours of Lynchian strangeness, you might even say absurdities, framed by or being at the heart of a story about identity, more precisely a woman in trouble. What happens exactly in such a long running time is quite unclear and there are lots of opportunities to give up on this one. On the other hand you might come across people who claim to be able to dissect and explain the movie for you from beginning to end - which will take more than three hours though, I fear. And even considering that it's a Lynch picture you might find you constantly asking yourself when you read theories about it: Seriously?"Inland Empire" is difficult to rave about on first viewing. But it has its moments, leaves a very strong impression. It stays in your head, even if it only leaves you disturbed and unsure with a plethora of unanswered questions, all let loose on you. Asking yourself if Lynch has finally lost it is absolutely valid at this point. Yet - who knows? - he might have wanted it exactly the way it came out. Or it is a combination of both. Be it as it may: "Inland Empire" is a vivid play with associations, references, a trip into hell and back, which demands a lot from its viewers. Try to analyse it to death or let it wash over you with its ambiguities kept intact, receiving it only on an emotional level to get to the things behind. On the screen there's Laura Dern's stellar performance. And behind? Well, there might be a rabbit hole for those who look closely...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is happening... again.In many ways, Inland Empire is the ultimate David Lynch movie. Despite the disjointed storyline and disorientating camera tricks, I still found it somehow more coherent than Mulholland Drive, even if the runtime of nearly three hours makes it a pretty harrowing and exhausting experience.On a side note, it's great to see Lynch working again with several wonderful actors who were with him in his earlier years - Grace Zabriskie (Twin Peaks), Harry Dean Stanton (Wild at Heart, The Straight Story) and of course Laura Dern. I just wish Jack Nance was still around, to make it a real reunion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How does one discuss this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you thought David Lynch couldn't get any stranger than Eraserhead or Wild at Heart then you were sorely mistaken. The convoluted, twisted insanity of Inland Empire tops anything Lynch has ever put together. The film is about an actress who, after receiving her biggest role yet, begins to see reality and fiction distorted in her mind as the film's plot mimics her own life. Thing get even stranger when she learns that the film she is making is actually a remake of a cursed Polish film where the two lead actors were murdered. Now, if that plot synopsis made complete and total sense, congratulations! That means nothing. Whatever you think you are in for with Inland Empire will be completely wrong. Don't go into the movie with any expectations. Just sit back and watch the film unfold in all its painfully confusing glory. It is a three hour overdose of David Lynch that will wring your brain dry of any sanity you might have left.The best Lynch film to relate Inland Empire too would no doubt be Eraserhead, Lynch's very first film. A lot of what goes on in this film isn't necessarily meant to be understood. Lynch transforms from director to painter in this film. The essence of this film is really more about the audio/visual experience rather than understanding the storyline step by step. This film is an endeavor and there is really no way to be prepared for everything that this film entails. It will scare you, it will haunt you, it will mystify you, it will hypnotize you, it might even make you laugh. It isn't a film with a clear cut storyline that you follow from beginning to end. It is an experience that you absorb and accept for what it is.Now this is what Inland Empire basically is, but where the problem lies is in my own personal preferences when it comes to film. I like films with a solid story and great dialogue. Inland Empire doesn't put these things first. It puts them under the immaculate visual experience. Thus I just can't get into this film enough because of just how far it swings out of control and just how far behind it leaves the conventional plane of filmmaking. Three hours of this is almost too much for me. I have unending respect for David Lynch and his ingenious and incredibly unique approach to filmmaking, but Inland Empire is just a bit too much. It is a very interesting watch because it is unlike anything you have ever seen before, but it is a lot to take in all at once.The state of mind that Inland Empire puts you in is honestly pretty frightening. You always feel just as lost as the characters in the film and your mind wanders to all sorts of places as you attempt to absorb everything Lynch throws at you. I found myself actually getting distracted from watching the movie by thinking about the movie. I raised so many questions in my mind like, Where did Lynch come up with this? how could one man be able to coherently piece together a film like this in his mind? do the actors even understand the film they are in? what would it be like to act in a David Lynch film? what are the dark recesses of David Lynch's mind like? etc, etc. Inland Empire does things to your mind that I never thought a film could do, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not.Inland Empire can't really be reviewed in any conventional way, so there isn't much more I can say about the film. It would be a waste of bandwidth for me to talk about the acting, cinematography, etc, because thats not how you review a painting. You take it all in one piece, not picking it apart but rather looking at it as a whole and going from there. I don't know if I really enjoyed Inland Empire but I can't say that it is a bad movie because the bottom line is that David Lynch is a genius of a completely different breed. I try to be as open to all forms of cinema as possible but there has to be a place to draw the line. I think the three hour long Inland Empire might be that place. Regardless though, this movie is such an insane experience that is so unlike anything you will ever experience, and so it deserves lots of credit for that, if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually impressive, but somewhat emotionally distant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the masterpiece of sadness which "Mulholland Drive" was, Lynch delivers us this movie, which is in pretty much the same vein: A woman with lost identity, lost in a world of dreams and nightmare. But this time, the movie isn't so emotionally engaging as "Mulholland". Why?, it's because the plot is so convoluted this time, and the tone is so shifting and strange, that the main sensation is not of sadness, but of confusion. The plot devices this time are not so emotionally sound ("Polish legend?", what the...?), but are intriguing enough to keep us interested.But, in any case, there IS a main story here, and it's interesting to figure it out, but the labyrinth this time is not as engaging. Recommended for Lynch fans, but for a casual viewer, the main sensation this movie may cause it's: "What the h### I've just watched?"8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch's weirdest and most experimental but not best one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without the glimpse of a doubt David Lynch's weirdest and most experimental movie. But as it hasn't the atmosphere of "Lost highway", the heavy intensity of "Fire walk with me" and the progressive and artistic inspiration of "Erasderhead", it is far from being the best one of his movies.I think that the main problem of this movie is that there are many movies and short movies mixed into one single one. Sometimes, the movie gets incoherent and almost impossible to understand. Even if it shouldn't be the main goal to try to understand and precisely analyze the movie, I think that the first half of the movie has a lack of intense and disturbing scenes and even for a Lynch movie a too slow paced introduction. I also think that the characters aren't as intense and authentic as they have been in some other movies by him and I can't easily connect to them. The story and intrigue of this movie is also not quite intense. Another negative point is that the way the movie is filmed might be something different and quite original, but is very uneasy and annoying to watch and doesn't create the same degree of intensity as the darkened shots from "Eraserhead" for example.What saves this movie is the second half where many incoherent parts of the movie slowly get connected. The movie focuses on the main character which becomes more intense, believable and intense. Laura Dern finally proves us why she has been chosen by David Lynch and why he was so satisfied by her acting. The footage becomes more intense and yet disturbing with a few frightening and really dramatic scenes. The true art and style of David Lynch lives up in the second part and all the famous trademarks are finally present and one begins to think about the different story lines and hints to create some kind of own interpretation of the movie's sense while the first half didn't invite at all to do so. I have to admit that this movie is probably the most detailed and well thought by David Lynch who does once again the job of a genius.But all of this doesn't quite excuse for the weak and too slow paced beginning with a rather ordinary acting by many actors and the high amount of confusing and yet unnecessary elements. This movie could have last at least thirty minutes less without cutting off any important scene and it would have felt more dynamical and intense but this time David Lynch took all the liberty he got and tended to slightly exaggerate on some points. Nevertheless, this movie is a surreal piece of art, but is very difficult to approach and asks multiple viewings once again which can get very long and annoying because of the disappointing first hour and a half. The viewer becomes a detective in despair but maybe this is the feeling that Lynch wanted to create to invite only the toughest ones to get over and analyze this alternative flick. I still prefer watching the puzzled and mysterious "Lost Highway" though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read Inland Empire was his most raw and abstract movie to date, I knew it was long and I knew it would not make much sense. What I mean is I was ready for it. Some art you are not meant to understand, Bob Dylan lyrics from his earlier period sometimes made no sense, so you watch observe listen and when it ends you are left with an impression. David Lynch has never let me down with regards to feeling satisfied with his work. To some this film would be a banal mess. A one hundred miles an hour car wreck of a movie, a three hour bore fest and I must admit it is a film I would find hard to recommend. Inland Empire is in a similar world to Mullholand Drive, but taken to massive extremes. Laura Dern starts out as a perhaps faded actress in her mansion talking to a new polish neighbour. She then finds out she has the role that will make her a star again. However the part is in a film that is a remake of a doomed Polish film that was never finished due to the murders of the two lead actors, and is also believed to be cursed. As the two leads get close and intimate during their scenes they also become so off screen and Laura Derns character finds herself getting confused as to who she actually is as the settings slowly change from mansions and movie sets to small houses, dark rooms, slutty looking women and eventually the streets of Los Angeles. As she morphs from actress to the character in the movie having an affair she eventually believes she is a prostitute on the streets of LA and gets stabbed by maybe the wife of the man she was having an affair with. As she lies dying a couple of street bums are talking about events and lines that have previously been said in the film. Then just as she dies we then hear 'cut!' and we realise it is not the streets of LA but again a film studio. So who is Laura Derns character? I don't know as what i have told you is very basic and there are 101 other things happening at the same time. Personally it is not Lynch's best film or most watchable. However it is probably one of his more pure and raw films that occasionally when I have the time will watch again. Laura Dern is fantastic as I think she is anyway. The use of Digial Video is interesting and allows David Lynch some freedom but i do prefer his more polished efforts. So overall I would think this is for Lynch fans only or for movie fans that like something that is a little outside the box. If you are tired of predictable movies, with predictable characters with predictable story lines then you could do worse that to check this out. It will have you scratching your head but its a hell of a trip!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the weirder openings of a film I have seen, with the people in rabbit costumes and a girl crying then the rabbit turns into a piece of light, totally weird and also wonderful, inspiring to make some of my own film, as Eraserhead did the same. Very similar to Mulholland Drive but more easy to understand, as its not as obscure, my only criticism with this and Mulholland Drive is that they are far too long and should be shortened to 1 ? hours. Its not as good as the best of his I've seen, which is Eraserhead, which stands head and shoulders above most films due to its creativity, and its obscurity, never the less this is a very good film that follows on with the lynch genre.Clinical turns to dark once again in his films, they are very hard to watch in one sitting as there is so much to take in and realise, but when you do this you try and understand the story. With his films everyone perceives them differently in their own way, that is the art of his obscure film making. What's with the dance scene! Crazy people wishing, the empire of the imagination. Is she in a film or not!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch does digital</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 4 years I still have no real idea what Inland Empire is about. I've read lots of speculations, but none of them seems as convincing as the ones that Mulholland Drive inspired. The main thing that stays with me about the movie now is the digital photography. Before I saw it, I thought Lynch would try to give the digital the same deep colors and inky blacks that his other movies tend to have. But here over and over again he heightens the fact that Inland Empire is being shot on digital rather than film, and indeed makes a point of giving the whole thing a blatantly digital, non-film look. I hated this look the first time I watched it, but now I think it's brilliant. Still wish I knew what's going on with the story, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can you spoil a Lynch film. You could read the entire script and still not now what the hell it's about!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning! You will receive a mission after reading this review....Inland Empire stands as one of my favorite David Lynch films along side Dune, Blue Velvet, The Straight Story and Mullholland Drive. I was lucky enough to see this film with director Lynch and actor's Laura Dern and Justin Theroux in attendance. I have to tell you I had to relieve myself the entire two hours but I sat glued to my seat not wanting to miss a single moment in a film made up of hundreds of mostly non related Lynchian moments. What can I say. I'm a proud member of the Lynch mob.Another of my favorite directors is Alfred Hitchcock. Hitch takes you into a world of the every man or woman getting mistaken for the wrong person or finding themselves in some sort of trouble. Lynch takes a different approach. He takes a troubled person, throws them into more trouble then sinks both you and the character into the god awfullest depths for two hours never letting go until he suddenly snaps you back into some bizarre happy ending. Mel Brooks once said of Lynch "He's Jimmy Stewart from mars! One only has to watch Vertigo or Rear Window to know exactly what Mel was talking about. He's a wide eyed boy scout voyeur that in his youth even looked a little like Stewart. But Lynch is not content looking through the rear windows like L.B. Jeffery's. Lynch wants to go behind the closed doors and into the very heads of his neighbors. Like Stewart in Vertigo he also likes to manipulate people, change them into something they're not for his own pleasure, even switching actors right in the middle of the movie for seemingly no rhyme or reason. Who can ever figure out Mulholland Drive and yet, because it's Lynch, it's a nightmare we're happy to visit. This is the same way I feel about Inland Empire (wow I almost forgot why I started writing this!) Inland Empire. I can't explain this film and won't even try but I will say that there are scenes of great beauty, horrific dread, and an erie play put on by actors in rabbits heads that just gave me a haunting uneasy feeling. Why should we subject ourselves to this kind of absurd abuse? Because no one can tell a story like David can. A story of truth without logic. And we can always trust him to bring us out of the depths and leave us in a much better place, somewhat intact and also a little wiser. Like Little Red Riding Hood sings in Sondheim's "Into The Woods" " Isn't it nice to know a lot?... With Lynch what we know is not always pleasant!A Happy Ending.... In Dune it was the simple promise of new life from the falling rain. In Blue Velvet it was the animatronic bird eating the horrible beetle in an ending so bizarrely happy I almost wanted to go back to Franks apartment! In the ultra violent Wild At Heart the film ends with Sailor Ripley singing Love me Tender after getting beat up by a street gang followed by a visit from the good witch of the north! Ya you read it right... In the movie it makes sense... Sort of. And he does the same with Inland Empire complete with a rousing finale song!... Speaking of songs I asked him in the question and answer period that followed the film if he ever planned on making a musical. I pointed out how he uses songs so often in his films and so brilliantly (as if he didn't already know this) and how odd that he rarely finishes the entire song. He laughed and said if a good idea came to him he would consider it. Can you imaging a David Lynch Musical? A singer right in the middle of his big finish gets interrupted by a phone call from the little person who lives between the walls. The song is never finished nor the singer heard from again! That would be amazing.Anyway thank you for reading and now for your mission. Ready? Here goes. Take that next film out of your Netflix cue, (I'm sure you've seen it twice already) and type in Inland Empire. Got it? good! I promises you'll never be the same again..."Isn't it nice to know a lot?... And a little bit - not!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting if not entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first real exposure to Public Access came when I saw a promo featuring a prolonged trek through a nearby neighborhood by a fellow with a camcorder dangling from one hand. The low angle point of view, coupled with the lack of music (the sound was recorded live as the videographer walked), was enough to give one pause while flipping through the channels. This sequence lasted a good thirty minutes or so and ended with the videographer climbing into a car, turning on his car stereo, and cruising along taping his journey. (One of the highlights of this videodyssey was an encounter with a little but very loud dog who decided to face off with this intruder and back him down. Riveting stuff.) INLAND EMPIRE reminds me more than a little of that Public Access promo. The narrative is too disjointed to follow, and the inclusion of human rabbits sitting around a living room (among other things) makes this one more than a bit frustrating- but it's still interesting, if not exactly entertaining, to watch. Unfortunately, it's also three hours long. That alone pushes it past the point of being tolerable (my butt went to sleep right before I did), but I like the way Lynch builds and maintains mood. I always have (which is why I dedicated an entire episode of a weekly experimental film and video show to the man, back when TWIN PEAKS was just beginning to make waves). It would be interesting to see Lynch tackle something like Cormac McCarthy's CHILD OF GOD: if anyone could do that kind of book justice, it's David Lynch.</fullReview>

The film is enjoyable as long as you can get over the absurdity and quit trying to formulate a rational story.There are many disturbing moments which are chilling in a way in which only other David Lynch films are. Inland Empire is more absurd than any of his previous releases which would deter many, but David Lynch still has a large, loyal fan-base built on the same style of film-making which characterizes Inland Empire.So, basically it's a long, disjointed, macabre, and brilliant film, about a Woman losing track between reality and the screenplay of her current film, a cursed film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This one grew on me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this film a year ago, and didn't make it through the first viewing. Usually that would be it for me, but what drew me back to watch it again was the extraordinarily intensity of the various fragments Lynch had arranged, the sheer range of Laura Dern's performance, and the tantalizing hints of tragic underlying story that emerged.I sometimes see people trying to interpret Inland Empire as a kind of symbolic commentary on the inner workings of one or another character's mind (something along the lines of Mulholland Drive). I don't think that's the case at all; for me it bears the clear marks of a film that started from a series of disconnected but intense images and scenes from which a plot evolved, ad hoc, as things moved along. That plot seems not to me to be about symbolic representation of mental fracturing at all, but much more clearly about supernaturalism, reincarnation, tragedies iterating themselves down decades, even an honest-to-Bob battle between good and evil (with one woman recruited by the side of good -- represented by a species of trinity, no less -- to step outside the prison of linear time and sacrifice herself to give a group of restless, suffering spirits some peace). It's an almost religious film, and Nikki Grace's surname is no accident. The various pieces aren't fleshed out enough to be completely definitive about their relationships to one another, but Lynch gives enough clues that it's possible to piece together what he eventually decided he was driving at; indeed some of the clues are almost heavy-handed, like the use of the colour red to signify the presence or activity of the spirit world, a device one could almost suspect him of having cribbed from M. Night Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense.(And yes, in the context of that plot, even the giant rabbits and their laugh-tracked absurdist conversations do make sense. On my most recent viewing, I realized that the seemingly random intrusions of the laugh track in their opening scene aren't random at all; they tie in neatly to the other themes Lynch repeats throughout.) Ad hoc though the underlying plot might be, the subjects it addresses are poignant and moving, and at many moments Inland Empire is a frighteningly raw, emotional film. Lynch succeeds for the most part in avoiding exploitation of the various "women in trouble" whose travails lie at the heart of the story (except for one rather gratuitous tit shot scene). The unusual digital cinematography brings a surprising sense of immediacy to much of the proceedings.It takes some getting used to. But this is one movie that's worth the effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Deep breath) OK? ah, look, I like David Lynch, I watched Twin peaks, I've seen all the movies, you know, that sort of thing. I really liked Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive. I really have no clear idea if I liked INLAND EMPIRE or not. I suspect that it is not fair to assess it in the same way that you would assess a normal movie ? I am probably supposed to see it as some kind of performance art or something. Which is, you know, fine. But I do kind of like just a teeny bit of sense and a vaguely, partially, slightly clear narrative to help me along the way. But really, it's all by the by. I don't know anyone who has watched INLAND EMPIRE who was not already a fan of Lynch's and thus was aware of what they were letting themselves in for. Art is self-indulgent. We, as fans, choose to indulge David Lynch's self-indulgency. And the world might be the better for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How do you say, 'Welcome to my nightmare' in Polish?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alternately brilliant and massively self-indulgent, (three hours? now really, David!). A reasonably straight-forward narrative, (a movie is haunted by the 'ghosts' of a former production of the same tale), is turned inside out, upside down and completely spatially altered by Lynch's unfettered and, you may say, unique imagination.Watching this film is like being allowed access to a very talented and very disturbed artist's psycho-babble. Or maybe it's just a very egotistically talented artist's gigantic joke, (who or what are the giant rabbits?). Whatever, it is still hypnotically watchable which says a lot for Lynch. I can't imagine any other director making this movie, (or any movie like it, not that there might be), and keeping you interested or making you care about the outcome or the fate of the characters, or rather the fate of one character, the actress playing the leading role in the film within the film and whose dream/nightmare most of the film seems to be.For this we have to thank, not only Lynch, but the extraordinary Laura Dern who gives a tour-de-force performance. She's all over the shop but then I suppose that is what acting is all about. Above all, she convinces you that this is serious stuff or at least that she is taking it seriously even if no-one else is. Shot on digital video it is also as much 'about' the process of creating, as opposed to 'making', a film as it is 'about' anything else and in the performances Lynch extracts from his cast, (and not just Dern), you could argue that it is also about the process of acting.It is also far from being a great film, (though it has at least one great sustained sequence - you figure), and at times it resembles nothing more than the out-takes from "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Mulholland Drive" though it lacks the cohesion of those films, (it's the most off-the-wall of any of Lynch's works and that includes "Eraserhead), and yet it is still extraordinary, unmistakeably the work of a unique and visionary artist and no-one, only Lynch, could have made it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The key to a Lynchian lock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading numerous attempts at describing Lynch's recent movies I feel that most reviewers have 'lost the plot'. The most common problem when criticizing Lynch is the comparisons to other movies and movie makers; the only movies that Lynch's movies should be compared to are Lynch's movies themselves; and do so, because the more Lynch movies you watch- the more the movies make sense. The first thing to remember is that Lynch treats dreams as sleeping realities and will not offer a shimmering image to illustrate when the dream begins or ends. Secondly, and although the story IS linear, the chronology of events are not; and again Lynch will not provide you with a graphic that would typically read "one week earlier" etc..., although there IS a clue to be found at all of these junctures.--note that somewhere around 70% of Mulholland Drive is a dream sequence and Inland Empire is nearly twice as'long as its predecessor; Lynch truly has made the ultimate multiple viewing movie. And he has achieved this without giving any of the game away--I have only the vaguest idea as to what is going on in Inland Empire but that doesn't stop me from experiencing the emotion and catharsis that good film is supposed to provide. So watch and enjoy one of the most original movie makers who ever lived present one of the most original films ever made.p.s. I know I said there was a spoiler but even if I had got all the answers "I'm not about to ruin this film for no man".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There isn't a person I know who would watch this movie more than once if even that. But I will and don't ask me why. It just draws me in with the sights and sounds and I want to see what appears on the screen next. I also want to know what it all means. I love a challenge. This movie is filet mignon to the greaseburger that most finds it's way on movie screens today. Yet it doesn't make "sense." Or does it? Would Lynch make a movie that cannot be unraveled? If so this might be the first. I mostly unraveled all the rest I've seen, Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Lost Highway, and Mulholland Dr, each in two viewings. Though Blue Velvet really never presented many difficulties. Inland Empire though, sheesh, I still have no clue what many of these scenes mean. The rabbits for example, I have no idea. But I see a woman getting lost in her acting, meshing it with reality. It is a story of utter depravity, betrayal, revenge, and redemption, and the actress from the original Polish movie runs parallel to Nikki Grace, played by Dern. In the end Grace hits rock bottom dying among the street people of Hollywood Blvd. "No more blue tomorrows" the street person told her. Ahh Grace's line from earlier, "only blue tomorrows," from the movie script as she resisted the prospects of having an affair. But the Hollywood street scene was just acting. "Cut...marvelous Nikki!" the director says but she still hasn't woken up. Then she walks in a theater and sees herself on the screen. Huh? It's just acting and this is the beginning of her coming out. Then the psychologist walks up the stairs, Dern follows and goes through a green hallway where we see door #47. That number was a cue from earlier. I'll try to catch it next time. Grace embraces and kisses the Polish actress then disappears. Then like Blue Velvet, and unlike Mulholland Dr, we have a happy ending. The Polish actress reunites with her family and Grace sits smiling on the couch in the mansion where the movie started. The nightmare is over. As the credits roll the one legged woman looks up and says, "sweet" and the players dance to a Gospel like song of being saved from a turbulent river. Not half bad for a general understanding but if you are like me, you want more. I'm sure much more is there but that means watching it again and this is a long one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three hours of David Lynch at his most fragmented and unsettling. Normal Lynch themes and techniques run through story, infidelity, identities changing, cyclical editing, Hollywood artifice, oblique dialoge, deadpan comedy, and the most disturbing special effects since Eraserhead. It's a feverish nightmare with unrelentingingly haunting and ominous music and a few pop songs(Beck's black tamborine, and doo-wop classic, "The Locomotion") and unique industrial/pop hybrids by Lynch himself. The film is shot on digital as opposed to film, and Lynch milks every trick lighting effect you could imagine in this film, and if nothing else he's really expands the possibilities of digital movie-making, by using the washed out colors and light sensitivity of his cameras as opposed to trying to recreate the look of film. Laura Dern shows an incredible amount of range and manages to hold you to the screen with her for the entire film, and at three hours that's a feat. My biggest complaint is the length, it's too long to sit in a theater, and I was literally exhausted by the end. If you liked Mullholand Drive, Lost Highway, Eraserhead and the more abstract films of Lynch, then this is his masterpiece. It's even got scenes from his online series "Rabbits", linked into story, and appearances by Laura Harring and Justin Theroux(who's a main character in similar position as he was) from Mullholand Drive, connecting it directly to the rest of the Lynch universe. Gave me a headache too, but I kinda expected it that, but it was one of the most rewarding headaches I have had the pleasure of receiving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film Review - INLAND EMPIRE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a foregone conclusion that attempting to make sense of a David Lynch film doth not time well spent make. Lynch is one of modern cinema's great provocateurs, a love-him-or-hate-him cinematic savant who manages to achieve with film what most only dare to attempt with paint or poetry. With this in mind, it should come as no surprise to learn that Lynch's latest mind-bender, INLAND EMPIRE, is a frighteningly surreal descent into paranoid perplexity that exhilarates every bit as much as it bewilders.INLAND EMPIRE ostensibly concerns actress Nikki Grace's (the marvelous Laura Dern) involvement with a career-making new film project. But, Lynch being Lynch, this was never going to be that simple. We later learn the project is the remake of a cursed film that never wrapped production as its two stars were brutally murdered. And here's where narrative coherence takes a flying leap, and we should ready ourselves for what's to come.At first, Lynch's decision to shoot on cheap digital video seems to prove distracting, as if the comparative nastiness of the image quality will detract from our ability to invest in the story. But, as the film progresses, it settles into a look all its own, and the grainy, hand-held camera-work actually seems more real and immediate, drawing us ever-closer to the edges of our seats as the narrative twists and contorts.In INLAND EMPIRE, characters cross over the threshold defining the limits of reality and fiction, co-exist with their other-world counterparts in one fluctuating existential plane and change wholly and completely from one scene to another, Lynch all the while serving up the kind of hallucinatory hell that cinema-goers have come to demand of him. Just as you think you're figuring it out, Lynch throws in a dance sequence set to 'The Locomotion,' cuts to a sitcom comprised of giant rabbit-people, or offers a glimpse at what appears to be footage straight from the original doomed film.As time perpetually folds back in on itself and the film's visual motifs begin to pile up, it becomes clear that this is Lynch's most daring and bizarre film yet. This is video art as feature film, with a serpentine narrative that defies comprehension driving us onward to oblivion with Lynch at the wheel. Its most obvious points of comparison are Lynch's own Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive, but even they seem like child's play when compared to EMPIRE, which offers tantalising clues to unlocking its mysteries, with the audience forever ten strides behind.This is Lynch down the rabbit hole and through the looking glass, a psychotropic epic that remains fascinating throughout, despite its three hour duration and the intentionally confounding nature of its plot. If you appreciate Lynch's previous exercises in dream logic and nightmare vision, and can handle the extended running time, INLAND EMPIRE is essential viewing. It's a terrifying and uncompromised journey to the depths of the subconscious, and one of the boldest cinematic statements of the year.http://celluloidtongue.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the Best Lynch Film But Quite Possibly the Strangest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nikki: Are you enjoying yourself, Freddie? Freddie Howard: Well... There is a vast network, right? An ocean of possibilities. I like dogs. I used to raise rabbits. I've always loved animals. Their nature. How they think. I have seen dogs reason their way out of problems. Watched them think through the trickiest situations. Do you have a couple of bucks I could borrow? I've got this damn landlord.Wow! Okay....so if you thought David Lynch's last film 'Mulholland Drive' wasn't weird enough....'Inland Empire' will be a real treat. Loaded with a bunch of cameos from high profile and very talented actors, 'Inland Empire' is basically a 3-hour nightmare of our heroine Nikki Grace (Laura Dern). Nikki is a struggling actress who gets a part in a big Oscar bait movie that's a remake of a Polish film that was never completed. However the acceptance of the role comes with a cautious and spooky warning from some random old woman (Grace Zabriskie -- HBO's Big Love) who tells Nikki that the movie is "cursed". Nikki, who thinks the old woman is off her rocker, accepts the role anyway and after that strange things begin to happen to her and the lines between reality and fantasy begin to blur. Unlike any of Lynch's other films beside perhaps 'Eraserhead', 'Inland Empire' makes absolutely no sense. 'Mulholland Drive' at least had an understandable plot, 'Inland Empire' is just so scattered, off-the-wall and random that it's impossible to understand from one viewing. I guess I'll have to watch it a couple more times to TRULY understand the film. That being said I look forward to seeing it again. Although it didn't make sense, it's a beautiful film from a cinematography/directing standpoint. Always the innovator, David Lynch takes his film-making craft to new heights with this extremely original and awesomely shot three hour epic. The acting is solid as well. Laura Dern is absolutely incredible as the lead, giving one of if not her best screen performance yet. Dern nails the role and let's hope for a Best Actress Oscar Nomination that WON'T happen next awards season. That being said Dern has support from big actors in tiny roles. Jeremy Irons is fabulous as always as the film within a film's director while Justin Theroux is perfectly cast as Dern's co-star. Harry Dean Stanton, who you might know as the twisted polygamist tyrant in HBO's masterful drama 'Big Love', is delightfully creepy/awkward in a minuscule part as Jeremy Iron's character's assistant. Daine Ladd, Naomi Watts, Mary Steenburgen, William H. Macy, Scott Coffey, Laura Harring, Diane Ladd and Big Love's Grace Zabriskie (who is delightfully morbid) are all solid in cameo roles. Like I previously stated, 'Inland Empire' probably won't make any sense to you. Your average movie goer will hate it, but those who see movies more as art rather than entertainment will probably find some way of appreciating it. I didn't love 'Inland Empire', I'm not even sure I liked it, but I sure as hell appreciated it. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar thematics; much greater complexity both narrative and technical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lynch is on familiar ground here, echoing what he began on "Lost Highway" and added to with "Mulholland Drive": the interchangeable/mirror-identity trick, in-narrative self-references, the Mobius-strip construction of narrative loops, a re-imagining of time itself (the film presents itself as unfolding memory). Thematically, we are dealing with questions of identity, infidelity, memory and various epistemological problems. However, Lynch goes much further here stylistically than he has before, making very effective use of digital's simplicity (even as his montage and musical mixing reaches new levels of intensity) and making what is surely his most detailed and intricate film yet.The film has a coherent meta-narrative, and, yes, Lynch does wrap things up (at least formally), but once down the rabbit hole we are taken through a mirrored fun house where it seems as if the film's very images have been sliced and refracted with (and through) shards of mirror. Its recursive structure is at once maddening and entrancing, and at times one feels as if Lynch is trying to one-up himself in the connections department. However, I was much less bored than I had expected to be and honestly cannot say that the film needs editing-- Lynch has gotten to the point, once unimaginable for him, where the appearance of randomness is both welcome and integral to the story.I hope Lynch continues down this path, but it will likely be commercial suicide. He will have to make another more conventional movie or two to pay the bills, but we certainly must be grateful that he went way out on a limb with Inland Empire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adding to the noise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Official reviews of this latest film from David Lynch descried it at best as "opaque", "hard to summarize" and "to be experienced rather than explained", to at worst "indulgent", "complete nonsense" and made without consideration for the audience. However, in defense of David Lynch, for one who has followed a number of his films Inland Empire holds a coherent and linear narrative, and one that most novice Lynch viewers can follow with a few pointers. As with many of Lynch's films, much of the narrative is played out in the main character's subconscious or dreamscape. Arguable in the case of Inland Empire this is true for the entire film. There a few mechanism's Lynch has used in a number of films that recur here to highlight this. In particular floor-to-ceiling red drapes (best known for the "Black Lodge" of Twin Peaks) indicate the subconscious, and the character moving through the drapes either indicates a deeper delving in to the subconscious or an elevation towards reality. Also a static room populated with strange characters usually indicates the very depths of the subconscious and typically as a character approaches this room this indicates a complete detachment from reality and decent in to psychosis. It is important to note, as with Mulholland Drive, the principle character the audience is introduced to ? Nikki (as played by Laura Dern) ? is not the protagonist. It is the protagonist's most prominent extension of herself in her own subconscious, though not necessarily the only one. The genuine protagonist makes a brief appearance half way through the film with only one line of dialogue. The basic story is of "a woman in trouble" as quoted by Lynch. This can be expanded on with a number of options without spoiling the film (Lynch's real skill is making films that are practically impossible to spoil). This troubled woman is a neglected, possibly abused, wife who could possibly be a stranger in a foreign land thus furthering her alienation. However she has dreams of much greater things ? hence her subconscious extension of herself as Nikki (Laura Dern), a desirable movie star. In her real life she pursues her dream through a one-sided affair with a Lothario type figure. She is jilted by her lover and is left with an unwanted pregnancy. She loses the baby ? "her son" ? either through a beating from her husband, or a self inflicted or back street abortion. At this point she may or may not murder her husband. Either way guilt, anger and abandonment combine with her existing feelings of alienation to accelerate her downward spiral. The usual hard drugs and sex follow, further increasing the protagonist's desire to detach from reality. Ultimately she dies, either physically or through a complete and permanent detachment from reality ? as indicated by the brief uniting of her happy family, son included. In this context, be it however close to Lynch's vision, all the imagery of the film can be interpreted and the plot followed from beginning to end. Lynch always leaves his films open to interpretation, and he is especially reluctant to explain his stories ? the above "a woman in trouble" was his most forthcoming explanation of this film when pushed. This is definitely a film for the viewer to choose to be engaged and not simply an indulgence by and for David Lynch himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A raw, unfiltered descent to the core of the psyche</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you love Lynch's films, hate his films, or fall somewhere in between, it's hard to deny his deliberate attention to detail and potent symbolism. I discovered it early on in my journey through his discography. Due to this, I never bought into the beliefs that 'there is no plot' or 'Lynch is just plain strange' or 'it's not meant to be interpreted'. I agree his films ARE meant to be felt &amp; experienced, but if you fail to follow his intricate construction you are robbing yourself of the full enjoyment his movies offer.Here is my take. This strikes me as Lynch's most personal film. A lot of you ask 'Why digital video?' I had to recall something an English professor told me years ago about one of my own papers. "It ventures deep and far into halls of private vibration, and may occasionally lose sharpness as a result." This teacher allowed artistic freedom and I often found myself 'painting with words' in his assignments. THIS is what Lynch seems to be after here. The DV allows him to go to the deepest, darkest places in the mind. It is raw, unfiltered, even primal, and it isn't meant to be polished. The close ups and grainy focus are the most personal we can get with the Lost Girl and the various personas she has become. The long hallways and dark rooms each represent the journey to different components of her mind, each a piece of her fractured psyche.What Lynch started with Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive he finishes here. In those films he dipped into the water partway--now he has taken the plunge with his approach. We get the protagonist's view of it all.The blonde character isn't the actual protagonist. She is the most identified piece of the Woman in Trouble. The real protagonist is Lost Girl, the brunette seen crying in interludes as she watches the snowy TV set. She is reliving the tragedy her life became in her mind over and over, in torment, searching for an ending that frees her from her anguish.THE PERSONAS: Lost Girl, housewife, actress and whore. THE TRAGEDY: She had an affair with her co-star, got pregnant, killed her abusive husband after an argument and miscarried her love child. THE TROUBLE: She has punished herself for killing her husband plus the unborn child's death, and sees herself as a failure for straying. In her mind, she is a double-murderess and whore who has also failed @ her Hollywood dream.THE RESOLUTION: When she confronts the Phantom (most likely her abuser when young) and kills him, symbolically she is confronting the demon that started it all and grew out of control: failed marriage, failed @ motherhood, failed @ Hollywood dream. She stabs herself with the screwdriver(attempted abortion?)and slowly dies. THE CLEANSING: As she is now free from her demons, blonde and brunette personas kiss--this is her way of forgiving her lost self for the unspeakable infidelity and murders. Lost girl is reunited with her dead husband and son.This feels like a culmination by Lynch and may be the last film he ever makes. The end credits suggest it's a personal goodbye to his viewers with the appearance of some past cast members. My verdict? This is a remarkable achievement. I'd have shortened some of the still and silent passages and dove into the fracture a bit earlier. Could be 15-20 minutes shorter. Otherwise, well done. Lynch trusts his audiences to figure out the meaning for themselves if they wish (some may not wish to and that's okay). Don't short change this intricate tale of a woman in trouble by not going through the 'trouble' of soaking up everything you see, hear, and feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch stretches his style to the extreme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch's best works (Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Mulholland Drive) are hyperbolic melodramas permeated by a surreal dream logic and punctuated by moments of terror. Inland Empire, as of this writing still his most recent feature film, takes his trademark style to the extreme--not always to the film's advantage.In Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, Lynch seamlessly integrates his surrealism into the narrative as a sort of subversive counterpoint to the idyllic, small-town Americana setting. Mulholland Drive transposes the wide-eyed protagonist (now Naomi Watts, taking on the Kyle MacLachlan naif role) to Hollywood, where the weight of dream (il)logic becomes even more pervasive. Inland Empire, likewise about an up-and-coming blonde actress in Hollywood, goes a few more steps down the rabbit hole, where it nearly loses its bearings altogether.Much of Inland Empire's three-hour run time takes place in this Lynchian otherworld, where the subconscious and supernatural are at the fore. Lynch is never interested in distinguishing these elements from "reality," but in Inland Empire he's not even much interested in tethering them to a developed narrative. Laura Dern's character, Nikki Grace, has even less of a back story than that of Naomi Watts in Mulholland Drive. Her co-star and the director in the film-within-a-film (Justin Theroux and Jeremy Irons, respectively) basically disappear from the story about midway through.If the uninitiated viewer has made it this far, they may be tempted to give it up around this point. The mounting menagerie of unexplained characters, the continual transitions from one stage of consciousness or one setting to another, and the sheer length test your patience. There are many extraneous or indulgent moments, even by Lynch's standards.But, against the odds, Lynch manages to (mostly) close the loop in the film's denouement. The film's final fourth contains a scene in the Hollywood gutter that is, for me, one of Lynch's most unsettling, most head-scratching and yet most powerful. Lynch's preoccupation with the primordial forces of love and evil, life and death still manages to pack a punch in the most unexpected of ways.I would not recommend Inland Empire to those unfamiliar with Lynch's filmography. It is obtuse and difficult enough to test the resolve of even his admirers. But there is enough of his trademark bizarre brilliance to reward those who forgive its excesses and stick it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible, dark and beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch uses his most dark and beautiful imagery in his longest film of the "Los Angeles 3". The film preceded by "Lost Highway" and "Mullholland Drive", it takes the themes of identity and the Los Angeles culture, present in those films, and explores them to their fullest degree.A twisted love story, a trip into a fractured mind, a look at the darkness of human nature, a psychosis of a woman lost? Whatever this film is, it seems certainly to be about, among a great deal of other things, women; it says to me that Lynch cherishes them. Whether she be a downtrodden prostitute, or a million dollar starlet, the message about the oneness of being is quite beautiful.For its three hours it transfixes you, pulls you in. An incredible, overlooked performance from the wonderful Laura Dern, gorgeous but nightmarish images, a sound production that is second to none, a finale that seems to be the perfect, emotional close to a film that, like all his abstract work, you understand in your heart long before you ever will in your head. If you're willing to go with it, this is stunning.As a sidenote, "Inland Empire" also contains what I believe to be one of the most unexpectedly frightening images in the history of cinema; certainly an image that haunts you for a long time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inland Homage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire cannot be described as anything other than a ride or a trip. You cannot spoil this film, as it becomes a personal experience for every viewer. I enjoyed the journey and felt utterly hopeless to tag along.Lynch has made no secret of his passion for Fellini and you can see the influence throughout this film. I found it to be a collaborative homage to many of the great filmmakers of the past. Strong references to Fellini, Bergman, Kieslowski, Bunuel are evident throughout, however his homages are kept solely to style and are not met with any obvious "salutes" to specific films. Kudos. It has been a while since I have seen a film successfully combine film history with the present in an enjoyable movie experience.This is not the type of film to go to if you want to unwind, however no Lynch film is. THis is a thinking person's film, and although you may not likely ever fully understand what Lynch is trying to portray, you will be able to derive your own meaning and interpretation of it (which to me is the true moviegoers' experience anyway)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate Lynch film, but not necessarily the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire feels like the film David Lynch has worked his entire career towards making. It has the dark, surreal atmosphere of Eraserhead, the cheesiness and twisted narrative of Mulholland Dr. and the sheer terror of Lost Highway, and all of it seemingly in larger amounts that his earlier films. In a sense this makes Inland Empire his magnum opus, but somehow it still leaves me a bit less blown away than his previous works.I have always wondered what would happen if David Lynch dismissed any attempts of a traditional narrative and made a strictly surreal film. Inland Empire is the closest he has ever come to that, and while I applaud his ambition and admire how he always goes his own way, I can't help but feel that I got a bit more than I had asked for. I have seen Inland Empire several times, and am still not sure if I dare to make a brief plot summary. Suffice to say, it is about an actress named Nikki Grace (played by a magnificent Laura Dern), whose latest role as a married woman having an affair with another man is uncannily similar to her own life (at one point, she says "Damn! This sounds like dialogue from our script!" only to find that she is actually on the set recording a scene from the film). As her character and real life persona are getting more involved in the love affair, the film grows increasingly surreal and delves deep into a haunting nightmare containing murder, abuse, Eastern European prostitutes and some kind of rabbit sitcom. Needless to say, Lynch fans will recognize the style, but it also has a more complex structure than usual, where we are not sure exactly how everything is connected or "what came before, or after", as Nikki puts it herself.. The dark style along with the difficult structure makes the film very intriguing in many ways and makes rewatches extremely rewarding, but I also think it makes it somewhat heavy-handed. Indeed, clocking in at almost three hours I sometimes find it a bit too much. I am actually more exhausted after seeing Inland Empire than, say, the seven hour long Sátántangó.Laura Dern, who I have only seen in Blue Velvet and Wild at Heart before where she didn't really leave an impression on me, is absolutely fantastic. She has countless nuances; she plays an abused wife, a prostitute and a glamorous movie star, presumably within the same character, and she goes from tears to laughter in the same scene without it ever feeling forced. Finally, parts of Inland Empire are undeniably brilliant and ranks among the best I have ever seen on film. It's hard to pick out a particular sequence as the film has a sort of stream of consciousness way of progressing, but some of the scenes where Laura Dern is just walking through dark corridors and goes in and out of different rooms are amazing and keeps me at the edge of my seat. But there are also weaker parts that neither work as standalone segments, nor within the context of the film. For example, the subplot with some kind of Polish circus tour leaves me strangely indifferent and could just as well have been removed from the film as far as I am concerned. In conclusion, Inland Empire is divisive even among hardcore Lynch fans, but I urge everyone to see it at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Kafkaesque Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Inland Empire" is, beneath "Mullholland Drive" David Lynchs best work. He tells the story of an actress, played by Laura Dern, who worked with him also in the Lynch-Classics "Blue Velvet(1986)" and "Wild at Heart (1990)". The bounds between Reality and Fiction become indistinct and Laura Dern finds himself in a Kafkaesque nightmare. It looks like there is no escape from this dark nightmare but the bizarre happy ending proofs the opposite.What I like so much about David Lynchs movies is that he doesn't tell stories you have heard over and over again like it is in the overproduced Hollywood Mainstream garbage, no, he makes his audience think.There are a lot of Plot Twists, who make this movie a real pleasure. The music is, as always in Lynchs work, excellent and the cast, too, is perfect: Laura Dern as the Actress, Justin Theroux as Actor, Jeremy Irons as Director, the fantastic William H. Macy in a small role, Harry Dean Stanton - bad as always, Stanley Kamel (from "Monk") and even the beautiful Laura Harring from "Mullholland Drive" makes a special appearance at the end of the movie.With 172 Minutes running time it is one of David Lynchs longest running movies but it is really worth to watch. An excellent Kafkaesque Masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch at it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very hard film to comment about based on only one viewing, and if I ever find the time and energy to wade through this 3 hour long and very rambling bizarre-fest I might come out with a different appraisal of it. But at this point what I feel is that it's a very gorgeous movie and a very innovative use of digital film, but I don't care much for what seems to be the story (you really have to guess, even moreso than with Lynch's other films). I really just think this film is much too long to hold the audience's attention given how loosely the narrative structure holds anything together. There's a balancing act going on in Lynch's stranger films, particularly his most recent ones like "Mulholland Dr." and "Lost Highway." Whatever balance he achieved in those films is only rarely present in this film as far as I can tell.One interesting thing about the movie is that in the first hour or so there are all kinds of fascinating characters being introduced, practically all of them played by veteran quality actors. Laura Dern plays the central character, Jeremy Irons shows up as a director making a movie with her, Harry Dean Stanton is Irons' assistant Freddie, and we even see Diane Ladd and William H. Macy very briefly. I was deeply surprised to see Mary Steenburgen showing up, but upon reflection I'm sure she's probably always wanted to work with Lynch. But as the movie goes on most of these characters drop away and we're left with Dern and a group of very gritty Polish actors. I can see how this might be the structure Lynch wanted but it really put me off, and I was having trouble staying interested in the last hour of the film. I started to suspect that there was no possible way for the film to really "payoff" my investment, and I was right.... at least in the case of this first viewing. I believe in making the audience work to figure out things for themselves, but I'm pretty well convinced that there's not really anything here to be figured out. Again the balance seems to be off and there seems to be a strong element here of process for the sake of process. Much as with "Mulholland Dr.", this film is about the problems of film-making in a broad sense. The problems of how we identify with characters and how we see ourselves in them, reflected through the film and through our experience of it. Certainly the "weeping girl" could be watching the film and seeing various aspects of herself in it and that could be an explanation for what's "happening" in the film. But I don't see the point even given that.I didn't hate it so I won't say that it's a bad movie. It's a lovely piece of pure film and I'm sure that for some people the idea of rudimentary plot is not important. I think the one thing Lynch has always done in his films is to bring powerful performances to the screen, that's what has linked his more bizarre films to his melodramas like "The Straight Story." But in this case he did not even give his actors enough material to really shine, so although everyone is competent there's nothing outstanding by way of performances. This is a self-indulgent film, but if there's any director in America who I'd like to see indulge himself it's David Lynch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sink Into the Mind of David Lynch (That's a Dare)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nobody puts dreams -- or should I say, nightmares -- on screen better than David Lynch, and "Inland Empire" is perhaps the most nightmarish film of his I've seen yet.Laura Dern tears up the screen in a fierce performance as an actress who loses her identity during the making of a film and gets sucked into a vortex of terrifying imagery and labyrinthine parallels, otherwise known as Hollywood.We've been here with Lynch before, as recently as his last movie, "Mulholland Drive," which "Inland Empire" is a kissing cousin of. But this film, much more so than "Mulholland," defies categorization or interpretation. It's a movie that forces you to feel its themes rather than process them through any of the normal faculties we use to understand movies. But for all that, and even though it clocks in at three hours, it didn't feel indulgent to me, or pretentious, or like a random series of images that any old hack could throw up on the screen. Even on a first viewing (and I could use many more), I could see how tightly constructed the whole thing was, catch recurring ideas and motifs, recurring patterns, colors and textures. The film looks amazing; Lynch does wonders with digital film. I'm surprised myself that I didn't become frustrated with the movie, but it's so alive, and so purely cinematic, that I instead was completely engrossed by the pictures it had to show me.Though the movie belongs to Dern, a slew of recognizable actors appear in prominent roles or in cameos: Justin Theroux, Jeremy Irons, Diane Ladd, William H. Macy, Mary Steenburgen. Naomi Watts provides a voice.This is sensational stuff, extremely well done. A trip into the mind of David Lynch, even if you don't enjoy it, is one trip you will not soon forget.Grade: A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my favourite film of the year by far. I always love the work of David Lynch, and this is by far his best work yet. It is 3 hours long, and some parts may seam overly long at first, but the second time you watch it it all seams perfect. This film is only let down by one minor complaint about the way it is filmed, with a Digial camera, though the shots are beautifully clear and so sharp they suck you in, there is moments of shaking and easy moving camera that at first I disliked, but it grows on you. INLAND EMPIRE will not be to everyone's taste, but i'm happy to say to those it will appeal, It is well worth it! 20 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The flowing of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've my own opinion about Lynch. He's a rather crude arranger, while being a sublime painter at the same time. His ambition is to portray, portray philosophical aspects of life and he uses first a layer of abstraction, a net of relations that correspond to the philosophical aspects in question and then a colouring and flavouring of the pieces in this net.The likability of the outcome depends mostly on the last step, whereas the first step is the foundation of any real artistic claim. All of Lynch's films I've seen, four in total so far, follow this procedure and none of them does flat out fail."Inland empire" is about captivity in time, even if you said to yourself that you had understood nothing about the film, you would subscribe that. When it comes to Lynch, look at what is there, evidently, and don't try to look out for things that aren't there. Is Vladimir Harkonnen's sadism subtle? No, nothing is, Lynch doesn't need that, he's a crude arranger, subtle is only the look on things, the things themselves are crude.So, how can you be caught in time? That's a philosophical question and all that "Inland empire" wants is to transport an idea of how you can be so! Actually, I haven't seen one film of Lynch whose philosophical questions wouldn't be covered in Schopenhauer's work, but I like his films still, because he always goes a step further, personalises the questions, links them to his own life.I could go on and decipher "Inland empire", it wouldn't be that hard, knowing the answers, but that shouldn't be my job here. Let me just point to some essential elements. You stand before your future or past and you can't link to it. People are seen in very different settings, under very different influences, and they fill them out, sometimes grotesquely passive, the sets range from marble mansion, over Polish province to Californian sidewalk. You also see fighting spirit, surprises. It is important though that battling remains in a larger cage too, there's no development here like in "Wild at heart". There's a film in the film and you often don't know whose script you follow. Finally, there is salvation, again linked to fertility, but this time not as a natural conclusion, but as an act of will, a decision to break out of ones captivity in time.In the flowing of time, take a break.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Especially Surprising Excursion Into a Whacked Out, Yet Way Too Familier Mind Set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is like a mad genius who have some many amazing and great ideas that can never really be described in any sort of vocal way. He's like a person so full of strange ideas and views and the closest he can express them is in film. INLAND EMPIRE is partly about a woman in some sort of reality trouble when she becomes involved in a remake of a Polish film. It is also partly about mistaken events that happen, but in a different sort of time slot. But somehow these time slots are able to juxtapose themselves with the present to create a totally unique mind frame. The film is also about mistaken identity and confused caricatures of the human mind. It is extremely difficult to describe this film in a simple plot way, so I'll end this paragraph by stating that, to say the least, things are never quite the same or ever will be quite the same as they were before or as they were intended. If somebody wants an explanation of this film, they'll have to preach to the choir. Any sort of meaning for this film is totally not important. What is important is actually viewing the film and having an opinion about what it could mean. That is the fun of a David Lynch film. Nobody knows what he is trying to get and in his films and that is the appeal of them. To say that a film is structured in the style of the artist has never been more true then in the case of INLAND EMPIRE. I can't say any more. Just, watch it as soon as possible to see what i mean.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inland Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally I've also seen David Lynch's new film "Inland Empire". And as one can expect it was a very intense experience. Even more than "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Dr." this is a film you have to feel, not understand. You have to give yourself into Lynch's hands and let him control your emotions. If you do that you will have an eye-opening experience. It's extraordinary again here, how he is able to create cinematic moments that are utterly frightening at first and two seconds later it becomes so bizarre that you can't help but laugh out loud. The soundtrack and "score" of this film are so good, it's almost impossible to imagine this film without it. Maybe there is no one else, who is that good in working with the interaction of sound and image, than Lynch. And finally: Laura Dern. What an unbelievable acting tour de force. Not nominating this for an Oscar was a crime (if they want the Oscar to be meaningful). For me it was a bit too long, but an amazing three-hour challenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much of a good thing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Federico Fellini's Satyricon and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey are two of my favorite films. I don't mind abstract imagery, or long films with slow pacing. David Lynch's Mulholland Drive also ranks very high on my favorite films list. Cryptic story telling is exciting to be apart of as long as there are enough clues given throughout the film to allow a clear interpretation.I wasn't bothered by Inland Empire because it was abstract, long, or cryptic. Inland Empire didn't work for me because it was ALL of these things to the second power. If it was shorter in length, it probably would have been easier for me to digest the cryptic and abstract imagery. If the story was told in a more direct way, the length probably wouldn't have become an issue. I found myself drifting far too often during this film. And when I tried to watch it again, I still couldn't get through it without thinking about something else. Inland Empire didn't give me any entry points, so my mind was left outside looking in, and free to wander to other places during the last 2 hours.David Lynch is one of my favorite directors. I have enjoyed most of the work he has done, including Eraserhead. But I felt Inland Empire was far too sporadic, even for my taste. I give it a 6/10 for its moments of inspired creativity, and for the guts Lynch had to make a film that is probably one of the most experimental I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a film to love, but to admire and to fight with. Or in other words : ART</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A new film by David Lynch; that means fanatical approval on one side, incomprehension and furious rejection on the other.But luckily there are different ways of making movies.I have seen nearly every film by Lynch: from "Eraserhead"( one of the midnight-movie favorites of the 80's) to "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Drive". "Inland Empire" together with the latter two forms a brilliant tryptich.A lot of motives and subjects from earlier films are found here and developed.It would be useless and more or less impossible to talk about contents: I see it as a nightmarish trip in the "empire" of symbols and their psychoanalysis with clear hints to fairy-tales like those of the Grimms (the old witch at the beginning,the 7 whores = the 7 dwarfs ?!) or to Caroll.Other people will come with other maybe contradictory interpretations,but the film not only permits it,even requests it.It is like an art installation,which develops in the heads of the viewers its own individual life.For my girlfriend for example it was the most typical film of Lynch and by the same time a parody of a Lynch film.I'm eagerly waiting for the DVD and the philosophizing interpretations after some more viewings of the film.BeforeI forget: Highest praise to the notoriously underestimated Laura Dern for her absolute commitment to this strange,mesmerising and menacing role.Why the film gets only 9 points:The images.DV gives Lynch the independence to shoot such a film,but the partly murky images lack the precise,clearcut and chilling atmosphere of the earlier films.But that's only a minor quibble.As conclusion David Lynch himself:"The film can't be understood,it must be experienced".I wish you all the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless and profound</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terrifying in parts, also infuriatingly tedious at times, it's a truly Surrealist film, so it responds to no criteria except its own. It pays no respect to its audience, nor narrative nor generic conventions. It destabilizes any aesthetic judgment because it places no value on such a thing. How wonderfully refreshing to see a film that doesn't give a damn about us! It's mission is not to entertain us, nor tell us a story, nor uplift us, nor win Oscars, nor sell merchandise nor pave the way for a sequel, prequel or trilogy. How gloriously blasphemous! It invokes many of the most cherished Surrealist themes: death, the loss of identity, the schism between dreams and reality, cyclical events, doubles and doppelgangers. It also links with Mulholland Dr. in that it details how an actress goes to Hollywood and loses her identity. At least I think it does.Inland Empire is jarringly playful and sometimes heartbreakingly sad. It rescues film, if only for a moment and three hours, from the tyranny of having to tell a story to people who are too lazy to read books. It celebrates, in the most perverse manner, the potential of cinema to do something unique with movement, light and sound. No other medium can do what Inland Empire does.At half an hour, I'd had enough. I considered walking out, which is a wholly valid Surrealist response. At two hours too. In the 1920s the Surrealists would do just that. Go into a cinema half way through a film, watch twenty minutes then leave and go into another for another half hour or minute. And so on. Then they'd create a single film from all the fragments. We don't have to because Lynch has done this for us.This is a sadistic film - and there's a profound link between sadism and Surrealism - because Lynch keeps 'ending' it, and then carrying on. The meaning is clear, that we cannot choose when we awake from a nightmare.At three hours, I didn't want it to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I totally agree with those who say that IE is more like Lynch's first movies. A pure, and I say PURE, Lynch fan should recognise that fact. I think Lynch has achieved what he has experimented so far in his movies from Eraserhead to Mulholland Drive: that is to create a cinematographic experience that goes way beyond the boundaries of an imposed narrative linearity.Like he says, we should'not watch a movie trying to understand it and figure out what it's all about, instead we should sit back, relax, and enjoy the trip. For those who are familiar with Lynch's art - I'm talking here about his movies but also his paintings, his photographs, and his digital experiments on the net - IE embraces all these fields. When I saw it, I felt I could appreciate his intentions, thus enjoy the movie without trying to understand the "story". There is a story, of course, but then it does not matter that much. We need to get out of our system to fully enjoy such a piece of art! No kidding! Inland Empire should be judged, and criticised, with that in mind and nothing else. For those of you who think they're gonna go watch just an ordinary piece of film, then think again because you might be disappointed. Don't expect what you usually expect,don't even expect Lynch, expect nothing, that's how you enjoy it. Last thing, the use of DV is the proof that Lynch is a man who knows how to live in the present, while still staying faithful to his ideas! To sum up Inland Empire is the realisation of his unique flow of ideas that has developed, project after project, failure after success, over the years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Lynch Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire, in David Lynch fashion, manages to shock the senses and boggle the mind. In a recent interview David Lynch was asked what Inland Empire was actually about. His response: "It's about a woman in trouble". This simple description pretty much sums up the films plot. However, this film is more of an artistic social commentary than a "story". I won't mention the messages I believe the film conveys to refrain from spoilers. Artistically, every scene is brilliantly crafted and there are many images and noises that shock the senses. At times the movie is frightening, sad, and outright hilarious. Although it can sometimes be hard to tell which emotion Lynch is trying to evoke. Adding to this film's brilliance is the cast. All of the supporting actors play their quirky roles to a tee and Laura Dern is amazing. The only thing I disliked of Inland Empire was its nearly three hour runtime. Regardless, practically everyone in the theater I attended stayed seated until the very last credit.As a side note... David Lynch has decided to cut out large movie theater monopolies by only allowing smaller independent theaters to play his film. If you are lucky enough to have Inland Empire play near you, see it and support your local theater.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Haunts You Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw Inland Empire at the American Film Institute Festival back in 2006, I was initially disappointed with the film.At the time, I felt like it was a pale imitation of Mulholland Drive, which I still consider to by Lynch's masterpiece. Whereas Mulholland Drive was able to anchor its non-linear structure to a coherent narrative, Inland Empire seemed to be nothing more than a random set of scenes strung together arbitrarily. Blue Velvet also dealt with similar themes as Inland Empire, and also had a stronger narrative flow.And, to be completely honest, I had a huge headache after watching Inland Empire, and by the time the third hour started, and the prostitutes started shouting incoherently at each other on some Eastern European street, I was getting annoyed and frustrated with the film.At the same time, I couldn't get Inland Empire out of my mind for days, and even months, after watching it. Certain scenes from the film would pop into my mind as I was going about my daily life. It was like the film was haunting me.Then, the more I thought about the film, the more it made sense to me, and I started to connect certain scenes together, and appreciate the stream of conscious approach Lynch took in making the film.Now, I consider Inland Empire to be a masterpiece, and Lynch's second best film behind Mulholland Drive. To draw another parallel, Inland Empire is Lynch's Casino, and Mulholland Drive is his Goodfellas.What Lynch is doing with Inland Empire is trying to recreate as accurately as possible the dream state into a narrative form, but whereas his earlier films flirted with the non-linear realm of the subconscious, they were still anchored by straightforward linear narratives.With Inland Empire, Lynch abandons all narrative conventions, and in the process invents a new form of cinema--cinema as dream state.Whatever you do, do not try to make logical sense of this movie, because that is not its point.Just experience it, and don't over analyze it. See how it makes you FEEL.Lynch is a genius, that is all I can say.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Through the hole in the silk?Inland Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch has made many "masterpieces" in his career. From the critically heralded Elephant Man, to the cult classic Blue Velvet, his debut surrealist nightmare Eraserhead, and the most recent headtrips, Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr, Lynch has always found a way to get into our psyches, grab a hold, and not let go until years after your viewing, if at all. With his latest film, Inland Empire, we are given his least accessible plot yet. As far as comprehending anything that is happening before your eyes, once you think you have a grip, he totally tosses your ideas out the window. Coherence, linear progression, or even characters staying the characters that they are at first will not be found here. Instead, Lynch has crafted his most viscerally rich tale of imagination and dream, once again exposing the underbelly of society and the human condition. People cannot be trusted and all will betray those they love. If we are to believe what transpires here, and your guilt and/or paranoia for finding how those around you have let you down won't kill you, your manifestations of fully choreographed dance sequences involving your prostitute friends most certainly will.If you are reading this hoping for some semblance of a plot summary, I think Lynch's tagline description is all you need: this is a tale about "a woman in trouble." Well, let us make that women in trouble, unless we can find a way to think all the different entities played by Karolina Gruszka and Laura Dern are in fact one and the same. The story starts out very well, much how the last couple films Lynch has created have. There is a strange visitor, played brilliantly by Grace Zabriske with a flawless Balkinish accent, who calls on our actress lead (Dern) to discuss her new role. Along with premonitions and cryptic talk about 9:45 and after midnight, and today and tomorrow, she relays a couple old stories, one about a man and another of a woman going to market and the alley behind. Not only do these stories end up occurring in some form later on, but the times themselves as well as the aspect of time alone play a strong role in all scenes. It is when the tomorrow our visitor speaks of starts to play out that we are thrust into the story as it struggles through scene changes, character swapping, and even to a soap opera starring people in rabbit suits, complete with canned applause and laughter.What at first seems to be straightforward, a mirroring of adulterous lives between our actress Nikki and actor Devon with their fictional counterparts Sue and Billy, becomes so much more. It begins to unravel to the point where the audience can't tell which reality is the true one, or if both are false while the truth lies in a third reality between a different Sue and Billy met by his wife Doris' eventually finding out and wielding of a screwdriver for retribution. However, once it seems to be continuing nicely, complete with a fourth mirroring of the Polish actors involved in the original version of the movie they are shooting, everything changes as aspects become switched around. The screwdriver leaves Doris' hands and enters those of one of Dern's many incarnations. Her husband, as Nikki, becomes the husband of many different female roles and we have a strange voyeur played by Gruszka watching everything transpire on television. Finally, Dern ends up discovering everything is being played out on a movie theater screen, her life being shown for all, although it is she who is the lone viewer.Eventually, I started to see the many references to Lynch's past films. Whether they be literal, Zabriske's acceptance of a drink with similar yet opposite reaction as that of Angelo Badalamenti in Mulholland Drive; to common metaphor prop usage, the colored lamps, curtains, and prevalence of phones as communication between parallel realities; or even playing on the notions of certain interpretations that have been made of past films, Lost Highway being a complete dream by a man guilt stricken from killing his wife and a scene here where Dern's character is dying and those watching start mentioning things that have been happening, as if explaining how the film has been a manifestation of what she heard as she died; the correlations are endless. It is almost like Lynch wanted his first foray into digital film to be one of rebirth.If I were to wager any kind of guess to the true meaning of this film, having just seen it with little time to flesh out each thread shown, it would be as follows. Inland Empire, to me, is a commentary on the state of Hollywood and the inferior films churning out from it. The general public goes and sees drivel and by allowing it to succeed, helps make certain more will be made. Answers don't need to be spoonfed to the viewers, and actually they shouldn't. I believe Lynch is calling out actors for facilitating this degradation in quality by calling them whores to the business. Dern continuously watches herself slowly fall apart as she cheats on her artistic interest with vanity. Her friends even say how if you have great cleavage, you are set for life because talent plays no role in success. It is only Gruszka's lost girl watching television that sees the destruction occurring around her, crying at the horror of it all. Desperate to do something about it, she finally gets up and sees her husband and son come home to her. Hers is the only happiness, while all the other characters find themselves trapped inside the house of vanity, surrounded by the other whores, living their selfish lives without regard for the society they are doing a disservice to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>made me happy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People here and elsewhere have already written a lot about this movie and will continue to, I'm sure, so I'll just say something quick: I left the theater, and I felt positively giddy. This movie made me happy. I gave it ten stars here, and I think it deserves it, because really - how often is it that a movie makes you feel genuinely happy? I love this film (um, digital video) and I love that it actually exists in the same world as me, as it were. IMDb requires at least ten lines, so i'll add: if you don't like David Lynch to start, then you will absolutely hate this movie. If you don't like Laura Dern then you'll probably hate it, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The master of illusionism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The great master of illusionism, David Lynch, is back to drive us, once more, into the depths of the unknown sub-worlds that exist in his own mind? The surrealism, the fear, the paranoia, the mysterious characters, the enigmatic rooms, the stairs, the red curtains are present, as they usually do in his works. It's all part of his cinematographic aesthetic and his personal and self-created iconography. That's why he's the master of illusionism, the creator of all dreams and nightmares to the ones that dare to penetrate his puzzling and confusing mind. He created his own world that, like a labyrinth, is full of rooms and doors. As we pass by the rooms they become stranger and stranger, but it always exist one more door to open even more rooms. It's like entering in a sub-world of unknown dimension and complexity.In a movie like Inland Empire there's no need to talk about the plot. Even if exist one, and probably there is (a complex, perverse, distorted and full of twists one, but I believe there is?), it's not the most important! At least for me, in a David Lynch movie, the plot is always what matters the less! What really matters are the underground worlds that lie behind the red curtains, the mysterious rooms and characters. But what do these characters want? What do they need? What do they mean/represent? For me it all can be described in just three words: Portrait of evil! Of course it's not related to a banal/common conception of evilness, but it is, for sure, the Lynch's conception of the perverse side of the Humanity; it is his own symbolism to represent the wicked side of the Human mind. And Inland Empire is full of these icons/symbols. It's one of the most bizarre and complex movies done to date by David Lynch. Possibly just EREASERHEAD can be so abstract and strange like this one. It's almost 3 hours to a non-stop journey into bizarre cinematography. But it's beautiful, either aesthetically or conceptually.Into the technical plan, there's the novelty of the DV camera, which was pretty interesting and gave a different "touch" to the movie. It was a very nice experience too.About the acting we must mention the amazing performance of Laura Dern! I had read somewhere that without Laura Dern the movie wouldn't have been done, and now I understand what that person wanted to say! A great part of Inland Empire is actually the Laura Dern's performance! She's brilliant, not just because she is a great part of the movie herself, but also because she has a fantastic role and performance (brilliant mimic expressions, changes of personality, different tones of voices and expressions). Absolutely great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stepping across from Lynchian fantasy into madness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a tough film both for Lynch fans and for people new to his work. By that I don't mean it is confusing and difficult, but it is a hard film to watch. Usually Lynch films provide you with fantasy worlds that are both beautiful and frightening. The beautiful aspects give you something to cling onto as the darker aspects of the films unfold, they stop you from becoming frustrated (what is going on? this is pretentious garbage) until you are ready to fully embrace what the media seem to call "Lynch World". The difference between Inland Empire and previous Lynch films is that it creates a world of madness not fantasy and you are dropped into it rather than lowered into it. This is reflected in all aspects of the film; structure, style, script, music etc. The film is shot more like a Japanese horror flick rather than the Wizard of Oz, gone is the beautiful cinematography of Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway. Aside from flashes of red and blue the film contains no bold colours. The settings are Sunset Strip and Poland rather than upstate Washington, small-town America or Mulholland Drive (stark and bleak not beautiful). Equally the film is structured in short mixed up scenes, if you released a film with the scenes in the order that you shot them it would be something like this. Similarly the dialogue is almost spontaneous rather than crafted. As a result after 30 minutes I thought I was going to hate the film. Indeed the beginning despite Grace Zabriskie's mesmerising performance is incredibly frustrating. As far as I can tell the Bunny scenes serve no purpose and seem terribly self referential and the short sharp scenes make it hard to immerse yourself. My only advice to people is to stick with it. Once Laura Dern says "that sounded like something from our script" and we become aware that it is not only us who are finding the boundaries between film and reality merging the film takes off. I shan't labour you with my interpretation but needless to say the film leaves plenty of scope for interpretation, but also gives you enough closure not to leave you completely baffled. Critically the grittier subject matter of prostitution and homelessness that are interwoven with the wider theme of fantasy/madness mean that the critical scenes such as the Japanese girls speech, the Polish sections and the scenes with the man with the wonky glasses are that much more poignant and justify Lynch's new style. Equally it makes the moments of comedy in the film ("******* brutal murder", the black guy during the Japanese girl's speech and the musical sections) that beautiful mixture of tragedy and humour. I will be interested to see what people who aren't familiar with Lynch's work make of the film. Certainly seeing it the context of his other films gives it a heightened significance, particularly coming after Mulholland Drive. But it is difficult for me to comment on how it stands on its own as a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Avant-Garde Masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No director works closer to his mind, his thoughts, and his feelings than David Lynch, an unimaginable (and even hated) director which has been the creator of more than one work of art. In "INLAND EMPIRE", Lynch shows us his real auteurism and his real wit through a collection of brainwashing shots that literally wanted to make me look away. Think of "INLAND EMPIRE" as a treasure; a self-devouring and intensely reflexive work of art. It is art, and it is very hard to describe with words about Lynches' films, especially "INLAND EMPIRE".The main actress in this dark experimental film is the beautiful Laura Dern, who plays Nikki Grace. Soon after entertaining a foreign-accented visitor that calls herself a 'neighbor', Nikki, who looks to be in her mid-30s, is rehearsing for a new film called "On High in Blue Tomorrows" with a director, Kingsley Stewart (Jeremy Irons, expertly blending style with ego), and her co-star, Devon Berk (Justin Theroux with weird hair). This film-within-film creation is part of the fun and inscrutability. Lynch later develops confidence with the viewer, only for it to be shattered with confusion and more and more confusion. In one scene, Nikki, in what seems to be one of her dreams, is trapped in a pink house filled with prostitutes that zoom in and out of the camera, followed by yells and confusions of Nikki. Later you see them in Poland, with a snowy back round, Nikki quietly observing them. Part of the film is a horror film, which again comes back to the film-with-in-film process. There are some scenes where Nikki yells frantically, and there are yet some scenes where it is comedy, and you see Nikki smiling with her mouth half open, revealing her shining but crooked teeth.More viewings will, no doubt, suss out new riches, possibly even clear up or muddle what has already been revealed. But what results, even at first viewing,is a haunting, selfish masterpiece that literalizes the theory of surrealism and troubles to a sit-down, don't-get-up state. "INLAND EMPIRE" is a treasurable avant-garde masterwork.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.The new David Lynch film will not win him any new admirers and will likely alienate many longtime fans, but those willing to give themselves over to this frightening journey into the subconscious of a damaged woman will be awed, frightened, and deeply rewarded. As theme parks create films and rides that try to help you physically experience a film--you're flying with ET, you're riding in Doc Brown's Delorean--Lynch has created a film that helps you to experience a complete psychological break. Or maybe it is just a long, horrible dream. Either way, it's a journey into a very damaged psyche that is both thrilling and haunting.The film eschews logic pretty quickly and the only way to enjoy it is to let go. Let the film wash over you and get caught up in its weird rhythms, frightening imagery, great performances, and fantastic music. Some of you will hate this film with a passion, but others will be awed. Don't call this film pretentious. Lynch isn't trying to impress anyone--does he really need any more artistic cred?--and isn't trying too hard. He's simply laying his unique and uncompromised vision on film.There are shades of narrative coherence, but this is employed in order to confuse and disorient you even more. Just when you're saying "I think I've got it," Lynch rips the rug out from under you and demands that you sink further into the confusion.The movie is a bracing experience that must be seen to be believed. Go in with the right attitude and this movie will reward you greatly. And scare the hell out of you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch is back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One mans vision is another mans nightmare and here David Lynch returns with his latest three hour mind f*ck. Part 'Eraserhead', part furthering the themes touched on in 'Mullholand Dr' this is a film that you don't go to see on a whim it certainly wont win over many new fans, but if you are a lynch lover then prepare to step into the nightmarish world of 'INLAND EMPIRE'. The majority of the film is centred around an amazing performance by star and co-producer Laura Dern as Lynch's woman in trouble as it states on the poster, she flips between dreams, reality and nightmares as easily as someone switching on and off a light switch and as she unravels so too does the film to become more disjointed and bizarrely tense. The most interesting thing here is that the whole movie is filmed on digital, this has its advantages, the effects, freedom and fluidity and it has disadvantages, looks cheap and grainy at times. But these factors put in the hands of lynch do not matter he is like a film studies student with a big budget and even bigger ideas and it shows. Writing the night before each scene was shot the actors can be a little more real as they never knew what they would be doing from day to day and the action jumps from Hollywood to Poland to giant rabbits to dancing hookers and more. With strange rooms and imposing corridors the settings are also a major player as is the diverse collection of music which ranges from eerie to Beck and the locomotion to Lynch singing one himself. By no means an easy watch, think an amalgamation of 'Lost Highway', 'Mullholland Dr' and any Aphex Twin video and you're not even close and with the nightmare lasting so long it becomes a very intense experience. Weird and wonderful not so much 'Alice in wonderland' more David and Laura in horrible hollywoodland. If you think you can handle it go deep into the vision of a man who has clearly carved his own style into the art of film-making, there is no-one quite like Lynch and no film quite like 'INLAND EMPIRE'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unexpected explosion in the unconscious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the second Lynch's movie i've seen after Muholland Dr. In the stages of Hollywood all is possible as in the men's mind, going in future is equal to go in the past, live one life is like live another life. Turning around in a viciuos circle, to live and to die, feeling real knowing that all is a great lie (the lie of the actor, the lie of the mind). All this is inside this indescribable movie, this and more. I agree that Inland Empire isn't only a movie, is an experience trough Lynch's mind and the spectator's mind, not linear unextabilished trip in the folds of the synapses oniric mind. All the logically associations explodes in theirselves, all the location confusing, all the women fight her different conflicts in different ways, and all the logical thought implodes in a whisphers or in an unsaid or more improbably word (like the words that seem without a sense that speakin' the rabbits in the TV). Definitely i can say that this movie is beautiful as i can say is awful but i can't resolve this question if i solve this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty on video still impossible...?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw Inland Empire last night, and as I suspected it didn't exceed my expectations, nor did it fall short of them. It dodged them completely. Whatever you've read, heard, forget it. Just go and see it.Lynch was talking on French radio about how he began with a Sony PD-150 and actually shot on low-res before upgrading it in post. He then graded it and played with it a bit more before printing it to film for the version we get in cinemas. It's hardly the death of film but it does give some images, particularly those in warm lighting conditions, an uncharacteristic depth. It doesn't resolve the inconsistency of video in the slightest though, and we do end up either marvelling at the quality of some images or lamenting the "videoness" of others.What's interesting is that his framing has changed drastically. Lynch probes his actors now, capturing their disorientation, and confusion, with harsh closeups and wobbly pans. He's clearly having fun being away from the rigour of a 35mm rig, and in many scenes dispenses with the tripod altogether and just sort of observes the action. This compounds the suspense and uncertainty at the film's core, carefully inviting us to make assumptions and hazard guesses, but never letting us past the perspective of curious outsider.I'm still utterly ambivalent about this video business. I wonder if Inland Empire would've worked on 35 though, if it would have illicited the same discomfort, been as challenging, as ambitious?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst Films I have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie. I loved David Lynch's over-the-top Twin Peaks. I relished Grace Zabriskie and Harry Dean Stanton in Big Love. I would go to see any movie with Jeremy Irons in it. I was looking forward to just glimpsing Nastassja Kinski and Mary Steenburgen again.But this movie was beyond awful. It is amateurish and indulgent. It is David Lynch giving his audiences the finger. It is mostly under or overexposed. The sound track was so muddy I could barely understand the dialogue. There are constant super closeups to make people look hideous and let you study their nasal cavities. The camera is jigglier than my mother's super 8 movies. It just gave me a headache.Salavador Dali said that he created his surrealistic art by removing anything that made any sense. He ended up with strange images like two dead donkeys in a piano. Lynch did the same thing. Nothing makes any sense. But what is left is ugly and boring, endless shots of people driving, sitting on a chair, or just the interior of some down at the heels home as though it had some deep cosmic significance. One recurring theme is people in rabbit costumes watching TV for what feels like hours. Another is a group of repulsive prostitutes who try to gross you out with their trashiness. But nothing ever happens. It is just random bits of footage glued together.There is a lot of screaming, loud noises and flashing lights that signify nothing.The patrician heroine strangely develops an accent similar to George W. Bush's. Why? Your guess is as good as mine. Show off her acting versatility?At first, at least there is the theme that people are making a boring film that is hard to tell apart from boring reality, but that degenerates into complete randomness. A movie must at least be interesting. This one most definitely is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch takes the art of film making to a whole new level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I watched INLAND EMPIRE, there would be times during the nearly 3-hour running time that I would have to get up to go pee or grab a beer or something. So I would stop the film ... and find myself unwilling to move. Instead I would gaze up at the mysterious TV lamp casting its glow on the wall, the ominous folding doors concealing the den next to the living room ... and suddenly my comfortable home environment felt vaguely threatening.Last night I began watching INLAND EMPIRE again, getting about halfway through the film before it was time to go to bed. Having plunged through it once already, I found myself free to simply watch rather than analyze, to simply listen to the exquisitely written dialogue rather than trying to puzzle out every nuance. And I found the film moving along a lot more quickly than the first time around.And make no mistake: INLAND EMPIRE is a lot to digest. I'm still working on it. But after two days and some additional viewing, I find myself appreciating the film much, MUCH more. The first time I watched it, I thought to myself, "There is a story here, but it is told in extremely unconventional terms." And now I think there are several stories here that exist in a kind of orbital resonance and sharing themes of loss, guilt, and regret.Oddly enough, spinning like a neutron star (or perhaps an old acetate record) at the core of this film is a Polish gypsy folk tale cum movie script so cursed that it has the ability to suck its actors and characters into other realities and identities, shuffling them around mercilessly, and in the process causing us, as members of the audience, to question our own grip on what is real and what is fiction.There is the story of Nikki Grace, a veteran Hollywood actress with a chance to reclaim the limelight with the role of a lifetime. She ultimately falls victim to the aforementioned curse, losing both her identify and her marital fidelity. But how real is Nikki herself? She might in fact be nothing more than a DREAM of stardom, a fantasy concocted by a doomed Hollywood prostitute. In this regard INLAND EMPIRE shares some of the themes previously explored in David Lynch's previous film, "Mulholland Drive."(Bill Macy, in a VERY brief appearance as a television announcer, utters what could possibly be the most telling line in the film, saying that Hollywood is "where DREAMS become STARS, and STARS become DREAMS!")There are other stories at work here: The prostitution ring in Hollywood may parallel a similar racket in Poland. We are teased with scenes from a Polish film that ultimately went uncompleted, the same film being remade with Nikki Grace (played brilliantly by Laura Dern) and Devon Burke (Justin Theroux). There are cryptic references throughout the film to something called "axonn.n" ... which, according to the first spoken words in INLAND EMPIRE, is the longest radio play in history. And then there are the rabbits (Trapped? Caged?) used as the films most surreal device.But to hell with all that. Ultimately what's really most important about INLAND EMPIRE is the art of filmmaking. Cinema is most often used to tell stories in the simplest, most conventional terms, just as oil paint on canvas is most often used to portray people, landscapes, and bowls of fruit. But both painting and cinema can be used in far more adventurous and experimental ways, even if such efforts are not commercially viable. I doubt that Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel made "Un Chien Andalou" in hopes that it would be a big box office smash; they were more interested in expanding the artistic potential of film, and if they challenged and confounded the viewer in the process, so much the better. And throughout the history of filmmaking there have been a great many other directors that have pushed the envelope of the medium in their own ways, whether through storytelling or visual imagery.With INLAND EMPIRE, I think David Lynch has gone back to his roots, forsaking the interference of big studio executives and marketing his film on his terms. As everyone knows by know, he is notoriously reticent to discuss the film's "meaning." But if all he really wanted to do was blur the distinction between fantasy and reality, and in the process make his viewers become just a little unhinged ... well, I think he succeeded in spades. Few films that I can think of have crept into my mind so tenaciously. And when some reviewers dismiss INLAND EMPIRE as pretentious nonsense, all I can think of is the old curmudgeon who looks at a Jackson Pollock painting and sneers, "My four-year-old granddaughter could do better than that!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen all David Lynch's film. I've only seen Mullholland drive and Lost Highway and I've found them to be pretty good. It happened to me that when I decided to start watching them without trying to understand what was happening I started to enjoy them. they have really interesting uses of the cinematographic language and a great development on suspense and intrigue. So when i got to watch Inland Empire i thought: OK, this time I won't understand it either, so let's enjoy the wild ride into the dark worlds of Lynch.Sadly it wasn't that way. Basically, knowing that I wouldn't understand any of the plot I was just expecting this film to entertain me like those previous two did. But it just didn't work for me. I found some interesting things like how Lynch makes some kind of circular situations where some elements previously presented come again in scene much later to remind you that you are seeing is other part of the things you already saw. Sadly this time didn't work for two reason: the first one was because I've already seen that in his previous movies and this time it didn't surprise me; and the second one is that in this movie I really didn't find a meaning or reason for those "cicles". Basically I was again seeing the same element in a new scene but with no meaning for me, like: "remember that house you've seen before? well, here is again in another point of view". But it means nothing to me. Maybe I just never got what was going on or where was the movie going to.Like I said I just expected this movie to entertain me or thrill me or make me wonder about that dark world presented by Lynch. But it just bored me. I could resume most of the movie as: Crazy characters speaking nonsense all the time and the lead actress watching them like "WTF is he talking about?". Really, she is most of the time with a expression of confusion in her face.Aniway, this movie is ONLY FOR HARDCORE LYNCH FANS which I'm sure will find it more attractive than I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Disjointed Mystery Of Actress Becoming Trapped Inside A Cursed Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nikki Grace is an actress who has just landed the lead in a film called On High In Blue Tomorrows. However, it is based on an old Polish folk tale which is reputed to be cursed and a previous movie version was never completed because of some tragedy. As Nikki immerses herself in the role, reality starts to warp. Is she losing her mind ?I like all movies from the strange country of David Lynch, but this one is not as enjoyable as most for me for two reasons. Firstly, it's shot in "low grade bad digital video" (Lynch's description) which I don't like - it looks cheap, the closeups cut off the top of people's heads, the lighting is garish - give me good old 35mm Panavision celluloid any day. Also, it's three hours of disjointed ideas, unappealing characters and pretentious scenes, a fair proportion of which are in Polish with no subtitles. There is some humour, and as ever lots of fascinating ideas - Dern (who co-produced) does a great job of someone who is playing somebody else who gets trapped in a fictitious world linked to another fictitious world (I think). But some of Lynch's visual ideas are recycled (the crumbling buildings from Eraserhead, the red curtain from Twin Peaks, the dancing girls from Lost Highway) and some are not all that original; the scene where a bewildered Dern walks into a cinema and see herself on-screen is almost identical to one at the end of In The Mouth Of Madness. He can't be faulted for his commitment though; in addition to writing and directing, he also shot and edited the movie, was the sound designer, and even sings one of the agreeably strange songs on the soundtrack. Shot in Hollywood and the central Polish city of Lodz; the title refers to the Californian metropolitan area of Riverside and San Bernadino counties, east of Los Angeles. Trivia - horror fans should note the scary discordant music playing while Dern is bleeding to death on Hollywood &amp; Vine is De Natura Sonoris by Polish composer Krzysztof Pendericki, which is also used extensively in The Shining. This movie, like most of Lynch's, is kind of beyond criticism, but I watch films for fun, not to be fashionable or impress people with my cultural pedigree, and this isn't much fun. Check out his other work instead. I like the rabbits though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kaleidoscopic cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lynch's latest exploration of the dreams and nightmares of Hollywood focuses on the actress, Nicky Grace, (superbly played by Laura Dern) who has just got a role in the remake of an Eastern European film based on a Polish folk tale. At a read through of the script the director reveals that the original production was believed to be cursed and that the lead was murdered during production.Nicky Grace becomes increasingly distressed by the ill omens that surround the production; then, in a disorientating moment of cinema, she says to her co-star, "Something's happened" and the film collapses in on itself leaving her to inhabit different times, films and characters as she stumbles through INLAND EMPIRE trying to make sense of her reality. Films and reality merge and entwine; and just as a coherent thread arrives it collapses back in on itself as if the viewer is watching a pattern on a kaleidoscope - unable to capture the ever changing narrative.INLAND EMPIRE feels like a summation of many of Lynch's themes and echoes of his previous works can be found scattered throughout Nicky Grace's nightmarish journey. This is a film about films within a film - a fractured nightmare where the protagonist wakes to find herself in another celluloid nightmare. It delights, teases and frustrates and could not be described as an easy 3 hours viewing. It is, however, a stunning, claustrophobic and brilliant film that is unlikely to win Lynch any new converts but will surely satisfy his many fans</fullReview>

I've hated just about everything that pop culture has had to spew out at me since somewhere in the early-to-mid '90's, and this thing is the first thing that's absolutely blown my mind in a serious chunk of decades.I bow down in absolute awe that is the perfection of this creation by David Lynch. This is truly the work of the real deal, an absolute ROCK STAR with a ROCK STAR production crew. No cheese here at all.If you've been waiting for unencumbered Lynch at his absolute best since Wild at Heart and Blue Velvet, this is so far beyond what you've been waiting for.. don't want to oversell it.See it cold, expect it to suck, plan on 3 hours without moving from your seat, and strap yourself in.This movie took 3 hours of my life, made it feel like at least five hours, and made me LIKE it.Wow. DAVE! THANK YOU, DAVE! YOU ARE TRULY ONE OF THE GREATS, THE REAL DEAL, never questioned it, but this one truly hit a whole new high mark. Thank you. I feel like I just had really, really great sex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't been this lost in the storyline of a film since David Cronenberg's eXistenZ and I love it! It's almost as if the two David's had come together for Inland Empire. I'm not a die-hard fan of neither Cronenberg nor Lynch but I found this movie to be quite enjoyable. Unlike Cronenberg's eXistenZ, which took me a good few days to shake, Lynch somehow balances his work... Beautiful imagery, humor perhaps? Inland Empire, although the darkest Lynch film I've seen, is no exception. It's apples and oranges as far as the two movies compared here go, but it's the same mind-bending trip... a true interactive experience.Anyone who can combine Comedy, Drama, Suspense / Thriller and Horror in a single go is okay in my book. Lynch wins again! I give it a 10 for not underestimating the audience and force-feeding the storyline. It's no Mulholland Drive or Twin Peaks but it's Lynch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An audiovisual tour-de-force. A most mystical work of art...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch has so far proved that he can direct various genres ranging from TV. series to incoherent experimental art-cinema. He seems to have concluded that the latter suits him best, and so do we. If you have not watched any auteur Lynch films before, I would not recommend INLAND EMPIRE before you become better acquainted with his other work. For those who wish to give it a try, the hint is, do not trouble yourself if you don't understand anything. INLAND EMPIRE is one of Lynch's best films. Shot throughout with an amateur digital camera, he once more captures all the mystery and perversion that human beings communicate through his close-ups, lighting and music. The film's peak is its capability to force the audience to think and try to make meaning out of where there is none. The mystification of the most trivial objects and the artistic mise-en-scene compose images of a most inspiring piece of art and the extreme surreal he blends more than ever in INLAND EMPIRE all work to produce a chaotic whole with a peculiar, awkwardly mysterious beauty. The performances in INLAND EMPIRE, especially Laura Dern's are simply disarming. Grace Zabriskie's small part will drive anyone mad (she is the classic Lynchean mysterious figure who visits, talks and vanishes) through its unrealistic plausibility and its mystifying weirdness. In a nutshell, INLAND EMPIRE is yet another Lynchean masterpiece that certainly needs more than one viewing and that is, not for one to understand it, but to simply appreciate its value and unveil all its beauty and mystique. Lynch is certainly one of the most talented and artful contemporary directors and INLAND EMPIRE is one of his greatest works...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch's The Tempest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie reminded me strongly of Shakespeare's The Tempest, which I am going to see in London's West End this coming week (starring Patrick Stewart as Prospero), so that is probably one reason why. The Tempest is a romance or tragicomic fantasy set on an island ruled by a magician who used to be a duke. Its scenes are disjointed and the plot barely comprehensible, featuring the sorcerer-intellectual-ruler, a spirit he owns, an enslaved man-beast, young lovers and a bunch of shipwrecked politicians up to no good. It was Shakespeare's last play and it took a few centuries for its merits to be appreciated, but some would now say it is his best, being perhaps a satire of colonial empire. The play is Shakespeare-Prospero's ruminations on the art of fiction, showing the mechanics of theater as directing, story-telling, acting, the vanished line between imagination and reality. The web he weaves catches us all in its threads, players and audience alike.Inland Empire is Lynch's Tempest. He is freed by a mobile digital camera and an improvised shooting script to tell his story as he likes in the medium he has mastered. He may make many more films, but I would bet that this is his masterpiece. He draws us into a primal scenario of marriage and sex, violence and death with a series of Chinese boxes leading into the timeless heart of human fear and suspense. Laura Dern provides the connecting thread as the story takes her and us through all the layers of contemporary society from the super-rich to the homeless via people living in hotel rooms, a sitcom starring rabbits in human dress, a Polish TV melodrama, a Gypsy circus, working girls who lounge, dance and sing and much much else. Part of her achievement is in playing the wide range of classes assumed by her character, each one with a different look and way of speaking. The plot starts out complicated, about an actress getting a film part and being drawn by degrees into into a macabre logic of sex and death, where linear time is erased and reality is the next shot in the movie.The technique of this film -- the light, the movement, the music, the multitude of references, the symbolism, everything -- is peerless. The final murder scene in Psycho (on the stairs) is echoed again and again. Doors open into corridors into more doors and still rooms. It is true that Dern carries the movie with a performance that must surely get her the next Oscar. But the star is STORY whose dark heart has never been explored so deeply, except perhaps by Shakespeare in The Tempest.I know that Dern gave Lynch the title from an LA district, but I want to believe that it refers to the exotic empire conjured up by Shakespeare, now ruled by Hollywood at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will violate you . . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this at the Palm Springs International Film Festival and was astounded. It has a creepiness about it that I have been searching for in a movie for a long time. There are so many themes and reoccurring narratives that make you want to believe they are related, but somehow you know there is something you are missing. This film is disorienting and will overwhelm your senses. It will intrude upon every concept you have of comfort. Laura Dern is amazing and really deserves any and all acclaim she receives. The sets and cinematography are haunting. This movie is not for everyone and the 3 hour length means that you should watch it after a good nights sleep. However, it is in remarkable to say the least. I love this film and it does much to reinvigorate one's faith in creativity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A meaningless delve into the mind of Lynch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this motion picture unfamiliar with the bulk of Lynch's work, having only seen Eraserhead prior to this. As a result, I had little expectations about this flick. It was a short plot summary that compelled me to watch this; it enthralled me with hints of a thrilling and mysterious storyline - the life of an actress becoming blurred with the fictional life of the character she is to play in her latest film role.The first scene that captured my attention was the sitcom in which a family of rabbit people, behaving as humans, discuss a secret. For this, I give Lynch credit - the scene is eerie and uncomfortable, but as for any meaning the scene has, I was left clueless. Another particularly disturbing scene is when we are first introduced to Grace Zabriskie's character, an apparently mentally detached woman who visits the home of the main character of this film, Nikki Grace (Laura Dern). Zabriskie gives a stellar performance, and leaves both Nikki and the viewer confused and affronted.At this point, I was eager to see more. But after the line rehearsal scene, it all goes downhill.A sequence of disconcerting and sporadic scenes follow, leaving no room for the viewer to grasp any sense of the plot. We see a man with a light bulb in his mouth, a woman confessing her intentions to use a screwdriver to murder someone, and a man who suffers from a metamorphosing face. The entire film is dragged out beyond belief, with minutes of screen time wasted on gloomy, useless shots that could have been used to much greater effect.I eventually realised at one point that my only incentive to continue viewing was to see more of the eerie rabbit sitcom, which thankfully reappeared a number of times in the remainder of the movie, and so my time was not entirely wasted. However, a film cannot rely on one particular recurring scene to keep viewers interested.In short, this was extremely disappointing. An interesting premise is dragged down by shoddy camera work, an overly confusing plot and a run time that greatly exceeds what it should have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cocteau on acid?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I would like to say that without a doubt this is Lynch's worst film effort to date. Having received at best lukewarm reviews in most of the film publications I'd read, I went to see it with a slight sense of trepidation but an open mind - which I guess is the only way you can see a Lynch film, unless you're a die-hard fan. The trepidation was not only justified but actually shocked at this blurred and obfuscating mosaic of incoherence.Ostensibly a follow-up to 2001's Mulholland Dr., this film evidently has a similar premise in mind as we meet Laura Dern's Nikki who lands the lead role in an exciting new film. However, this thematic construct ("plot" is NOT the right word) is not as pronounced as in Lynch's earlier effort as it is hidden among sequence after sequence of pointlessly minor-key music saturating long, long shots of lampshades with a ridiculous air of foreboding, and a whole bunch of confused and frankly pointless diversions.What made Mulholland Dr. interesting was that it consisted of a first half that almost made sense, and a second half that then went about mystifying everything we'd seen up to that point, but because the essential players remained mostly consistent and their reactions and mentality changed inexplicably, it at least gave the viewer a sense that this tangled mystery could be solved. What's more, it had wonderful colour, style, and a beautifully satirical sense of Hollywood even as it subverted the very myth of Hollywood.In Inland Empire, delightful eccentricity plummets into sheer infant-like dementia. The grainy texture and hand-held camera work which can stand up so well in the hands of Mexican filmmakers here lends the whole film an amateurish air, but that's mainly because the film itself is so badly constructed. The over-enthusiastic use of Dutch camera angles, unusual lighting effects and shrill screaming violins makes it look like something that a first-year Cocteau-wannabe film studies student might put together the night before an assignment is due - while on an acid trip. What I'm trying to say here is that what Lynch managed with subtlety, humour and precocious genius in Mulholland Dr. goes much further in this film, and extends far beyond the pretentious lunatic fringe.I personally don't believe this film, like other confronting and obscure pieces, is love-it-or-hate-it. Your options are to hate it, or not get a single second of it but don't mind. It's interesting that it took 2000 years for the literary world to flush Aristotelian notions of plot construction down the toilet and Lynch has achieved the same thing some 100 years after the advent of film.However, I don't mean to suggest that this is some post-modern masterpiece. It isn't. In fact I think many critics in writing about this film have been extremely generous, understating its sheer blind absurdity for one of two reasons - either they would like to forgive the director for wasting three hours of their life, or because they are so firmly convinced of Lynch's genius that behind this incomprehensible drivel must lie some prodigious meaning.But I for one am firmly convinced that there isn't, and that Lynch's undeniable genius has here bypassed any semblance of reason, and the "touch of madness" which to some extent may constitute genius has ballooned into excess. Furthermore, I believe that if Lynch's name were not attached to this movie, it would not find a release in any market. What makes this ironic is that if Lynch were locked up in a mental asylum, he himself would never be released.That's all this is: the unleashing of a twisted mind on an unsuspecting public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cinema's Hyperspace</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire is a revolutionary film in the history of cinema; it is cinema's cubism and surrealism. It is the vague line between the reality and fiction. It is when you look at yourself in the mirror and say: which one of us is the real one? This film blew my mind away. It is Mulholland Drive extended to be an Empire; extended in space and time. Forget about the plot, look at the concept and you will see something amazing. You see Picasso's "Portrait of Dora Marr", and Dali's "Christus Hypercubus" brought to life in a movie. You see Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) lost in the hypercube, moving from one internal cube to another to find herself more surprises. You see "the story of a woman in trouble" as stated by David Lynch himself.For whom that cannot make sense of this film, just remember the beginning when a Polish sounding woman which has no memory of her surrounding gets abused by a person who claimed she was a whore, and later a Polish lady comes in Nikki Grace's house to announce herself as a new neighbour and somehow it seems that everything happens in her imagination by linking a Polish folklore to Nikki's rule as Susan in her new movie. Everything is a dream, No Hay Banda, it is all on the tape, and it is all illusion. Don't you get it! The message was in Lynch's previous film; Mulholland Drive. Perhaps the Polish woman switched the plot of the last film in the remake.I simply loved this film and the three hours flew by so fast that when the credits came on, I could not believe it was over. But something was certain, the lost girl united with her image.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all..INLAND EMPIRE is not a movie..or if it is, it's the best ever made. This is not to make a classification, but INLAND EMPIRE is the only movie in history that put you into and hit your emotions in this way..(at least in my case). David Lynch is one of the directors that I prefer, because of a lot of things, like his dreamlike style, his atmospheres..the use of sound, and music..the fear caused by mystery and absurdity that he creates..BUT the best thing in Lynch's movies is that there is a story ,of course, but it's not the lead part of them..feelings are the lead part of them, the emotions and the way we feel pain or happiness from his characters.. INLAND EMPIRE is a journey, and Laura Dern our vehicle, I also cannot call her Nikki, or Sue...or both...she's a woman (in trouble, of course) and she's lost in a nightmare..this is the plot, if is necessary to talk about a plot..Leaving feelings for a moment and talking about the technical aspect of the film I can only say: SIMPLY AMAZING. The use of sounds, the music, and ,of course, the directing are great, and in a really experimental way.. I enjoyed the use of DV, and his amazing camera-movements with the wide-angle. I have to say that the directing is really different from other Lynch's movies...maybe it's different from every movie made before. In the furniture of some places, in the dialogs, and of course in red curtains, but in a lot of other things we find Lynch as we know him, but I have to say that this is a change in his career, an evolution started with the masterpiece Mulholland Dr.The interpretation of Laura Dern is unbelievable, and the rest of the cast perfect..(oh my god, Grace Zabriskie...)..I could start discussing about the meaning of cinema, about the meaning of art..and a lot of intellectual theories...or talk about an interpretation of the movie..but it's useless, the only thing that I say is: run, and don't miss this masterpiece!</fullReview>

I managed to last 38 minutes before turning it off, and that is saying something because I normally try to hold out and attempt to finish movies, even the crap ones. The acting from some of the actors was nothing short of woeful, the script (was there a script?) a shambles and it seemed to be leading nowhere. I gave it one star for the only reason that you can't go into negative figures on IMDb, otherwise I would have given it -10. I will post one positive comment however, at least Laura Dern is looking good for her age.

		<fullReview>I don't care how great David Lynch is supposed to be, if the only way you can make a movie mysterious, suffocating, troublesome, etc. is by filming most of it in the dark -- it is not a good movie. And, as I experienced with the last season of Twin Peaks, I couldn't kick the feeling that some scenes (humanoid rabbits) were there just because Lynch enjoys being strange.I'm all for experiencing, rather than watching a movie, but I don't like weirdness for the sake of weirdness -- I feel like I'm being manipulated. Maybe that is me not suspending disbelief, but, watching this, I got too fed up to suspend. I'm not new to David Lynch, and I LOVED Mulholland Dr. - THAT was clever. Part gritty story about jealousy and murder, part mystical (the contract killer who could be the devil), and part meta-physical (was she ever in her aunt's apartment at any time?)But Inland Empire felt like 2+ wasted hours I'll never see again; luckily I was sick at the time and so couldn't really have done much else with that time anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For Lynch fans only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch has made many controversial and provocative films over the years and Inland Empire is no exception. Twin Peaks, Mullholand drive and last highway are some of the more well known and successful efforts. Inland Empire is his latest work and while the above worked both on a commercial and artistic level for me this falls way short of the mark. Indeed the keen Lynch follower will spot many references to his past works within many of the exchanges between the characters. Film making is an artistic expression of a directors vision and with this in mind a film can take any structure or form. In order words it doesn't necessarily have to follow a linear plot with a neatly wrapped up conclusion that fits perfectly into a pre-determined running time. For this reason i admire it. It wasn't made to appeal to focus groups or movie buffs. Its Lynches film through and through and as such he made it exactly the way he intended. Unfortunately this is also the problem. Know one really knows what the film is about and in parts you really begin to think that if even Lynch himself knew what he was trying to do. Like Mulholland and Lost Highway the first half follows a somewhat linear plot outline while the second half transforms into a kind of dream like structure with characters switching identity/reality leaving the viewer to interpret the meaning, if any, for him/herself. This is a pleasure to see unfold in Mulholland drive and takes the film to a new level of enjoyment. The problem with Inland Empire is this familiar Lynch shift in the latter half is more of a haphazard mess of narrative and imagery and is taken as far as to make it almost unwatcable. Its almost as if Lynch is going out of his way to confuse and annoy the viewer. Every scene is drawn out and shot in monochrome with extended still shots of seemingly meaningless imagery. This combined with the minimalist setting really tests the viewers patience. Most of the cast of Mulholland Drive return with the exception of Laura Dern who is given most of the screen time. Justin Therioux has some memorable scenes and Jeremy Irons pretty much playes himself most of the time and there's a very amusing cameo by Harry Dean Stanton which i wont give away. The score is also excellent (written by Lynch himself) but unfortunately is not enough to save it from the tedium of the second half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Isn't it Strange What Love Does?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Isn't it strange what love does? There is simply no point looking for meaning and symbolism in a David Lynch movie - its simply not there. The images presented are not meant to be interpreted, they're meant to provoke a reaction in the viewer, an emotion. With David the emotion is almost always horror and fear. I can think of no other director who is better at it, or, for that matter, any director who has even attempted it the way he does.Take, for instance, the first line of this review. It means nothing and makes relatively no sense in relation to the rest of the review. But even knowing this now a small part of your subconscious considers me "clever" for putting this line in which is also the line from the song used in the trailer (and movie). You have to force yourself and your brain to acknowledge you were wrong in the first place and I am actually a stupid putz.Now feel free to expose me for who I am for that ridiculous line, but do NOT - not, I say! - do this in a Lynch movie. For those of you that have not been to his world before, here's some advice. In watching them, you are standing at the Event Horizon. Do not resist it. Simply allow yourself to be pulled in. Stop trying to make sense of it all - isn't that what ruined 2001: A Space Odessey for you? Stop trying to form your own reactions and emotions. Allow the film to take control, to choose which reactions and emotions will be pulled from you.Be warned: this is a looooonnng movie. Think the longest movie you've ever seen and multiply it by 2. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some."Mainstream" audiences don't know how to react to a movie like this: most humans like to be in control of their own senses (so yes, this is, in a way, a movie for stoners). They resist the tug. And I have advice: Don't be afraid. You don't have to run away from the black hole. Because, eventually, after this very long time, it will spit you out again, and, to give thanks for your attention, it allows you to taste your world again, and you can look upon those petrified three hours of your life and laugh. Because, after all, our world isn't anything like David's. Is it? Now I haven't seen all of David Lynch (in fact, I really need to catch up) but this is probably his Lynchiest movie to date. Think the Lynchiest moment of the Lynchiest movie he made, and extend it over a three hour 15 minute period. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some. I mean, every half an hour we are treated to what should be funny but is strangely disturbing: a room of humanoid rabbits who say things that do not correlate to the last and next spoken sentences, and a laugh track to boot.The synopsis, if you can call it that - the movie only remains "plot driven" for the first 45 minutes or so: After a number of false beginnings, we meet an actress, Nikki (Laura Dern, Lynch favorite finally given "her role") who appears to have just moved in: a bizarre lady (Grace Zabiriskie, another Lynch favorite) invites herself in to "greet the new neighbors." She says strange things that seem...relevant. In about an hour or two hours or so. In fact, everything in the second half of the movie you think you've seen this somewhere before in the first half. The film is oiled with a sense of Deja Vu.Nikki just gets a role in a movie directed by "Kingsley" (Jeremy Irons), costarring "Devon," (Justin Theroux, another Lynch favorite) a notorious bad boy from the tabloids. Nikki is married to someone very important who suspects her of everything and is extremely threatening to his wife and Devon.Kingsley, during a script reading, tells his actors the movie had been attempted to have been made years before, but it was not finished because the lead stars were murdered in ways uncannily similar to Nikki and Devon's life.Nikki eventually gives in to Devon's advances and what follows is The Lynch. That is where the plot ends. Nikki meets all the past women of Devon's life in a closet, "8 1/2" style, who show her Laura Dern playing different women who are all in trouble in similar circumstances, but is a completely different women each time. Instead of allowing the sequences to flow together Lynch gives us a *jolt* each time until we're begging for mercy.I've never seen a film that is able to so vividly recreate what it's like to dream. Wes Craven came close with some details from the first and last of the "Nightmare on Elm Street Series"...but not really close to this. This is, basically, after the plot leaves us behind, a very, very long nightmare. Inland Empire is one of the scariest films I have ever seen.And yea, Laura Dern is good. This is one of the greatest performances of the past few decades. She's incredible. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some. And then some.There's nothing to be afraid of, children. Because, eventually, the movie ends, and you can walk out of the theater. I would never see this movie again, but I'm glad I've seen it once, and it's highly recommended. We are allowed to taste our own world again, and it's a relief and escape because our world isn't anything like David's.Right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Exhausting Trip Into the Mind of David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A David Lynch film is a tightrope act of sorts. They're all a little abstract, a little bit mystical, but remaining (usually) is a looming mystery that is never solved; the viewer must be ready to interpret the abstruse puzzle presented to them. In a great Lynch film, Mulholland Dr. for example, a profound characterization can act as a backbone to the many head spinning detours that dawdle in the celluloid. Without one, though, a Lynch film can become intolerable, masturbatory rather than dazzling, a series of puzzle pieces that don't fit anywhere besides his own mind. He is perhaps the definitive hit-or-miss filmmaker ? when he hits, his baffling ideas are seductive, lingering in our memory like our very first run-in with Rita Hayworth's Gilda; but when he misses, we're presented with a nightmarish landscape that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, doesn't go anywhere, and doesn't have much in the way of meaning. (And a Lynch film is generally long, making insufferability even more insufferable as the images go on and on and on and on ?)Simply put, Inland Empire is one of David Lynch's most unbearable movies. It's his first film shot completely digitally, done so with a Sony DCR- VX1000 camcorder; the images, in return, are fuzzy and textural. Some, especially Lynch, find this photographic technique to hold more value in terms of enigma and subversion, but I, possibly in the minority, think that this experiment is a downfall. His images are so outrightly peculiar (only he could sell the idea of three people in rabbit suits living in an apartment together in sitcom bliss) that the cheapness of the digital camera makes his once lush pictorial instincts read like an experimental student short. Before, the lavishness of film made diversions into the freakish more of a surprise; here, Lynchian punches no longer hold the shock the once did. This shouldn't suggest that his cinematic mastery is waning ? it's the fault of the camera, not his.Supposedly, Inland Empire is about Nikki Grace (Laura Dern), a has-been actress who has just received a part in a movie that could revitalize her once strong career. Her co-star is known womanizer Devon Berk (Justin Theroux), her director the respected Kingsley Stewart (Jeremy Irons). Minutes into the rehearsal process is it revealed that the project is thought to be cursed ? it was supposed to be made decades ago, but the actors tragically died during the filmmaking process. Following this revelation, strange things start to occur: Nikki and Devon begin to mimic the lives of the characters they're playing, Sue Blue and Billy Side, and Nikki, desperate as she is to succeed, begins experiencing situations that can only be described as hallucinatory.I say "supposedly" when providing the plot summary because Inland Empire revolves around this storyline for only the first act, possibly even less. It starts off intriguingly, with the same sort of luminous ambiguities of Lost Highway, until it descends into a labyrinth of entangled phantasms. For a while, the delusions are evocative (the audacious pairings with experimental music are especially fascinating), but at three hours, Inland Empire eventually keels over and turns into an unappetizing smörg?sbord of Lynchian rejects. As the story was never interesting enough to begin with, interpretation is left untouched; we're either frustrated or stimulated, mostly the former.The one thing to celebrate in Inland Empire is Laura Dern, in a fearless performance. Her character(s) is hardly defined, but Dern gives us a reason to gaze upon her face with utter enthrallment. She wanders around the maze Lynch places her in the middle of; Dern is so breathtaking that, once in a while, she deceives us into thinking that the material is solid rather than flimsy. More or less, Inland Empire is flimsy. Lynch wrote the script as filming went on (seriously), and nothing ever commences from it. He is a great director, but nothing is worse than taking an audience for granted, especially when that audience has to meander through a film for 180 minutes.

		<shortDescription>Still shaken</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could say that I'm something of a David Lynch virgin. I've seen and loved The Elephant Man, Wild at Heart and especially Mulholland Dr which has quickly become one of my favourite films of all time. From the films I've seen, you could definitely say that I like David Lynch and I've been eagerly awaiting watching more from him (I've recently bought the Twin Peaks box set which I'll be watching soon!) and when I saw Inland Empire on the TV I was very excited to give it a record and become immersed into his dark world. And immersed I was. If Mulholland Dr was a dream, then Inland Empire is a full on nightmare. I only saw it last night and I still do not know what to make of it, except that I am extremely interested in what it was all about and it actually made me feel scared. Inland Empire is one of those wonderful films that stop becoming films and end up as an experience, and I'm not entirely sure if I want to experience Inland Empire ever again.It had that lucid dream-like quality to it just like Mulholland Dr, maybe even more so. But it also made me feel as if I was turning insane (in a good way). If David Lynch aimed to get his audience in the same twisted mind-set as his protagonist then he succeeded. The film was a total mind funk from start to finish (think 1408 but good and ten gazillion times more trippy!). I have never been high before, but this is what I would imagine a 'bad trip' feels like. It was incredibly like a dream because in dreams you feel like your in them for ages, yet when you wake up you can only remember patches. Inland Empire is three hours and yet a lot of it is unclear in my head. It felt like it was on forever and not long at all, all at the same time. In this sense I loved Inland Empire, because it was such a trippy and unique experience.However, what Inland Empire lacked (unlike Mulholland Dr) was a sense of plot. Whilst Mulholland Dr by no means has a coherent and linear narrative, there was still a strong sense of a narrative and it was open to interpretation at a perfect level. Pretty much throughout the whole of Inland Empire I had no clue what was going on. As I sit writing this now, I have about 100 tabs up about the film and the interpretations it offers. I could see that the film had something to do with the relationship between films and their audience and I'm guessing that the Polish segments were when the cursed screenplay was originally being used. I also got most of the beginning with the film set and everything, but once things turn more nightmarish than you could ever imagine, I had no clue what was going on. Especially as it was out of order and unclear which parts were the film and which parts were the film within the film. I mean what were those rabbits all about!? Maybe it could've been stronger if David finished script before shooting.The look of the film was very early Lars Von Trier, as by common knowledge it was shot on a digital camera, which I think suited this film because it felt very raw and real. There are some very claustrophobic moments where the camera is right up to the actor's face and some moments where I felt very scared and vulnerable thanks to the suspenseful point of view shots. I also loved the music which added to the unusual edge, some of it was reminiscent of The Shining and some of it was even from The Shining itself which was lovely to see. I have no idea if I liked it or not, so this score is not set in stone. I just know that I've not been shaken by a film like this since I saw the end to Sleepaway Camp a few weeks ago. One moment especially chilled me to the core towards the end (I think you'll know what I'm talking about) and by the end of it I rushed to my bed covered in chills. I think it's very important to watch it alone in the dark in order to get the full experience. That's if you really want it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The schisms in Lynch's mind....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of those who dare watch this three hour mind-fest from David Lynch and then attempt to put down online their feelings as a review have said that the first hour is the only one that made some sense and perhaps after that point, it became just too disjointed and weird to follow, or be enjoyable.For me, it's only after 55 mins clocks up on the LED counter that it gets going. This was always going to be a strange and disturbing film, so if any should be cut, it's the rather boring and non-sensical period before.Once the vivid colours, close-ups and eerie silences transport us to a world within a world, it gets interesting, with Laura Dern, at the very least, acting superbly and whether we get "it", or not, there's a semblance of interest, the unexplained, the mysterious. Are we (or Lynch's High-Def Video camera) tunnelling along through her brain cells, or is Lynch saying something about psychosis? More scary than many a certificate 18 gore-fest, the occasional sudden jolt sends rivers of chill down one's limbs.Before I reviewed films, I watched Inland Empire for the first time, I wrote out every single word and thought that popped into MY mind (after that hour marker) rather like, I suppose, one of those picture association card tests that Shrinks apparently get their patients do. However graphic, sexual or non-sensical, it all went down. I showed it to the creative writing course tutor I had at the time, who said it was the best thing of mine she'd read - I have to admit I wasn't a particularly good student....BUT - point is, I do recommend that one tries this and not just with this film. Chances are it won't make any more sense and possibly will confuse one more, but it does increase the experience...So, take Inland Empire with a pillar of salt, be totally receptive to all it feeds you. You do get numbed by it, soothed by it, confused, disturbed and appalled by it. But, as one famous reviewer said about Fellini's later and really quite weirdly unhinged stuff (Satyricon) is at least much more interesting than most director's average material. The same could equally be said of David Lynch - he HAS done better and Inland Empire will always put up its walls of sheer length and iffy reputation to Lynch fans, let alone to the mainstream audience.Rather than taking mind-warping drugs, watch this instead - it's a lot safer and you can always switch off when and if you need to...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though i am not a huge fan of USA cinema but because of the common language between us i watch their movies on and off, some of which are pretty good. This is not one of them.It was at least good to see that they tried to do something different, as pathethic as it is, maybe after a few more experiments they will get it right.***Spoilers*** The movie is a stew of about 4 or 5 Hollywood movies (As many of Hollywood movies are) They have bits from E.T., Donnie Darkman, Deep Impact and a couple of slapstic flicks, the names of which i cannot recall at this time.The story is basically E.T. except that we have a brain damaged young woman playing the role of E.T. There are a lot of music and dance numbers which are not bad but whenever they tried to add something of their own to the story they have ended up making a mess.The Physics is so bad that even some one like Rakesh Roshan must have known that a child of grade 6 would not be impressed.I mean Instant messaging rabbits from another planet via a radio broadcast. Mr Lynch, radio waves travel at the speed of light and would take 4 years to reach the nearest star.Well........ instead of describing it's follies i would just say that if u wanna watch something other then the usual bollywood melodrama you are welcome to try Inland Empire but don't keep your hopes too high, just enjoy the show.2 1/2 out of 10 (Which includes 1 star for bravery)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The craziest film of the recent years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The thing with most of the films made by David Lynch is that, you either love or hate them. And in "Inland Empire", the common elements present in his previous movies are taken to a extreme point, that even the most hardcore Lynch fans will found absolutely confusing and self indulgent.And yet, I found this film to be extraordinary. Why? Because, after seeing a lot of fantasy/ horror/ thriller films, one could think that everything was said, that there is nothing that could be add in those genres...But this film speaks otherwise: "Inland Empire" is a triumph of the imagination over the coherence (And that is the reason why I could understand why so many people dislikes this film) the supremacy of the dreams over the reality. This film is unpredictable, twisted, and filled with sophisticated nonsense, the kind of film that you could watch hundred of times, and always will be equally surprising as the first time.Laura Dern's performance is simply outstanding: I just couldn't think in any other actress able to do the incredible effort required by this movie, in which Lynch introduces us into a wild world of dreams and nightmares, even more intense than his previous films, such as "Eraserhead" and "Lost Highway".Just like "Toy Story 3" is considered by many film-goers as a delightful love-letter to all those that enjoyed that franchise of movies since the very beginning of it, this could be considered as the very own message to all those that loved his previous work...And all those who dare to dream beyond any kind of limit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreamlike journey into the mind of an actress--and David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreamlike experience, this one. Watched it on DVD in two sessions, due to its three hour length. In a theater this would have been a butt buster. The uninitiated should watch "Blue Velvet" first.As a Lynch fan I enjoy most his efforts to turn everyday scenes and objects sinister and/or foreboding. The sound design is always a gas in his films, and heightens that foreboding.It's difficult to put this in a category, but I'd vote for psychological horror film if I had to choose. The cop out answer would be "It's a Lynch film."This appears to be filmed on standard DV, cropped to widescreen, the image in places is flat out awful. Hopefully Lynch's next film can be shot with the upcoming cheap model Red. That would come as a relief to the eyeballs. But this is second guessing him, I'm sure he'd say this is the look he was after. The bottom line is that this is an unabashed art film that is opaque and not for viewers looking for a straight forward narrative. It drips with fragments from Lynch's unconscious, it could be called a "stream of consciousness" film. I'm glad I watched it, it was like a trip to the art museum. I loved what he was doing in a number of places, but at other times I felt like I was locked up in a padded cell with the filmmaker. Proceed with caution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lynch who did not study philosophy but seems to belong to those natural talents to whom incredible insights of the deepness of mind just fall - comparable to people who did find amazing results in mathematics without ever having studied one semester mathematics -, has become more and more the only film maker who systematically eliminated all traces of Aristotelian logic by replacing implications through associations. So, whoever has studied the relevant literature between Kant or Hegel and Heidegger or Gotthard Günther and still has no concrete picture in his mind how a world would look in which logic has been replaced by sensation, must watch Lynch's movie - starting from "Eraserhead", in which the alienation of the human being in a world had been shown which had become utterly senseless - up to "Inland Empire", a masterwork which bears all signs of an ultimate stadium from where there will be no way to lead further.A world in which there is no logic is a world without causality. What we call association is merely an empty container in which everything falls which does not fall under logic. However, there is a huge difference between what the surrealists did at the beginning of the 20st century and what Lynch is doing today: It is not true that everything is possible. Abolishment of logic means, in Lynch's sense, that one reasons can have innumerable consequences - but those are well determined, you just do not know which one will follow at a certain time and place from the reason. In this sense, one could speak of unequivocal multi-possibility. This is very well shown in "Inland Empire" by the many recurring scenes - scenes which are shown first isolated, and then are recurring in many different and allegedly non-fitting contexts. As we see, the Un-equivocalness of the multi-possible consequences is nothing but the memory of the lead actress to hold together what still can be hold together. Hence memory plays an important role in Lynch's films (while they do not do in surrealist movies): Memory is the only possibility to isolate and recognize recurring elements which may serve later in order to give structure to a stream of ideas which seem to be deserted by logic. We thus do wonder that associations, which have replaced logic, are solely based on memory. But there is nothing left to coordinate the associations. In the end, we found ourselves confronted by memory versus mind.</fullReview>

Inland empire could be defined as the most bizarre or the most simple work he's done to me. I have my ideas about what's going on but they all could be reduced down to one sentence that Lynch also uses to define his movie : " A troubled actress" It is well worked out. It is transparent as all Lynch movies are. You have your own space to fill and I really don't want to say anything more about it. You should have your own personal experience and make your own judgment. For the Lynch fans it is a masterpiece but i really don't know how would one feel if his/her first Lynch movie was this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lynch's weirdest film since Eraserhead takes you on a journey that most people won't be able to follow. This 3 hour epic is about a woman who becomes the character she is to play in a cursed movie. I know it sounds like a crappy horror movie, but it's not.Shot entirely on a DV camera, the film takes us on a trip from Hollywood to Poland, while following two almost completely different stories (don't worry it'll all make sense in the end if you can follow it that is).My suggestion is you watch some of Lynch's earlier works like Mulholland Dr., Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart, and Eraserhead before trying to embark on this strange journey in to the mind of all that is Lynchian.The Rating: 10/10 (a Lynch 10/10). The film can seem long and times and the shots of Lara Dern can seem almost unnecessary but it is a great film, if you can follow it.Remember: There is not exit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has some interesting moments, especially at the beginning, but it is entirely too long and disjointed. Lynch likes to make the point again and again that our sense of narrative is socially constructed, and he thus takes great delight in subverting our expectations by breaking the narrative line repeatedly. Okay. Enough already. We get the point. On the other hand, we might argue that a film with a tightly woven narrative line is never a bad thing. What is bad are the tiresome shots of darkened hallways, the constant entering into darkened rooms while the crappy electronic score kicks in (I guess we're supposed to feel a troubling eeriness in the air) in the background, and subtexted stage acts (in this case humans with fake rabbit heads) that don't enrich the story line, even though they are meant to thematize the breakdown in marital relations by showing how the language of married couples ceases to be communicative (gee, didn't T. S. Eliot already do this?). David Lynch, it's time for you to reinvent yourself. Stop dishing out cinematic crap that looks like a remake of your last film. This is a film for die-hard Lynch fans only. To call it enriching and fresh is laughable. If it were tomorrow, then I probably wouldn't have seen this film today. Right? Sheesh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange, Confusing, Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch has again created a confusing, almost incomprehensible movie that is composed of various strange, nightmarish experiences. In Mr. Lynch's attempts here he seems to try to outdo himself and unfortunately, his almost, nauseous influence gets in the way of the story - particularly the dialogue in places. The brilliance of some of this movie, however, is in its recreation of actual nightmare landscapes - perhaps one of the few people who can accomplish this mental experience. Yet, even in dreams, however, there seems too much going on in this movie than even in dreams. The fascinating twists and turns, the eerily successful immersion into and out of various dream subplots are sometimes great pieces of cinema. Yet the number of associated dream experiences are perhaps one too many, the really distracts from the experience. It is really the directors responsibility to be able to edit and project onto the screen something that allows the audience to experience, but frustrate and confuse beyond reason. Laura Dern, strangely enough, demonstrates an amazing range of acting talent and her presence, despite the nauseous David Lynch dialogue at times and David Lynch looks and styles, really captures her ability as an actress, a very good performance. Six out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mulholland Drive" on street crack.Seriously... For his latest feature, Director David Lynch operates under complete creative control boldly experimenting with digital film-making and further exploring the art of "diving within" to produce what is probably his most raw, honest, and personal project since the 1970's. But what the f*ck does it all mean? For starters, the film's title certainly does not refer to any physical place, rather the vast treasures or rewards that can be found by searching within one's self, as an actor or actress (i.e. Laura Dern) is often required to do for a role. To help make the best sense out of "INLAND EMPIRE", ManwithaVan recommends Lynch's short book, "Catching the Big Fish."www.manwithavan.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This will shed a lot of light on you if your frustrated with this movie: Go back and remember what this film is called, "INLAND EMPIRE" OK, thats Hollywood, L.A., right, which brings to mind plastic, greed, selfishness, fakers. Well, the "unpaid bill" is Nikki needing to face that and kill it to be a good person. So at the end when we see her shoot Polish guy/her plastic soul, shes killing it. Now you ask, Why Poland and Polish things? Well think about what a contrast Polish culture is to L.A.? Older, real, cold, "gone thru more pain" to become more cultured, so Lynch is using this culture to bridge the gap to Nikki and teach her, thus at the end she looks at herself and shes content with herself. Lynch uses a lot of things in the middle to shock you and through you off, but he usually has one main point to tell in his movies. I know there may be other elements to this movie, but they are to make you think harder of Whats the main point, because if I made a movie and I was trying to get across a point of view to you and I made it obvious, than you wouldn't get a lot out of it, but if I made it under a bunch of surreal layers and you worked your ass of to get it, it would drive home harder to you. By the way, one thing that really confirms my theory on this is that Lynch went around promoting this film with a cow, yes you heard me, a cow and a sign that said "without cheese there would be no INLAND EMPIRE" get it? cheese as in cheesy? Well I got to go, its 9:45, I need to be home by after midnite!p.s. A Fun Thing I Noticed: the rabbit/psychiatrist gets up on the 4th ring and answers the phone just before the 7th ring, and he does that again when hes a rabbit in his house when Nikki calls him. 47.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief impressions and summary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is always a difficult task to review a David Lynch film. For one, it can seem virtually impossible to summarise the plot. This has never been more true than in the case of INLAND EMPIRE (Lynch insists the film's title be capitalized), a film some have said his entire career has been leading up to ? a sprawling three-hour film shot on digital video.The basic plot (but there are many more plots both connected and seemingly unconnected to the main plot) has Laura Dern playing an actress called Nikki who is cast in a remake of a haunted film (the previous cast died mysterious deaths). As she becomes more involved in the film's production and immerses herself into her role, Nikki's mind begins to unravel, and she turns into many other characters. Dern is fantastic in her role(s) and is ably supported by a strong cast including Grace Zabriskie, Harry Dean Stanton, Justin Theroux, Julia Ormond, and Jeremy Irons.INLAND EMPIRE is not an easy film to watch or to understand. I wouldn't go quite so far as to say that it is for Lynch fans only, but being a Lynch fan would certainly help as the film feels like the director has come full circle with his career, back to the independent production of his surrealistic and experimental debut, Eraserhead. It's also chock full of subtle self-referential nods to all his films. If you're unacquainted with Lynch, I would certainly recommend that you check out some of his other films before this one - 2001's Mulholland Drive may be helpful as an introduction.It may leave you scratching your head. You may find it impenetrable. But one thing is for sure ? INLAND EMPIRE will tease, torment and teach you with its multi-faceted and multi-layered narrative. It's definitely the most innovative movie of the last few years, a complex and puzzling work of genius that's worth taking the time to try to unravel.A quick note on the DVD: INLAND EMPIRE is available as 2-disc Special Edition. The one sold here has some interesting interviews on its second disc. But I would recommend the Region 1 (US) DVD as its production was personally overseen by Lynch himself, and it contains much more features ? including a further 90 minutes of deleted material!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director David Lynch refuses to give clear explanations on his movies(with the exceptions of The Elephant Man and The Straight Story)and he prefers the spectator to making the homework of taking out conclusions.I like a lot the films he does but I do not try to find in them a clear explanation.I just enjoy the extraordinary talent Lynch has of creating emotions and producing feelings without a too coherent story.He uses all the instruments to give us something unique which we may not understand it immediately but something which we will never forget.Inland Empire is a very interesting experiment and we can see the same surrealistic style he used on most of his movies.After Eraserhead,his brilliant first film,Lynch continued with more normal films,like The Elephant Man or Dune.But,with Blue Velvet,he backed to show the oneiric feeling he had shown in Eraserhead (although on a lesser degree).With Inland Empire,I had the perfect sensation I was in a dream(or,best said,on a nightmare).But this film is not for everyone:its running time is of 3 hours.Lynch plays with our perception in the time and the reality to create a very interesting experience but which will not satisfy to the people who are looking for a clear story.Lynch makes us taking out conclusions all the time.The film is made with a digital video and that thing helps because it creates more mystery.Laura Dern brings an amazing performance.I do not know if I can recommend Inland Empire to everyone:I liked it pretty much and I think it's a very interesting experiment.But I understand some people will not like it.Inland Empire is very interesting and it makes us taking out conclusions.And I always appreciate that.</fullReview>

I must have watched Twin Peaks episodes 10 times each &amp; never get tired of.Mulholland Drive is probably his best movie to this day.I probably put expectation way too high (because he always wait like 5 years to make a full lenght feature) when watching Inland Empire. That's why I have mixed feelings about it.First of all, I was very disappointed to find out he used DV for some scenes... as if Lynch hired a nowhere cameraman to do his work. I probably understand he wanted to make it look like a dream and/or make it look like a "reality show" but I think he was able to do so in his previous work without using digital &amp; shaky camera. I hate shaky cam... especially if it's a David Lynch movie.Also, where was Angelo Badalamenti??? Not that I didn't like the score at all but I think both make the perfect match.On a positive note, I thought it was scary as hell, as if we were in the red room for 3 hours.Laura Dern is fabulous! She shows she's a great actor &amp; she fits perfectly with Lynch's genre.Hopefully, Lynch still puts his dreams/nightmares to the screen!! I can't wait to see what he'll be doing next!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Distanced Experience - and it doesn't have to be that way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that to me, the best films, the ones that are truly original, are the films which take something known and accessible and twist it into something superbly strange. Take Donnie Darko, which espoused a fairly worn-out formula of the troubled youth battling teenage angst and flipped it entirely on its head both stylistically (clever camera-work), generically (mixing sci-fi with mystery/drama/fantasy) and narratologically (hello wormholes). Or take Requiem for a Dream, whose script might be mistakened for a one-sided parable on drug use, but avoided this pitfall by forcing audience engagement via its immediately accessible characters and a confronting techno-classical soundtrack. Better yet, take the Kill Bill duology, with its countless intertexts and colourful genre plays. However stylisms aside, these films are enhanced by something which Inland Empire completely lacks - an engaging, three-dimensional protagonist (in Requiem's case, there are several).That's why, for all its clever discourse and discursive underwriting, I'm still at a distance with this film. My boyfriend was quick to point out the clever allusions to Hollywood and what he saw were, I suppose, some pretty shocking feminist readings; the lead actress does, after all, get stabbed with a screwdriver on Hollywood Boulevard - a stunningly provocative scene, to be sure. Yet interestingly, I found the cameo role of an Asian prostitute and her blundering speech about trying to get a bus to Pomona stole the scene. It was, to me, the most gripping part of the film, at least in terms of characterisation. I guess the reason I'm at a distance with this film is because you're kept a such distance from the main character. Never are you allowed to really penetrate her character. Instead, you are forever trapped in a kind of suffocating theatrical wheel that tries to dabble in mystery but ultimately stinks of melodrama.3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe myself the first to have watched it here in Malta before it even got to the movies, being a big David lynch fan I had it ordered in advance. David Lynch's movies have always been strange and seemingly getting stranger with the play of dark and light. I think that one can understand this film from his own personal perspective as he watches it, but attempting to discuss it with a friend next to in detail can prove to be quite futile. One can call it a nightmare, the logic of dreams when you are in them, but come the morning it all seems so weird and senseless when we accept the world at face value. I think that like Fellini once said "One must sit down to watch a movie with the innocence of a fetus".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>7 out of 10 is a pretty good rating, but considering what a Lynch fan I am that is slightly less than Stellar. While I do completely support Lynch and his work I felt like this film was sloppy and slightly indulgent. That being said this is an ultimately rewarding and thoroughly bizarre film. I should say that if you are not a fan of Lynch there is almost no chance you will enjoy this film.Lynch is trying for something different and I respect that, but I will not embrace something that is different simply because it is DIFFERENT, there must still be a story there essentially.Perhaps I need to watch this film a few more times, it could very well eventually become a favorite of mine. Considering its 3 hours running time, the film is not easy to watch several times, but I feel that is necessary to understand it in its entirety.Bottom Line: if you like Lynch then you simply have to watch this movie, there is no real way to explain it. If you aren't into Lynch or aren't familiar with his work you should give this film a shot, but be warned it is very VERY different.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of our most viable film masters releases his most labored, affecting, and cryptic work yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uncompromising, epic weirdness...David Lynch fans rejoice, for Inland Empire is the film this master of warped cinema has always wanted to make, for himself. The three plus hour film would probably be tediously difficult to anyone but the experienced fan familiar with his distinct surrealist vocabulary, but those who do value David Lynch and his unabashed explorations into the subconscious will truly be rewarded with this quintessential work.With Inland Empire, Lynch has finally shaved off all the Hollywood fat that his major studio releases have afforded him in the past and instead is allowed to focus solely on this major decent into his surrealist nightmare. While this will certainly bother a majority of rational and logic-based viewers, I could not be happier to see one of modern film's few authentic masters submerged completely in his element, reporting to no higher authority then himself. Laura Dern embodies the gigantic eeriness to a tee (often shot with a striking resemblance to the directors face as well), and compliments her long-standing partner in crime like no other major American female star could.Though the film is certainly guilty of it's pretentious excesses, I would have it no other way. Inland Empire is a testament to the power of creative control, and a haunting character exploration that can bear much fruit after a lot of the initial creepiness subsides. For those brave enough, and open-minded enough, to take perhaps the longest and darkest journey through the clouded psyche of identity that any modern work has produced, all directed by perhaps the only living filmmaker that possesses the singular drive to expose some of the scariest, most realistic horror emanating from our own unconscious thoughts, embrace the cold, dark undercurrent of Inland Empire, and never look back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For what it's worth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just seen it at the Wellington film festival so still working it out. All the pieces are there. In the first few minutes there's a girl crying, a TV with static, a twisted sitcom. This then progresses to the old Lynch favourites (Dern, Theroux), the red curtains make a comeback, the violence against women, the strobes, the sixties music. Somehow it just doesn't seem all there though &amp; at times it seems like it was edited by an epileptic six-year old. The lush cinematography has been replaced by washed out DV which mutes it all for me. The jump cuts &amp; outbursts of string stabs are more reminiscent of a bad amateur horror film, not something you expect from Lynch. Overall you feel he should know better &amp; some of this film just smacks of sensationalism. The closing shot under the credits is a great tribute of his career to date though. And those rabbits are going to give me nightmares for a while to come. Perhaps it'll make more sense on repeat viewings; but probably not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very effective, yet slightly disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire | 8.25/10 As expected, this is quite a good film, with a large number of scenes that are as effective as anything Lynch has come up with in the past. What I see the film as, upon first viewing, is a dark and disturbing meditation on the idea of self, identity, and conscious. The devices used to present this are quite abundant, but the main story seems to revolve around a Polish actress that ends up seeing her own actions and emotions presented to her through Dern's character in some parallel place and/or time. This is strongly highlighted through the repetition of an absolutely haunting song that evokes a mood and feeling similar to that of Club Silencio from Mulholland Drive.That being said, I must admit I'm slightly disappointed not only in that this feels like there's been no progression from Mulholland Drive, but that much of the film greatly resembles Mulholland Drive to begin with. That's all good and well, as it's one of my favorite films, but I still think Lynch should have avoided such a regression and moved on to something different. Many of the typical Lynch themes are present, and as usual, it's basically incoherent on first viewing, at least narratively speaking.Overall the film is obviously worth seeing at least twice; that is of course if you made it through the first viewing without wanting to give up on cinema altogether. I wish I could say that I was blown away by this film, considering Lynch's talent and the fact that he's been working on it for over 5 years. I suppose that I can settle for what's presented here, though, if only for the fact that it is still more innovative and interesting than 95% of what continues to come out these days. As true as that may be, I do hope that Lynch's next film is a vast departure from this in every imaginable aspect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's most unusual work - works on most levels</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally managed to catch Inland Empire and the Sydney Film Festival last night.As a long time Lynch fans naturally my expectations were high and for the most part were met.I felt it appropriate to tick the SPOILERS box when writing this post, however, I could have left it unticked and explained the plot and still felt confident that I wouldn't ruin the plot for anyone.. the simple truth being that this film hangs together on the most threadbare of narratives.Those who take some satisfaction in dissecting Lynch films such as Lost Highway, FWWM or Mulholland Drive should prepare themselves to cast off the shackles of analysis of INLAND EMPIRE and simply enjoy it for what it is.. a three hour insight into David Lynch's subconscious exploring how Lynch feels about female FIDELITY and GUILT.The story goes something like this .. Laura Dern plays a semi-successful actress in Hollywood who get what appears to be a "breakout" role in a film called "High on Blue Tomorrows".She is attracted to her co-star, played by Justine Theroux and the lines between her character in the film being made and her own life begin to blur. That's the first 45 minutes in a nutshell and at that point the film casts away it's narrative and simply goes on an exploration of Dern's character's mind. Dern turns up as herself, a prostitute and a few other characters (often played by other actresses).During the 1 1/4 hour "mindf**&amp;" that exists in the center of the film) we meet characters that all seem to be connected by central themes, yet there is no TANGIBLE connection between them. Characters appear and ask what seem to be simple questions and then disappear never to be seen again. We see themes emerging, fidelity, guilt, lust etc.. all "connected" purely by the emotions they conjure in the viewer.. there is nearly no narrative at all to connect characters and themes. Be prepared for "lynchian" scenes aplenty, but also be prepared for no explanation or resolution at all of those characters and scenes. They are "just there".. simple as that.. interpret them as feelings.The last 40 or so minutes begin to bring the threads back together.. albeit BARELY. Lynch doesn't resolve the story, reveal a mystery or try to feed us information to allow us to make any sort of interpretation.. he simply leaves it to us to decide for ourselves and explore our own feelings.Is Inland Empire a masterpiece ? Anyone who appreciates creative film-making will say yes... Lynch fans will say yes. To any other film-going member of the public they are going to tell you it's the worst film they've ever seen (assuming they make it through the 3 hours).I can't wait to see what Lynch comes up with next with his DV.. having seen what he has done with the media in INLAND EMPIRE the possibilities are endless. Personally I've always wanted to see a Lynch "horror movie" (I guess in some ways Eraserhead was close).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see INLAND EMPIRE at my local art-house cinema last night and found it to be one of my favourite David Lynch films with scenes which often made me want to stand up and scream "Oh my gosh!" (I decided against it in the end) due to the sheer joy of seeing such beautiful images fitting together with the obviously well-thought out use of sound (which is usually one of the high points in any David Lynch film).I should probably warn you (although you have most likely been warned already) that this film is not one with an average narrative structure which is completely coherent to the viewer. It's a film which asks you to let your mind drift off in to its abstract world and to enjoy the mood and atmosphere sustained throughout. So looking for the storyline might be an exciting task to set out to do, but it will be a task and something that you might have to piece together very slowly. So my advice is to just sit back and be taken for on the journey that INLAND EMPIRE took me on.My only minor gripe with the film is that it was 3 hours long and sadly my bum does start to become a little irritable after that length of time sitting in the same position. I also felt that little scenes of the film didn't quite interest me as much as others, though I'm glad to say that they never detracted from the overall experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memory, sex, and celebrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Returning to themes mined in Mulholland Drive, David Lynch's Inland Empire explores the disjointed world of memory, sex, and celebrity framed by the old "film within a film" motif. Only on Lynch's fragmented terms where actress and her role Nikki/Sue (Laura Dern) converge to become one with not a blip even if the audience should confuse the two roles. As the director has Niki assume other roles such as Hollywood Boulevard hooker and battered housewife, the actress becomes richer in character if not confusing in reality.The recent Perfect Stranger with Halle Berry shows the complicating and destructive force of sex in advertising and journalism; Inland Empire shows the life-threatening effect of illicit sex between an actress and her co-star. Lynch adds the turn of the screw that this is also a plot in Nikki's film. But "plot" is giving Lynch much more credit for realism than he deserves, the discursive Blue Velvet and early and famous example of his wide-ranging mind. At times I am reminded of Robert Altman's much more plot-restrained Eyes Wide open where sex is the dominant force underneath visual set pieces that overwhelm character and plot, such as it is.Interspersed among the plot points in Inland Empire are disorienting images of actors in rabbit costume in a stage play with canned laughter (some critics suggest Alice in Wonderland), bad girls visiting Nikki"s home and joining her on the street, a soothsayer older woman predicting the upheaval of Nikki's marriage with her new role. The predictions don't alter the future but remind us that human failure is predictable.Images in Inland Empire clash and merge like memory itself?imperfect and random, dwelling on the ends of experience, either ecstasy or defeat and seldom the softer center. Lynch bravely provides few clues to his disjointed universe, only juxtaposed images of love and death that are sometimes confused for each other.Inland Empire (an appropriate title given the signature Lynch close-ups revealing souls in upheaval) might best be approached like a poorly organized photo album: Although the images evoke the joys of familiarity, even warmth, they cover a world of greed and lust at war with love and happiness. Empire is a tough three hours but ultimately worthwhile if it only jogs the memory to face the effects of the past and dread of the future.</fullReview>

Mixing normal imagery with dreamworlds with what might be explained as drug induced it follows none of the normal patterns.For the rest it is very hard to say anything about this film.

		<fullReview>Toward the end of his career, Michelangelo quit being interested in nailing down every detail of his subject's form while sculpting. He had gotten to the point where he was more interested in capturing the essence of the forms in as few, roughly hewn cuts as necessary. I think Lynch has gone the same route. The difference is that he never had much use for traditional form to begin with. So, with Inland Empire, you've got all the necessary "brushstrokes" or "cuts" to elicit feeling, emotion, thrill, etc. without any sort of real form. If you're looking for something concrete to hang on to, this is not the film for you. However, if you've got the nerve to hop a ride on this disjointed, yet somehow coherent visual mood piece...you will be rewarded. I think this flick is brilliant and that the maestro should finally take his place next to auteurs such as Kubrick, Hitchcock et al.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>visceral stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been assaulted by 'INLAND EMPIRE'. It is easily the most arduous film I've ever sat through. My body was literally attacked; Eyes: the repeated flashing, sudden switches and all these grainy close ups. Ears: the sound at times is so unnerving the sheer ferociousness of the screams, electricity and banging. Heart and stomach: the sudden scenes and often uncomfortable situations left my stomach ailing and my heart was pounding at the end. Added to all this is that the film is 3 hours long it makes watching it such a grueling task. One of the first impressions I get from INLAND EMPIRE is that Lynch is setting out to attack Hollywood! This I find slightly perplexing as he constantly reiterates his love for Hollywood in interviews. The film documents the descent of a woman into depravity and danger while trying to document this story as a film within the film itself. This may be confusing and at one point towards the latter end of the film it becomes a story within a story within a story within a story. Sound confusing?... well upon seeing it it becomes clearer (though not the lenses!). Lynch repeatedly attacks vestiges of Hollywood; fickle self-interested "friendships", disloyalty, the abuse of women, falling on hard times, the loss of spirit and good will and most poignantly the inability to really know how people are feeling and if they are genuine. These motifs are constant in the film and are expressed either directly or symbolically through violent shattering scenes. The first hour or so is digestible and often funny thanks to Grace Zabriskie and Harry Dean Stanton. But then when Laura Dern's 1st character enters a door leading her to view herself at the audition we have seen earlier it descends into a visceral onslaught with only sparse and brief moments of reprieve. The colour of the film is dominated by a terracotta hue during the first hour and it simmers during the rest of the film. This I found useful as it achieves a degree to compel which is needed to balance out the tough scenes that make up the final 2/3's. The camera-work is mostly adequate, usually to initiate fear or uncertainty in particular scenes, but at times it becomes exaggeratedly blurred and difficult. This however is obviously Lynch's intention; he wants to completely unnerve his audience, whether this emanates from a desire to keep up his publicly perceived eccentric-ism or motivated by the need to film this way to justifiably showcase his story. I hope and think it is the latter. This is related to the credit sequence, read on! Typical of Lynch there are memorable scenes; the prostitute ensemble, Julia Ormond with a screwdriver in her gut, dream sequences, a bizarre barbecue scene, the eccentric Grace Zabriskie and one of the most frightening scenes I've ever witnessed at the end which all il say is that it involves superimposition! Then there is the credit sequence! It hints at something that im still not very sure of but it is certainly one the most fascinating endings to a film... ever! There is so much going on in it I don't know where to begin. It could act as some sort of resolution for the film, but it also creates a substantial link with 'Mulholland Drive' and even 'Blue Velvet' which then leads to another idea that is backed up by other ingredients of the credit sequence; Lynch has made some sort of evaluation of his own work and the scene it seems is a vitriol against public perception, perhaps dissatisfaction with/of him. This left me thinking whether Lynch is planning to engage a markedly different way in future films or even to pack it in altogether? What also needs mentioning is Nastassja Kinski's role. This has fascinated me equally as Lynch's self appraisal, probably due to the fact that Kinski herself is fascinating. Is Lynch hinting at a link between what he told in INLAND EMPIRE and Ms. Kinski??? I don't know, I have to see this film again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch's 'Ulysses'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young prostitute, half dreaming, remembers the nasty time she had with her last client. Her dream segues into a fantasy sitcom where all the characters are hares. That's not it. A weird and mildly threatening little old lady pays a visit to the nouveau riche mansion of a posh blonde and begins to make disturbing allegations. That's not it. An actress is preparing for her big role, but when she begins an affair with her co-star, she realizes that her life is beginning to echo the film that they're shooting. Adding to her (and our) confusion is the revelation that the current film is a remake of a doomed Polish production, 47, which was never finished due to an unspeakable tragedy, alluded to several times but never explained. Although we, the audience, are allowed to see parts of it. Several times it looks as if what we thought was the story, was a movie, or a dream, and Only Now are we getting the truth. Then the camera pulls back exposing its fellow camera and crew. What Lynch has done is spend a few years shooting bits of films mostly on basic video stock originally just for his website, then with the help of his star, Laura Dern, pasted them together into the most impressionistic film ever. As well as running several separate stories in parallel, this includes a good few alternative narratives. It's in the nature of writing and movie-making to change the role-assignations as well as the plot lines during the scribbling or shooting but the usual thing is to finish with one definitive version. (A notable contrast is Roeg/Cammel's Performance, which has three cuts doing the circuits) So a bunch of intercut half-plots and scenarios will be topped by something even more dislocated and often nastier; certainly more intriguing. The whole work, with its strong emphasis on murky visuals, using heavy shadow and colour to provoke emotion, looks like a return to the feel of Lynch's early films, including The Grandmother, which mixed in graphics and animation. Its emphasis is on the anxiety; full-time, as in Eraserhead. The director has spoken of his debt to Edward Hopper and Francis Bacon - that's easy to spot, and in this film you may detect a strong flavour of Pinter in some of the dialogue. This is a long film; two things keep it alive: one is David Lynch's doing his equivalent of Joyce's Ulysses, with all its magniloquence; the other is, rather than talk about the theory of creation he's exposed it in the most entertaining way. Not a conventional narrative of course, but a pleasing shape, when you stand back. CLIFF HANLEY</fullReview>

I drove home both yelling and laughing at the same time. A Bleepin' 3 hr sexual tension and worry fest. Jimminy Cricket, man. No thing means nothing. In other words, meaning is completely derived from your own thinking. The film (and by Anology, my life) doesn't mean squat except where I insert my own connections and meanings. We are the directors of our own movies (our lives). Movie making is now a free for all. There are no rules. Grab your camera and have your actors be solemn and worried the whole Bleepin' time. Now, I have to work at directing my own life the way I want it. I have to thank Lynch for that. I thought it a little over the top unless it was his intention to rile us at the length of this movie. I mean, enough already. I get it Dave I get it. Go see this movie. It's whatever you want it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Inland Empire" introduces a new character to Lynchian cinema--the audience. I'm surprised that nobody has mentioned this elephant in the living room--especially since it's so obvious in the rabbit's living room. "A woman in trouble" is an archetype. We came to see a woman in trouble and, clever wag that he is, David Lynch has shown us ourselves watching a woman in trouble.After "Mulholland Drive", the astute viewer is on the lookout to ask--"Who is the dreamer?" David Lynch suggests that this movie is about transcendental meditation and that we approach the whole film as a dream. We are the dreamer, even if we are led through a Lynchian artistic representation of our dream. As may be expected, it does not resonate with everybody's unconscious--sorry. We (the unseen seer) appear early, the elephant in the rabbit's living room. Who's trip down the rabbit hole is it--not Nikki's--ours! We are he viewer towards whom the characters in the Polish apartment turn their chairs.At the end Nikki "awakes" to be in the movie, but in the theater (in the audience) she sees herself on the screen and is back in a dream. At the end, the cast speaks directly to us-"It's OK! It was only a movie! We hope you had fun!"-Then the lights come on and there we are in the audience. The movie hasn't ended; we must awake and be enlightened.Stephen R. Cann</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen INLAND EMPIRE twice now in three days. I drove over 100 miles each time to see it and was thrilled to do it both times. This is an incredible movie. I will warn those who do not like David Lynch's films: you will not like this movie. If you are looking for something straight-forward and simple, go see Little Miss Sunshine (which I also enjoyed). INLAND EMPIRE will twist and warp itself in your mind, grab a hold of your psyche and never let go. I took extensive notes the second time I watched it to help me unlock all of the mysteries held within.Upon one viewing, you can discern a somewhat simple version of the narrative elements of the film. However, multiple viewings (of which there will be many more for me upon the DVD release) allows you to hear and see all of the hints that are given throughout the movie. Subtle dialogue, foreshadowing, allusions and flashbacks are all used to construct the mind-bending story that is INLAND EMPIRE.As for the DV aspect of it, I will honestly say that I did not think I liked it the first time I watched it. The quality of moving shots is grainy and distorted and the film is filled with uncomfortable close-ups. However, after seeing it the second time I realized how much those help the overall feeling of the film. By the end of the first hour, you are completely hypnotized by what is occurring on the screen.Lynch is certainly on the top of his game with this movie. While he has made some more straight-forward, easy to understand films (Wild At Heart, The Elephant Man, and The Straight Story) I have always had a place in my heart and mind for his abstract surrealism (Eraserhead, Mullholland Drive, Twin Peaks, and Lost Highway). If you are a true Lynch fan, I highly recommend you see this in theatres if you can. The sound, when heard loudly in a theatre, adds a whole new dimension to the story. If you must wait for the DVD release on June 8th, I suggest you watch it on a big screen with a good surround sound system turned as loud as you can take it. Then up it by another couple of decibels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to jump down the rabbit hole &amp; land in one piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire is an incredibly simple movie told in an abstract manner. The core plot could be written easily on a dinner napkin, so it is obviously not what makes this movie special. David Lynch's ability to tell the story in a free-associative, non-literal style is what makes this film one that people will be talking about for a long time.Lynch gives the audience a number of cues to show that what's on the screen is not to be taken literally -- the rabbits, for instance. Movies like Lost Highway and Mulholland Dr. toy with ideas like dreams and identity, but Inland Empire manages to turn these ideas into an entire self-contained filmic language. This is what people mean when they say it's even stranger or more experimental than Eraserhead.Please please please, do not try to analyse, delineate, and piece together every aspect of this film. You might've been able to do that with Lynch's earlier works, but with Inland Empire he is making it sharply clear that he wants you to feel out the movie, not think it through. Trying to "figure out" how character X relates to character Y and whether or not they were dreaming or not will quickly turn you into one of those people madly typing out a "Why did you fail me, David?" screed on some internet message board. If you do not learn to listen in Lynch's language, you will not understand him, guaranteed.This film requires some faith on viewers' parts. It requires you to watch films in a new way, and really be open to identifying with people. If you're not that type, and you were looking for another film full of midgets, Angelo Badalamenti, subtle lighting, etc...please go back to watching your copy of Mulholland Dr. But if you are game, Inland Empire is a treat unlike anything you've seen yet.

		<shortDescription>The New Lynch...well worth the wait.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an avid Lynch follower who has seen all of his works and read just about all their is on the man, I must say INLAND EMPIRE is by far his most experimental. His short films are worthy of competition in this category, but I must admit that this film has pushed Lynch further into, well further into "Lynch world". The Digital Video format has allowed Lynch to break boundaries set for him by the conventional film format and explore the truly dark and mysterious corners of the imagination. Although I found it difficult at first to decipher, it later on became one of his more easily reachable stories. I feel the 2 and a half years he spent filming INLAND EMPIRE while ignoring the typical script treatment, Lynch was able to 'feel' what the film was, build the characters based on what was being filmed and not written down in words, and find the connections through the visual/audio elements rather than force together the elements because that's what he originally intended. Even though I still believe "Mulholland Dr". to be his 'best work', INLAND EMPIRE truly impressed me and I would rank it at a close second on his all time list. This is definitely his darkest work and it will surprise most people for its wit, its nail biting moments, and its ability to throw you where you've never been before. I RECOMMEND THIS FILM to anyone who is looking for something new, and that will inspire them. But mainly because it will leave you with a mental hangover that will continue well into the next day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>His MASTERPIECE.. A work of sheer brilliance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I've been ruminating on Inland Empire, the New David Lynch film, and I've come to the conclusion that it's a work of sheer brilliance, and his masterpiece... When I originally saw it, I tried to dissect it and come up with the 'meaning' behind it, and kind of figure out the structure and how the separate threads worked with each other.. It struck me last night, Lynch has finally accomplished something that I think he's been working towards his entire career.. He's actually filmed a dream.. Parts of other films of his have been 'dream-like' and with Mulholland drive part of the movie was actually supposed to have been a dream, but it was a film dream, meaning, it was still merely 'dream like'... This thing is actually a dream.. It hit me like a brick... This film can't be interpreted in the same way you'd interpret a regular film, this film has to be interpreted as you would interpret a dream... Lynch himself I believe is cryptically letting us in on this.. The tagline to the film is 'a woman in trouble'.. I believe the woman in trouble is the woman who's HAVING the dream.. SHe's troubled, and the nightmare she's having reflects it.. It's filled with guilt, and persecution, violence... In the interpretation of the dream, we can somehow figure out who the woman is that's having it... This is not to say that there isn't some sort of 'plot' running through the thing, however, it's not a 'movie plot' it's the kind of plot one has in a dream, it's messy and doesn't really make sense when you're awake... Even the name 'Inland Empire' suggests the inner world, the dream world (yes I know that it also refers to the LA suburb).. I'm going again this weekend, this time I will dispense with the prosaic analysis and just 'experience it' ... This is what lynch says about it, he says, 'I hope you have a good experience', he's basically letting us know, that this needs to be taken in on a different level... The film is incredibly brilliant in the pacing and editing, it starts off slowly with just a general sense of unease and 'non-rightness' that all dreams that turn darker start off like.. Then it becomes more out of control, and all of a sudden you realize it's a nightmare, and the ending.. the ending is mind blowing.. I've had dreams like this before, David Lynch has created a masterpiece, end of story.. If anyone cares about true art, they should experience this film..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stations of the INLAND EMPIRE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie at Trinity College in Connecticut. The movie is about connecting to something beautiful. No matter how many a dark hallway or alley we have to go down; we are sustained by the need for love. David Lynch knows this and I suspect is the reason he is a practitioner of Transcendental Meditation.He also knows some of us need a hand thus the tearful woman watching 'shades of reality' on television after being kissed by Nicki/Sue is reunited with her husband and son. The ending of the film (end credits)is the ultimate celebration of 'CONNECTION'; there we witness a festival of themes and characters together, engaged in joyous song. And Laura Dern sitting on the settee never looked more beautiful; one may say transcendent in her beauty. Thank You, David Lynch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inland Empire - Inside Lynch's head</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should start off by saying I am a huge David Lynch fan. The intricate complexities of Mulholland Drive and the near perfection of Blue Velvet list among some of the masterpieces of modern cinema. And I don't use the term lightly. In fact 'masterpiece' is a grossly overused word when it comes to cinema. There's practically a new 'masterpiece' released every week, judging by critic's responses. Inland Empire is not a masterpiece. It's good, but it's not a masterpiece. In terms of the plot (and I use the term 'plot' very, very loosely) it follows the rise of a once great actor (played by Laura Dern) to fame through her being cast in a new melodrama. That's about as comprehensible as it gets. For the remaining 2 hours and 25 minutes we are presented with an unintelligible mess of Lynchian madness as we see Dern's character slowly lose grip of her sanity and slip into darkness as she questions what is real and what is a product of her madness. And, ultimately, we will do the same. Dern seems to spend the whole 3 hours looking completely terrified and bewildered, but nevertheless she carries the role with a truly operatic brilliance. It's true that the film is overly long. After the first 90 minutes I began to grow tired of the brain-teasing and longed for something with clear narrative rigour. Mulholland drive is an example of clear cut linear storytelling in comparison to Inland Empire. However none of this matters because if you stick with it you will be rewarded with some real cinematic gems. It's always a treat to revisit the world of David Lynch and it really doesn't matter that nothing makes sense. If you accept that this is a film of moods and don't spend the whole 3 hours asking 'what are the people in rabbit suits? , why are they all dancing? , what the hell's the bit with the monkey and the one legged woman?' (I'm not making this up) and completely immerse yourself in the world that Lynch creates, you will enjoy, or at least appreciate, the film. To summarise, Inland Empire is a tour inside the head of David Lynch which places the greatest emphasis on the oppressive atmosphere and building sense of indefinable dread. Yes, it's overly long and would've worked better as a 90 minute snapshot of a descent into madness, but Lynch has certainly cornered the market in terms of mind-boggling surrealism. I will say this though: if you haven't seen any of Lynch's work, I advise you to watch Inland Empire last. It's so surreal and nightmarish that you will either dismiss it as obscurity for the sake of obscurity and outright refuse to watch any Lynch stuff again, or accept the dream-like logic for what it is. The film's a mess?but I think it's meant to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not recommended. David Lynch was caught in its web. In other words, Lynch making ... Lynch. A solipsism that only the most pseudo intellectual fans can truly love. Other self-plagiarism: Tarantino doing Tarantino in his "Death Proof" or Scorsese making Scorsese in his "Wolf of wall street". The greatest Lynch's films feature a curse that resembles much what the illustrious music critic Ricardo Salo once said about the first two discs of PERE UBU: "unrepeatable music, beauty in the chaos that its authors will never approach but only imitate a very pale form" I hope I'm wrong, I hope that Lynch is capable of reinventing himself...we'll see.Pay attention to all different genres of cinema and cinematic styles that Lynch has ever experienced. Amazing!But ... truth be told, this "inland empire" and "death proof" films are "dead end" (both formal and in terms of history) ... they bring nothing new and the old is spent itself ...If you want to see David Lynch in his best i advise "Eraserhead", "Blue Velve" or "Wild at Hear"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now hear this David Lynch did not go to the trouble of making this movie for you to watch it on your crappy portable TV. Come on, you have a PC, how much does a projector cost. Not much yet it transforms an experience like this into one you will remember for the rest of your life. Well, it worked for me anyway. Watching this movie was like watching a flickering candle. Nobody asks what a candle flame means, why does anything have to mean anything. Same with this movie. Projected onto a wall with a good sound system. Don't try to understand this movie, it's like a dream and we all know how nonsensical our dreams can be. It can be interpreted many ways. I am still thinking about it days later. The scenes in Poland in the snow remind me of The Pianist. Laura Dern is magnificent. I watched Blue Velvet the night before so it was like seeing your sister grow up. I loved the music, the rabbits, the laugh track, Laura Palmer's fish eyed mother. What is the movie and what is really happening? A dream within a dream. A dream so real you think it's real. How do we know that all of this is not just a waking dream. The soap opera character she plays, some viewers believe that soaps are real. To them they are. I hope David Lynch makes many more movies like this. Tried to watch Dune the following night, too much like Star Wars younger brother, will wait till I can get it on Blue Ray to really appreciate but for the moment nothing can touch Inland Empire. It's the movie has been working towards all his life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch has apparently lost his mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This will not be an in depth review. Suffice to say, I thought this film to be a muddled mess. Maybe it makes sense somewhere in David Lynch's tortured mind, but nowhere else. I honestly felt that Lynch made this film while having some sort of psychotic episode. I was baffled, which is not a bad thing, but also very irritated by the film, and that IS a bad thing. What there was of plot was incoherent and confusing. I do admit that there were some interesting visual images, which one would expect from Lynch, and Laura Dern gives an earnest performance of whatever it was her character was supposed to be doing, but there were long sequences which induced me to want to fast forward the film. I refrained because this is "David Lynch." I kept thinking, "At some point it will all make sense. Just stick with it." Alas. I have enjoyed many of Lynch's films before this, for all of their flaws, but on the whole, I don't care if I never come anywhere near seeing this film again. One more thing, and I don't think this counts as a spoiler: Rabbits?????</fullReview>

It is a very arty movie. I can see how some people will enjoy this as art on screen. But that is what people have come to expect from a David Lynch movie.I remember watching Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me and feeling exactly the same afterwards... confused and a little curious.The film is a surreal thriller about an actress' life which begins to mimic the events of her current movie... but it is not that clear when you watch it.The movie stars Laura Dern and Jeremy Irons. Both of them do a good job, their acting was really good, but I just thought the story was so weird that I just didn't understand it very well. But there was something so weird about this film that it had me hooked.Other people in this movie were Justin Theroux and a cameo from William H. Macy &amp; Terry Crews.A lot of the way in this movie I was gobsmacked at the randomness. The bunnies especially really surprised me. But they were also my favourite parts of the movie. They were so weird that I couldn't help but laugh once i got over the shock of what I was watching.I will give this film 4 out of 10.I don't think I could sit through this movie again. It is too weird and too long as it was on for 3 hours.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inland Empire Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch, the artist who became a director, has once again used the canvas of film to paint the violent inner colours of the human condition. In Mulholland Drive, how much better we understood Diane's mental state through her dreaming than if we had seen her in real time moping around her flat! Inland Empire is trickier to follow as the boundary between 'reality' and 'fantasy' is less clear. But Lynch does have a 'real story' in mind somewhere, although he ? returning to the pattern of Blue Velvet and Lost Highway ? is inviting you to create it for yourself. Creativity is more important than the 'right answer'. The story line is characteristically conveyed through non-sequential narrative. In this film, we never know who is experiencing the emotions we see. A woman has undergone a traumatic series of events, not necessarily outside the experience of ordinary people. What Lynch succeeds in doing is showing us what impact these events may have on the inner world of subjectivity, on the 'inland empire'.Here is my reconstructed jigsaw picture. The character whose emotions are dramatised (let us call her X) has been married. Through an extramarital affair with a man who already had a wife and family, she became pregnant. She tried to hide the infidelity by pretending that the baby was her husband's, only to find that he kept hidden from her the fact that he was infertile ('I have a secret'). As a consequence, he becomes very angry, leaves her and starts a new life with someone else. We know little about him except (perhaps!) that he has 'a way with animals'. When X turns instead to her lover and father of the child, he too rejects her. At a later point, the child ? a son ? dies. She is left with nothing but the wreckage of two relationships.We see the extent to which X's self-loathing has reached. In reflecting on her own circumstances and looking back at the events, she fantasises, using narrative lines which are perhaps available in drama that she knows ? radio and film ? but on which she superimposes her own story. Through this we see the potential of dramatic narrative to help people express powerful emotions which arise in their own apparently unglamourous lives.First, X sees herself as the woman who had everything but who lost it through circumstances that seemed at the time to be out of her control. In her recreation, Laura Dern's 'Nicky' plays that part. As an actress, Nicky begins the film in a luxurious house but, in her character as 'Susan', gradually moves down the social ladder and ends up as a prostitute with a horrendous past. Her naivety ('who could have known?') at what is about to unfold ? and she is warned about this by her 'new neighbour' - reflects X's own recollection of her lack of awareness of the 'consequences' of her 'actions'.Secondly, X uses a drama about shady Polish characters to castigate herself. Her actions have shown her to be no better than a prostitute. What do they do? They 'f***', hence the corollary: she f***s, so she must be a prostitute. A prostitute's life is lonely, stuck in a hotel room that she doesn't recognise as her own. X too is alienated from her past, her hopes and those she loved. The Polish woman alone in her room represents X in the present, looking back on the events. The dramas intertwine, as the two parts of the woman's self-characterisation ? naive, romantically stimulated Susan and the Polish prostitute ? come together. Susan finds herself to be the prostitute.X's hatred ? towards her ex-husband; his new lover; her ex-lover's wife; but mostly turned against herself ? is expressed through the idea of a 'brutal f***ing murder'. The events that inspire this metaphor have occurred in the past (as conveyed by the lapse of time in the Polish part of the story), but Susan has to live through them; by looking back, she makes them present. Only by re-experiencing her feelings in the most dramatic way can X begin to move on from them. The anguish of Susan when she is stabbed is a climactic and very powerful moment in the film. The agony of emotional pain, regret and self-condemnation is fully expressed in it. Susan is also threatened by images of herself, and the moment of release comes only after she ? now back out of character as Nicky ? has destroyed the distorted self-image and the inner demon (represented by the 'Phantom') before entering room 47.X sees herself as both murderer and victim. She has been hurt by events, some beyond her control, and she is angry about her husband's lack of communication about his infertility. She feels accused by the wife of her ex-lover (although we don't know whether this woman actually threatened her). But she is also the perpetrator of her own downfall, as represented by the Polish prostitute, who carries out the murder in Lodz. The fact that Susan is stabbed low down in her stomach might also reflect the loss of the baby, perhaps through miscarriage ('she had a hole in her vagina wall').X's fantasies include an obsession about time ('9.45', 'after midnight') and numbers ('47') but the actual circumstances to which these refer are not known to us: we can only speculate. Whether or not she is Polish, or was married to a Polish husband, is also uncertain. However, we do not need to know all the biographical details to feel the anguish suffered by X.A tragic extra-marital affair, the breakdown of a marriage and the loss of a child are not uncommon events, although they certainly don't happen to everyone. They haven't happened to me. Yet Inland Empire gives its audience a powerful insight into the emotional state of someone living with the bereavement and despair involved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie that should have made history...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say that it is just as likely for a fly to land on sh!t as it is pie, and well the same can be said for Lynchian cinema. I have always hated reading critical responses of straight laced people and there views of David Lynch films. If you have no imagination and ability to wonder without a guided tour, than Lynch will never be your chef.Inland Empire suffers without this kind of help from the casual summer blockbuster fan. If you look back at the career of David Lynch you can see where he gets things very right and when he fails miserably. Two examples that come to mind are Wild at Heart and Fire Walk with me. In these instances it seemed like Lynch lost track of story telling and got caught up in the on set moment to moment artistry. Both examples struggle because the individual parts were stronger than the sum of the elements combined.Inland Empire unfortunately, is just that all over again. Wonderful in its moment to moment scenes and nearly unwatchable as a whole. If you were one of the many Lynch fans to eagerly jump for the midnight release of the DVD than you can see this point exactly. Watch the deleted material for Inlnd Empire, you will be treated to nearly an hour and a half of scenes that were cut. The funny thing is that much of this material is better than the film and much more pertinent to the story telling. It made me want to re-edit the film and create another story entirely and strange enough with this additional material it would be possible.I just think Lynch works best when he has a filter to run his ideas through and keep his story telling somewhat on track. As for Inland Empire, it is a film that I love and hate equally, a film with all of the potential and Lynchian elements to be haunting and beautiful. I catch myself watching this film hoping each time that it will get better or seem different. This is one of those films I really want to like. Inland Empire even in 2010 still continues do draw me in like a whirl pool of obsession, but in the end I feel like I just sat through a 3 hour film school, critiquing the film mostly for what it could have been. Unfortunately the real gems of this picture are in the moment to moment scenes and not the film as a whole. David Lynch and Laura Dern should never work together again, they have they might have the Polish gypsy curse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have enjoyed Lynch's Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive. After watching IE once, I do not know where I have ended. LH and MD are already confusing, but this one is just somewhere out there.Maybe that is what director David Lynch wanted to do. Maybe he also made a cinematographic multi-layered poem. That is actually where I have most of the problems with. I am not very good in understanding poetry, and when it gets longer and longer (IE, ca. 3 hours long), it gets also quite boring. I wish I had understood more, and as in poetry, you should go back to it, try to get a grab of it, but 3 hours... That is not so tempting.Lynch's style of making film is quite original, in modern cinema. However, you are able to find, similarities in other works in film history. But none of the films have really lost me right from the beginning. In IE the story is told in a way which are easier for others to follow, but some of the people are left by the road wondering, what the heck happened. That may be the reason, why some of the people love it, and others do not get it.I give Lynch's Inland Empire something from the mid-roads. I must say that these points go for Lynch, who has the courage to make such films. For the story, and the film itself, I give blank.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch unchained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the second time a couple of nights ago while watching it with my dad and I can tell you that watching it a second time brought not too many revelations of what the actual PLOT was but it did strengthen my idea that this is David Lynch's masterpiece.To paraphrase what my dad said, David Lynch takes things that happen to people that are traumatic and expresses them in an abstract and insane way. The reason for this is that when someone is going through something life-altering or traumatic they are usually driven to the brink of insanity. But we've been taught by society to bury this deep inside of ourselves. David Lynch, as an artist, expresses these feelings.There really is hardly a way to bring spoilers out in a review of this movie because everything is disconnected, yet perfectly interwoven, non-sequitor, yet the obvious replies, disturbing and beautiful, broken and assembled. It is so huge that it is nearly impossible to swallow it in one gulp, even two, as I learned. I have read that David Lynch had to cut several of his other movie's running time down for one reason or another, but as David Lynch discovered the freedom of Digital Video, he freed himself to pack everything he's ever wanted to do into a folding, amazing, mammoth of a movie. Imagine if an urban epic like Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia was stripped to it's bare emotion and then buried deep within the shadow of your psyche. That is what Inland Empire is.The movie begins with a prologue about a shady Polish prostitution syndicate. It then shifts to Laura Dern as the actress Nikki Grace. She has an affair with the co-star of a movie she is working on which is a remake of a cursed movie. After that who knows what it is about in terms of plot. The only thing one can be sure of is that actions do have consequences. The scenes in which Laura Dern plays the other side of Nikki Grace, Sue, and tells Sue's life stories to the psychiatrist(or whoever that guy is) are some of the best examples of Laura Dern's superb acting ability, and this is the best role I have seen her in and she deserved that Best Actress nomination David Lynch campaigned for with a cow back in 2007.The movie takes you on a journey through total darkness and then ends with a redemption so excellently executed that although it reveals nothing as to what the plot is about on the surface, it raises you from a place of complete hopelessness and despair to a fantastical gladness that everyone(seemingly) made it through their night terrors unscathed.And, on top of all that, the movie has the most creative end credits I've ever seen.Final Rating 10 out of 10, this is David Lynch's masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire is truly an indescribable piece of art. David Lynch travels beyond the boundaries of what is considered film, much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001. Lynch perfects his surrealistic dreamscape style with Inland Empire.Lynch uses his cinematography as a means to transport the viewer into another world, giving the film an almost documentary look to it, through its use of lighting and framing of the subjects. Inland Empire is a recollection of a nightmare you dreamt the night before, vague fragmented memories, and blurred, terrifying images.What makes Inland Empire so memorizing and horrifying to watch is the nonsensical chaos of it all, the only thing you can be certain about in the uncertainty of what you'll see next. Your imagination is in a constant frenzy, frantically searching for something to latch onto and regain control. Lynch will occasionally utilize this thought process to his advantage, lulling the viewer into a feeling of safety, only to have it melt away seconds later as he escorts you deeper into his Hell.The film's score also plays a key role in creating the atmosphere, providing a dirty, grainy feel, the sharp noises making you feel uneasy, even in the moments of calm.Inland Empire is David Lynch's masterpiece; it's pure, unrestrained, psychological horror, it's 3 hours of hopelessness and terror, and you can't stop watching no matter how hard you try.</fullReview>

In previous films Lynch has been a master making the slow moments between actions create tension and interest - hanging on intriguing moments, this film just hung - and tortuously so.I think the idea of the fine line between role and reality which is presented in the film is interesting and has lots of potential, but in the end the film just felt like a mix and regurgitation of previous films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hoo Boy, what a stinker, but so bad it's good in parts. I love David Lynch and his various works, but that couldn't keep me from realizing this is a piece of poorly thought out trash. It's the sort of sloppy movie-making where they aren't 100% sure what everything in the script means either so they use the art of confusing imagery to try and distract you from the ever creeping realization that this is a really boring movie.PLOT: an actress married to a jealous husband gets a leading part in a movie with supposedly hunky leading man. Friction ensues, and the actress can't help noticing the script is starting to resemble her life.. is the script cursed? Brace yourself for continual attempts at dream sequences without any special effects other than lighting and location. The movie is forgiven somewhat for having ubiquitous D list T&amp;A strewn throughout the movie for no apparent reason other than it's awfully nice to look at. Unfortunately it's all PG and no real skin.FAILURE: this movie fails due to a very low budget feel, intentionally wooden acting, and completely confused attempts at being mysterious without really ever having an interesting mystery to speak of. It basically infers that the script is a portal of some kind but the special effects used to get that point across are so bad that it takes a lot of strength to sit through this whole thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not enjoy this movie. I understood most of the story line (not much of a line, but more of a time traveling scribble), and was able to follow most of the abstract and interpret it for what it was, but this movie just did NOT do it for me. I've seen thousands of films, and for as long as I've known his name, for some reason I'd not seen any of his films. This was my first Lynch film, and as such I had no expectations whatsoever.I felt fear, amusement, I jumped out of fright once, felt anxious, laughed a bit, and was otherwise bored and under stimulated. Very likely I will score it a 4, for the fact that regardless of the severe lack of a understandable plot, or decipherable sequencing, etc, the effective use of sounds, lighting, perspective, and more that drove me to FEEL something from the film was very, very well done.I don't watch trailers or read reviews before watching something new, so I had no idea what to expect. I wouldn't be surprised if someone says 'well you really have to see one or two of his other films to really understand and appreciate it', but, that's not true. It might acclimate me to his odd and original techniques and style, but unless this film, er, video, is tied to another by being part of a series or trilogy, it should be able to be judged fully and honestly without any prior exposure to the director's previous work.What I watched was, to me, the very near equivalent of a weird, bothersome, torturous half-nightmare, as well illustrated as one could possibly do so through the chosen medium. The confusion, the transformations, from one place to another, one person to another; it was very surreal. What I did not expect was that I would feel that such an experience was such a waste of my time. If I had woken at the end, rested at 7am from a good night's sleep and feeling a bit funny from the insane dream I had, I may have been just fine; I quite enjoy psychedelics and the insanity of my own dreams. Rather, I spent half the night on HIS dream, and feel I am a bit numb in the brain from the experience.I know that all of the film-school graduates may disagree with me, with him being a much loved director, but come on now, if this is beautiful art, then so are paintings of soup cans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch Unplugged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is an interesting character. He's been everywhere in the film department: from underground cult ("Eraserhead"), to classic watch-in-high school ("The Elephant Man"), to big-budget Hollywood ("Mulholland Dr."). But this new one, "Inland Empire", can't quite be categorized at all. It's surreal, experimental, it has big-budget movie stars, but yet it has all the makings of a cheap independent film. Perhaps that's the beauty of Lynch.I refuse to say how I interpret the film, because it's different for everyone. A clean cut explanation, as Lynch would say, destroys the experience of watching it. That said, don't go into this film with an expectation of "figuring it out", not only because it perhaps doesn't have a defined meaning, but also because over-analyzing a Lynch film is futile and destroys the world which you're about to be transported into. Some movies are made for pure entertainment (most these days are, whether it be to scare you, make you laugh, etc), while others are made with an underlying message (political, social, or whatever). Lynch does neither. What he does is create a different, surreal world for you to live in for the duration of the film. Sometimes this world is funny, or sometimes it's highly unsettling to the point of being terrifying, but that's the Lynchian world.That being said, I will say that this movie is his most non-linear, and is his hardest film to follow. But you don't have to follow it. Because it's not about narrative, it's about experience. We as humans naturally try to follow things in an understanding, linear way. But you gotta break yourself of that habit, and watch "Inland Empire", not to understand it, but to experience it."Inland Empire" is not for everyone. If your idea of a good movie is "Pirates of the Caribbean", or "Live Free or Die Hard", then you may not be ready for this film. Although, it's hard to say at all who would like or dislike it, since even some hard-core fans of Lynch dislike it. But "Inland Empire" is pure cinema, and David Lynch is one of the few filmmakers in this day and age who I believe are making true films.Anyways, if you do choose to see "Inland Empire", refuse any interpretation someone tries to give, and go into it cold turkey. Get yourself a drink, maybe a snack (although, this isn't quite the popcorn type of movie), watch it at night or in a dark room, and make sure there are no disturbances. Then just sit back, and let Lynch take the wheel. He'll take you into his world, and love it or hate it, you can say you've been there.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I had to reconsider what movies are for</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit that I am a big fan of Lynch and this is the first time I comment on something in the net. I could not resist commenting simply because this time I can not keep my fascination to my self.This is the best filmed material I have ever seen. In this short comment I will just try to add maybe a little bit of my understanding.To my mind this film is the closest to what I would call an art. Any viewer that would try to watch it with a perspective that a move is nothing but entertainment is bound not to like it. This film is not an entertainment. And indeed ask yourself what is the purpose of a movie as such? Inland empire is not just art, it is more than that. It is on a great scale and depth educating, and not just educating, it is giving the viewer direct experience. Experience of the structure of the self mind. I found this movie very meditative. I would call it art of meditation. We are so much used to fixed perception of reality, that have become addicted to it and that is the reason why many would not like it. This film will let the fixation lose. Reality is not fixed it is our mind that makes the perception fixed. Lynch is giving a powerful tool to experience dynamic perception you just have to be ready to accept the possibility that the reality might not be universally objective.Enjoy and be happy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snipping The Thread, Lynch Lets His Film Implode Into A Completely Unaware Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't and never have disliked David Lynch as a filmmaker. I like Blue Velvet very much. I think that is one of the most original and interesting movies of the 1980s or '90s. I like Mulholland Drive very very much. It was a very interesting, atmospheric, brilliant journey from the dream state to consciousness to dream and so on. But you see, despite all of the confusion and perplexity that was caused by many of Lynch's films, they were all held together by a thread of sensibility that made them coherent. Inland Empire begins that way and then decides to snip the thread.I'm not sure how much I like digital video cameras being such great resources for professional film-making these days, because that means that anybody can make a movie and thus it will be harder to discern the newcomers from talented to pure fluff material to self- indulgent to plain muddle-minded. I don't mean to be harsh. It's just that a lot of American movies are quite bad, and I feel that it's easy to mistake a particularly ambitious person or really someone who grew up wealthy with a lot of clout as the ones to choose to be our next individual new waves and generations that will further develop cinema when there are truly talented ones despite whether or not they have clout or business acumen. However, I found myself actually very pleased to see that a large-scale film by a name director could be made by way of digital video. It shows that movies can get somewhere in that medium and that Generation Y hasn't just been jerking off this whole time.I also thought Laura Dern gave a very impressive performance that takes hairpin turns sharper than nearly any other role I can recall, and she sucks up the character on the page and lets herself turn whatever shade she's just absorbed. Jeremy Irons is the other highlight of the cast, serving as the most refreshingly normal character and being very very enjoyably comfortable in his own skin in the role he plays, as if the character is very much like him.I am also very intrigued by the story as it opens and begins twisting and meshing into a very cerebral something else. However! Somewhere between the recollection of the family of rabbit people in sitcom form at the beginning awaiting connection to the rest of the events and Laura Dern's violent bursts out of character and into a series of deviant, angry, shy, false, and real personalities, I am severed from the tractor beam between the audience and the movie. The cast, though, still seems to know what they're doing, so the film either does mean something or they're giving doubly good performances by acting as if they are acting, fooling even the filmmakers and the audience as well as becoming someone else.In the end, when one is recalling the film, one only recalls a film that is more of a compilation of the director's work into a collage more than a film. When you're really watching, you know that there is a story being told, an actual story, but within the spinning wheels of Lynch's compulsion to be deliberately strange and cryptic in a way where he's giggling to himself and looking over his shoulder as he's writing it at the keyboard, the attention of the audience is released somewhat, at least to the point where we're now watching in a completely objective way because we're being left out. I'm starting to flirt with the idea that Lynch could be an indulgent filmmaker who enjoys toying with his audiences. I hope I'm proved wrong soon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not in the habit of commenting on a movie, but seeing the contradictory reviews in this forum wanted to add my personal view. When you dabble in the theater of absurd, what comes to the surface depends more on the subconscious than the intellect. What you're left with is more symbol than meaning. Like a Blake painting, there is surely more room in the world of cinema than often 3rd rate realism.At the captions at the end of the movie, I found myself laughing. And not just because of increasing anxiety throughout the movie (that made me shut my eyes during some scenes) was relaxed with the smallest hint of hope. What it left me was a nice "hmmm", that needn't necessarily be analyzed. Don't bother with the personality swaps, they won't make much sense, although the general flow of encounter, love, love lost, and redemption is not too hard to miss.When was the last time you were face to face with such a strong work?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a twisted masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like other David Lynch films, "Blue Velvet", "Eraserhead" this seduces the viewer into a 3 and a half hour bizarre nightmare that plays tricks on the audience. Laura Dern's performance is just absolutely riveting she carries the entire film, its all her, and without her it would not be as interesting. I had no idea what was about, I just knew from the poster its about a woman in trouble. And boy is that an understatement. Dern plays an actress excited about her new role in a love story epic, but her strange new neighbor warns her about evil and murder if she does the film. Dern ignores it, and does the film. But then after starting a steamy affair with her costar, she becomes catapulted into a bizarre and disturbing world she becomes different people. and becomes completely mixed up with time. the weird neighbor warned her, it all came true. she gets confused with whats a movie and whats reality. The end is shocking and you will get angry being by the masterful director. In some very bizarre and creepy moments with a talking bunnies family sitcom, you start to think Lynch is a lunatic and should seek mental health for his very demented thoughts. But never a less its brilliant and strange, and Lynch smartly fools the audience just like a magician does. A new masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far THE most beautiful movie ever made. I am not just saying that because I am an avid Lynch fan either. A lot of people questioned, and thought that his transition to video as opposed to film spoiled it in complete entirety, but I beg to differ. As far as visual elements go, the fact that it was shot on video is completely secondary to its power and virulent truth. The first Lynch film that truly captivated me was Mulholland Dr., ever since that has been my favorite film of all time, bar none, but this movie struck me in a different way. General narrative need not apply, and obvious plot actually breaks off from the mass here... but who cares. Any fan of David Lynch knows what to expect, seemingly, I knew what to expect with IE and my expectations were thrown out the door completely. It doesn't matter. Nothing really matters in Lynch world, but the sheer fact that it matters more than anything is what makes his films so amazing. It is impossible to decipher Lynch films, so just see it, please.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's most beautiful and haunting film yet...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire is without a doubt one of the most bizarre, yet beautiful David Lynch films that I've ever seen. It also had one of the most interesting plots I've seen in a Lynch film. Understandably, a lot of people aren't going to like this movie because it is far more fractured than the typical Lynch film, which makes his other work seem completely straightforward, and that is definitely a feat. Plus, it's quite long and most people barely have enough patience to get through an hour and a half of a typical Lynch-esquire story line. It was also completely terrifying. There were a lot of very amazing psychological scare scenes. I noticed that Lynch used some of the same Penderecki score that was used in Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, which was a lovely touch. Music like that should be utilized far more in horror and psychological suspense films. Another interesting addition was the behind the scenes featurette on the 2nd disc. It shows that David Lynch is a very passionate artist and filmmaker who knows EXACTLY what he wants and demands it from his cast and crew. He gets right in there and very enthusiastically describes everything he wants from his actors. There were a few interesting scenes where he loses his patience with Laura Dern. Ironically, some of their banter reminded me of the behind the scenes of the movie The Shining and the relationship between Stanley Kubrick and Shelley Duvall, only not quite to that degree. Regardless, it is definitely the type of movie that needs to be watched again and again in order to catch little bits that weren't noticed before. The bottom line is that David Lynch is a master storyteller and approaches his films in a completely unique and interesting way. This is why they seem so fractured and end up confounding so many people. However, if you are willing to open yourself up to it and have patience, you will be rewarded with a truly wonderful and haunting story that will stay with you for a long time after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For almost anyone but the most devout fan of David Lynch ("Blue Velvet," "Twin Peaks"), "Inland Empire" will be a very tough sell. It's just shy of three hours long (170 very long minutes), and seems to be about an actress who turns into someone else, lives through a nightmare that involves a family of either people in rabbit masks or people-sized rabbits, winds up on Hollywood Boulevard vomiting blood on her hands and knees, and then lives happily ever after in a song and dance number. Or maybe none of that. Or maybe 50 other things, too. I'll say it plainly: This is the single weirdest movie Lynch has ever made, and that, my friends, is saying something. But though many will disagree, the weirdness isn't just some old trick. There's a method to Lynch's surreal horror show, and just because I don't feel qualified to explain it doesn't mean I don't perceive it. But if that's not enough for you, consider that Laura Dern gives the performance(s) of a lifetime. This film is not for the faint of heart, but who ever wanted to be one of them?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Inland Empire" a bold work of artistic vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The latest film from legendary director David Lynch (Blue Velvet, Mulholland Dr.) invites the viewer to abandon all preconceived notions and expectations concerning film as a medium of storytelling. We're invited to be like Alice in Wonderland, tumbling down the rabbit hole into a world strange and unfamiliar. The world of "Inland Empire" exists entirely within the subconscious: a world populated by Freudian symbols where nothing is what it appears to be and time and space have no meaning. This is a world of dreams in which all semblance of plot and narrative is thrown out the window. "Inland Empire" works like a dream because it is a dream. Don't worry if this doesn't make any sense. Believe me when I say that this is probably the strangest movie ever made."Inland Empire" is the ultimate vanity project. For those unfamiliar with the director, David Lynch, all I can say is that he's unlike any other director working today. Lynch is the Salvador Dali of filmmakers: his medium is surrealism and his canvas is film. He's one of the most talented directors of his generation but also one of the most frustrating. The ultimate question concerning his artistic merit is this: are his films simply weird for weird sake or is there something more to it than meets the eye? In the case of "Inland Empire" I choose the latter. A Lynch film should be viewed as an abstract work of art: interpretations may vary but the feelings conveyed within are clear.The plot (what plot?) of "Inland Empire" is difficult to follow and more difficult to explain. We're introduced to a character named Nikki Grace (Laura Dern), an actress living in Hollywood who's hoping to be cast in a new movie. As she awaits a call from her agent, Nikki gets paid a visit by a mysterious woman who might be some kind of fortune teller. She warns Nikki that she might die if she gets the part and makes vague insinuations about other unfortunate events. When Nikki finally gets the lead in the movie, she finds herself falling in love with her co-star, Devon Berk (Justin Theroux). To complicate matters, the script is about an adulterous affair between the two leads. The problem for Nikki is that she finds her real life mirroring that of the character she's playing in a fictional film. Also, it is later revealed that the film she's shooting is a remake of a doomed Polish production which remained unfinished due to the murder of the two stars. The production of the movie appears to be cursed.The rest of the movie plays like a surrealist nightmare in which the line between thought and reality are never clear. The entire movie may, in fact, be a dream of Nikki's where she's forced to confront her own fears and insecurities as an actress. Or is it someone else's dream about an actress playing a woman in a film? Or is "Inland Empire" actually a movie within a movie: a film about the difficult of film-making? There's no easy answer here."Inland Empire" is full of startling images and unforgettable moments. At several points the film cuts to a group of talking rabbits who seem to inhabit the set of some bad television sitcom. The rabbits talk in deadpan voices as a laugh track interrupts the dialogue. Later a group of prostitutes cast in shadow recount the horrors and abuse they face on a daily basis. This scene is interrupted when the prostitutes randomly break out into song and dance as they perform "The Locomotion." No explanation is ever given as to why.Trying to figure out "Inland Empire" is like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube: no matter how hard you try to line things up, they never fit. Some viewers are likely to find "Inland Empire" an exasperating and frustrating experience. At three hours in length, "Inland Empire" is an intellectually challenging film. My recommendation is that you submit yourself to the film's epic weirdness: this is a puzzle that's worth figuring out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an abstract work, and should be reviewed as such; (as opposed to 'Wah, this doesn't make any sense.') Lynch utilizes the freedom of digital video to riff on the themes near and dear to his heart. The visual language is different from film, but this is a good thing; the results when a film maker tries to make video look like film are usually pretty terrible. Lynch chose the Sony pd170 camera because it is the best camera in low light, so he can just dive right into shadows. The thing can shoot in 1 lux, or the amount of light one candle emits from about 1 yard away, as opposed to a pro-sumer HD cam which needs about 7 lux to "see". The film is composed of many vignettes on the same themes: identity, and the malleability thereof; the psychological dangers of acting; voyeurism; mystery; seeing; dream logic; light and shadow, literally and metaphorically. What it all means is secondary to what it makes one feel. Its a quite visceral visual and aural experience. Lynch is I think the best film maker for showing the viewer rather than telling him. In other words, this work of art is best executed in the cinematic medium; it wouldn't work as a play or a novel or a painting. The performances (not just Dern's) are rich and multi-layered, as we now know Lynch views the universe vis a vis his practice of Transcendental Meditation and the interconnectedness of all things. He has said openly that large pieces of the film were written moments before filming and that the actors didn't know the whole picture when acting any particular scene. (A lot like life, eh?) Bottom line: this is one of Lynch's best, and probably the best work of art yet created in this medium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly I have to say that I have been desperately in love with David Lynch till I have seen Blue Velvet. So I am not going to be maybe totally objective, but on the other hand they are only 2 categories of Lynch's spectators - who adore him or hate him. I definitely enjoyed Inland Empire even if I think it was the strangest Lynch's movie. It was like the direct insight to his head, to his subconscious ideas. There was many levels and snippets of stories but one of them was for me the most significant: the idea of the "crime and punishment", especially for infidelity. I couldn't help to wonder whether Lynch was dealing in this movie with the women who had cheated on him. Laura Dern plays a women who is in kind of LIMBO where she has to pay "unpaid bill". The movie is also about trying to understand what's going on - I especially enjoyed this rabbit's "soap opera" where the rabbit with Naomi Wats' voice said: "I am going to find it out." So question could be: are we going to find it too or are we ready for the limbo?</fullReview>

It is, after all, overtly about the relationship between the movie and the observer, the actor and the performance, the watcher and the watched (and the watch).Laura Dern has done a fine work and probably this movie is her best.

		<fullReview>If I told you that David Lynch's Inland Empire was the best movie I have seen in the past few years, I would be lying. If I told you it was the worst I had seen in that same time frame, I would be lying. If I said I understood the film, I would be lying. If I said I was completely baffled by it, I would be lying. The film itself defies - and laughs in the face of - explanation or categorization. I sat down knowing a few Lynch movies (Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me) and left knowing those movies again and every movie ever made before them. For three hours I felt trapped in my seat, a viewer, a watcher, someone on the outside, someone on the inside, someone being watched and someone taunted and thanked all at once. I struggled to grasp the meaning of what was going on and the more I did the more I felt my control over the movie and its narrative slipping away. Around the time a group of people began singing and dancing to The Locomotion I gave up and realized I was lost in a turgid sea of images and stories, and that trying to swim with or against them would only cause me to drown in them. This is the point of the movie, I think. To wash us in our narrative expectations - but not just from one movie, from all movies - and to shock us with sudden jolts away from these expectations. Are the performances great? I cannot say. I couldn't tell when they were acting, when they were acting like people acting, and when they were simply people. I may sound lost, or pretentious, but that is the only way you can react to this movie. You will struggle with your own ability to explain just what you have seen, because what just happened was on a level of storytelling and movie-making that is not even in existence. It is cerebral, a barrage of images and actions and motions made to impress on us an idea and a world. I saw it, and walked out of the theater. I fear, however, that I will be forever trying to walk out of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>View 'Inland Empire' in Afghanistan!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just seen David Lynch's "Inland Empire", and first off must recommend to Lynch and friends that he arrange at once for a special international viewing at the US Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan -- there are videophiles there who screen cult films and who will appreciate the Afghan national premiere of this film, following from their experience viewing the Afghan national premieres of Eraserhead in 2004, and Blue Velvet and Lost Highway in 2005. That aside, the most important visual phenomena to note in the film (beyond the digital video distortion of the face of 'Visitor #1') is the presence of the rabbits. The rabbits. Sitcom rabbits, surreally posed as if on the 1950s set of 'I Love Lucy', with laughtrack included; the inherent symbolism is profound, and coherent. As codebreakers search for the enigmatic key to read new codes, so the rabbits must be read to view this film. Clearly, synthetic chemicals were involved in the making of this film, and I'm not talking about the digital video 'stock', as it were; the key to realizing this is the repeated presence of the rabbits. Lynch is clearly indulging in homage to that seminal cinematic masterpiece, 'Night of the Lupus' (not to be confused with Night of the Living Dead, nor Night Porter, nor even Night People, although the subliminal associations and references to these films are prolific and clearly self-evident). Reliable sources reveal the Golden Globes wanted to vote this three-hour opus 'Best Picture Viewed in the Reflection of a Automobile Hood Ornament', and who am I to disagree with this visceral groundswell opinion. I can only say that in future midnight presentations of "Eraserhead" at the Waverly/ 8th Street Playhouse venues in Greenwich Village, 'Inland Empire' must replace the venerable 'Asparagus' as the short before the main feature. For those who have seen 'Empire', this can be nothing other than self explanatory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off let it be known that I've seen this movie six times. INLAND EMPIRE absolutely demands multiple viewings. The first time out I felt the same way as the negative reviewers: the film is too long, too confusing, and too demanding. About halfway into it I gave up on trying to "follow" the story and just enjoyed the imagery. When to false ending happened (Lost Girl embraces with Nikki/Sue) I know that I had missed something, but I wasn't sure what. Then the there's the stupendous, exhilarating finale when the characters come together and dance to the Nina Simone song. The title of the film flashed on the screen one more time, and the three hours were over. I KNEW that I had missed something, and in subsequent viewings I began to really sense. Trying to experience it as a normal movie does not work. INLAND EMPIRE occurs in three different cycles of time: linear, circular and parallel. These cycles frequently cross over each other and blur into one another. Just like in one's dream, you are in many places at once without moving. I wonder about the audience members who walked out of the theater grumbling that it was pretentious. I wanted to ask them: are your dreams pretentious? Is your brain pretentious? Fifty years from now, people will look back on INLAND EMPIRE as being the movie that changed EVERYTHING about the art form. It is an utter masterpiece. By the way, you don't know what the deal is with the rabbits? Go back and re-read Alice in Wonderland and Alice through the Looking Glass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this superb, surrealist epic, David Lynch, and his fellow visionary, actress Laura Dern have firmly established themselves among the truly great geniuses of the moving image. Lynch has now earned his rightful place alongside Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Bunuel. Not so much a "movie" in the more traditional sense, as a surrealist work employing the devices of cinema, "Inland Empire" burrows further into the viewer's unconscious, bringing him/her further towards a sensory, mystical experience of one's own cosmology (as channeled through Lynch's) than almost any other picture before it. The movie watches you as much as you watch it. It is psychosis filmed from the inside; quantum-reality dreams and nightmares demonstrated, inscrutably, before one's eyes and ears. Lynch has previously attempted to film journeys through the rabbit-hole, with extremely entertaining and thought-provoking results. This time he made it through, and you are invited to see (and hear) the resulting footage in glorious, un-glossy Digital Video. I find it only tepidly interesting whether Mr. Lynch can actually account verbally for how this is done. If one believes, as I do, that certain great artists are in touch with larger realities than their own everyday, reductionist, analytical minds as they create their masterpieces, one should have no problem sinking back into a theater seat to take this 3-hour trip through the intricate, un- mapable, un-nameable dark passageways of a cinematic visionary's mind. If you dare, I recommend tuning your mind to receive this piece. Perhaps not a risk free venture - especially for those unaccustomed to such mind-travel - but then, visionary art never has been.

		<shortDescription>Empire built on sand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A perfect example of everything I find baffling about David Lynch, namely a man of obvious genius and vision who chooses to waste it on such mindless, masturbatory rubbish.The moments of beauty -- the needle on the record player, the nightmarish rabbits, the crying woman in the room -- are buried amid an empty blur of random images and nonsensical turns in the bend that lead only to exasperation and puzzlement. The characters are valueless and empty, allowing one no access to internal workings outside of disturbing visuals that have all the personal feeling of a schizophrenic's disassociated delusions.One does not glimpse into Laura Dern's soul and its too-human wrestling with a curse, or personal guilt and fear, one merely lifts the sod to take in what lay underneath -- the bugs and worms roiling in the ground, a well-known, and facile, Lynch motif from Blue Velvet.Like the insects, Dern's delusions are supposed to have deep meaning for the viewer. In Blue Velvet, the idea was the rot underneath the suburban dream; in Inland Empire, the visual hodgepodge is, one can assume, supposed to signify the curse, and perhaps various moral concepts -- guilt for her affair, fear of her husband, empathy with the other women etc. However, like the insects, the delusions are glib and too on-the-nose. They are also incredibly distracting in their broken and jagged chaos. One is reminded of the phrase from the statue in Amelie: "The fool looks at a finger that points at the sky." Sadly, the fool watching Inland Empire is left with little else to gaze upon; the droning sludge of the film's three hours (!?) makes even gazing at the finger an exercise in sheer will. There is also the possibility that what Lynch's finger is pointing at is simply an empty sky.An irritating film and a good reminder of why I feel Lynch is one of the most overrated and consistently disappointing directors alive today. Perhaps I am simply one of those unfortunate souls who is simply not smart enough to get Lynch. The fact I feel little in the way of loss or regret for this status tells me all I need to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst movie in the whole universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My vote -infinity/10. That's it. This is the worst movie ever. And David lynch is the worst director ever. I've watched lost highway and Mulholland drive both of which are Lynch's so called art works. And I didn't like them a bit. But they deserve at least -2/10 just because they used normal cameras. This movie used hand-held digital cameras that go inside the noses and mouths of the people whenever they start talking.Don't see this one even if someone promises to give you a thousand dollar in return.It's better to watch any other movie other than to watch this. I hope Lynch stops making films after this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hint: putting a picture frame around a stupid movie does not a non-stupid movie make.David Lynch has good visual ideas, and he is very good at committing visual ideas to film. What he lacks, in this movie at least, is patience, and discipline, and calmness.Just a wild guess, David, but: were you by any chance drinking less coffee (or drinking more booze and/or smoking more pot) during the filming of The Straight Story? Because that was an excellent movie.More of that, please, and less of the lazy DaDaist crapola.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My Least Favorite Lynch Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An actress's perception of reality becomes increasingly distorted as she finds herself falling for her co-star in a remake of an unfinished Polish production that was supposedly cursed.David Lynch is an inspiration for those who want to do their own thing. He started with some creepy, surreal short films, moved on to the bizarre "Eraserhead" and has made numerous strange films since, seemingly with little regard for what critics or box office receipts say. While he has done some stories that border on normal, there is always an element of the bizarre, and trying to make sense of a plot in a Lynch film is an intellectual landmine. I fell in love with Lynch after seeing "Lost Highway" and "Twin Peaks", but find it hard to justify my love."Inland Empire" continues the madness. Opening with a beautiful shot of a record player in black and white, then of a couple making love... we are soon greeted by a family of anthropomorphized rabbits, and two gentlemen having a discussion in some foreign language, apparently Polish. How any of these things are connected is unclear thus far, and that is only the first ten minutes of a three hour film. How well they make sense by the end is hard to say.The film goes "normal" after that, through we enter a world with odd camera angles, mismatched close-ups, and conversations that do not flow... a murder accusation, an agent on the telephone... and all words spoken in an unusual manner. Almost in an amateur way, but clearly professionals trying to be amateur, with emotions not matching the events. And then there is William H. Macy as an announcer...On top of already being a lengthy and interesting film, the DVD comes with a second disc with several hours of supplemental material. My only complaint is that, despite all this, the film only has subtitles available in French. I like subtitles. Maybe I am in the minority, but as a visual learner, I follow a story better when I can read along. And I cannot read French well.Lynch veteran Laura Dern stars (and co-produces), which is beneficial to the film, because she knows exactly what sort of weirdness Lynch is looking for. I think the film fails, or at least falls short, though. The running time is a bit too long and it is hard to stay focused for this length. Also, the film just does not seem to have enough. While starting out strong, it gets slow and monotonously as it carries on, and any intelligent point hidden in there is missed by the audience's boredom. I appreciated the inclusion of the randomness, such as the "Locomotion", but of all the Lynch films I have seen (which is many) this is my least favorite.If you must see every David Lynch film, see this film. If you can survive without that goal, do not see this film. I cannot recommend it to anyone except his biggest fans because everyone else will be lost, bored and leave with a lower opinion of the man than he deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gave up halfway through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story (what little there is of one) deals with an actress named Nikki Grace (Laura Dern). She's starring in a remake of a Polish film that was never finished because it was cursed. She starts falling for her costar Devin (Justin Theroux) and also starts losing her grip on reality in the process. She starts having some REAL vivid hallucinations...and that's when the movie falls apart.The hallucinations are (even for Lynch) weird and come totally out of left field. Some of them seem to have no relation to anything else in the movie and get annoying and downright boring. There's a lllooonnnggg conversation between a bunch of women that is virtually inaudible because of the noises on the soundtrack and they keep saying the same thing over and over again. When they started dancing to the song "The Locomation" (seriously) I gave up. It was just getting too dense and confusing to follow. And WHAT was it with the walking talking rabbits at the beginning??? On the good side it was great to watch (Lynch is a masterful director) and Dern was just superb in her role. If this picture had gotten a wide release she would have easily been nominated for an Academy Award. Theroux is drop dead handsome and just great as her costar. Irons seems to be having a whale of a time in his role. I didn't give this any stars because I didn't see the whole picture but what I saw had moments of brilliance and some great acting totally lost in a slow-moving and incomprehensible story. Maybe one day I'll go back and make it through the whole thing but, in this case, a little of Lynch goes a LONG way!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoyingly, Inland Empire Implodes Emphatically the more it wears on; offering a few shocks at items we cannot follow plus very few instances of narrative clarity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think David Lynch's Inland Empire is interesting for about an hour, but after about a third or so of its runtime and after we've jumped from one thing to another and back to something else before finishing on an item which I think was supposed to tie it all together but I'm not sure, the film looses sight. Here is a piece that will leap from people dressed in rabbit suits ironing and talking on the telephone whilst acting in a TV sitcom; to a look at somebody experiencing unrequited love; to a bunch of what I presume to be Polish gangsters doing what it is they do; to the tale about production of a film adapting a cursed fable and then onto something else entirely different in the slight hope you're still keeping up. Perhaps that's the point; perhaps nobody can keep up, much like in the vein of, who I think is the lead character in Laura Dern's Nikki Grace, cannot keep up with her world around her which is rapidly spiralling out of control; maybe that's the point: maybe it's all one big viewpoint of a film within a film from someone severely deranged.Whatever it is, it is interesting if only for a while. There is a point you zone out, a point in which everything collapses in on itself by way of the amount of stuff that Lynch continues to pile on top of you. Just as I was starting to figure out why it was that a certain rabbit in a mock TV sitcom was sitting on a sofa in a specific manner was linked to a Polish prostitute and the stalker on the set of a film production which is having a second crack at getting made, was I bombarded with a scene in which I was forced into calculating what binded a jam-like substance vomiting clown had in common with a troupe of dancing bikini-clad women.You can call it avant-garde, you can call it what you like; but the underlying message I got out of Inland Empire was that the world is a strange and disorientating place, and that it's alright to exist within it and be a little confused now and again. The film begins with some sort of footage resembling a mock-undercover trafficking documentary, the kind that sees the faces of those that are guilty blurred out as hidden cameras capture all the evidence the authorities need to put the people on screen in prison. From here, we jump to the crying eye of a Polish girl as she watches a television, in what seems to be a self-referential sequence linked to the capturing of one's gaze as she sits looking transfixed and evoking emotion over a number of rabbits pottering about on the TV screen, talking out of sync and evoking warm laughter from a diegetic audience despite not actually doing anything. Later, the room will revealed to be sort of connected to the wider (real?) world when Dern's character seems to stumble across it ? is the Polish girl aware of, or indeed actually watching, the plight of Dern's character within Inland Empire? Does that render Dern's fictional character a fictional character within a fictional piece? Most probably and not at all both at once.Dern's character is an actress called Nikki Grace, at least initially. When we first see her in the place she plies her trade, that being a studio set, we get some deliberately soppy romance genre-infused music as it becomes apparent her next project is an adaptation of a supposedly doomed piece of Polish literature; doomed in the sense it has an uncanny reputation in having whatever acting talent that plays its lead roles die mysteriously. Nikki must spend some time with actor and co-worker for the piece Devon Berk (Theroux), someone she unexpectedly falls in love with. At least I'm pretty sure this is what happens. There are only very few occasions Lynch informs you of what's actually going on, or provides you with stone wall occasions in which you think you know what's going on. Nikki's period of panic as she comes to terms with what she's done in spending the night with Devon is highlighted when the aforementioned sequence in a blood red drenched bedroom evokes terror amongst the audience when generic sensibilities of mockumentary and romance clash with an approach of pure avant-garde.Rather depressingly, Inland Empire is, I think, border-line nonsense which, in a somewhat merciful manner, does feel like it's actually about something at sporadic, intermittent times. There are occasions the film leads you into thinking you've sort of cracked what's going on, but, rather annoyingly, I think it takes more pleasure in pulling out the rug from beneath you more than it does in delivering a comprehensive film-watching experience for you. Sure, there were times I was unnerved but what I was unnerved at, I have no idea - any film can plunge the audience into the unknown with a digital video aesthetic; low-level lighting plus off the wall content and get a desired effect of sheer panic born out of ambiguity. I'm torn with the piece - I didn't hate Inland Empire; I cannot recommend it but then again, I cannot explain it although there are those that cannot either but give the go ahead in seeing it anyway. It's an ambitious piece; a piece that feigns as if you need your head tuned in at all times but might very well work just as well if the viewer is less attentive that first appears. I don't ask for a film-going experience to spell everything out for me, but I ask for a degree of clarity; and in Inland Empire there simply isn't that degree. It got people talking upon its first release in 2006, and it'll continue to get people talking more in time, but I wonder if anyone actually knows just what it is they're all talking about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of dark, obscure and non-linear films especially Lynch's work but I can not recommend Inland Empire.It is way too long and incoherent. Yes the film is artsy and I loved certain aspects and scenes but the connections between them was just to cavernous and obscure. I feel the acting was real and superb with a stand out performance by Laura Dern. But artsy-ness and great acting can carry a film so far and Inland Empire came up short. We all watch movies for different reasons but I believe we like to feel satisfied by some aspect of the film and this one left me with feelings of total dissatisfaction and remorse for viewing it. In my opinion Mulholland Drive was far superior in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A towering achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After countless viewings I have come to the conclusion that INLAND EMPIRE is not quite as masterful as Mulholland Drive. Why? INLAND EMPIRE (hereafter IE) is more abstract than its predecessor but not as intuitive, as demonstrated by the plurality of theories, most of which are wildly divergent. Conversely, there was a consensus (most of the time) about the dream aspect of Mulholland Drive (hereafter MD) and the supposed back story, which was more transparent than the one Lynch deliberately obscures in IE.While MD had a character we could empathize with in the guise of the Betty/Diane division, the dual identity of Nikki/Sue presented in IE is harder to grasp. Nikki doesn't endear us like Betty did in her wide-eyed innocence; while Sue is presented as a deeply disturbed, embittered woman, lacking in any redeeming features.The story of IE is not as intuitive to grasp as MD's. Little is known about the 'real' story and how it relates to the Lost Girl and Poland vis a vis Sue's consciousness, and we don't really know whose viewpoint is privileged. In MD, we knew Diane was the central stream of consciousness; in IE, it's deeply ambiguous whether or not the Lost Girl is projecting her life to Nikki/Sue or if it's the other way around. Lynchian fans may grasp this ambiguity as part of the film's appeal, but for viewers who like to find meaning(s) after countless viewings, it's deeply frustrating and unrewarding. Surely film should reward any viewer's patience, not stifle it? Technically, IE's digital video was a brave move for a director known for his visual flourishes and painterly approach to film. Mulholland Drive, without a doubt, is a visual feast and shows a masterful grasp of cinematography courtesy of Peter Demming. In IE the results are impressive but sadly inconsistent. The decision to film with hand-held DV cameras is well handled but there are times when there is a sense of technical ineptitude, where the camera is too jerky or out of focus in low-light, most notably in the torch scenes and the night scenes on Hollywood and Vine where Nikki sees Doris from afar hiding behind a tree for the first time. These are minor gripes. Only the most technically-minded person would notice themIn terms of editing, IE nearly matches MD. I can't think of any bad editing instances in MD, but in IE, there is a clear one that I was amazed Lynch/Mary Sweeney allowed. The edit in question is between the Nikki ('Damn this sound likes dialogue from our script") scene and the one in which Devon is told about the idiocy of the gypsy curse by Nikki's agent. When I saw this in the cinema, the transition was very abrupt, intensified by the music in the Nikki scene being cut to accommodate Nikki's agent in mid-flow. I sense this was a mistake and not intended, or perhaps it was, but it didn't feel right. This might be a minor gripe, but I expected perfection. Morever, the typically absurd Bucky J scene may provide light relief but does it really add anything to the film? The gibberish spoken by the bald-headed man on set was also baffling but something I half-expected, given Lynch's propensity for obscurantism.I also think MD is more of an honest film than IE. MD takes us on a journey through a tortured world of a deeply disturbed woman who cannot find salvation or the light, only the brief hope of unrequited love, brutally cut by the netherworld that is Silencio. Conversely, IE takes us on a torturous journey where salvation is about self-discovery and finding the light out of the darkness. It may be more positive than MD's silencio, but sweet it surely isn't. Was there anything sweet about Sue's life? The surprising credits sequence further mystifies the film. Why Sinnerman? Do they matter? Are they really part of the film. I wish he ahd ended with Polish poem on a sombre note. Sweet felt like a reckless riposte to a film that was even darker than Mulholland Drive and didn't feel quite right yet as an in-joke it might have worked.I enjoyed INLAND EMPIRE a lot. I still think it's a brilliant film, in the sense that it's Lynch's most ambitious film to date and one where he brings his dreamstate to narrative without the obvious conceit of the omnipresent dreamer. It develops and exceeds ideas in his earlier films. I just wish the film had ended before the credit sequence. To close, IE includes many scenes that exceed MD, but as a totality, it falls just short but not by that much. A towering achievement nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you don't get it... get out of the cinema and watch reality TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch's latest film comprises several different but related "realities." Those who say it's just a jumble of random scenes aren't paying attention. The numerous visual rhymes (for instance: a man with a huge ketchup stain on his belly in one scene, a woman dripping blood from her screwdriver-impaled stomach in another) and lines repeated by different characters in different contexts, like verbal leitmotifs, make up a complex web of interrelated, fractured narratives. Some say it's like a cubist painting, but it's more like a hypercube. Inland Empire is a mutlidimensional, trans-temporal maze, bewildering but endlessly intriguing. As usual with Lynch, dream logic dominates. But if Eraserhead is like one prolonged nightmare, Inland Empire is like an entire night of interconnected dreams condensed into three hours. There's nothing here that's as thrilling and strangely moving as the Club Silencio scene in Mulholland Drive, but overall I think I like Inland Empire a bit better. It's much more complex and even more amenable to multiple viewings. Although I doubt the film will ever quite reveal itself as a surprisingly understandable story the way Mulholland Drive does. Inland Empire is audacious, crazy and daring. Unfortunately, a lot of people, including a lot of Lynch fans, resent the film for it. But to me it adds up to a remarkable, truly innovative achievement.</fullReview>

"the little fairy tale in the land of nightmares"there is a story. a 'main' story. and you're taken in and out of it, back and forth in time, truth, legend, reality. somebody needs help, somebody is called to help, without understanding it. and to understand it she has to go through pain, suffering, madness, even lust, and finally - love.maybe 'the author' wants to wake you up, to disturb this too comfortable world you're living in, to throw in some nightmares and scares in order to make you act and feel alive. even if this 'kills' you, even if this changes you forever.with too many allusions, seemingly disconnected events, sub-stories and characters - this movie is hard to watch and understand. i'm glad that it ended 'happily' as this brought some relief to my troubled mind too :) all is good when it ends good, even if we don't understand what happened, we can feel that it's alright7/10peace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is not a film (which is not a bad thing)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion IE is more (much more!!) an artistic construction than a film. It should be projected in a Biennale art show and it would be a smash hit! But films are about stories. Stories which can be told in tops 1 paragraph. The way to tell a story makes a film a masterpiece or just crap! I 've read 6 different attempts to describe the plot of IE. They all failed. And they failed not because the people who wrote them were idiots, but because they had to describe a modern art exhibit. This is a job for art historians and critics. And they have to be very good!!! When you get out of the theater you get the right feeling but you can't explain it, why you feel this way and if that was the point of the film. Film-making is an art for the masses. If it was only for the cultivated people, there wouldn't be any theaters but only small rooms for 10 people and the ticket would be 500 EURO. This fact doesn't work only for blockbuster crap. We all have seen many films which were very spiritual and cultural and they had many tickets. But these movies worked on 2 levels. The first was a story for all the people to understand and the second was about the meaning of the film, which wasn't always the same for all. IE didn't have the first level, and it sultan't be criticized as a film. Excuse my bad English...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and so many people seem to capital letter H-A-T-E it. And then throw those over-used phrases around "pretentious" and "pseudo-intellectual"... when in reality it is absolutely INTELLECTUAL, not pseudo... Some things in this world ARE legitimately intellectual, ya know...I have a friend, who is very prominent in Hollywood, who I think sums up Hollywood's attitude toward David Lynch. When I was telling him how much I liked Inland Empire even though it was still confusing to me, he only had this to say, "Like Lynch himself even knows what it means. Get a story. Loser." Ah, Hollywood... But like I said, to dismiss it out of hand just seems, well, DUMB. Clearly, this is not an ordinary linear plot with boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back -- that much can be agreed upon. So then CLEARLY we are challenged to try and understand it in a different manner. One reviewer said it is CUBISM applied to a movie script. That is an interesting theory and seems the most likely after I have given it much thought; and it's better than trying to decipher it all as some private code of Lynch's, full of hidden meanings, color codes, etc...From wikipedia: CUBISM -- "the painting of a normal scene but so that it is viewed from multiple views while the positions of some of the parts are rotated or moved so that it is odd looking and scrambled. In cubist artworks, objects are broken up, analyzed, and re-assembled in an abstracted form ? instead of depicting objects from one viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context. Often the surfaces intersect at seemingly random angles presenting no coherent sense of depth."Well, with regard to character, plot, timeline, action and dialogue this is indeed what seems to occur in Inland Empire... AND, brilliantly enough, it appears that Lynch then applies cubism to the relation of the actor to the role, the actor to the movie, the movie to ITSELF and finally the relationship of the viewer to the movie itself AND to the very movie theatre he finds himself sitting in!It seems to me that the director is presenting a brand new concept in film-making and is doing it in, believe it or not, the most DIRECT way he possibly could. How ELSE would you present a vision of filmic cubism?? In this light, Inland Empire is something that has never been done before and also seems to be the culmination of Lynch's career to date. As in 'masterpiece'!So I say: Brilliant! And kinda lazy to simply 'hate'...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The evil directors do</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Disciples of David Lynch will know that his signature form of presentation is to fashion an emblazoned phallus from celluloid and angrily thrust it into the bottom of his audience. He gets away with it principally on account of the fact that he has the psychological measure of his fans, those introspective ghouls who think mainstream is a synonym for conformist and would abhor the notion that they might be ordinary enough to enjoy such fare as this would run in direct opposition to the lies they've told themselves since their abused childhood. Just as Lynch packages pretencion as art, his acolytes wear whatever he throws at them as genius. For them it's a perfect fit ? the wonderful fusion of auteur and cinephile. In reality its closer to how the hence man in Robocop wears his own skin having been subsumed by toxic waste. If Lynch is a genius, it's fair to say that the people who eulogise his work are not.I foreground my comments on Inland Empire with this because your enjoyment of it will be pinned to where on the 'I love Dave scale' you'd put yourself. If you wear your love of impenetrable, kooky, obscure movies like a badge, a sort of layered intelligence by proxy, then you'll love what he's done here. If you think Lynch can't tell a story and covers himself by knitting little visi-poems together then you won't find anything in Empire to change your mind.What struck me as my knees became heavy across its unfeasibly long running time was that I was looking at very sharp, very visceral piece of cinema that simultaneously hated itself and its subject matter. It's a sort of anti-film, shot on poor quality DV in a 2 fingered 'f*ck off and take your hand off my breasts', kind of rebuke to the smoothness of conventional cinematography. It's the right tool for the job because it contributes to the jarring, garish sense of disjuncture that runs through the whole thing like the name of a seaside town in a stick of rock. Half way through I temporarily lost my mind. There's no conventional narrative, no plot as such, no characters in the classic sense, just this nightmarish stream of false consciousness that leaps from situation to situation, made even less pleasant by the ambient hum and stylus scratch that backgrounds most scenes. If you ate an entire slab of blue cheese, smoked a mushroom and went to bed early, this is what your dream would look like.Lynch's previous, Mulholland Drive, trod similar ground ? the Hollywood Dream as a dehumanising, corn fed nightmare ? an environment that defecated into it's victims mouths when the menu promised caviar. But whereas Drive was sort of beautiful as well as unsettling, Inland Empire is like watching an episode of 'you've been framed' fronted by Myra Hindley. It's bloody hard work; occasionally unbearable, sometimes unremittingly tedious and the stuff in-between takes perverse pleasure in being as obscure as humanly possible. If you stick with it to the end you realise there is a structure and it does have a sort of circular logic (hence the stylus maybe?) but it's also ridden with touches that suggest an inevitable question. Is Lynch having us on here or what? A family of rabbits, a bloke who talks gibberish while waving his finger at you, Mary Steenburgen, subtitled English, the locomotion ? sometimes Inland Empire is so conspicuously weird that it's almost impossible to take seriously. I'd like to think Lynch knows what it's all about ? that really would make him a genius. If he doesn't he's done well to convince so many that a searing intelligence shapes this shapeless camcorder evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like David Lynch and the fact that you have to watch his movies at least 4 times before you even begin to understand what's going on, then you will love this film just as much I did. It is a truly strange film that twists and terrifies as it moves on.The trick is, to go in and watch it without expecting to understand it. If you just follow along with Laura Dern as she goes through all her bizarre troubles, you will be taken for a horrifying ride. Like most Lynch movies, it can be assumed that there is deeper meaning in the montage of images and actions?but it is not easily available to the viewer. I picked up many connections through the film about Hollywood life (it helps that I'm a filmmaker) but to each person it would mean something different.I give it an 8 out of ten because the acting is superb?especially considering that Lynch didn't really have a script up front. Also, I am not easily scared and I've never been freaked out by movie before this one. I was truly creeped out many times. The only real problem that I had with the movie was the film quality. For some strange reason he decided to shoot on some sort of DVC pro camera and it looks horrible. The grain works for some of the shots, but the bulk of it probably should have been in film?at the very least some junky 16mm.Go see this with no expectations and you will love it (if you like Lynch..)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first really bad David Lynch movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, let me say I'm a huge David Lynch fan. I've seen all of his movies, and most of them numerous times. There are two things which usually set his movies apart: 1. Beautiful imagery. Most of the frames from any David Lynch movie could be hung up as a well-done piece of art.2. Bizarre-yet-engaging storyline and acting.This movie had neither of these things. Instead, it had grainy digital prolonged closeups of actors cheeks and a truly inexplicable plot.I've heard that Lynch will only be shooting in digital from now on, but I hope this isn't true. I guess I never realized how important the first aspect of a Lynch film was to his movies in that, even if you find yourself totally not understanding anything that's going on, at least it LOOKS GREAT. Not so in this movie.I wonder what this movie would've been like in regular film. I imagine most of the shots would've been redone, and it probably would've been about half as long. Maybe it would've come out as something like Mulholland Drive, which was great, but I wouldn't necessarily want to see another Mulholland Drive.All in all, extremely disappointed. My girlfriend had to walk out of the room about half-way through. I stuck around because I was hoping there would be some kind of payoff.*****Possible spoiler***** The Dern character's pseudo-death scene at the end was interesting and something that only Lynch could or would really attempt to pull off. The prolonged and unappealing closeups using the digital camera almost served a purpose there, and it was an interesting scene. I still think it would've been 10x better if it had been shot using film.*****Summary***** People have been saying that this film is for Lynch fans only, but I doubt it. The film lacks most everything that makes a Lynch film great.PLEASE DITCH THE DIGITAL CAMERA David!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The art of David Lynch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just done a one-hour trip to watch this?Wow! And I mean wow?What a phenomenal piece of cinema this is and I wonder: can you be so amazed by a movie without knowing what it is about? "Sit back, relax; you're on a David Lynch film", Laura Dern said on an interview. Her co-star Justin Theroux also explained that it had become a game for them to figure out what the movie was about while shooting: "I think that even David can't tell you", he added. Cinema, making cinema, above all things, is an art; and David Lynch is one of cinema's greater artists. Ironic however, is that, if you watch his last film and you don't know who he is, you'll probably think it is the work of an amateur. "Inland Empire" is the work of a professional and, as Lynch himself puts it, "a story about a woman in trouble". That's all you need to know about the plot; then you have to watch carefully.I met a man named Scott at the screening and he told me that the viewer only appreciates David Lynch's movies if they are seen in a movie theater. True, because you're experiencing the director's mind during three hours of pure cinematographic magic. And that's a mind that includes a large number of characters in the most twisted of stories, with the richest handling of digital camera you'll see in a long time.Some audiences that watched the picture complained because they said the digital camera image didn't look good on the big screen. False, it looks beautiful. With the cheap camera in his hand, Lynch takes all the risks generating a lot of movement and shooting directly into the actor's faces. He goes from light to dark, he appears, disappears and reappears, he crafts the music and the sound design so well that it becomes another main character (you really have to watch that), turning an actual scene into some kind of music video; he goes through all the moods of cinema which are, in some ways, the moods of life. His script, written whenever a new idea came to him in a period of two and half years, is more than ever a work of patience. During the whole film, after one character talks, the other stares intensely and waits at least five or ten seconds to answer; there are lots of insightful looks, there's a lot of contemplative silence that becomes dreamlike and consequently scary. The script has a lot of fear that can make you jump off your seat and it also has a slight subtle humor that works as a refreshing breeze of air when apparently no one can breathe. Lynch's total freedom becomes clear with his own editing, which we realize he controlled a lot, inserting his vision to the viewer in an even stronger way.However, there's another driving force inside "Inland Empire"; and that's Laura Dern's fantastic performance. To say fantastic is to find one appropriate word that summarizes her tour-de-force portrayal. She's on screen in every scene, the camera is on her face all of the time and she doesn't look at it; not even once in three hours. Of course she's not supposed to look at the camera, but her work is so focused that she doesn't even turn her eyes at times; she seems to be somewhere else than in Lynch's set, somewhere beyond. She takes her character beyond every possible level and she does it almost entirely on her own, with few answers from the rest of the individuals. Maybe another word to describe her act is unforgettable.And so is "Inland Empire", in the good or the bad way for anyone: an unforgettable experience and, as Scott said to me; a movie that will be playing itself in your head after five days?Or even more. One more thing: don't even bother on trying to figure out the 'mystery' or the meaning of the plot and you'll be alright.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Really horrible experience. I saw many strange films, but this one... i didn't know if i should laugh or cry. Lost Highway is superb film, i didn't tried to understand it, but IE - this is not a movie, but total mismatch of silly scenes. Wasted time. Just because u don't understand it and everything is so strange, U cannot say it was good movie and u're gourmet. Horrible... There is nothing more to say about this movie, but IMDb say's, that my text is too short. So I have to write some add text. I saw this film at cinema, first 15 minutes looked good, but later I was ready to leave before ending. I hopped for something just a bit interesting and for some very very little sense, but nothing.... I felt like someone is laughing to my face... I hope, this is enough text.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's Biggest Homework Assignment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I would like to say that I did not make any final judgments until the credits began to roll. I did not enjoy this movie. I had already watched Lost Highway, and the collection of short films, so I figured I was prepared to watch another David Lynch film. I think the most problematic aspect of this motion picture is that it was in fact not film, but was shot on consumer miniDV. After working with it for several years, I loathe the format. If Inland Empire had just been a pilot, or a collection of test footage for an actual film, I could have appreciated that. However, I watched a three hour video that was to me, no better than a student "film" project. An 8mm or 16mm Inland Empire would have been much better.Through the whole thing, I was asking whether I should like it more than any other project of the same quality, just because David Lynch was the director. My decision was, "no." I enjoyed the challenges the he laid out in Lost Highway. I thought it was fun to be led on an endless trail of uncertainty. Perhaps I would have liked this movie more if it was shot on film, and if the production value was higher. However, after shooting three or four scenes, he should have changed course and switched to film.Although I dislike much of the movie and Mr. Lynch's decisions, I found a few points entertaining. I do not see it as a collection of random scenes, and I did again enjoy the challenge that Lynch presents with his difficult time lines and plots. I found it amusing that he included the Hollywood insider humor. At one point, I even considered that he shot on consumer DV to show his disdain for the Hollywood way, but I thought it detracted too much from the ideas he was presenting. Perhaps I just disagree with his approach to this video. The poor dialog and atrocious fake accents were almost unbearably annoying most of the time, as well. Wait a minute, this is one of Lynch's tricks, because you're actually watching a movie in a movie! Gotcha! If he was trying to strike up a discussion about how bad the movie was- on purpose- he succeeded.I will probably watch the movie again, just to check my thoughts, and I recommend that you watch it if you are considering. Don't make any judgments based on what I have said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch Punked Us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The problem with Inland Empire isn't that it's hard to understand. In fact, unlike many of Lynch's other films, Inland Empire puts it all out there for us to see, up front. This is a disquieting thing for most Lynch-o-philes, who think "oh no-- there must be something more... I just have to wait for things to gel or reveal themselves..." Well, the problem is that it turns out Inland Empire is just David Lynch running Canadian hog-wild with a digital video camera. Seriously, who gave him that? That was a Bad Idea. OK, it was a mixed-results idea: Lynch has certainly shown us a thing or two about cinematography in DV, but at the same time DV has essentially ruined his film-making process by allowing him more freedom that he should have... essentially giving him more than enough rope to hang himself with.This all becomes abundantly clear at the veeeery end (think credits) of the film when, through a shorthand juxtaposition of characters and tropes you realize: "holy sh--, David Lynch is mocking me! He is laughing his head off at the viewer's expense!" Briefly, Inland Empire can be summarized as: David Lynch plays around in a new medium by creating a quintessentially Lynchian film universe that is utterly boring because there's nothing new in it- he's just re-hashing old ground. But just when you start to feel sorry for the old guy, thinking maybe this is the best he can do any more, here comes the last-minute reveal that shows you that he's just having fun at your expense. Because he can. Because he's David m-f Lynch.Really, Inland Empire should have a subtitle: David Lynch Punks Us.Disclaimer: I'm not sorry I saw this film. If I knew now what I knew then, and was presented with the option to make the choice again, I'd probably still see it. I probably won't, however, willingly see it a second or third time, like I usually do with Lynch's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American icon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is a genius once again! He is the American Fellini. No one can take the subconscious and bring it into reality like him. No one can depict nightmarish childhood-like images with such accuracy and give such depth to the most simple seeming characters and objects. Lynch brings the world of film making and acting into a new perspective and lets the viewer interpret what they are actually seeing. Is there a plot, storyline, or script to one's dreams/reality? Do we all wake up every morning starring in our own movie? I think David Lynch wakes up and sees a movie within a movie happening all around him. Laura Dern does an amazing job playing multiple roles of the same person and at times seems like Lynch's female on-screen persona. I wish I could say I smelled an Oscar for best picture but I know how Hollywood is (apparantly so does Lynch). Hey Kubrick never won an Oscar either but that didn't stop him! I can only hope Lynch makes many more films to come. I will always see a David Lynch film without even knowing anything about it (like I saw this one) because I am never denied a thought-provoking experience with a who's-who cast of new and old. Advice: use the restroom before seeing this movie. It's over three hours long!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's worst film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the masterpiece that was Mullholland Drive, comes Inland Empire, David Lynch's worst film. The first half hour is semi-coherent, as Laura Dern plays an actress living in a very wealthy mansion (and with a very jealous husband) set to star in some film. Her costar is Justin Theroux and the director Jeremy Irons. The feature seems to have been made in the past, but it was reportedly stopped after its main actors were murdered. This is the start, and as the half hour approaches, the films collapses into absurdity, full of unconnected surreal vignettes that test the patience of the audience. For instance, Dern's character suddenly becomes a street hooker (is the actress dreaming she was a hooker or is it the other way around? does anybody cares?). And don't ask about the meaning of the rabbits or polish angle of the film. As a twenty minute short, this material might be OK, but as a three hour feature this is simply unbearable. Even Lynch's previous bizarre feasts (Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks, Lost Highway) look like a model of lineal clarity as compared to this. Heck, even Dune was a better film than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inland Empire is one of the best films I have ever seen! It's classic lynch times like 45. It's a whole new look and new ideas. I don't think I have ever experienced all those emotions in just three hours. I went from laughing to feeling extremely sad and then extremely scared. I can't begin to tell you what is about. I guess I can say it's about a woman who is trapped in different worlds and they all come together in a crazy scary as hell way. I think everyone will get their own conclusion about it. Check it out! It's an emotional roller-coaster all the way. I really hope Laura Dern receives an Oscar for this film. I am still amazed at what I saw. I don't think I will ever get out of my head some of the things that I have seen in that film. He is an absolute genius.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sublime David lynch high</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"its about a woman in trouble" for at least two years this was all anyone knew about the basic premise of David lynch's new masterpiece.Some spoiler info to follow Some other bits and pieces were known such as the people in the cast which grew and grew as the running time did. Laura dern in one of the best roles that anyone has ever been able to give due to the fact that she trusts lynch completely. justin thereoux plays her costar in the movie within the movie. For the first hour or so the movie is everything that we've come to expect from lynch. Odd little monologues including one from grace zabriskie as dern's neighbor who seems to know a lot more about the movie that she wants to get a role in. She pretty much lays out the basic road map to trying to figure out what is going on but this didn't really help me. Like any other lynch movie before i didn't really care. The zabriski sequence ends and dern gets the role. After a mysterious person is seen during a read through of the script and somehow disappears its revealed that the film they're working on is in fact a remake of one that was never finished. The two leads were murdered and the film was deemed cursed but dern and thereoux's characters decide to start filming anyway. There are several funny moments during the first forty five minutes including a voice cameo that can be no other than Lynch that has to be heard to be believed. After this however the building paranoia Dern feels that her menacing husband will find out about a developing relationship with thereoux seems to blend her perception of what is real and what is not and the story and dern's character drastically changes. For the next two hours we witness a woman change and her life become a living hell. A subplot that seems to be the original movie that they were remaking is interspersed into the other various story lines. Its hard to say at any point in these two hours and forty five minutes what exactly is going on. if its a series of story lines from cursed movies and dern being sucked into them one by one. The running time is 8 minutes shy of the three hour mark and lynch takes advantage of every minute. one of the best musical sequences i have ever witnessed was probably well into the second hour with derns character looking like shes been through hell and lost in something that only the twilight hours walking down sunset on the walk of fame and seeing every seedy aspect of it can create. The camera creates a sense of disorientation and a song performed by beck called black tambourine engulfs the seedy atmosphere. it was one of the most surreal, perfect moments because just a few hours before i was walking down that same walk.If I'm not mistaken the five minute song is used in its entirety. shortly after this there's another disturbing sequence that has one of the most memorable, bizarre lynch inspired dialogs ever put on film or in this case dv.(I'll get to that later). I say inspired because i think at least some of it was improvised. Lynch allows the characters acquire a sense of believability while the camera picks up every line and become a signature scene that will be long remembered. Its not that the dialog is disturbing, its that the three people are having a conversation while something incredibly horrible is happening right before them and they accept it as an ordinary event happening on an ordinary night. In some ways we the audience accept it as inevitable as to what has been foreshadowed. It seems that this is going to be the last scene of the movie and in some ways it is but the story isn't quite finished. Lynch has more to say and creates the best sense of finality to any one of his movies or any other movie I have ever seen. The only criticism i have is of the ending credits which has one of the most insane musical numbers i have ever seen but doesn't seem wholly appropriate but who am i to question lynch's genius?Note: I am a strong believer that there are no good or bad David lynch movies only good or bad experiences. You may or may not agree but in many cases the experience always changes so i tried to entice with commenting on sequences that affected me more than others even if their significance is minimal.</fullReview>

It feels like it was just thrown together with scraps of 'art' posted on You Tube and non sequitur scenes edited together like some kind of cinematic Frankenstein monster. None of it makes any sense. Nothing about it serves any purpose. And the only thing I felt watching it was; cheated. Again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about transmigrations of dharmas and fragmented self-experiences in the collective dream of maya that happens in the opening of the spirit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch avoided disclosing his own intentions (I assume it is a part of the school of filmmaking that is based on a viewer's response and avoids providing pre-given interpretations to viewers); but he did refer to the Upanishads at some points, saying: "We are like the spider. We weave our life and then move along in it. We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives in the dream. This is true for the entire universe." Some people in the Internet found a translation from Mundaka Upanishad which says the similar thing: "As the spider creates the cobweb out of its saliva, it lives and plays in it and at the end the same spider swallows up the cobweb, similarly the God, the Lord creates the whole universe as the act of His thought. He manifests in it and again He withdraws the whole universe in Himself."I believe that INLAND EMPIRE is a riddle or koan which has keys to its resolution. I think those who intuitively embraced the keys managed to have their viewer experience transformed and allowed the film experience to transform them. It's definitely a difficult movie to watch and I saw people stopping watching it precisely at some points before the end of the second hour. I am sure that we can be sure to say that INLAND EMPIRE to a great, probably predominant extent is about transmigrations of dharmas and fragmented self-experiences in the collective dream of maya that happens in the opening of the spirit, the meaning of which can be adequately grasped only through a transpersonal state of consciousness (the state known as turiya or the Witness).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Missing the point</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch has quite the reputation, but with "Inland Empire" I think he is just missing the point. Indulging in one's whims might make for artistic freedom, but not necessarily for a good movie. And here Lynch discards film in favor of the hand-held digital camera, and also scripting in favor of semi-improvised takes. It doesn't work.His favorite technique of a storyline that loops around another storyline is repeated here for the third time (after "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Dr"). But those were good films; clear, despite their complexity, and pure in their aesthetics. "Inland Empire" instead is a mess. Three hours of Laura Dern walking in endless corridors, and of close-ups of her face looking scared and puzzled. A monumental performance? Not really.The various story lines are unclear and unfocused, to the point that they do not warrant further investigation. Loss of identity, innocence, dreams within dreams, big bad Hollywood, yada yada yada. Yawn. If anything, what "Inland Empire" shows is the importance of the soundtrack. Various boring scenes are spiced up due to the usage of some amazing musical accompaniment. This would make for a nice video-clip then.Oh sure the art-house elite will love it. An auteur's piece, they'll say. What a shame that people are prepared to like such pretentious lazy nonsense just because it's a film by David Lynch. Coincidentally, Lynch has gone the businessman route lately, making his own line of coffee. Maybe you should focus on your future career, David?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch's world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't Lynch's masterpiece, but this is the film in which more vitality, more creativity and more personality that Eraserhead director has made. Far from any meaning or stereotype in which we can fit the plot, Lynch creates a story that rather than united by a script, their structure is made by a character and his feelings.Inland Empire doesn't have an ending or a beginning, all the film is a series of episodes one after another, connected by little details that make us participate in hobbies, dreams, realities, fantasies, hallucinations and allegories, of character or characters played by Laura Dern.She is a kind of Alice trapped in a realistic-imaginary world where her multiples facets and feelings are exposed to show us a fictional frustrated-done actress and lead us through a story whose only common thread is the way in which viewer faces every part of the film.I must admit that after reading "Catching the Big Fish" I could better understand the way in which Lynch structured this film, not only because of the chapter that he wrote about the movie and origin of Inland... but because after analyzing each book's chapters I can figure out that this movie is a digital summary of all his hobbies and fixations. This is the way in which he closes a circle opened with Eraserhead, and this is the beginning of a new point in the life of the filmmaker.This is the way of reinvent cinema whether we like it or not, this man is a cinema's visionary and I think that from now on we will see Lynch's movies more focused in emotions than in plots, because life by more understandable or incomprehensible is, it makes sense so we set up inside and this is the substance and form in Enland Empire.</fullReview>

I would think I had it, only to lose it with the next scene.My simple explanation is that we are Laura Dern, because her look of utter confusion that she has on her face for a majority of the movie is exactly what I was going through.But what I really think is that we were watching a movie of a woman (the brunette at the end) watching a movie that is a movie about the making of a movie (the Polish film).That being said, there are many scenes that have no explanation, but that is what one expects from a David Lynch film. I wanted to rated it higher, but being confused for 3 hours with nothing to so for it prevents me from rating it any higher.If you like weird, you will love this film.

		<fullReview>I think the best word to describe someone like David Lynch is just weird. It's true that he makes wonderful films every now and then, but this is not one of them. It is so disoriented (and not in the brilliant way Mulholland Drive and Twin Peaks were) that I could barely sit through this film. Sometimes Lynch makes you have these insightful, philosophical, and life-altering thoughts about reality and existence, and sometimes he makes you think that you're a lunatic for even trying to sit through and pay attention to one of his films. Guess which type of film this is?Sometimes Lynch is that brilliant, boldly experimental artist, and other times he is an off-the-barrel, gun-in-mouth loony-bin escapee. This film was so confusing, so weird, so why-in-god's-name-did-i-put-myself-through-that? that it was not artsy and new, but just plain bad. I don't even know how I managed to watch the film. I did enjoy the last about 30 minutes of the film, but that was seriously it. I loathed myself after I finished the movie - and usually I love Lynch! I just realised that perhaps I may have been a bit harsh on Lynch and less so on the film. It is the film that is a catastrophe, not Lynch. I love Lynch's weirdness, but this is not one of those times. Watch the film at your own discretion. How this happens to be one of the Lynch films that Ebert appreciated - when he hated Blue Velvet and The Elephant Man - escapes my mind completely. Ebert must've felt guilty about trashing Lynch in the past that he compensated by calling Lynch a genius from this film.</fullReview>

Lynch was introduced to digital cameras, he had nothing better to do, he had several ideas and themes, and thought " let's do something". If you watch the documentary "LYNCH" you will see when he calls the actors he doesn't know what to tell them about the movie. He calls Jeremy irons and tells him he's doing an experiment. He made the movie with no script. you can also see him playing with digital cameras. The movie looks so amateurish. it feels like the work of a 1st year film student who just bought a camera and is randomly shooting objects and people. This is digital filmmaking at its worst. Unlike Michael Mann's films lynch doesn't know how and when to use a digital camera. this gave him too much of a freedom. his thoughts are all over. Maybe if this was shot on film and there was a script it could have been special but unfortunately its no lost highway or mulholland drive. its 3 hours of random dialogue and images that lynch tries to connect but fails. I hope this isn't lynch's final film. He is one of the best directors out there but this is what happens when you shoot something unprepared and try to fix it later and call it art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inland Empire is an mix of horror stories that have inexplicably garnered the praises of many fans of Japanese cinema, thus earning itself an 8/10 average rating on IMDb. Unfortunately, the film simply doesn't deserve the high rating, and it most definitely does not deserve 164 minutes of anyone's time.As a horror feature, Inland Empire fails miserably. Quite literally, there is not one scene in any of this dreadful backfire that is even marginally disturbing. In fact, the attempted horror was so badly executed that it came off as comedic. Oooh, I'm scared. If anyone is looking for a few chills, stay far, far away from this one.The lack of horror is not compensated in the least with interesting dialogue or dramatic elements. The acting is not very good, and almost no interesting narrative occurs in the films 164 minutes. When one tries to find some kind of point or moral to these stories, one finds that there is very little actual content to warrant an objective conclusion. The filmmakers seemed intent on creating the most superficial, meaningless plot lines and characters possible. The motives for the supernatural entities are usually ambiguous. In addition, Inland Empire was just plain boring. And no, I don't mean slow-paced; I mean boring. Old Yeller was slow-paced, but interesting. Forrest Gump was slow-paced, but interesting. I could list another 100 deliberately-paced films that move slower than molasses in January, but were still riveting. Inland Empire is just boring.There's almost nothing in this film that's noteworthy, but the exception to this is its cinematography. The special effects were used well to create an otherworldly atmosphere, this is just window-dressing to an otherwise shallow, below-average film that is in the end not very entertaining at all.What annoys me the most is when defenders of this film claim that it is far superior to Asian horror films made during the past decade. Such a claim is totally misguided. Inland Empire has NONE of the masterful storytelling found in A Tale of Two Sisters (2003), NONE of the impending doom-like atmosphere of Kairo (2001), NONE of the creepiness or cleverness of Ju-on: The Grudge 2 (2003 theatrical), NONE of the interesting concepts found in Cure (1997), and NONE of the psychological contributions seen in Audition (1999), just to name a few. Basically, Inland Empire has NOTHING memorable whatsoever, while the Asian horror films of the past decade have just about EVERYTHING except the convenient luxury of being made before 1970 - a time where every Japanese movie was a "work of art" or a "masterpiece." Give me a break.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cinematic Nightmare of Epic Proportions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seriously think David Lynch may have gone to bed one night, had the scariest dream in the history of mankind, and then decided to document it.Inland Empire is a very difficult movie to watch. I've had the DVD since August of '07 and it still smells brand new inside because I've opened it and watched it only twice.It is really hard to mentally prepare to view this movie, so more than a review, this is a suggestion on how to view the film.Inland Empire begins as oddly as any Lynch film ever made. A young woman, who's face is blurred out, is led into a hotel room by a man who's face is blurred out. It's black and white, and they exchange some odd dialog in polish about how they're about to have sex.After their conversation, the shot becomes completely distorted and she begins saying "Where am I? I'm afraid." The next shot is in color and it's a girl crying, naked and watching a television with no reception. Then we cut to a shot of three people in rabbit suits who are discussing a secret in incoherent dialog and a very creepy laugh track.That's the random nature of this film.Mulholland Dr. took multiple viewing before I finally got it. It's now one of my top 10 favorites of all time. Inland Empire is 10x more difficult to understand than Mulholland Dr., but there is something there. I just haven't completely figured it out yet.But I'm getting there.This isn't a fun movie to watch, but it is a challenge, and a riddle, and so it can be fun if you like the challenge and feeling of power of choosing whatever you want the movie to be.If you feel it's about nothing, than that's exactly what it's about. If you feel it's about a young woman trapped in her subconscious, that's what it's about, etc.Tips for viewing...* Have a clear head when you watch this * Watch this during the day, because night will contribute to the scary nature of this film and distract you from what's going on * Don't try and figure it out while the movie is going on, because you won't * Soak up as much info as you can, possibly on back-to-back viewings and then try and fit all the pieces together * Remember Lynch's love of illusion and that what you see may not always be real Just take all the info and at the end try and figure it out. Soak up everything. If you try and figure it out while it's going on, you'll keep getting thrown off. Just look at it like you're figuring out a riddle, and the info you need to get it is coming in pieces.I'll give this movie a 10 for it's intrigue, and because I like the plot (What I believe the plot to be, anyway. ;) )</fullReview>

We float through time and different realities never exactly sure of where we are? reminding me a little of Goddard too? But WAY too long? and not enough THERE there.

		<fullReview>Normally I enjoy off-beat and unfathomable movies. This certainly fell into that category. But it was incredibly slow-moving and tedious. Lingering scenes of blank screen or repeated motifs, cheap and scary-movie bursts of loud music or screams into the camera to occasionally awake a sleeping and bored audience. A whole film-maker's bag of tricks of pseudo lead-ups to something, then going nowhere.I felt that I had been tricked into spending half a day (yes, half a day!) watching a director's tedious indulgence, with payoffs and existential meaning that could have been achieved in around an hour. Other directors have enough respect for their audiences to edit down a bit to at least keep interest up.The BIG irony is that this is supposed to an evocative, non-linear expression. Yet the audience is FORCED to watch it as a linear experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Huge Disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is one of my favorite directors. I've enjoyed every film he has ever done. "Eraserhead", "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway" remain 3 of my favorite works of Lynch. After the excitement of "Muholland Drive", I was anxiously awaiting for "Inland Empire". I must say I felt let down. "Inland Empire" is the story of Nicki Grace (Or at least one character of many stories) played by Laura Dern. Nicki is an actress who just got a role in a big Hollywood production. Little to her knowledge does she realize the film is a remake and the 2 lead actors from the original film were killed due to a Polish Gypsy curse put on the production. The first hour of "Inland Empire" had me glued to the screen. It started out beautifully, but the last 2 were a complete disaster. It had such a great cast, but I felt Juia Ormond, William H. Macy and Jeromy Irons weren't in it enough. So many amazing actors that weren't used to their full potential. There roles felt too brief. I admit, Grace Zebriskie was hilarious as the crazy Polish neighbor. Too bad we didn't see more of her. I enjoyed Laura Dern's outstanding performance and I liked the sitcom with the Rabbit head people. But beyond that, there wasn't much else. Interesting note, the Rabbit sequence was taken from one of Mr. Lynch's short films from his website called "Rabbits". I love surrealist cinema, but similar themes have been done before and much better in films like Luis Bunuel's flawless dark comedy, "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" (1972) and Shuji Terayama's forgotten masterpiece "Pastoral: To Die in the Country" (1974). More recently films like Andrzej Zulawski's "La Fidelite" (2000), and Sion Sono's disturbing "Strange Circus" (2005) remain unseen. Speaking of Polish films, Wojciech Has' multi-layered "The Hourglass Sanitorium" (1973) is an emotional puzzle worth figuring out. I feel these above films mentioned give more food for thought. Digital video usually looks pretty good, but "Inland Empire" is way to dark, sloppy and shaky. It looks like a bad experimental college film. Then again I think he was going for a raw look. I'd recommend the strange and somewhat similar low budget gems "Mad Cowgirl" (2006) or "The Three Trials" (2006) as great examples of what can be done with digital video. I love experimental films, but they either work or they don't. For example Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers" (1994) shows that a mainstream director can put together a visually stunning experimental work. The last 2 hours of "Inland Empire" feels like poorly shot random scenes thrown together with no coherent meaning. At least 3 short films were put into "Inland Empire" and it doesn't work. The rest of the movie was made up of things David Lynch wrote quickly before shooting. The outdoor barbecue scene and the prostitutes doing the locomotion were painful to watch. I still think Lynch had good intentions of trying something different, but fell short. If you want to see bizarre surrealist films that are not only visually stunning but with deep religious, philosophical and political meaning; check out the films of Alejendro Jodorowsky. Anchor Bay recently released Jodorowsky's films "El Topo" (1970) and "The Holy Mountain" (1973) in a box-set. I love you David, but please let this be a one time thing. Then again, my opinion could always change in the future?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1. You will be disorientated and confused the first time and probably the second time you see this film. I don't know if Lynch consciously tries for this effect or if it just happens. Eventually like magic after 2 or 3 viewings the film will suddenly come into focus.2. This film is a convergance of ideas, meaning, spiritual expositions, and emotions. There's a huge amount going on, but there's plenty of signposts that give hints so just open up and pay attention. I know I miss a lot of the meat of Lost Highway, a film I've watched dozens of times. Yet I get enough that the film is still satisfying to me. It took many viewings to get to the point where I am now with the film.3. If you don't understand the film and all its themes completely you're not meant to understand it. Just enjoy the mood and beautiful film-making.4. The bunny people are real</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Annoying.Does anyone know if David Lynch takes drugs regularly? Okay-- in its positive credit, the movie is artistically and visually appealing. The acting is superb.But-- if you want to show me a photograph of a tree, show it to me-- don't cut it up into a jigsaw puzzle, and waste 2-3/4 hours of my time, manipulatively feeding it to me in random order, and call it true creativity.As one reviewer states, you won't find the mystery solved-- it's supposed to be movie which is experienced. In other words, could it be said that it's just another David Lynch self-aggrandizing schizo-piece of work in which we are to be impressed, just because it's artistic and abstract? I experienced the movie. I experienced feelings of being annoyed and played-with. We all decided unanimously that we were simply annoyed with the movie, and in the ultimate outcome, we simply didn't care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe Lynch's best, depending on your point of view...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could argue that Inland Empire shows a full circle completed. Lynch started his career with the abstract dreamscape of Eraserhead and since then until about the early 90's has gradually tuned down his vision into more commercially digestible form. Arguably the peak came with his masterpiece Twin Peaks and its incredible success with the viewers. Since then though, after the savage mauling of his criminally underrated Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, he has been gradually been drawing the abstractions back into his work until now he seems to have gone back into Eraserhead territory. So is it any good?Well, it seems to me that the big question is - what the hell was that about? Well, I know the answer - nothing whatsoever. It doesn't make sense because it can't make sense - Lynch wrote the scripts on the day of filming and took numerous sources for the film from works completed years before. The Rabbits for example, were a short and rather creepy movie he placed on his website in 2002. Why he has integrated them into the film I don't know - but they work. And that's the thing; it may not make any sense, but it doesn't need to. When you look at a painting by Salvador Dali or Francis Bacon it doesn't make sense. Oh sure, there will always be people who will try and put meanings to the works, but that's always just an opinion - the paintings represent pure consciousness, a stream of thought in a reality which doesn't work like you think.In fact, that's the key to all of Lynch's films, especially IE - dream logic. You see, when you see most films with supposed "dream sequences" it never actually reflects a dream - they're always too logical, too coherent, too well put together. Lynch's films are not like this - they reflect the true dream logic, which is that you never know you are having a dream and everything makes sense to those inside the dream. IE fucntions to this logic throughout. It is pure thought.Right, now that the pretentious crap's over I'll get to the easier to digest facts about the film - firstly, it's the scariest film ever made. It's true that nothing in the world can scare you as much as a nightmare - it acts upon your basic instincts. Well, that's what IE does, more than even Eraserhead. Not to mention there's a scene towards the end which I won't give away that genuinely almost made me crap myself. I have never been given such a fright by any other film ever. I almost felt like I wanted the film to hurry up and end I was so freaked out.Another thing - the acting is absolutely fabulous by all concerned, but in particular Laura Dern - Lynch once said she was his favourite actress and you can see why. You'll never see a more disturbing or tragic performance given by any other actress for a long time.And of course it goes without saying that Lynch has all his trademarks in place - Red drapes, little dudes, flashing lights - but even more interesting is his use of Digital Video - some fans expressed complaints, but I have to say it makes the film all the more dream-like and it also gives him much more room for picture manipulation. It's perhaps the most beautiful film I have ever seen, if not in the traditional sense. One more thing - he makes a lot of references to his other films; remember the monkey from Twin Peaks:FWWM? Well...To conclude, if you're a Lynch fan and you haven;t seen this you need to be tazered - if you're not, well I wouldn't suggest making this your first film of his; it may throw you off a bit.Still, the best film of the millennium so far. Ya dig?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant yet deeply, deeply boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Inland Empire begins with a great scene - one of the best Lynch has directed. Film star Laura Dern receives a mysterious guest (Grace Zabriskie) who starts to ask questions about Dern's latest film. It's as funny as it is unsettling and Zabriskie gives a truly amazing performance. Occasionally she'll hold words back as if stopping herself from giving away too much information, or perhaps saying something very unpleasant. For the next half hour we seem to get the basic plot - the Dern film is a remake of a Polish original which has some strange history, is perhaps cursed. It seems an intellectual occult thriller like, for example, Foucault's Pendulum.But then the film becomes...well a word like 'fractured' undersells it. It's a collection of more or less random scenes which could unfold in any order and make as much - or as little - sense. There's a discredited theory which states that for a film to be successful you have to 'care' for the characters. Obviously you don't - but you do have to have some idea of their motivation, or the sense of what they're saying or how they feel about other characters. Even after two hours of the film Dern could walk into a room and you could have no idea who she is, where she is, why she's there or who the other people are (even though they, like Dern, have appeared before). One very much proved theory is that there is nothing more boring than someone recounting their dreams. "Well I was in a plane except it wasn't really a plane...it was my kitchen! And then I picked up an apple and my Mum came in and said I should put it in the fridge, so I did but I then realised etc etc etc." Inland Empire is three hours of someone recounting a meaningless dream and it's boring. It's excruciating. I lost the will to live and died literally twice during its running time.That's not to say the film doesn't have flashes of brilliance. No one does rooms like Lynch. He can make Deco furniture sinister, an emerald bedspread radiate pure evil. The rabbit sitcom room (oh, don't ask) is somehow like a vision of hell even though it's just...a room. And the vaguely industrial hum on most of the soundtrack is a great way of notching up the dread factor. But by the end I was thinking that if there was another shot of Dern running up some dark corridor to find something strange at its end (a roomful of whores, a fat-faced sweaty man, a cinema showing Inland Empire, a room with a man and a gun...the list is endless) I may start to cry.I think the film may come into its own when it's released on DVD. Lynch has, in effect, supplied the audience with a movie's raw footage which we can import into iMovie and then cut into our own version. Simple maths shows there are many billions of ways of assembling as few as 50 shots, and Inland Empire has a lot more than 50 shots. Some people will recut the whole 3 hours, others will give us a more manageable 90 mins. Someone will just give us the uncut rabbit sitcom and nothing else. If I could face watching it again even I'd want to maybe give it a go.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge David Lynch fan I was looking forward to this film enormously. After the majesty of Mulholland Drive what would Inland Empire be like? Well, the truth is I'm still not sure. However, it's only fair to acknowledge that I am somewhat disappointed.I'll start by admitting that I have no clue as to what this movie was about. Early on I lost the plot but figured I would roll with the punch and enjoy the ride. The lack of understanding wasn't something that I was so worried about. However, make no mistake, this is no Lost Highway or Mulholland Drive; films that do not make full sense on first viewing but which captivate the viewer nevertheless through their seductive execution. No, Inland Empire is an entirely different beast. It's one of the least commercial movies you are ever liable to see made by a name director. And while this in itself is a commendable thing, I could not help but find it all a somewhat frustrating viewing experience.The most obvious problem is the running time. 3 hours is very excessive for this film. I could not help but think this could've been edited down to a much more rewarding 90 minute movie. I think that the freedom that digital video has given Lynch has conversely compromised his film-making in that he has lost all discipline. A full-on no-holds-barred Lynchian work of art is, in theory, a great idea but it became increasingly obvious as this movie dragged on that he benefits far more from weaving his magic around a project with a tighter focus, the beautifully constructed dream logic of Mulholland Drive, for instance. Inland Empire, by comparison, is unfocused and unengaging. And to make matters worse, there really are very few moments of pure genius here that can be found in all his other work and that are a justification in themselves.On the plus side, this film does have a feeling all of its own. The atmosphere really works at times. He still uses music well as a direct accompaniment to events on screen. And this does lend itself well to the feeling of the movie. The acting is very detached - imagine Patricia Arquette and Bill Pullman's early exchanges in Lost Highway stretched out for 3 hours! ? but Laura Dern is very good in what must've been an extremely baffling role for an actor to tackle.And I liked the rabbits.This review is just an initial impression. I am unable to include very much analysis of meaning as I genuinely was perplexed on first viewing. I really, really wanted to like this but I just simply cannot ignore my reservations. Despite all this, I will definitely revisit Inland Empire on DVD. I am sure that there is more to it and am willing to reassess. I may even post a follow up review when that day comes. But for the moment I remain a little underwhelmed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What This Movie Is Really About...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To paraphrase a joke, what this movie is really about is...about 3 hours. The first thing anyone wants to know about "Inland Empire" it seems is, does it have a "meaning," a puzzle piece missing that, once you have it, makes the movie easier to understand?As far as understanding, you can't describe the "plot" of "Inland Empire." Other reviewers have given detailed accounts of what "happens," and that's about the best you can do with the material.What "happens" is that David Lynch turns on his camera and sets it in front of people and things, then cuts the images he recorded together in a way that pleases him. Self-indulgent movie-making is nothing new. Goddard was hailed by many as a genius for doing something similar with his films in the 60's and early 70's. So were Fellini and Bergman. Bunuel and Dali did it as far back as the silent era, Ken Russell and a host of others, including Woody Allen, have dabbled in this technique to this day, with varying degrees of success The truth is, it's very freeing to do "abstract" art, from the standpoint of the creator of the art. Whether the art created is something the public will enjoy is something a true abstract artist can't be concerned with...it's at complete odds with the concept of abstraction. If he "looks down" he might fall when he realizes that his art really only reflects that he was too lazy or untalented to create something more accessible.I'm glad Lynch created "Inland Empire." When Lynch is good he is very good indeed. There are many moments in "Empire" that resemble the "monster behind the restaurant" sequence in "Mullholland Drive"; small, isolated moments within a greater whole that are satisfying on their own and summon up the full spectrum of emotion. The film is frustrating, irritating, funny, moving, scary and sad all at the same time, and parts of it race directly for the deeper parts of your brain pan...and will stay there, whether you let them or not.The night I saw the film about 20% of the audience left around the two hour mark, and I don't blame them. It IS long and self indulgent...many of the shots look as if Lynch, rather than going to the bother of working hard on coming up with a solid, entertaining script, literally said to Laura Dern, "Let's go out back and shoot more of the movie...OK, in this scene you are (yet again) really scared, crying and screaming! Action!" Worse, he continually teases the audience with hints of a deeper meaning or a "real" story underneath the fever dream. But just when you settle down and get comfortable suddenly he cuts away, as if his Ritalin has suddenly worn off and he's lost interest in what he was doing. It's a challenge Lynch sets up. How long can you free fall without the safety net of traditional storytelling? "Empire" really does look a lot like someone's over-wrought film-school thesis...but isn't that what "Eraserhead" was? And that movie is now a classic. Time will tell about "Empire," of course.But is it any good? I admit I'm disappointed in the film visually. It was easy to forgive the obscure "story" of "Eraserhead" because that film was so fascinating visually (and aurally) it drew you back, and the more recent Lynch films are similar. "Empire" has several memorable moments in its epic running time, but nothing to rival the set pieces the director has become famous for. It's a small film and the rewards do come but only if you are extremely patient (the "Locomotion," an alarming "pop out" gag in a hallway near the film's end, Laura Dern on the streets of Hollywood, the end credits). Everyone will take something different away from the movie and Lynch probably would be happy with this; he set up the world and inhabited it...you make sense of it.And if that's what he wanted, if this film is truly meant to be explored and interpreted in any way the viewer chooses, like a painting by Magritte or Dali, it works fantastically. Like a dream, it can possibly be "explained" but only, truly, by the dreamer himself who actually FELT the dream. The rest of us have to content ourselves with interpreting what he shares with us to describe what he saw and how it felt; our interpretation can only be based on shared symbols we all agree upon. If, in fact, Lynch wants us to find a "story" in his movie, a beginning, middle and end that you have to work out like a puzzle...he's failed miserably, and the work has to be deemed amateurish, indulgent, ugly and slightly sad--the ultimate joke being that the movie is little more than a mental j.o.-fest that he's asking us to pay admission to see, because we so remember the joy of his midgets, log ladies, foul-mouthed pervert villains and Naomi Watts as a bitter lesbian. There have been many writers and filmmakers (and musicians) who are content to create for the sake of creation, without rules, and know that there IS meaning there, somehow, simply because the work exists. However, most of them are young and lack any sense of artistic discipline, they haven't "earned" the right to place a can of soup in the middle of a floor and call it art. In any other director's hands, "Empire" would probably be like a lot of disgruntled viewers are probably thinking it is...a meandering mess that goes on too long and waste's the viewer's time and money. However, I personally don't mind going for a ride with Lynch, even if there's no ultimate destination. Can you enjoy working on a puzzle that has no square edges, and some of the pieces actually missing? If you can, you'll enjoy this movie a lot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The bulk of that line refers to a quote from the film Inland Empire- spoken in a cameo by William H. Macy as a TV show announcer- and one might be tempted to use that as the template to try and 'figure out' what happens through the course of the film's three hours. It is indeed, especially on a second viewing, the most intriguing and useful theme for what goes on with the character of Nikki (or Sue, depending on the scene or mood of the moment), as she goes through what can be described as, well, indescribable. But the line is helpful to look at what director David Lynch is most after and interested by with the film- dream logic. More over, the dream logic of life, and how it relates to the cinema, and to perceptions, and to, as the tag-line suggests, "a woman in trouble." But all of this still can't really help me, even on a second viewing, give at all an idea of what to expect with Inland Empire. It's a dense, ambitious, graceful, crude, ambiguous, and flawed work of the highest order of abstractions put together into one big Lynchian package. And don't forget the rabbits with that.The first time I saw the film, I was more swept up into the emotional mix &amp; match that Lynch threw up on the screen, and by the immensity of how beautiful he was able to put everything together through his DV camera (like with Eraserhead, he plays with a form that is difficult in some ways, but inviting and exciting in others). The second time, I thought that it could be another excursion as Mulholland Drive was, where I could focus more on piecing whatever the hell kind of puzzle Lynch put up for the audience to possibly figure out. About half an hour into the film, however, I realized it was an act of futility to 'figure it out', at least in any conventional sense. But this is not necessarily a bad thing, even if it leaves the audience sharply divided as to take it: the greatest mind-bender of the new millennium, or the pretentious ramblings of a director un-hinged? I maybe went more with the former, even as I could understand the latter; it allows so much thought to come out of what happens in terms of characters' behaviors, of themes that emerge, and what might *seem* to come together when it really doesn't. What it lacks in narrative flow it makes up for with an originality in delving into personality, and what personality even means.At first it might seem as if there's a simple story here- Laura Dern as Nikki gets the part she's been waiting for, in a film by the great director Kingsley (Jeremy Irons), and with a fine co-star (Justin Theroux, even better here than in Mulholland). The actors find out though in a moment of confession from Kingsley that the project they're about to work on is technically a remake of an unfinished film where on the project the two main stars were killed, as there was a kind of 'curse' on the project called "47". It isn't long after this that Inland Empire gets even weirder than before, but by weird will be totally subjective to the viewer (and may depend as well on how much you're familiar with Lynch's world- or thought you knew what it could hold). Lynch then submerges Dern's character(s) into a landscape of suffering and bewilderment, where sub-plots possibly emerge involving a Polish circus, a murder via screwdriver, a "sitcom" TV show involving rabbits on a couch, and Nikki/Sue caught up in the maelstrom of an abusive downfall.A lot of this madness that comes through in Lynch's style, which is as audacious and remarkable and totally mesmerizing as it is going almost over the edge with its delirious need to push the dream logic and surrealism to its limits, could not be completely of worth without Laura Dern, who in particular is almost on equal footing of Lynch with heart and soul poured in. As required for looking at what it means to be an actress, or what it means to be a person, or to have a reality shattered by various un-realities, Dern is always perfect in relaying her emotions, however intense or drained or shocked or horrified they may be (or, sometimes too, of just listening to someone, like in that wonderfully batty scene shared with Grace Zabriskie as a 'neighbor'). It's probably the pinnacle of her career thus far, with everything she's ever either hinted at or shown as an actress up till now thrown up on the screen to match up with the wild demands of Lynch's own mind-set. It won't win an Oscar for her, but she should at least get a nomination, if it even means anything at this point. In a sense, this IS what acting is all about, at least for the sake of what Nikki has to do to play Sue, and vice versa, if that make sense.So on a second viewing did I understand Inland Empire any better than the first time? Probably not by much, and I actually still felt the flaws that pecked away the first time, namely that it does go too long, becoming sluggish towards the end (albeit with an astounding end credits sequence), and every so often a moment or scene felt too over the top. Yet overall, this is a film filled with so many ideas, so many visions, and so much to cast into one's mind about the nature of reality, of what it means to see an un-reality (either through the media, or through a form, or just in front of one's eyes like Dern with the "hot" girls who dance to the 'Locomotion'), and how things are never, ever as they seem. Just like Hollywood, one might say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Lynch's work. Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway are wonderful films. Both have a beautifully self-consistent logic that works even if it is a twisted one.Inland empire is just an endless montage of unrelated scenes. The idea might have been analogous to videos they show at clubs where the dancers minds automatically sync the action to the beat. Perhaps, the internal logic of the viewer was supposed to connect the random scenes together into a narrative that worked.Or maybe he's yanking our chain, mooning his fans to see if they have the guts to call him on it. Whatever, the film is a waste of 3 hours+ and is only marginally useful as mildly trippy background video...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inland Empire is, without a doubt the best film so for in the 21th century, and it goes without saying that this is everything Lynch has been working towards. The only real reason i wanted to post a review was because of how baffled i am over the legions of supposed lynch fans that feel "let down" by this film, and how it had "no plot whatsoever" (but Mulholland Dr. did?) and because of its near 3 hour running time... Granted most of the time i am put off by extensively long films, and though im not saying this film wasn't slow and didn't chug at some times, it was all the worth it... and if lynch would have made this 4 hours long, then i would have been just as happy! ;)So to any fans of David Lynch out there who (for some odd reason?) are having doubts about checking this out, do your self a favor and see it and let your own reactions come to you. Of course its acquired taste, it is Lynch we are talking about after all! but if you HAVE acquired this rather strange taste in your mouth, and cant get enough, Inland Empire will surely satisfy your thirst.And to everyone else out there who thought the film was "pretentious" , "too arty" or "utterly senseless" , don't worry - Hostel 3 and Spider Man 4 are being made right now JUST FOR YOU! &lt;3</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch serves up tripe...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I just returned for David Lynch's Chicago premiere of INLAND EMPIRE at the Music Box. I should begin by stating that I'm a big DL fan. Now with that being said, I can honestly say that I found little redeeming qualities in INLAND EMPIRE. To begin with, the narrative goes absolutely nowhere. But OK, that's typical. What isn't typical is:1.Terrible cinematography-the single most distracting aspect present in IE. Knowing DL's background, I was expecting great lighting, compositions, and steady cam work. What I got was non stop shaky camera work, unflattering closeups, and dark grainy stairways. Now I am aware that this is shot digitally, but that isn't necessarily a problem. Look at '28 days later' or 'Looking for Kitty' to show how digital can be effectively achieved. Director of Photography Peter Deming is sorely missed here, and we now see how much he actually added to DL's pictures in the past. 2. Lack of music- Again, DL's stubbornness in doing everything himself hurts the film, this time with music. Angelo Baldamenti is nowhere to be found, and leaves DL to play around with Roland Synth pads to create ambiance. 3. Editor- I know I'm repeating myself here, but same as above, our Jack -of-all-trades DL is back at it, this time editing. His decision to leave basically 10 minute long diatribes sorely slows things down to audible snores being heard from the crowd.As you can see, I definitely think our friend DL has fallen from grace, and this film is one that you should have your head checked or at least seek therapy before undertaking. Also of note, David Lynch had a Q and A session after the film completed. I was so underwhelmed with what I saw that I headed for the isles while others stuck around for DL's tripe recipes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inland Empire explained! (MAJOR spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say, that I, Dan "The Movie Man" Wolfson have done it again. I have like in all of the previous Lynch films, managed to unearth the rich textural subtleties and secrets that lie within the film's tombs of confusion.It all lies in the name Axxon N. If you remember correctly, Axxon N. is the longest running radio program in all of Bulgaria (or somewhere strange and European) that is mentioned at the beginning of the film. Think about this. This is the first feature length movie that Lynch has shot on DV. I'm going to assume there will be more. Now, if that next one was Movie B this would clearly be Movie A. Add that A to Axxon N. Rearrange the letters.AXXON N. NO XANAX.The actress, played by Laura Dern in her best performance since Jurassic Park is obviously not on Xanax. She seems depressed. Confused. Wandering from one murky hallway to the next. As I watched the brilliant images flash before me one by one. I realized this Phantom character represented the darkness or depression in Laura Dern's life. When she shoots him at the end with the gun she pulls out of nowhere (the gun of Xanax, I should say. Xanax was developed by a Polish Doctor Of Medicine named Dr. Tryzcwk Gunn) he is vanquished and everyone is happy again. Light and life return to the picture. Everyone hugs each other! A family is reunited (I don't know what they were all about though). There's lots of bright lights and EVERYONE DANCES! The woman that Laura Dern kisses represents the pharmaceutical industry, which America has turned it's back on.It's no secret that Lynch is part of the crazy meditation cult. The Scientologists are their arch Nemesis's. I know L. Ron Hubbard would love for nothing more than to see the Maharishi Yogi lose his followers. Scientologists are against medication for depression, so obviously since these guys are like the Ying to each other's Yang -- the Yogi is totally for medication. I think it's great that they're out there fighting -- almost like the two Zoroastruthian Gods. Clearly, we know the battle lines that Lynch has drawn.If you are depressed like Nikki and keep thinking you're being stabbed in the stomach, get on Xanax. Take it from me, Dan "The Movie Man" Wolfson.(P.S. The girls who play the hookers are amazing actresses!)</fullReview>

Laura Dern and the all star cast probably tried their best, but I would love to ask each of them what this movie is about. I go to theater to be entertained and to be challenged mentally, but this film is the directors nightmare and only he could enjoy it.It was impossible to follow, the film switched back and forth between the old Swedish movie/characters and present day and nightmare or fantasy scenes without clues about why it was flashing back. You were left always thinking, what was that scene about, what information did I miss in that scene?

		<shortDescription>Very intriguing but didn't entirely work personally</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As someone who appreciates David Lynch and loves most of his stuff, Inland Empire both captivated and frustrated me. It is not his worst film, that will always belong to Dune, but it is his least accessible film in the way that Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man and The Straight Story are his most, along with Mulholland Drive they are to me far among his best. It is very easy to see why a lot of people would and do dislike Inland Empire. The film starts off very promisingly but really drags a little over 2/3s of the way through to the extent that you do feel like it's an hour too long. The story is very jumpy structurally and many, including myself around halfway through will be as lost as Nikki herself trying to completely understand what's going on. And some of the script is even more of a convoluted jumble than Wild at Heart's, even the actors on occasions look bemused by it. The use of digital is a mixed bag, sometimes it's effective and fits with the atmosphere of the scene but there are other times where it looks amateurish and overused, the least polished Lynch film perhaps technically. That's not to say at all that the film looks bad because actually most of the visuals aside from the use of digital look great, especially in the bold colours and lighting that are both bewitching and creepy, while Lynch's direction is immediately recognisable and works particularly well in the most surreal moments. While Inland Empire is problematic for many narratively it actually works amazingly as a mood piece; there is some humour of the black humour kind-in distinctive Lynch style- and it does amuse at least and doesn't feel out of place, the surreal and even at times nightmarish atmosphere is often unflinchingly terrifying and in a way that is so captivating that you can't look away and there are some beautiful touches like with the lighter near the end. This atmosphere is enhanced by the soundtrack that is as positively entrancing as it is hauntingly beautiful, and Inland Empire has some great acting especially from Laura Dern whose astonishing lead performance marks as a career-best for her. Justin Theroux is very good and Jeremy Irons clearly looked as though he was having a ball. The support roles are acted more than dependably and nobody jars with the tone with the film. Overall, an intriguing that could have been great, it was easy to get drawn into the film but it was just as easy to get frustrated with it. Ranking it in his filmography, personally it'd be second weakest. 6/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

Harry Dean Stanton is terrific in a role of a funny and spooky 1st AD. I don't even mind the story structure that goes every where it wants to go. But come on... Morbid dialogues (especially little Chinese girl near the end) are filling the uncertain gaps that it will not be to interesting or something. It's just funny how strange it wants it to be. Lynch does some great things with image and sound, but for every brilliant solution he delivers a lame one. I still remember symbols of light striking the cigarette in Wild at Heart. Come on! That's symbolism for kids, and all the tricks in Inland Empire should be untouchable if it wants to be something special. This film is not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I imagine David Lynch makes some great home movies for his family. A trip to Disneyland becomes a disjointed nightmarish journey into the subconscious in which his wife is replaced by a tire salesman and his kids become gruesome specters that never materialize but are talked about in the third person by the REAL family that's on vacation, which we see only as dolls in a store window. Actually I don't know if Lynch is married with kids... I don't care. Inland Empire is he and Laura Dern's home movie. It's filmed with boyish geeky glee on DV and it's built like the barely remembered details of a dream of a really cool story. I never much cared for Lost Highway, and the fractured dream nature of this story reminds me of it in the worst ways. All that being said, I found myself utterly engrossed by the combination of sights and sounds. Lynch is an artist who demands attention on screen. That hasn't changed, but just scan through the hundreds of reviews that deride a person for not understanding his narrative intent, they are all different interpretations!! The problem being, that the movie is an afterthought to the trip. And the trip is always to the same place.</fullReview>

I can usually figure out my own version of the plot somehow, like I did with Mulholland Dr., Eraserhead, and Lost Highway, but I don't even know where to begin with this one. It was definitely a disappointment for me.It has some nice Lynch creepy moments but I guess that's really the only thing that kept me from rating it lower than I did. I couldn't find a story or reason for much of anything in this film. To me, it just seemed like a bunch of random scenes spliced together. Usually Lynch has more structure than that. The acting is really good, Laura Dern does a great job and it's nice to see her come for a Lynch film after Blue Velvet. Other than that, I don't really know what to think, I am simply confused and let down.Check this out if you like David Lynch. A lot of people have enjoyed this film so maybe you will as well.

		<fullReview>The power of a David Lynch film such as Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway, is in my opinion the need to understand the story. Just when you think you understand, something strange happens and you will be forced to reset your ideas of logic and continuity. In Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway, the first somewhat 50 minutes of the film are pretty straight forward, but build up a nice tension, so that you get in touch with the story and the actors. Inland Empire was so weird from the beginning, that I didn't feel connected to anyone in the story. This film looks like someone has tried to imitate David Lynch, but just didn't quite know how to do it. The filming was very bad too. Looks like it was made with a small camera with the aperture too high and a little out of focus most of the time. The film is full of useless remarks and tiring close ups, this made the three hours seem longer than it should.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst film I have ever seen! Absolutely terrible. A catastrophe. Rubbish. Utter drivel. Awful from start to end. Utterly confusing. Mr. Director, please note that random scenes thrown together do not a plot make. An abomination!What was that? It's a David Lynch movie? Oh, that changes everything.)It's a masterpiece! Absolutely brilliant. A challenging piece of cinema. Lynch fiercely abandons all notions of what constitutes a linear narrative to come up with something truly surreal, experimental and freewheeling. It's a motion picture jigsaw puzzle, with Lynch trusting his audience to put that puzzle together. It's wonderful! Ahem.Well here's the rub. I have loved David Lynch movies with a passion. He is a true artist and his palette is the cinema screen. But with most artistes pushing at the boundaries of their art, there is always going to be a moment when you wonder if the artist is just taking having a laugh. Lynch might indeed be having a laugh with this film. I don't know.What is "Inland Empire" about? It's about an actress working on a movie. It's about a prostitute working Hollywood Boulevard. It's about the unfunniest sitcom of all time. It's about a movie that had to be abandoned after the two leads were murdered. It's about girls dancing! I don't know what "Inland Empire" is about.But did I like the film? Yes I did. "Inland Empire" is definitely something different and different should be celebrated. I would like to see it again, if only to try to piece it together, assuming that there is something to be pieced together. (It took me 3 watches to get "Mullholland Drive". Sadly, I'm not so clever.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irritating and intriguing in equal measures</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love David Lynch films. But this one was simply too long, and contrary to what many reviewers have said, for me very unrewarding.A problem I had with Mulholland Drive was the knowledge that it was a TV pilot reworked into a movie. So from the start, wasn't intended to be a film, but somehow was pulled off OK and worked.I had seen Rabbits before in its entirety, so it annoyed me that segments had been so liberally spliced into Inland Empire. I knew it wasn't written for IE, so it seemed somehow wrong. It also felt different in tone to how I had received rabbits on its own.This film felt like Mulholland Drive crossed with the Shining. I mention the Kubrick film because at times the tone, the suggestion of time hopping and repeat characters, the grand designs of some of the rooms, the random shock moments and certainly the music.Blue Velvet and Lost Highway were true rock'n'roll movies, they had confidence, style, involved the viewer, and were far more emotional that IE because they had much more suggestive dynamics. E.g. Fred envying his wife in LH, Jeffrey discovering his own darkness in BV. Since Mulholland, Lynch has developed this too understated style where people purposefully repeat themselves too often, talk in monotone, everything is slow, and the film is too distracted by itself to allow a proper flow of feelings.Something for all the pro-reviewers to think about: if this film had been made by a first time student filmmaker, there is absolutely no way it would receive praise. I think people are influenced by the implication that being a David Lynch film, it simply must be good so everything is seen through that filter. I think that suggestible people will enjoy this film more, because they believe they should.In the end I found it very difficult to 'feel' this film. This isn't to say I didn't 'get it' as I find that a snobby and pretentious argument. It is more that the film doesn't want involvement, the characters and situations beg for awkward self-consciousness that draws attention to itself and alientates any potential emotions. When Laura Dern is talking like a whore, I wasn't 'feeling' her emotion, I was thinking 'this doesn't seem at all credible, her swearing seems forced and contrived, the guy she is talking to looks like hes from a sketchshow, why should I invest my time in this self-conscious attention seeking'. Overall I think very overrated - for three hours of investment I expected so much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Lynch down the rabbit hole...if actions really do have consequences, what is the penance for complete self-absorption?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch carves out another skittering, schizophrenic, skin-crawling mental-mystery with "Inland Empire", which has recognizable elements lifted from other David Lynch films...the most familiar of which is an overall obtuseness which makes the picture difficult to grasp in one sitting. Hollywood actress Laura Dern learns the new picture she's working on is the second attempt to film the story, an adaptation of a Polish legend; the first version resulted in a shut-down after the two leading actors were murdered and the material was said to be cursed. Dern's wealthy, powerful husband uses strong-arm tactics to remind his wife's leading man that their marriage vows are tantamount, while Dern's personality splinters off into different incarnations that seem to have one thing in common: the threat (or fear) of murder. Without reading other comments or professional movie critiques, I am not quite sure why the Polish man's teary wife appears to be the spark plug for the initial set-up, watching a rabbit-headed play on a television screen, or why the Loco-Motion prostitutes don't acknowledge Dern while she's in their presence. I can figure why one of the hookers lifts her T-shirt and shows us her breasts. Lynch has a deep-rooted fixation with trailer-trash life, and paradoxically doesn't think much of low-class women; using them as pawns, or as objects to be ogled, he reasserts his heterosexuality by not showing remorse or scorn for their lives, but by showing off their bodies. I think it's time Lynch got his movies out from the Hollywood milieu, away from the street whores, and streamlined his narrative for more inclusion. I don't care that his dialogue is so elliptical it stretches the picture out to a three-hour length (the pacing is nimble enough that you hardly notice the time), but by being so emotionally (and dramatically) imperceptive, I get the feeling Lynch is laughing at the audience--not with them. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't wait to get my hands on this DVD because I'm always looking for Laura Dern movies. Couldn't find it to rent, was going to buy it, but I found it at the Library. Boy, if I'd paid $28 for that, I would have cried my eyes out!!! It is the worst film I have seen in my 70 years of watching movies. I like stories that have a beginning and and end. This was a lot of weird stuff, distorted faces, rooms changing colors, 6 foot rabbits, and quick scene jumps. It was like a 100 two minutes movies tied together but disconnected. I can't imagine this move making money or even meeting production costs. Ms. Dern has made some very great real-people movies, but this one hit bottom. I always favored Alexander Payne over Mr. Lynch because of his realism and knowing how real people act. I didn't even watch all of Disk 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inland Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David Lynch is just missing the point. Indulging in one's whims might make for artistic freedom, but not necessarily for a good movie. And here Lynch discards film in favour of the hand-held digital camera, and also scripting in favour of semi-improvised takes. It doesn't work.His favourite technique of a storyline that loops around another storyline is repeated here for the third time (after "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland Dr"). But those were good films; clear, despite their complexity, and pure in their aesthetics. "Inland Empire" instead is a mess. Three hours of Laura Dern walking in endless corridors, and of close-ups of her face looking scared and puzzled. A monumental performance? Not really.The various story lines are unclear and unfocused, to the point that they do not warrant further investigation. Loss of identity, innocence, dreams within dreams, big bad Hollywood, yada yada yada. Yawn. If anything, what "Inland Empire" shows is the importance of the soundtrack. Various boring scenes are spiced up due to the usage of some amazing musical accompaniment. This would make for a nice video-clip then.Oh sure the art-house elite will love it. An auteur's piece, they'll say. What a shame that people are prepared to like such pretentious lazy nonsense just because it's a film by David Lynch. Coincidentally, Lynch has gone the businessman route lately, making his own line of coffee. Maybe you should focus on your future career, David?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are really two people who need to be praised for this film: Grace Zabriskie and the incomparable Laura Dern. Both of their performances are top notch and Laura Dern's is particularly astounding in its breadth and scope. That being said, I would hate for those great women to be hurt by my following review. What I have liked about Lynch films in the past is how beautiful they are, even if they don't make a lot of sense. The symbolism, imagery, cinematography all and sheer emotion make up for a sometimes atypical narrative. I'm afraid this film lacks most of those positive qualities. Don't get me wrong, I am not upset that I can't figure the plot line out, or that this film is long. I just found it weaker than Lynch's other offerings. First of all, there was no need for the 3 hours, having just said I didn't mind the length. I liked that it took its time to start to unravel. This was most effective. But the dream-like sequences and "shocks" were less pointed and planned than usual. They were... well... just weak. Usually you leave a Lynch film feeling that you don't know what you saw, but you were enriched for having seen something you couldn't have possibly imagined yourself. Here we have too much emphasis on the fact that you are supposed to try to figure out what's going on. And, I have to say, that I think Lynch is suffering from an old, white, heterosexual stereotype. He is obsessed with prostitutes. And, I'm sorry, that's boring. The laughing, buxom, grotesque prostitute shots are abundant and overwrought. The only thing I couldn't get enough of was Laura Dern's talent. She is so amazing and gets to do so much in this film it's such a treat. But Lynch's contribution seems meager in comparison. Only Grace Zabriskie's extreme and menacing close-up at the very beginning of the film brought me unending joy. All of Lynch's other usual tricks, long hallways, bright flashes of light, spotlights in the face, ponderous, long, senseless dialog were heavy-handed. "Like I was in a dark movie-theater waiting for the lights to come up" is a line in the middle of the film, that is then replayed IN a movie theater later on. Come on, that's heavy-handed. And not the beautiful heavy-handed, either, it's mundane. I wish Lynch had a better self-editor on this one. It could have been great if it had been strung together at a better pace. See it if only for Laura Dern's power-punch of a performance. Oh, and leave before the ridiculous, mood-destroying final credits. Nina Simone has never been more misused.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Inland Empire (2006) dir: David Lynch"Could you tell us what this movie is about?" - Random viewer to David Lynch "Its on the poster." - David Lynch "A Woman In Trouble." - PosterHaving sat through this movie twice, if somebody asked me the same question I'd come up with, "Its a dreamscape."The movie makes less sense than Eraserhead, is the unnatural progression of the final act of Mulholland Drive, and has a schizophrenic quality that eclipses Lost Highway. At times it is less tolerable than Wild At Heart. At others it is genius which is mainly an acting tour de force.Oh, and its 3 hours long.David Lynch needs an editor.If I had to summarize the movie, I'd be hard pressed to do so, even after having seen it twice. But, here's my vain attempt. Laura Dern is an actress who is starring in a movie about a girl who falls from grace because she cheats on her husband. There is also a room with bunnies in the form of a television sitcom, and some hooker in a hotel room crying.The movie follows from scene to scene illogically as if it were one of those annoyingly slow dreams which trying to have its own internal logic but fails. Its not like the fever nightmare that was Eraserhead nor the fantasy that was Mulholland Drive. This is its own maudlin flight of fancy that really just drifts by.Does a movie need to have a point to be good? Not really. Does it need to have a story? It depends. Did I find the movie entertaining? Off and on. Missing is the usual Lynchian dark wit. This is an intense Serious Piece of Art. Missing is David Lynch's usually plush atmosphere. This has been replaced by his use of DV instead of 35mm. And, a hand-held fascination with everything.The best way to describe it is this is David Lynch's first student film since Eraserhead. It is completely self-indulgent (Its David Lynch, there is always going to be some degree of it), and overloaded. And, its 3 hours of it.C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lynch of Diminishing Returns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I want to report a fraud," the drunken Beverly Mantle (Jeremy Irons) announces at a ceremony where his identical twin, Elliott, is accepting an award. "He's Beverly and I'm Elliott!" And this reference to David Cronenberg's seminal gynecological nightmare, "Dead Ringers," could very well sum up "Inland Empire," David Lynch's latest opus of switched-identity incoherence, where-nothing-is-as-it-seems. The "fraud" comes in when you discover that Lynch has come up WAY short in giving us a narrative worth investing in, or characters worth caring about. More often than not, this ugly-looking, overlong slug of a film plays like a practical joke on those who have spent long hours dissecting the buried plots of "Eraserhead," "Lost Highway," and "Mulholland Drive." Yes, now the long-term Lynch detractors can point their fingers and say, "I told you so!" While my mind is still revisiting certain images invoked during the 3-hour "Inland Empire," it is in a very scattered way?the images may be striking, yes, but do they really MEAN anything? And does the movie really engage us well enough to revisit multiple times to find out? Not really. Lynch, who has touted digital film-making in interviews, seems more like a kid showing off a new toy, and badly?the film is awash in murky hues, shaky framing, and an over-reliance on extreme close-ups that made me wish I'd taken Dramamine before viewing. The sound quality is maddeningly uneven?on the DVD, you'll be turning up the volume to hear the hushed dialog, only to be knocked out by a random loud sound effect (or maybe a bunch of hookers "doing the locomotion" as seizure-lights flash across the image), while our cinematic ringmaster laughs delightedly. But "Inland Empire" comes to a point where the dialog ceases to have much relevance...along with everything else.Last year, right around the time of "Inland Empire"'s theatrical release, I read an article that gave a revealing detail in that the film was shot according to ideas the director would write down and tell his actors to perform. This goes quite a ways in explaining how scattered the finished product feels (yes, even for a Lynch film)?our perpetually spaced-out auteur could have easily filmed "Inland Empire" over the course of a lone weekend with no regard for structure, and simply thrown the damn thing into theaters as is. Even in his most seemingly nonlinear films, there is a salvageable plot that warrants analysis and brings into focus even the most disparate elements. "Eraserhead," on the surface, is about a man's reluctant, awkward (and failed) adjustment to fatherhood; "Mulholland Drive" is a love story set against a Hollywood backdrop; and "Lost Highway" is a tale of lust and betrayal with Noir underpinnings."Inland Empire" bears the most in common with "Mulholland Drive"?at times, it seems like a very poor remake or sequel?but has no emotional or metaphysical anchor to keep us firmly attached to the story. It begins with Laura Dern (Lynch's "Blue Velvet") and Justin Theroux ("Mulholland Drive"), working on a film directed by Jeremy Irons; Harry Dean Stanton has an odd little supporting role as Irons' assistant. And things venture far into left field from there, as any pretense at a plot is abandoned, even the details that may hint at where we could FIND one? the more "Inland Empire" goes on, the less resonance anything has, and the more you're just waiting for the damn thing to end. Invasive weirdness set against familiar facades has always been Lynch's stock and trade (and is usually an asset to his films), but that we care nothing for Laura Dern's character, who is introduced hastily and undergoes all variety of hell before the film sputters to a conclusion, is a bad sign. Spending most of the film looking directly at the camera, as slack-jawed as the viewer, Dern had me longing for the more lively ladies (and story) of "Mulholland Drive." That being said, Dern can be only held partially responsible for the performance (though she would have been wise to outright turn the movie down)?again, it's Lynch's slack "script" and direction that leaves her adrift in nonsense wearing a mask of depth.At 3 hours, "Inland Empire" is a ponderous headache whose replay value will depend on individual viewer gullibility. Lynch has long been an advocate for artistic freedom and liberation from the confining studio system, but if all he has to offer us is dreck like "Inland Empire," then I'd say we'd be better off with his "mainstream" efforts.My rating of "2" is indicative of the fact that, at some point, I probably will revisit "Inland Empire"?many of Lynch's films are more revealing upon subsequent viewings, but as I give most films I comment on a single view before passing along my judgment, I believe "Inland Empire" should be subjected to the same treatment. If, in the future, it plays any better, I will be sure to amend this review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I loved Lynch's "Elephant Man", "Blue Velvet", "Wild at Heart", and "Eraserhead". I forgave him for "Dune". I liked "Twin Peaks", tolerated "Mulholland" and "Lost Highways" but this thing (INLAND EMPIRE) is a mess.I get the feeling that he makes movies like this just to mess with our minds. I'm no idiot (in my humble opinion), but I could not make much sense out of any of this besides there was a movie within a movie and life imitates art and blah blah blah.... I mean, what's the point? Sure there were all the trademark Lynch effects here; the disturbing closeups, the lighting, the "nails on a chalkboard" music.. I realize that he (Lynch) is an artist. But I don't want to be made to feel as if I'm taking an IQ test at the theater. I don't want to have to refer to "Cliff's Notes" after watching. I mean at least, if you're going to make the dialog almost indiscernible at times, put in subtitles so I at least have a chance to figure out what the hell is going on....

		<fullReview>The people who gush over this film are simply not to be taken seriously.Firstly, it's shot with hand-held digital cameras (not the kind of digital used in, say, the recent Superman, where digital comes close to being a passable substitute for film if you lower you standards only a hair's breadth; rather, it's the kind of lousy, cruddy, mud-o-vision digital which makes you wonder why you bothered walking into the theatre) - with an absurd overuse of fish-eye lenses. And it's not even in focus all the time. I know the out-of-focus shooting was deliberate - well, actually I don't know, but let's suppose it was - but it adds insult to injury: the image definition isn't anywhere near good enough for even a half second's out-of-focus shooting to be endurable.Why do we stand for this kind of thing? Why don't people who pay good money to see a movie rise up in spontaneous rebellion when they find they've been swindled? It's one of those mysteries of modern life, like the mystery of why all modern buildings are ugly, when we certainly don't have fewer technical resources than our ancestors did when they made buildings that were beautiful.And secondly, Lynch's latest is about (inasmuch as it's about anything) an actress, and about the production of a film. It's set in Hollywood and most characters are film-makers of one description or another. Does the resulting work consist of tedious, puffed-up, self-referential tomfoolery? Is there any serious doubt? Mulholland Drive was a more lifeless, inferior knock-off of Lost Highway chiefly because it was about Hollywood rather than something external to Hollywood: the most versatile directors in the world have difficulty making films about films without turning out something tiresome and trite, and Lynch, although he has on occasion been a great film-maker, and although he did make The Straight Story, is not renowned for his versatility.One of the basic plot points is silly. Being based on a Polish folktale does not curse a production. Being set in Hollywood, does.Lynch usually relies heavily on his is-it-real-or-is-it-a-dream ambiguity, but in this instance, there's nothing else - and the lousy digital images mean that even this stalwart gimmick doesn't stand a chance of working. Obviously, in excrement-brown digital, it's all a dream. Or might as well be. The digital cameras have robbed Lynch of his power to invest mundane items with menace (in digital, the mundane simply looks even more mundane); they've preventing him from using his slow, gliding camera; they've led him into the by now well-known just-let-the-camera-operator-follow-the-actors trap, and encouraged him to be self indulgently profligate in compiling more and still more footage for the thinnest script he has ever worked on.You don't have to take my word for any of this, or trust my aesthetic subjective sense. Let's suppose for the sake of argument I'm a lousy judge of cinema. Nonetheless, the movie was shot on low-definition, muddy digital video: that's a known fact: look it up. The movie is set entirely in Hollywood and features actors, directors and technicians; again a known fact: look it up. You now know all you need to know to infer that Lynch has laid an egg.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I recalled seeing "Blue Velvet" and certainly seen "Elephant Man", I guess I knew what to expect from David Lynch. What I did not expect is an agonizing, slow death by being thrown crappy footage and senseless and completely worthless dialogs and scenes. I mean, c'mon, you guys in the UK were lucky with 170 minutes of film! Here in Italy we get the full blown 190! luckily I was smart enough to decide that 2 1/2 hours where enough of that complete and utter garbage of movie-making, and left the theatre. Now into part by part movie critique:******************************SPOILERS*****************************I liked the beginning. Polish, no subtitles, dark and b&amp;w, sinister. Even the bunny people with the completely absurd laughs at the back was an acceptable "unreal interlude" between scenes, and it got really creepy at one moment (with mama bunny holding candles) Then on to the "main" (if any) story: Dern is visited by a strange woman (beginning of the exaggerate close ups and HORRIBLY ANNOYING out of focus filming which gives you headache, darnit, your eyes try to make up for the lack of focus and you end up physically and mentally tired) and we understand that she's about to star in a film. Things go smoothly this part, we can understand that the husband is horribly jealous, and that there _will_ be something between the starring roles. Then it all goes to hell. Apparently, at this part of the movie making / filming / writing, David Lynch fell head down into a rock, and either got amnesiac or ADHD, which gave him the chance of putting random, shaky, low quality DV into the film, senseless stories, scenes that where TOO similar to those of "Requiem for a dream" (a masterpiece), for example the music, the dancing, the sudden violent / horrible scenes, etc. Then you have painfully long and senseless scenes in badly spoken English or polish, which do absolutely nothing for the movie, which should have been cut down, to say... 80 minutes of film? Maybe my opinion on this pile of crap would have been better, should the film be 80 minutes long. Don't watch this movie: you won't even be able to sleep in the theatre; it's all nice, warm and quiet, and then BAAAM! loud noises, bleeding screaming girl.1/10 because I can't go decimal or negative.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There will always be a hardcore of Lynch fans who will love Lynch's special brand of weirdness for its own sake or otherwise, but I think this film is his weakest to date. Since Lost Highway his films have become more and more obfuscated and fragmented, paying little mind to coherence of plot or character. Whereas Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway amounted to highly atmospheric and sometimes intensely emotional experiences, Inland Empire feels too deconstructed to sustain interest. All the trademark atmospherics are there, but there is little in terms of character or narrative push to make the audience care. Apparently Lynch wrote every scene before shooting, and with its lo-fi digital technique, it feels like it has been made up as it goes along. Furthermore, at almost three hours, it feels amateurish and pretentious, like a terrible student film extended way beyond necessity. I think that no matter how abstract a film is, the audience needs a reason to care (especially at this length) and Lynch just doesn't deliver one on this occasion. Also, the visual and acoustic techniques that underpin the mood of this film seem largely regurgitated here, and as dislocated and nightmarish as it sometimes is, it never feels authentic. The sense that Lynch has run out of tricks a little is impounded by the cheap quality of some of the production. In one dislocated scene Laura Dern's character finds herself in some sort of brothel, and the lighting effect was obviously generated by shining torches in her face in a manner that recalls the acid trip sequence in Easy Rider. It's kitchen sink standard at times, but Lynch never punches above the weight of the apparent economic restraints. Overall it is a tedious mess.</fullReview>

Perhaps this isn't emphatic enough... a colossal failure because the film is aggravating, contrived and ultimately not entertaining at all. It is as though Lynch produced the film with little or no regard for the audience. The film is a monument to himself. I am not condemning Lynch's style; his previous films work because there is justification for the bizarre components which have become his signature. Inland Empire is esoteric merely for the sake of being esoteric, which is disappointing because with a little less "mental masturbation" on the part of David Lynch, this might have been an extraordinary film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugh!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading some of the claptrap comments, I can only scratch my head in wonder.Three agonizing hours of nonsense! It seemed as though Lynch must have been on crack. He definitely needs therapy. This film is as much "art" as Jackson Pollak flinging paint at a canvas. Lynch takes bits and pieces of video and throws them against the wall to see what sticks, and a whole lot sure sticks. Masterpiece? Giant rabbits? Give me a break.Laura Dern should receive some kind of award for bravely being in this monumental piece of drek.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fallen Empire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'd like to say that I found David Lynch's Inland Empire to be a disappointment, not entirely, because there were a handful of good scenes, but overall it's a great mess, sugarcoated with bloated non-linear structure, which is so complicated that you start losing interest and simply don't care anymore. Personally I could not feel for the characters, because the film failed to touch me emotionally. It was just the opposite to all the other Lynch movies that I adore with great enthusiasm, especially Blue Velvet, Elephantman, Twin Peaks Series and even Eraserhead, that is a truly great work of abstract art. I like non-linear structure, because it makes you think but this one went too far, straight into self-parody.I watched the movie a few days ago, gave it time to rest in my mind and tried to figure out why I disliked it. It was not the DV-cinematography (it's a new technology with new possibilities), the actors were all great (well, most of them), the music and sound effects were really good, too. It was THE FORMULA that bothered me. David Lynch added nothing new to his world, except the DV technology. In a certain way, it was painting by numbers by David Lynch:"Mistreated Woman + Losing Reality + Immoral Counterparts (Men) + Threatening figure in the background (Husband) + Non-linear time structure + Spooky Sound Effects + Director Trademarks (Hallways, Curtains, Light Effects, etc.) + Beautiful singing voice at the end (Crysta Bell and DL on the synth) = David LYNCH MOVIE (TM)"Now, this formula was too obvious and leads automatically to disappointment, if you've seen all David Lynch movies and know his biography. You can compare and you can tell the differences. It does not have to do with form, it has to do with substance and whether an artist has to say something important or not. Maybe David Lynch said all there is and he uses Digital Video as a toy to experiment with new technologies. And Inland Empire just looks like that. But that's cool with me. The only problem is that I invested 3 hours of my life, spent 8 Euros and waited more than eight months to see his new work. The most positive thing I can say about Inland Empire is that it shows the possibilities of Digital Video. It inspires you to do a movie on your own. The quality is gritty and cold and very realistic (that's why DV works for porn and Reality TV so well) but with artistic lighting, a creative set-design and good actors you can create a masterpiece if you're lucky.The first hour of Inland is quite good, "the story" begins to unfold and there is a certain amount of suspense. There are a few brilliantly executed scenes, like the title sequence, the Marilyn Levins scene or one of my favorite, when Nikki/Sue realizes that she fell in love with Devon/Billy. You can see it in her eyes! Now that's great acting! Later on there is a death scene that is very disturbing but great and memorable, but the rest is not very intriguing. The end sequence is nice and ironic but I thought it was confusing and broke the mood. As a standalone it would be awesome. The rest of the movie is - like another reviewer wrote - overdosed mental masturbation. Nothing else.So, can I recommend this movie? The Lynch-Fans, like myself, who can't wait for it, should see it. For all the other people out there who are just curious, I suggest a DVD-rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not sure what this movie is but I will tell you what it is not: Great.Sometimes you know you're in the presence of something great, but have trouble grasping it. This is not one of those things.The film has 2 problems: Repetitiveness and gratuitousness.No matter what you want to imagine the format is trying to 'convey,' many scenes were redundant. So, although we don't get (or care) what's going on, we find ourselves urging Lynch to move on.Lynch could have chosen to dispose of quite a bit of footage-- especially since it's filmed in digital.It's gratuitous because the confusion is groundless and unrewarding. You won't learn anything new by continuing to watch. But if your time isn't worth much to you, you might enjoy that.Anything with meaning communicates something-- anything. This film defies communication-- and I mean that in the most offensive way. If nothing is being said, resources (money, time) shouldn't be sacrificed.The film adds nothing to the world of art, film, ideas, etc.DP</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Belief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am going to chime in with the chorus of people who did not appreciate this film. I love Lynch (usually). ERASERHEAD was one of my all-time favorites, so I'm no stranger to "strange". But this film makes you cringe, just wondering if its ever going to get any teeth and try to bite you like his other films do so well. And you wait and you wait.There are a few surreal Lynch moments. A few. Jeremy Irons was good, for sure. Amazing that it was shot it on DV! I turned to my wife at one point and said, could he have shot this on HD?? Later I said, no he would never do that. And then to find out it's DV!! Shot on $3-4K Sony DV Camcorder. That's balls.Will David ever come back this way again? Who can say.P.S. When you see a long review on the IMDb that romanticizes the joy and wonder of any given film to the last detail, skip it and read the short ones. They are usually more honest and not out to sell the film to an unsuspecting public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring, pointless nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Obviously you don't expect the usual film framework when you go to see a work by David Lynch, however even with no discernible plot in his last few films he has managed to create an interest through style and mood. Actually working out what most of his movies are about would challenge Sherlock Holmes to the point of despair, but still they intrigued me.The difference is Inland Empire. There is no plot, and a mishmash of messy, annoying scenes that simply turn the viewer off completely. The film is boring from start to finish, the camera work is awful (even if this is deliberate, it's still awful), it is way too long and totally pointless. It was as though a room of monkeys wrote the screenplay such was the complete nonsensical actions and dialog.I wasn't particularly surprised to read nonsense reviews from people wishing to sound smart by claiming they understood the film. There is no way anyone can understand that mess, the Emperors New Clothes comes to mind.Probably in the running for the worst film ever made, not just pointless and boring, but annoying as well.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lynch fan disappointed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is for Lynch fans really - I wish someone had warned me about this one. I'm all for making up your own mind on things, but for this, well, I wish I could erase it from my memory and go back to a time when Lynch's artistic output was unblemished on my mind.To all those who love this film, that's great, I was really hoping to be among you, however, such is not the case.I have been a Lynch fan for a long time, he is among my favorite American directors and I have loved most of his films, and not disliked any of them. I also am a fan of Twin Peaks, his website and his shorts (even his new digital ones).On a small or large scale the thing I have always enjoyed most about his work is his imagination. Whether the films make up a cohesive and understandable 'linear' whole is usually ancillary to the fact that he's able to craft wonderful and memorable scenes punctuated by gorgeous visuals and fantastic use of sound.Going in to 'Inland Empire' I didn't expected straightforward or 'beautiful' aesthetics knowing he shot it on a low range prosumer camera, but I had hoped at the least he'd do something interesting with this visual hurdle. Whether he did or didn't is not for me to discuss here, rather beyond the look my point is that he has done nothing with the freedom this medium afforded. In fact it seems painfully obvious now that Lynch works best when he has the constraints of shooting on film.Going back to 'Eraserhead' one can see the fantastic use of visuals, the unconventional style of each scene, the creative use of sets, the unique story - clearly a true independent spirit at work. Here in 'Inland' all that is missing. It feels most of the film is b-sides from 'Mulholland Drive' a few ideas ripped from 'Lost Highway' and A LOT of Laura Dern walking from room to room.Rarely funny, containing no real suspense and with a stunning lack of creativity 'Inland' was a real disappointment. The first 40mins or so showed promise, though a bit too much deja vu. From there it fell off the rails.I can recall many many scenes from all of his movies, but having just been in to see 'Inland' i'm having a difficult time recalling anything particularly memorable. One or two scenes come to mind as being worth the time investment but in 3 hours, forgive me, I expect more than that.I really hope this is not indicative of where his artistic muse is leading him. I know there are those who sincerely liked this movie but judging by todays audience response they are in the minority. And so I don't feel too selfish hoping that he moves away from this style of film / mode of working.To Lynch, if you happen to read this - Dino's still alive, quick go have dinner with him before it's too late, he'll set you on your path again. Let's hear it for Blue Velvet 2! * / ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Davis Lynch's got a new DV camera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's quite hard to judge this movie with traditional aesthetic codes, for, if you immediately recognize the typical Lynch's themes and figures, it's such an experimental recherches laboratory, that you leave the theater without any judgment in your mind. It's nor good nor bad, it's fascinating and boring at the same time, unimaginable and yet predictable when you know Lynch's other movies. It's not a movie in the traditional sens of the term, but there's much more cinema in this movie than in most films released in theater."Mulholland Dr." was the narrative apogee of the interrogations Lynch asked years ago with "Blue Velvet", and formed, along with "Lost Highway", a coherent trilogy about cinema and the unreality of its world, witch drives its characters in the edge of madness. "INLAND EMPIRE" continues the formal experiences of the previous movies, but without their narrative coherence : it's like the themes of "Mulholand Dr." were mixes with the experimental style of "Eraserhead". The result is quite intriguing, but also a little disappointing : it's like Lynch, after what may be his absolute masterpiece, gives us his preparation works, instead of a finished piece of art. Of course, some scenes are beautiful (specialy at the end of the movie, for those who survive more than two hours) and some cinema ideas are really crazy, but the impression of incoherence still remains. It's seems the movie was think like a gigantic "work in progress" more than a classic narrative movie, but this lack of an identifiable storyline, whereas the movie brings you some narrative lines, rapidly creates a feeling of incoherence, and makes it looks like the artistic necessity is missing. For instance, the movie could have last one more hour (thank good it's not), or could be cut in half without interfering with its integrity. The others Lynch's movies didn't give this impression of arbitrary, but their complexity increased the narrative necessity of each scenes : you can't cut or add anything to "Mulholland Dr." or "Lost Highway" without breaking their unity : it doesn't seem true for "INLAND EMPIRE", where the logical cohesion of the movie seems much more blurry. It's even hard to say if the all movie isn't a big joke, and that Lynch gives incoherent frames without meaning, for an elitist audience who's only waiting this kind of meaningless montage from Lynch. Don't get me wrong here : Lynch is certainly one of the most brilliant director alive, as "Wild at heart" or "Twin Peaks" prove it, but you may doubt his sincerity when you watch "INLAND EMPIRE" and ask yourself if he's not just trying to mess with his audience... But even if my feelings are right (only time and other visions of the movie will tell), "INLAND EMPIRE", between two boring moments, hides a fistful of beautiful frames and magical ideas, and stays, no matter what, a hell of an experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enter the macabre for three hours of nonsensical stupidity and you will realize what a ripoff this is. David, you have absolutely terrible film making skills.I am so tired of watching your usual shtick and antics with lighting, camera work, stupid dialogue, etc. Do something original for a change. You have a following, now prod them by making something beautiful, heartfelt and meaningful. If you are incapable of doing so, at least make it humorous.I'm sick of looking at your ugly sets, drab rooms with gross retro 1960's furniture. It just looks cheap and shoddy. Stop with the 1980's-1960's retro hairstyles. Try to modernize your tastes realistically. Sometimes we can't figure out when and where the hell we are.Almost everyone looks bad in Inland Empire. Laura Dern looks frightening anymore. She looks like an aging ostrich. Her performance is nothing but frantic quavers and painful frowns. Jeremy Irons looks so out of place in this genre and doesn't seem like he knows what to achieve in his role. Thoreau is a poor excuse for a leading man. He's short, pallid and not very handsome.Numerous characters are thrust into the screen briefly and then are heard or seen no more. This grows tedious, nauseating and downright boring after ten minutes. Three hours of investing your time with this mess is a crime. I used to assess actors in Lynch's films as avant garde actors in his earlier work. Now I just see them as a melting pot of losers who need an acting job.There are some pretty girls, like the girl watching the television as she weeps. Her big dark eyes in contrast with her fair and beautiful skin is mesmerizing. The prostitute friends give us something to look at , but they are used poorly here.Do not waste your time and money. If you do, you will regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Lynch has done some good things, but he has also done some bad things. This is by far his worst. A friend labeled it "David Lynch on mushrooms" The movie has talented performers, and their performances are talented, but the disjointed snippets fail to create a montage--they just bore and confuse. Lynch uses foreign language scenes, double cut backs and every other imaginable gimmick to try to create something artistic--but he fails miserably. Unfortunately, his prior genius fools many into believing that the "emperor really does have new clothes," instead of dismissing this as the craven remains of an artistic bankruptcy.My advise is to avoid it even if your video store sends it to you for free. You'll never find the pot of gold at the end of this three hour rainbow-less soaking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hardly ever leave the theater before the credits start rolling - no matter how bad the movie is. Sometimes I fall asleep but I hardly ever leave. However, after 1 hour of "Inland Empire" I left the theater! This was a special preview. When I left the theater together with my friend, the theater owner made a note - she had been asked to write down how many people leave early! Three more people were in the foyer, drinking coffee, etc. They wanted to go back in eventually, but said that they needed a break....The fact that the Polish parts of the film had no subtitles may have made things worse, but even with subtitles I doubt that I would have stayed longer. The film was in-comprehensive and - worst of all - boring! The bad quality (obviously Lynch used an old video camera to shoot this) and terrible shaky camera work made it even harder to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strange, threatening, long and yet consistent film. The basic plot - rather like the actor/character crossover metaphysic of Mulholland Drive - centres around an actress not only in a cursed role but also with an out-of-synch consciousness. Not for nothing is the film within the film entitled On High in Blue Tomorrows.The grand joy of the film is it's texture. Shot almost entirely on digital film, it often has the look of a string of bizarre You Tube clips played in succession. The CCTV-ish grain of the texture really lends itself to Lynch's fine-line narration veering between realism and the surreal. Additionally, the editing is quite outstanding and the film maintains a coherent pulse.This is just as well because most of the time the substance of the film is either elusive or simply impenetrable. There is very little in dialogue or scraps of linear plot to guide one through the grand arc of the film (such as there is one). It doesn't help that there are one or two sequences that really tax the patience of the viewer.Lorna Dern's heroic performing stamina is a pretty good reason to commit yourself to three hours of this baffling but undeniably affecting opera. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I nearly walked out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was quite bad. With easily 30 minutes left to go (this is a long movie - nearly 3 hours), I couldn't wait for it to be over, and I didn't really care about how things turned out (there wasn't much of a plot, anyway). The story is extremely non-linear and revolves around a movie-within-a-movie and an old folktale. The action jumps between "inside the movie", "on the set", the folk tale back story, and what I'll call 'weird, scary in-betweens', and the main character herself loses grips on which is which. The movie is full of long shots that are intended to create suspense; I thought they stretched out too little story over too much time. I found the movie-within-a-movie scenes self-indulgent and boring.My chief criticism: there was much too little story development to keep me interested. Long sections of the movie were flat plot-wise, and I was tired of the go-nowhere 'suspense' long before the movie was over. It felt stagnant. I did laugh out loud once during the movie when the suspense gave way without warning to a pointless, hilarious scene involving pop dance music. But, in summary: this movie was simply not worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, let's face it. This new David Lynch movie is a load of pretentious nonsense. It's like he's mixed all his previous movies in a blender and then filtered out all the good bits. Three reasons why this is not a good movie. 1. It's far too long. I can't think of a single reason why this film should go on for almost three hours, since half of the time you're watching completely meaningless or utterly incomprehensible scenes which don't help the story a millimeter forward. During the performance I attended, several people left the cinema. Others were clearly glad it was finally over. 2. Too much form, too little substance. An overdose of creepy dark hallways, disturbing close-ups and cheap horror effects would be forgivable if it all served a purpose. It does not. Of course somewhere deep beneath all the Lynchianisms that seem to go on forever, there is a story. Or two. Or three (I lost count). Intertwined of course, with references forward and backwards in time and space. But they're hard to find. 3. Laura Dern. She is a fine actress with some noteworthy performances in this film. But too much is too much. There's hardly a minute without her. And since there are 170 minutes in this film, that's a lot of Laura.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Confusion on too many levels to count</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alright, to respond to people saying it reminds them of Lynch's early short films; this film may resemble that, but it's a brutal 195 minutes of madness, and thats pretty hard to take for anyone who wants a storyline with coherency and, er, plot.You can call this a SPOILER if you want; if you want to go in not having any idea what to expect, don't read: Like Muholland Drive, this film tries to bring you into one storyline and then pull the carpet out from under you to reveal another. However, this is done SEVERAL times. We're first brought into the storyline of Laura Dern's character, an actress who just landed a big part in a film. Lynch holds our hand through it, and here is where he shows his brilliance as a director. He sets up the atmosphere and the characters' dynamics with each other well. Then BAM, we're wandering through tangents with characters speaking in Polish and Laura Dern's own psychotic adventures... for HOURS.END SPOILERS After the first hour, I the plot fell apart and I was left for (at least) the next hour and a half unable to comprehend any of what was being told; the warping story lines and the confusing character relationships lost me. I was eventually brought back in to the story... only to soon be kicked out again.I will commend it for this though; near the end, there is one sequence where I saw what I deem to be the scariest image I have ever seen in a film. Right after it was shown, literally every audience member in the theater was giving a friend a look of "holy sh*t".As a film, Lynchs "Inland Empire" is crap. There's no single coherent storyline, there's hours of confusion and its length left me supremely bored. The confusion left me no reason to care for any of the characters, and I was left wondering just when and how the hell they were going to wrap it up. I would recommend it for those who want to explore a film that may be the equivalent of someone losing their sanity; not the hollywoodized, Donnie Darko kind of enjoyable sanity lost. Literally an exploration into what losing one's sanity would feel like. As a movie though... I can't really recommend it. Also, its filmed on DV cameras, for anyone that cares.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While absolutely true to the visual tropes many of us have come to thank director David Lynch for from "Eraserhead" and"Blue Velvet" forward, "Inland Empire" is best suited to an earlier, and in a sense, more nuanced form of the art - silent films.Lack of narrative notwithstanding, the director seems to promote the old Hollywood noir portrayal of an independent/disengaged woman reminded that she (and by extension, most other women) is still a whore, an idiot, and probably psychotic.Laura Dern has never particularly impressed, but her 'acting' at acting here was strong and effective; nonetheless, she is Lynch's Hitchcock bitch.Enough already.This film is too much an amalgamation of previously effective Lynch signatures which, taken together, are absurdist in the least French of ways.I saw this film at the Palm Springs Film Festival - I would estimate that even in the respectful tenor of an audience that is open to challenging films, dozens and dozens of people walked out - they had better things to do, evidently.</fullReview>

This is Lynch's most elusive tone poem to date, and its cheapo visual aesthetic links it to no other film in his canon What we get is an unsurprising uncomfortable 3 hours of unfathonable iterations .. Psychopathic sexual jealousy; rabbit sit coms, unwanted children; unreliable electrical currents, leading to exploding light-bulb effects and cavernous hallways --all Lynchian trademarks The same goes for Lynch's iterations of female innocence contrasted with female degradation. The director indicts the voyeur and is the voyeur. By the time the blond Dern releases the raven-haired Polish "lost girl" with a kiss, we're back, fleetingly, to the identity schisms informing "Blue Velvet" and "Lost Highway" and "Mulholland."

		<fullReview>The good things about the movie are; The great performance of Laura Dern, she has to play several characters and she does it in a marvelous way! The expressions on her face are incredible especially the weird things she does with her mouth. (in a positive way) So Laura makes the film. Then there is the use of music, I love the song sinner man at the end, good way to keep your audience till the end of the credits. And the polish song is just sublime! There are really good and touching quotes in the movie. And great characters, especially at the end on the walk of fame.***little spoiler here*** I got a real 'bigfish' moment at the end when they're showing the credits, all the people come together who were mentioned in the film and have a party. I enjoyed that! ***end of spoiler***The close-ups really work, and impress you especially in a theater but they get a little annoying at times. The bad things about the movie are; First thing you notice is the video quality, you expect a lynch film to be immediately touching by the way of using film color? But here, it works distracting and it gives a real dirty look. For example the first image of Blue Velvet, you think; wow! The colors! And now it was more of, d*mn it's on video and it's so gray and dark? And sometimes it really works for the film but I think it's a step back. Then there is the constant Lynch sound 'deeeunnnnsscchhh' going on, which gets a little annoying. I also think it's clear he filmed it when he had another part ready for over a year and half? It's a typical Lynch film, OK? but he repeats things a lot, it's slow and especially when the films duration is almost 3 hours. When I looked around in the theater (which was completely full) I saw people sleeping! I enjoyed watching the film, but the main reason for that would be the acting of Laura Dern. Sublime! My curiosity, that kept me motivated to stay till the end. But it didn't fur fill my expectations. So maybe I'll have to see it again or maybe I don't and I'll stay with my opinion which is; Definitely not the master work of Lynch, not even in my top 3. I thought I was going to be overwhelmed by a masterpiece which would have me analyze the film from A to Z. But now I don't even want to put the effort in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main problem with INLAND EMPIRE compared with earlier Lynch films is not that it has no coherent plot, but that it is totally uninteresting - in fact, painful to watch.I am a big David Lynch fan and wish I hadn't seen this movie because of how much it has hurt my image of this usually wonderful director.Most people usually think Lynch films don't make much sense, but they're wrong - movies like Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway have just enough coherent thread woven through them to make them very good, interesting films. Both MD and LH arguably have coherent plots which are just presented in a nonlinear manner. So when people told me that this latest Lynch film was "bad" and "didn't make any sense," I ignored them.DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE.I had a cup of coffee on my way into this movie, and halfway through it I was asleep. Two-thirds of the way through it (it is incredibly long) I walked out because I could not take it any more.This film is the product of David Lynch's overinflated ego. He is no longer trying to please an audience, just pleasing himself. Undoubtedly people will wrap themselves into pretzels trying to analyze this film, foolishly. Lynch himself has stated that he filmed INLAND EMPIRE with no coherent plan (notice I said plan not plot) in mind.Keep in mind that I am Polish and therefore better prepared than most to understand/appreciate this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must be frank: this Lynch-movie was a bit too much for me. Not only does he use the exact same 'themes', - if Lynch works with themes -, as in Mulholland Drive &amp; Lost Highway. (You know: the self-confident woman &amp; the jealous, possessive man &amp; the dreams of an actress/artist), but he even uses the same interiors as he does in Twin Peaks (the eighties rooms). I think it's daring to make your film without a script, but it has brought Lynch only to recyclage of the things he used to make. We may not demand a lot of David Lynch, since he is a master with the camera: he makes his own demands. But is an original story too much to ask? There may be a lot of critics and movie-fans who are going to juggle with expensive words as oniric odyssey, osmosis, postmodernist etc. and they are going to claim: "It wasn't entirely the same as Mulholland Drive or Lost Highway" but honestly: tell me you didn't look at your watch. Tell me you didn't look at your watch. No matter how complicated or simple you want a film to be, there's always going to be one critic who can find a complex narrative in it. And I have the impression that what Lynch is all about. Tell the world how deep &amp; insightful you are by watching and liking David Lynch-films. So David Lynch is actually a gift to the world and the people who are "expressive". On a more positive note, I thought there were some funny scenes too, especially with the girls-club (doing the Locomotion). But that was rather rare and it was more funny like when you see a dog with a funny tail: funny but not really. For the people who are already planning to go see it twice or three times: I respect that a lot. It shows you have great character. (The soundtrack was fantastic by the way: really nice of him at the end to start Sinnerman at the instrumental solo. Made my heart skip a beat.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lynch is dead for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>whatever lynch does, everyone like it. it's just snob-ism i think. Yet i do like lynch myself, but this last movie, frankly, sucks. The digital image is so ugly, so crappy, so yellowish, so "pixelised" that i wished i could watch it on 15" screen instead of the big one of the theater. Most of those "premiers plans" are useless. Music sucks too in this movie. The history is just a multidimensional Mullholland drive-like crap, not that original after all(at least Mullholland drive was a great movie!!), the same old story (Mullholland, lost highways) and poor laura Dern, that i really like, can't but act always the same. How could she act differently with such a screenplay, poor creature? Always that worried what-the-hell-is-going-on face. I just liked the old woman speech and face, the one coming to see laura at first and the rabbits' room (specially the cruel "pre-recorded" laughing) my English is poor, sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insanely Bad, Intensely Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dear David LynchI went to see 'INLAND EMPIRE' last night. Usually a three hour film has a three hour storyline, whereas yours had maybe 20 minutes of story in total. What on earth were you thinking? You've made a truly bad derivative student art movie. Lots of (and I mean LOTS) of shots of Laura Dern walking down corridors with a worried/scared/horrified look on her face, and endless supposedly 'meaningful' conversations, do not make tension, interest or even a decent cinematic narrative.I 'get' that supposedly the central reality is that its 'the thoughts of a woman in trouble' - in this case some Polish hooker. And yes, there's that arbitrary side plot of two people filming a Hollywood movie, and the ones' husband is jealous, and maybe there's a murder. And yes, the time duality thing is interesting. I don't need a 'linear' storytelling form in order to appreciate quality cinema - however, I DO need something more than what smells like a burned out artists' laundry list, disguised as a deep artistic creation.People began leaving the cinema eventually, as the hours trudged by, and endless scenes signifying nothing, kept appearing, which just kept completely defusing any dramatic tension you might have established initially. (Unless you meant to establish boredom by hours of 'meaningful' and 'portentous' dialog).David - I don't know if you've been surrounded by too many people who have been telling you that your every idle thought and foible is of great value, and thus causing you to lose what every artist needs - namely - a good objective perspective on your own creative output, but because I love you and your previous work, I'm taking the time to succinctly and sadly fulfill this critical function that seems to have failed you when you perhaps needed it the most.Listen to me David, I'm not willing to delude myself and try to pretend that what I saw was somehow meaningful or even 'good'. I don't care that you are boring your audience, I do care that you are deluding yourself perhaps, into having made a badly conceived piece of work, and are lowering artistic standards by attempting to make your audience have to pretend to themselves that their justified boredom was somehow 'good' or 'not there'. You are better than what you have created here.The public should be warned - its NOT 'Wild At Heart' 'Eraserhead' 'Blue Velvet' or 'Mulholland Drive' - each of which were truly great stories and even better Cinema. I would suggest that the public should not be fooled by any PR, or any prior goodwill that they justifiably have towards David Lynch, given his cinematic pedigree.'INLAND EMPIRE' is 'disturbing' - not because of its unique vision or storyline or narrative style - but because its so incredibly badly made, so utterly pretentious, narratively boring and incoherent, visually plodding, banal and badly edited, by a director who used to be so damn good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long, Weird and Bizarre Trip to the Edge of the Insanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actress Nikki Grace (Laura Dern) is invited to perform the role of Susan Blue as the lead actress of the movie "On High In Blue Tomorrows", directed by Kingsley Stewart (Jeremy Irons). Nikki's husband is a jealous guy and the co-star is the wolf Devon Berk (Justin Theroux) that will perform Billy Side, the husband of Susan. In the rehearsal, Kingsley tells that the movie is a remake of an unfinished and damned Polish production where the two lead stars had been murdered. While shooting the movie, Nikki has daydreams, mixing her real life with the fictional Susan.I am a big fan of David Lynch; I have watched and enjoyed most of his filmography, but "Inland Empire" is a long, weird and bizarre trip to the edge of the insanity. I do not know whether David Lynch use drugs, but the impression I have he might have used an acid trip to write this messy and non-sense screenplay. The most impressive is that he found producers to finance this movie. The nightmarish atmosphere, the stylish cinematography, the soundtrack and the acting are the good points in this film. However, the story is incomprehensible, impossible to be fully understood. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): "Império dos Sonhos" ("Empire of the Dreams")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what the hell?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i left the theater confused and annoyed. the movie honestly didn't need to be that long. it was entertaining in the fact it kept me guessing. it was one of the first movies of the year to surprise me. i don't know if it was a good surprise or a bad surprise. i know i will prolly never see it again, much like mulholland drive, but honestly i don't see myself gaining much more information a second go around. it was abstract and most of the time out of focus. i do agree that laura dern's performance is one of her best ever. in the end, nothing is resolved. there are no answers, like in some of his other movies. bring back closure David. the best parts were the bunnies, the locomotion, and the convo on Hollywood blvd "you're dying, lady".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>too arty and too boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never understood the concept of arty movies and maybe I'm just too dumb to understand the deep message behind it all but I have to say that movie really sucks! 3 hours of pretty random stuff with mostly noise music.. yea.. I think it's a good movie if you want to play intellectual and impress your girl and explain her the how the lamp or the bunnies symbolize death or whatever but not if you want to have nice evening. And contradictory to the other comment I have to say I didn't like the actors' performance a lot. At some times it really reminded me of 9th grade school theater.. As a friend remarked - Lynch is probably right now searching the internet for deep interpretations and explanations of the stuff he randomly thought up put together in 2 minutes for this movie. The 2 points are for the bunny costumes..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh no not again- I feel lynched</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What might have been attractively strange during my previous first Lynch-experiences, now brings up an "oh no not again"-reaction. And this is the reaction that you just would not want to have when you choose to go to a different movie instead of a normal storyline-movie. Some red curtains. Creepy people. You have no clue what the movie is about. Been there, seen but didn't find it exciting a third time again -that. I saw the movie after a day that I wanted at least some entertainment, but this wasn't any. It is só dark, só depressing, só absurd. There is almost no storyline at all, no 3 sentences in a row without bringing up mystery. And there are at different points in the people dressed up like bunnies doing some ironing. I note it has more conversations than Lost Highway. It's not that I don't like these dark movies by definition, since Mulholland Dr. was one of the best movies I ever saw. There even that you didn't get it completely, at least you had the feeling most of the scenes were somewhat connected. Here this is not the case. Don't go and see it unless you admire Lynch. The you'll enjoy connecting it all to a whole. But for me this was too abstract.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LIsten You Pretentious Hipsters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad it's enough for all of you for a film to stoke your "feelings" and pull you in "emotionally" and that it satisfies you when a director just splashes a bunch of drama and horror and tantalizing imagery onto the screen. It must be wonderful to go through life all loose and feely like that.Don't think about the film, you say, just surrender to the screen! Get some artistic integrity, people. "Coherence" is not an optional element that "artists" can just afford to dispense with. David Lynch is perfectly capable of making a coherent film that still has a strong emotional and visual impact, as anyone who has seen Blue Velvet knows. But he doesn't seem to have been trying too hard to combine those elements since he made that film (except, maybe, for Wild at Heart).If you want emotion and feeling, put on your IPod and listen to your favorite hipster band. A really good film demands more than this sloppy artistic standard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Garbage or Genius?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you had any plans to see it, Inland Empire is the worst POS ever made. It's longer than Titanic and not a single second of it is coherent or makes any sense. I'd rather be stabbed with a screw driver and left bleeding to death on Hollywood boulevard than to see a frame of that movie ever again. AND I AM A David LYNCH FANATIC. It was so bad it undid anything good Lynch ever created previously. I came home after the screening and threw away my copies of Lost Highway, Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive, Eraserhead, Dune and Twin Peaks: Season One. On the flip side of that coin, Inland Empire may be complete genius. I have my suspicion that it is a BS tolerance test designed to see how long the sheeple would remain in their seats based on the strength of the filmmakers reputation. I admittedly did not leave, but watched quietly as half the audience slept through 60% of the film, then erupted into applause at the credits and the arrival of Mr. Lynch to the Q&amp;A that followed. I did not stay to hear David's comments, because after this, he will never again have anything to say that I want to hear.My one line review would read: "I didn't believe in burning films until I saw Inland Empire."</fullReview>
