		<shortDescription>Meryl Streep Italian Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meryl Streep is absolutely astonishing. I forgot it was her ten seconds into the film. That opening breakfast scene where all of her story is written in her magnificent face. As an Italian I know there is no acting involved here. She IS Italian. She reminded me of Anna Magnani in "Bellissima" there is not a single false note. Clint Eastwood, clearly, dedicates the film to her and the results are pure magic. The film is based on an unreadable book- at least I couldn't get through it, in spite of the brevity of the volume - the film however, is bound to become a classic thanks to the powerful chemistry of the stars. If you love film,like I do, I recommend you to see it once and let yourself be taken away by the truths in Meryl's eyes then go again and take note. Look at every one of her moments, from how she closes the refrigerator door to her laughter. Look at her reaction when she discovers that Clint stopped at Bari, her home town, just because he thought the place was pretty. Look at her hands, her walk and then go back to her eyes. It's a treat of the first order. Clint, in front as well as behind the camera,does a miraculous job. I passionately recommend it, no matter how young you are.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The book on which this film is based is a very thin volume, thin in every department. As a matter of fact I gave up after a few pages. The film is something else entirely. Meryl Streep plays an Italian living in rural America and she is out of this world. Her opening scenes at the breakfast table are staggeringly beautiful, it could have been a silent movie, we would've understood and live Francesca's story just by looking into Meryl's beautiful face. Every laugh, every move, every nuance is so Italian and so real that I went to look up her background to see if there was some Italian blood in her. Apparently not, but she reminded me of Anna Magnani and of my mother - she's Italian too, so I should know. Clint Eastwood's performance is tender, powerful and generous. I started going to the movies in the 70's and part of the fascination was to go and see movies with adults doing adult things, behaving and reacting to life the way adults do. "Five Easy Pieces" "Coming Home" "Sophie's Choice" and then the old great old ones from "Sullivan's Travels" to "All About Eve" As a side note I should inform the decision makers that on my second visit to the theater I took five kids with me, two 17 year old boys and three girls, 18, 16 and 16. They went back to see it a few days later with some of their contemporaries. The comment of one of the boys was: "It made me think of things I don't usually think about". He invited his mom to the movies to see "Bridges of Madison County" According to his mother, that was the first time ever, but, as it happens, not the last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A cinematic silk purse from a literary sow's ear ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only managed about two pages of the book before feeling physically ill by the trite dialogue, heavy dependence on cliche and ham fisted, adolescent romance prose style. So a film of the book 'The Bridges of Madison County' did not fill me with joy and pleasureable anticpation.Yet Clint Eastwood has waved a magic wand, and worked wonders on the lack lustre source material, by pairing it down to produce a beautiful, warm film with only one real flaw (more on that later)The film's overwhelming main strength is the casting of Meryl Streep. As Francesca she dissolves into the role - at times her gestures and dialogue seem so natural and unforced it is as if Eastwood had installed a fly-on-the-wall camera into the house of a real Iowan housewife. She lifts the film - which does centre on themes which could appear trite in the wrong hands - to the level of profound piece of art. Her selflessness and devotion to her family, and tortured sense of divided loyalites are presented so powerfully, and so plausibly, that the final scene in the car at the end (those who've seen it will recall immediately what I mean) pulls at your emotions so hard you'd swear it was you who was making the decision. I defy anyone with a pulse not to shed copious amounts of tears at this point --- you would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved on some level by this great, great performance.Clint Eastwood provides good, solid support in the sense that he doesn't overact, and allows Meryl to become the heart of the film. This is a wise decision - part of the terrible weakness of the book was its dependence upon the inane thoughts and ramblings of Robert Kincaid. The film is beautifully directed, beautifully photograhed and beautifully scored - the radio tunes and the non-diegetic Bridges Love theme really enhance the romantic, lush tone and mood of the film.My only problem is with the misguided decision to cast Francesca's older children and flash back periodically to them reading through their Mother's journals. The acting in these parts is mediocre at best, and they detract from the elegance and poignant mastery of Meryl Streep's central performance. The ashes scene at the end is - I feel - necessary for closure, but the rest of the scenes featuring the chldren should have been scrapped. The Francesca and Robert sections stand alone and require no interruption - these other segments cheapen the mastery of Meryl.Above all, this is a film which (on paper) can be dismissed as pure soap opera. But it transcends these potentially trite themes to make a universal story of love, selflessness, devotion and choice, that speaks eloquently to the viewer, no matter what your age or experience. It's a truly heartbreaking tale of transitory experience and the power of memory. It will make you think about your own life, and about your closest family members and relationships.And its finest quality has to be the magic of Meryl Streep who proves, yet again, why she is uniquely the best actress we have ever had. As Clint Eastwood said about casting this role: 'I only made one phonecall'. He knew as you will too - no other actress could have brought so much depth, warmth, beauty, charisma and humanity to this character. As a humble film lover, it's all I can do to applaud her from the depths of my heart. Bravo, Queen Meryl!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meryl from Bari</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the soul of a movie is reflected in an actor's eyes then you have a miracle, you have something that's going to last. Meryl Streep in "The Bridges Of Madison County" is such a miracle to me. I never thought for a moment that she, no matter how wonderful an actress she is, could fool me. Meryl Streep could never be Italian. Well, there I was, thinking and pre-judging like people I detest. I was so wrong. Not just because she fooled me, although there is no fooling involved here. She won me over. I forgot she was Meryl Streep, the actress, and I lived Francesca's story to the fullest because, I suppose, that's the mystery of great acting, I was confronted by her sheer undiluted truth. The truth in her eyes in every one of her gestures. The truth on her brow. Her thinking, transparent. Clint Eastwood does the right thing putting the entire film at her service and placing himself as the foil to liberate that powerful latent side of Francesca. I though it was ironic and I'm not sure if was meant to be that a wonderful woman like Francesca will sacrifice, what could arguably be call the love of her life, for those children. The grown children's mediocrity was kind of shocking to me. Will the revelation of their mother's secret, reveal a latent, greater side to their natures. I hope so. Francesca deserved extraordinary children. Try no to miss this little miracle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the page "The Bridges of Madison County" often read like a reject from Mills and Boon and yet it was tremendously popular. People who normally wouldn't read this sort of thing were not only reading it but quoting it. You could say that for some people it held the kind of camp appeal that bad books sometimes do for the so-called intelligentsia. Personally, I am inclined to think that its tale of middle-aged romance struck a cord. It may not have been well-written but many people recognized in its two central characters a reflection of themselves. It spoke of a great passion and a great loss; a "Brief Encounter" for the nineties. Still, it never quite seemed like a vehicle for Clint Eastwood; (once upon a time you might have envisaged Arthur Hiller doing it), yet here it is, larger than life on the big screen and utterly lovely, utterly heart-breaking.Perhaps Eastwood chose to film it as a vehicle for himself. He wears the mantle of the ageing Lothario perfectly at an age when most romantic leads are played by much younger men, (or are simply non-existent), yet who blanched when Gary Cooper or Cary Grant were wooing Audrey Hepburn well into their old age. Admittedly Eastwood isn't entirely comfortable in this sort of role. He's not a versatile actor. His best performances have been as tortured losers or just old-fashioned tough guys but under his own direction he blossoms here. Of course, the 'romantic' in Eastwood has never been hard to find. You need look only to the scores he has composed. (He has written the main love theme here and his use of classic jazz standards by the likes of Dinah Washington and Johnny Hartman adds considerably to the film's beating heart).What is remarkable is that essentially Eastwood's film is really something of a chamber piece for two players. A few other characters flit into the frame but for most of the time there is no one on screen but Eastwood and co-star Meryl Streep and this is one of Streep's great performances. As Francesca, the woman who finds in Eastwood's photographer Robert the one great passion in her life albeit briefly and at a time when the likelihood of such a thing happening was remote indeed, Streep is extraordinary. Sometimes Streep can overwhelm a project; her versatility doesn't always work in favour of lesser material. But here she seems to have tapped quite effortlessly, not just into the consciousness of her character, but into her very soul as well. And if that sounds cheesy, let me assure you it isn't. Cheesiness isn't in Streep's vocabulary, even if it is in mine! Perhaps Eastwood was able to discern in Robert James Waller's novel the seeds of a great love story or perhaps he just felt he could bring his artistry to bear on some unlikely source material. Whatever, it's paid off. On screen "The Bridges of Madison County" is a great love story; there won't be a dry eye in the house.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never give up hoping for something better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched this movie yesterday evening and it had a great effect on me.In my opinion this movie is outstanding because it reflects an average life,which is then becoming a really extraordinary one,representing that everyone's life can change from one moment to the other.And I think this meaning tells something to everyone,because everyone has dreams that seem that one can't fulfill,but this story says the opposite,so that at any time can come an opportunity that you have to recognize and be brave enough not to release.Another thing is that you may have to live your whole life in only four days and you have to be able to live it so that after it you can say that you had a really wonderful life. My favorite part of the movie was when Robert was leaving and the two cars were staying at the lamps one behind the other...it was a very touching scene,I think. So to draw the conclusion:I can recommend to everyone to watch the movie THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY because after watching it you're getting an other state of mind,a better one,that doesn't allows you to give up hoping for a better life...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly sensitive film that Eastwood does well to keep away from the usual sentimental clichés of the weepy genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Francesca Johnson passes away, her grown children are puzzled to learn that she wishes to be cremated and her ashes scattered from a local bridge rather than being buried next to her husband. Their puzzlement turns to surprise and shock when they read their mother's secret journals and read about an affair she had had many years ago with a photographer who came to the area for a few days.I had seen this film many years ago in the cinema when it came out and had only average memories of it. With it coming onto TV recently, I wasn't sure if I'd bother because I had the idea in my head that this was a rubbish weepy but decided to go for it anyway. I am glad that I do not just make assumptions about films based on genre because my memory had tricked me in regards this film and in fact it was surprisingly good. I'm not generally a weepy fan but this is not what you think a weepy will be. Reading the plot summary and watching the film itself, it is clear how easily this could have fallen into sweeping sentiment and unbearable mush and it is to Eastwood's credit that it never does. Even as the plot sees the lovers falling into idealised romance, the film never does and it is the cool, calm direction that keeps it from being this way. Some will see this as 'excusing' the affair but I don't think it does ? affairs happen because the grass is greener and that is just what this film does; it seems romantic and idyllic but that's because it is meant to be. I'm the last person to try and defend having affairs but I don't think that this film did this but I can understand why people would dislike it for doing this.Without the mush, what is left is a film that is refreshingly free of sentiment and is able to deliver a grown up romance that is genuinely touching. This is seen in the honest chemistry between Francesca and Robert; sometimes things like this happen ? two people just click, nothing has to be massively wrong in the relationship for it to happen. The film avoids easy shots (like making the husband be a real idiot) and just tries to show us why these two fell for one another so quickly. It isn't perfect of course and it is still a weepy of sorts ? some of the dialogue is a bit self-consciously 'deep' for my liking but generally it was an adult telling of an adult romance ? no corny ending, no sweeping score or clichéd effort to pump the audience for sentiment, instead I found it genuine and, as cold hearted a b*stard as I am, I was moved by the film.I am a fan of Clint Eastwood and this film was a real pleasant surprise as it showed how able he is as a director and performer. I have already praised his work as director but he also turns in an unshowy and natural performance in the lead. Streep has never totally won me over and I often felt that doing an accent is not the same as giving a performance. Here her accent put me off at first but generally she is good and shows suitable restraint in depicting her character. She suffers a bit from having to deliver a narration that occasionally contains sentimental dialogue but she does well despite this. The support cast is OK but really contributions from Corley and Slezak are no more than distractions from the main show which is a collection of natural scenes between the two leads and no one else.Overall, I consider this film a reason to not just watch any specific genre of movie and reject films simply because 'those aren't my type of things'. I was pleasantly surprised by a film that is romantic without being sentimental or mushy; idealistic without being unrealistic; moving without being sickly. True it may not be everyone's idea of a great film (nothing goes bang and there are no car chases) but I liked it a lot more than I had expected and if you want to see an adult love story then you could do a lot worse than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meryl Streep received her first Academy Award nomination for the stunning war drama "The Deer Hunter" (1978). The following year, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Dustin Hoffman's wife, Joanna, in "Kramer vs. Kramer". She earned the Best Actress Award for "Sophie's Choice" (1982), and was nominated for another Oscar for her outstanding performance as real-life Karen Silkwood... In all, she has received 13 Academy Award nominations, the most recent for her supporting role opposite Nicolas Cage and Chris Cooper in the fascinating film 'Adaptation.'In 'The Bridges of Madison County,' Streep stars as Francesca, a conventional wife of an Iowa farmer... Francesca cares for her family with all her heart, as she has done for years... She describes herself as "happily married," but nevertheless falls easily into a chaste but tender affair with a charismatic wandering photographer on assignment for National Geographic magazine in the fall of 1965... Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) stops at Francesca's farm to ask for directions... While close-ups provide Streep's intimate thoughts, some women lost patience with her indecision and reticence...Francesca, although nervous by the attention of the courteous visitor, but guilty about being unfaithful to her passionless Iowa husband, finds out a mystical attraction for the top photographer who has come to Madison County to take pictures of the local covered bridges... Francesca was at home, alone, her husband and two children having gone for four days to the Illinois state fair...Francesca and Robert talk about their lives and their old dreams, and as their relationship grows, they both find themselves drawn to each other, falling deeply and immediately in love... Their true love strikes at the heart of everyone... 'In a universe of ambiguity, this kind of certainty comes only once.'The suffocating rain sequence has to go down as one of the most poignant in cinematic history, beautifully complemented by a soundtrack resonating with a melancholic piece of blues and piano... Every performance in the movie is backed up by a truthful, believable script full of real, everyday people... The poignancy of each moment is underscored by an unforgettable choice of romantic melodies... The motion picture, nominated for the César Awards in France, is another example of Eastwood's exceptional style as both a filmmaker and as an actor...As a filmmaker, Eastwood proves his comprehension of the secret of romance novels, showing sensuously, and sensitively the way people feel and think when they are really in love... As an actor, he is very convincing as the loner with much to share... Although his travels have taken him far across the 'other side of the world,' he still looks cleverly back on his life...His film gives us the passion between two lovers, but also life's compromises and regrets... It is a realistic portrait of a man and a woman who love the memories they share... It is a sensitive exploration of feelings which grows into something neither one can get free... It is an invitation to consider what might have been missed or lost in our life... Meryl Streep is heartbreaking as a lonely woman surrounded by family... We truly feel her pain and desperation... She fights with all the love, hope, frustration and responsibility... She is someone whose dreams of coming to America have not been fulfilled by the tedious reality of her life in Winterset, Iowa... Her busy life is filled with details but has nothing that truly excites her anymore... She is forever altered by a chance encounter.. Her emotional range is enormous and her laughter is as charged with energy as her tears... But you never doubt the truth of what she's feeling... As the pair reveal their own lives through each other, a connection is made, and in just four fateful days, they find one another and commit themselves to each other for a lifetime even though they remain apart...We all dream of the chance meeting, that particular time when we really feel we are enjoying life... But love never obey our expectations... Robert and Francesca, couldn't stay together physically, but their love was so strong that lasted forever as Francesca grew old on the farm and Robert traveled the world... Women love romanticism and never seem to get enough... And true love is possible, even in the scope of a life of compromise, and in the middle of nowhere, on the far side of any age...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie of one of the best movies I have ever seen. Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood really did a great job in this movie. for him to come in and change her life in just four days is amazing. To fall in love with some one in just four days is just wonderful to me. I watch it on Starz, and it played everyday for a week and I watch it every day it came on. she was a strong lady to stay there and be unhappy for all of those years. It is simply a beautiful movie. I love the part when he was picking flowers for her and she told him that the flowers were poison and then she started to laugh, that was hilarious to me. Because just in the few minutes she had know him he brought out something in her something that has not been released. She was more herself in this movie.I would surely recommend this movie to some one else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I admire the likes of Woody Allen, Chaplin and Clint Eastwood (just to name a few), who possess(ed) the chops to write, direct AND act. They're complete artists, and I wish I could be like that (I'll be already too happy if I can ever achieve my life passion of writing and directing, though, since my acting would be less convincing than Owen Wilson playing Hamlet). Even though Eastwood didn't write this (Richard LaGravenese did it beautifully, based on a novel by Robert James Waller), he does a good job in front of the camera while also directing this human encounter between a photographer (played by himself) and an Italian housewife (Meryl Streep, magnificent) in 1960s Iowa. Their four days together would change their lives forever. The premise doesn't sound too original, but Eastwood wonderfully captures all the raw emotions between these people, who seem throughly genuine, alive, and passionate. Lennie Niehaus' beautiful music score helps enhance the romantic atmosphere, and the slow pace is never a bore since it's necessary to make you live those brief but special moments with them. From westerns to female boxers to jazz musicians to war dramas, Clint Eastwood knows how to tell a good story, and "The Bridges of Madison County" ranks among his best. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, technically the movie was well filmed and had some lovely cinematography, but it was also obviously written to tug on the heartstrings of those viewers easily given to sentimental mush.***Spoiler to follow***My biggest beef is with the story, itself, and the message it gives. Here we have a middle-aged bored housewife who's going through a midlife crisis and longs for some excitement. So what else is new? I'm middle-aged and I'd like some excitement, too, please. Enter our rugged traveling photographer, Clint Eastwood, and, a few screws later, our housefrau has now found the love of her eternal life????? Of course she's horny for him: he's exciting, adventurous, a deep-thinker, poetic - but very selfish and crappy family material. Meanwhile, her devoted husband of umpteen years, who is not abusive in any way and has stood by her through thick and thin takes the back seat because he's...well, boring. As a married man of 10 years with 2 children, I guess this gives me free license to dump my wife and kids if I suddenly wake up one morning and find them tedious in comparison to some hot new chick that really turns me on. It also makes me feel really good to know that, right now, my wife is probably fantasizing about dumping me for some rugged, exciting, outdoorsy type.This is basically another Jack and Rose Titanic situation, where the audience is deliberately kept from the reality of what would happen if these two shmucks really did get together. Namely, Clint would dump Meryl when he got tired of having sex with her or Meryl would dump Clint when she finally figured out what a twit he was. Well, it's nice to know that they will be stuck with each other for eternity - under a bridge of Madison County.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once in every life....someone comes along</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Closeup on a mailbox: Mr. and Mrs. Richard Johnson. Behind it, a dusty road leading through green fields, a minivan coming towards the camera and a pan over towards an isolated farmhouse. It's the present, and Michael and Carolyn have come to settle some issues regarding their mother's estate. It seems that their mother wanted her ashes scattered from a nearby covered bridge, which startles her two grown kids, particularly the seemingly very conservative and religious Michael. Turns out that Francesca had her reasons, as they find out when they open her cedar chest and turn to the diaries contained within...Late summer 1965, and Francesca, an Iowa housewife in her mid-40s is seeing her husband and kids off to the Illinois State Fair. They'll be gone for 5 days and she'll have little to do but be bored in a different way than she usually is, until the arrival the next morning of a lost National Geographic photographer, Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood). Kincaid is on assignment to photograph the covered bridges that the county is famed for, and Francesca tries to tell him the way to the Roseman bridge but quickly decides to show him the way personally instead. As they drive towards the bridge and make small talk, they seem uneasy at first - but when Robert mentions Francesca's accent, and she finds that he has visited the town where she grew up in Italy, something starts to click. He reaches for a cigarette from the glove compartment and brushes her leg...later he picks flowers for her....they have the same favorite radio station, playing blues and jazz. Francesca starts to see something special, exotic....Robert sees someone warm and real, centered but more than the simple housewife that she's let herself become.So begins four days of falling in love, four days of uncertainty, secretive glances, shyness turning to boldness, feelings long-buried in both reawakened and examined by two people smart enough to know right away how problematic an affair can be, yet willing to cast aside the doubts and damn the consequences. For now. The brilliance of The Bridges of Madison County isn't in any kind of originality, and it isn't in the bits of Waller's strained prose that occasionally leech through LaGravenese's generally excellent screenplay; it isn't in Streep's accent, which I know some have problems with but which I barely even notice at this point; and it isn't in the framing story, which again has grown on me over time but is certainly not all that interesting itself. What makes the film magical is the chemistry, the feeling of absolute rightness between the two leads, and the slow building towards an inevitable yet still heartbreaking decision.Clint Eastwood certainly must have seemed an odd choice to take on this film, which he co-produced and co-wrote the elegiac "Doe Eyes" theme for in addition to directing and starring - even to me, a big fan already at the time, it seemed odd. Robert Redford seemed to be everybody's idea of Kincaid, and Steven Spielberg got mentioned often as a possible director, but I doubt many people will have problems after they see the film. Eastwood's Robert is a sensitive guy, but he's not schmaltzy, a poetic man but not pretentious about it, and a man clearly as unsure about the concept of love and the kind of risk he puts himself into as the married Francesca. He's a traveler and a loner, but deep down there's something missing, something we can feel almost from the beginning, something seen in the long gaze out the window near the end, and as he stands in the rain, waiting and hoping, at the film's emotional climax. And Eastwood the director keeps things from getting out of hand sentimentally until the last half hour, when both he and the audience know it's time for the tears to flow.But as good as Clint is - and this is surely one of his two or three best performances - Meryl Streep is just a marvel here. Overlook the accent - whether you like it or not, it really isn't terribly important here - and you see a less mannered, more natural performance than she's given anywhere else. She mentions a couple of times in the making-of piece that accompanies the film on DVD that she was uncertain at first of Eastwood's quick shooting style, but it does wonders for her, giving a spontaneity that she really needed for the role. So much of the film relies on us believing that these are two hesitant, uncertain people with a yearning that at first has no direction - it can't seem studied, and it doesn't. And for a film that is set mostly in a kitchen and around barn-like red covered bridges, there's an excitement and intensity that can't be matched in most romances shot under the Eiffel Tower or in front of the Golden Gate Bridge. The technical aspects - Jack N. Green's lovely September-October photography and the wonderful Eastwood-chosen musical mixture of Johnny Hartman and Dinah Washington, among others - are just about perfect as well.What the film ultimately builds to - and much of it is on Streep's shoulders - is a powerful examination of regret and loss and a determination that there are no perfect choices in life, only choices that involve different kinds of sacrifices. The film doesn't comment on the rightness or wrongness of her adultery, but Francesca lets her kids know that whatever she's done, she's not going to beat herself up over it - and neither should they. At the end, we know that whatever choice she made would have been difficult, would have involved hurting herself and others; there's no easy answer, only a bit of hope for the next generation, as they at least have come to accept and understand, and Francesca's ashes scatter on the wind....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful scenery does not make a beautiful romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I don't condone infidelity, affairs can make for great cinema. However, not in this movie despite featuring two stars, Meryl Steep and Clint Eastwood, whose talents are wasted here. Streep's at times compelling performance is expended on a film which manipulates viewer emotions so they don't see this affair for what it is. It shouldn't be considered a great love story just because it's the wife who is cheating on the husband, not the reverse. It is not poignant, sensitive, and romantic (as often described) but instead involves boredom, lust, and naive schoolgirl thinking far more than genuine love. Yes, it does have wonderful cinematography but viewers shouldn't confuse the beauty of the Iowa scenery as indicating that this illicit relationship was in any way beautiful. When you get past the acting and the scenery...Here we have a housewife, Francesca, longing to travel and bored with her faithful, hard working, and decent but dull farmer husband and unexciting country life. While her husband is off at the State Fair with their teenage children, she has an affair with a stranger who chances her way, a ruggedly handsome, world traveling photographer named Robert. She foolishly concludes, after a few conversations and sexual encounters (some of which occur in the marital bed she shares with her husband, not exactly endearing), that her new man, a charismatic wanderer, is her true love. Of course her husband 'doesn't understand her' but her lover, who has known her for a few days, is her soul mate who understands her completely. (Would viewers be as sympathetic to a man whose wife didn't understand him, who had an affair because he suddenly found his soul mate and contemplated leaving his family so he could go off with his lover to follow his dreams???) From the onset Francesca is miserable living in a house in the middle of nowhere but she has only herself to blame. Wasn't she aware when she married him that her husband was a farmer, that they would be living in the country?? There would have been hobbies and interests she could have pursued, even living in the country, where she might have found some degree of fulfillment and which wouldn't have upset her husband, especially given that her children were getting older all the time so likely to permit her more freedom. Francesca should have discussed her needs, wants, and dreams WITH HER HUSBAND! Admittedly he wasn't exactly sensitive but neither did he appear to be a monster who would have cared nothing about his wife's unhappiness, had she made him aware of the full extent of it. She never really made much effort to open her heart up to him. While she did remain with her family, playing the self sacrificing martyr and suffering for years in silence are not admirable, IMO. She stoically 'did her duty' but never attempted to make anything better of her marriage.Who is to say that if she had gone off with Robert, he wouldn't have dumped her when she started to bore him? Having one failed marriage behind him and a history of reluctance to commit, he didn't come across to me as a very promising life partner. If Robert had really loved Francesca, he would have thought of her best interests instead of selfishly encouraging her to abandon her children. The dancing scene where they end up in bed comes across as a cliché seduction, nothing original or memorable. The truck scene in the rain is supposedly so moving but how can anyone sympathize with a woman even considering leaving her teenage children for her lover of four days? Unwisely, Francesca chooses to write a tell-all journal about the affair to be read by her adult children after her death, requesting that her ashes be scattered off a particular covered bridge to join her lover's ashes. I found this neither romantic nor touching but selfish and pointless, serving only to upset and potentially hurt her adult children. If she and Robert genuinely had this great love, surely it wouldn't have required some grand romantic mingling of their ashes off that bridge to prove it. Of course these children, a rather uninspiring pair who contributed nothing positive to this movie, quickly become understanding and are not (as would be more believable) devastated about their mother's infidelity and especially learning that their father wasn't her true love. In fact, we're to believe this revelation actually helped them sort out their own romantic messes. The modern Hollywood message, I guess.Had she not chosen to risk hurting her children with her after-death revelations, I might have felt some sympathy for Francesca wasting so much of her life based on four days of the romantic, exciting, passionate early phase of a new relationship, foolishly pining for a man who likely would have brought her unhappiness even if she had been free.Those who want a truly moving film about an affair should watch the 1945 Brief Encounter. It has class. Much the same idea -- bored middle-aged housewife has short term liaison with exciting new man but unlike this film, the wife realizes what she does have in her husband and, contrary to the cliché about not being understood, relates her tale as though addressing her husband, the only person in the world who would understand. It perfectly contrasts committed married love versus the excitement of a new romance. And its heroine, a very sympathetic character, would NEVER have deliberately hurt her adult children for such a pointless whim as the ashes. Alas, Bridges is no Brief Encounter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Understated Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an understated romanctic film. This is probably down to the competent directing from Eastwood, and the exceptional acting ability of Streep, which she executes without much effort - at least it appears that way! Streep's character, Francesca, who is somewhat of a dreamer, was in search of an illusionary life, which was unobtainable, mainly because it only existed inside her head of fantasies. Indeed, the fantasy of the romance is only her interpretation of it via her journals. In reality, her romantic interlude would have turned sour because it would not live up to her expectations in everyday life, just as her idea of the American way of life didn't, being married to an ordinary farming lad.As an Italian homemaker, Francesca is stereotyped from the start as the opera loving romantic, cooking breakfast for a largely unappreciative family in a mundane world, which she once viewed through rose tinted spectacles, whilst daydreaming back home in Italy.The film's message is that romance can be deceptive, in that it misleads women into mundane lives that bear no reality to what they have been taught about it. But, women who crave romance, should demand it, and not be afraid to ask for it, or to admit to liking it for that matter. This is what Francesca should have done with her husband.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Francesca Johnson" (Meryl Streep), is a housewife who left her dreams for caring for her husband, and raise her two children in a small farm in the lost Madison County. The arrival of a photographer for the National Geographic "Robert Kincaid" (Clint Eastwood), a weekend that her family is out, will open the eyes and hearts to a world buried in years of routine, and it will entail hidden feelings that come into conflict with the person who has been so far.With this simple, and austere history, Clint Eastwood is confirmed as one of directors living larger American cinema and reveals to him as a filmmaker multifaceted and minimalist sensitivity, capable of portraying aspect with more than poetic the simple emotion of two human beings.The sensitive direction of Eastwood returns to give meaning to that expression of "small is great" something as simple as the face of it discovering that is being desired and admired, when he is photographing in the bridges. Or that hand undecided on the door of the car, which shows a scene that rubs the prodigious in regard to containment stylistic and emotional tear. And of course the scene best remembered for "The Bridges of Madison County" that is the scene of the rain with nothing more and nothing less than Clint crying.Particularly in the film is gently until the end, leaving the talent of the actors speaks for itself, without further excuse argument that the miracle of a love matched in the twilight of life.There are also emphasizing the fantastic photography, the soundtrack, and the ambiance."The Bridges of Madison County ", one of the best films of Eastwood, is already a classic modern of the few there in the 1990. And Clint Eastwood demonstrated once again that is one of the great masters and that fault of the very well-deserved awards for "unforgiven," films like it or as "A perfect world" passed with more penalties to glory in regard to awards when they were of the best films of its respective years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolutely terrible "romance" movie! Is it just me, or is love no longer a part of romance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bridges of Madison County is probably the worst so-called romance movie I have ever seen. If you disagree answer these questions: Why would Francesca believe he loves her? Because of a few "lines" professing his, what? Great opportunity? His good times with her? What he said was "This kind of certainty comes but once in a lifetime." What was "certain" about it? Was it more "certain" than the wife he divorced without regret? Romance note, before you trash your life, such as it is, and run off with someone who has managed to abandon one marriage, and looks down on commitment in general, AT LEAST know that he loves you! And if he really does, he will NOT ask you to abandon your children!Another question; What exactly did he see in her? What was so special and different to leave him without sense enough to come in from the rain? Are these two "soul-mates," or is she just a woman who needs to feel loved and frustrated enough with her life to have sex with a total stranger. Was the sex sooooo life altering that he was willing to finally settle down? Passion and love, let's not confuse the two, one can last four days, perhaps a week, maybe a year... the other a lifetime. Sure, drop everything and go... he's got nothing to lose, while she'll lose what little she has. That is NOT romance, it's sad. It's insulting. The more you think about it, the more his "certainty" plays like a pickup line.And when did these DEEP LASTING emotions develop, from the 3 or 4 conversations they had? While driving along in the truck? Or was it when they were soiling the sheets in the bed where she was to sleep with her husband? Which brings me to the issue of infidelity, and the dim view of marriage in general? He doesn't seem to value it, she "suffers" through it. In this lopsided "romantic" story there's scarcely a happy couple to be found, let alone happily married one. As a GUY who LOVES romance, please, PLEASE do not accept this counterfeit tripe of an offering as real romance. Hollywood has gotten so lazy as to toss us a scrap and expect us to gobble it up as fillet! A man who asks a woman to leave her husband, and her kids who are "almost grown" is thinking of himself. A REAL man, and REAL love would offer to do whatever you wanted to make YOU happy. He would say I cannot bear to lose you BEFORE you had to have a conniption-fit in the kitchen. HE would be devastated on that last day BEFORE you served breakfast, before you did anything, and would take you by the hand and ask you to sit down, and with a lump in his throat the size of Iowa look you in the eyes and ask, "What are WE going to do?" THAT is romance. It's not a 4-day teenage fling with older actors. It's no-matter-what, 'till the end, 'till death do us part!HUSBANDS listen up! Your wives are quietly telling you something. Get busy and do your duty as a husband. Sure she's adjusted her life for you, sometimes sacrificially, but you are bound to do all within your power to see that she is happy and fulfilled! She should feel LOVED!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful love story... that's the way the movie was described to me.After seeing it, I couldn't understand where the love story part came in.All I saw was a woman who was unfaithful to her good husband while he was away for four days.The idea, I guess is that she was "dying inside" and that her life was empty and devoid of passion.If her marriage was that bad, she had other choices, other than violating her marriage vows.If I sound bitter, it is because this happened to me.This movie/story has a deep meaning for me, because my wife had an affair with a stranger.Now I have to question what love is, or what is meant by people when they talk about "true love".Why do people get married? Why do they take vows? I thought that I had found true love, that's why I married my wife and that's why I thought she accepted the idea to be my wife and grow old with me.So, NO...

End of story. Cheating is no romance, no matter the "sweetness" in which it is couched. I don't care about the cinematography, I don't care about the covered bridges (and the cinematography and scenery were very nice, it's just not the point). Cheating on your husband is just NOT romantic. And staying with your husband and kids is no great sacrifice. This movie disgusted me.

		<shortDescription>A Sad Comment On The Times</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a popular movie from an even-more popular book, and it was particularly attractive to women. It deals with an adulterous relationship. Apparently, that's okay if it's the woman is doing the cheating on the husband! Yeah, a photographer (Clint Eastwood) comes by and has a fling for a few days with a housewife...and this was supposed to be a "wonderful, feel-good film?" Yeah, those are the adjectives I read over and over from sick national critics. What a comment on their morals as well everyone who thought this was just great. Yes, times have changed, and the film industry many times leads the way in showing bad to be good and vice-versa. I did not know what the film was about, only read the rave reviews, and spent my money on it. What a mistake. Meryl Streep plays bored Iowa housewife and mother, "Francesca," who jumps in the sack with a perfect stranger after her husband and kids go away to the county fair for four days. Wow, that's admirable of her! Gosh, this story is so "sensitive, romantic, poignant, brilliant, breathtaking, beautiful, timeless, warm and fuzzy," etc. Those are just some of the headlines here in these user comments. I'm not kidding. It brought many women "to tears." Wow, I just hope guys don't marry those women.To those people who think this is so warm, fuzzy and romantic, I wonder what your reaction would be if that was YOUR husband or wife cheating on you?I was sorry to see Eastwood and Streep be a part of this schlock. Eastwood should stick to his tough-guy roles and leave this kind of nonsense to Hugh Grant.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing movies, especially tragedies that send people to tears, is one of my favorite activities, the best way, when I fell mentally exhausted, to relax deep pressure from heavy studying and to recharge myself spiritually with powerful energy. When eighteen years old, I sent myself a birthday gift, seeing a motion picture, "The Bridges of Madison County " and it has impressed me a lot still now, in the turns of empathy and encouragement. "The Bridges of Madison County" is about the four-day love affair between an Italian woman, married and middle-aged, living in rural America, who had ardent soul long been inactive and a romantic photographer who has been looking for what he really wants. Francesca is absolutely wonderful because of her beautiful face, every smile, every move, and every expression and of being so wise to deal with the dilemma. " I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one." she said. She is everything but a common woman. It seems ridiculous that l get supporting powers from this drama. Like many, loving this movie, fanatical about its scenario, I have not only seen this cinema but also read the novel of the same name again and again. I appreciate Francesca's compromising in the dilemma between ideals and reality and have compassion on her giving up this kind of certainty that comes once in a lifetime. However, a master in English drama tells me "True love is you feel happy when you see she is blessed, even because of someone." Finally, I realize Francesca's hoping her family, save her, in happiness, which is worth her all-out effort. In conclusion, this movie leads me to treasure our family and the bliss we hold in hands and to realize human's affection and emotion more deeply. As a result, I honestly commend everyone to see it, no matter how young she or he is.</fullReview>

This movie was basically just what I expected, NOT WORTH WATCHING. I don't understand why anyone under any circumstance would condone a wife cheating on her husband? I felt badly for the husband she was cheating on, he was a descent man and did not deserve a wife who was so lose. If she wanted to sleep around she should have gotten divorced.

		<shortDescription>Before Sunrise, middle-age version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersThe challenge in making The Bridges of Madison County is to convince the audience that spending four days together out of their entire lives, a man and a woman can be so deeply in love that they, separately, wanted their cremated ashes to be spread over the bridge where they first met.Over the 135 minutes of this movie (which by the way never felt too long to this viewer) director Client Eastwood goes about this formidable task. (I have not read the book so these comments are confined solely to the movie). It's a normal, contended if not outrageously happy family, with nearly-grown-up kids, and a cordial if a little stagnant marriage, when Francesca (Meryl Streep) faces the prospect of spending four days by herself in the farm house when the family goes to a country fair. In comes globe-trotting loner National Geographic photographer Robert (Clint Eastwood), a little lost in search of a covered bridge he is hoping to shoot. In a way, there is a little similarity to Before Sunrise, in that two complete strangers in a chance meeting suddenly click, realizing how much they enjoy each other's company and conversation, and carry on to develop a deep relationship within a very limited time. Obviously, there is a big difference, that would put TBOMC more in the category of Interlude (1968) (which, by the way, I consider to be the best in the 'brief encounter' genre). But somehow, I tend to associate it more with Before Sunrise.Upon showing Robert the bridge, Francesca is actually a little bit annoyed that right away, this man become so absorbed with it that he seems to have forgotten about her. Streep portrayed that feeling beautifully, particularly in the tone of her voice, when she says something to the effect of 'I can wait, I have time', more to herself than to Robert. But then, annoyance becomes attraction, as we recall the general belief (albeit somewhat male-centered) that to a woman, a man is most attractive when he is fully absorbed in his work. The relationship develops in a wonderfully relaxed pace, with dropping her off home, 'care to come in for a coffee?', 'would you like to stay for dinner?'??..all nice and friendly until Robert asks one question too many, although quite innocently, 'ever thought of leaving your husband?' Even with profuse apologies, the parting was a little shadowed.Calming down, Francesca reflects that she might have reacted too strongly, drives to the bridge in darkness and leaves a note to invite Robert back to dinner the following day. After seeing the note, Robert calls to accept the invitation, but asks Francesca to join him at the bridge at twilight as he wants to do some work there first. They then separately carry on with the day, Francesca going to buy a new dress for the occasion while Robert goes about with his business. But then, at lunch, he witnesses how a woman known to be having an affair is received in the restaurant (this is one of those small communities where everybody knows what everybody else is doing). Concerned that being seen with him might compromise Francesca, he calls her to give her the opportunity to back out. She seems unperturbed, they meet at the bridge, nothing untoward happens. As Robert continues to handle their relationship in a most considerate and gentlemanly manner, Francesca's attraction to him deepens. We see how she is erotically aroused as she baths in the tub where Robert has just showered, and finally puts on her alluring new dress and comes down to the kitchen, looking like an entirely different person from the earthy country housewife she has been. The spark that sets the whole thing on fire is a call from a neighbour, simply to ask how she has been managing with the family away. As the phone is on the wall right behind where Robert is sitting, Francesca's hand comes gently down to rest on Robert's shoulder as she speaks, and he responds by putting his hand over hers. The rest is history, so to speak. They spend their third day together, a day very much reminiscent of 'interlude'. Cold reality hits on the morning of the fourth and last day and Francesca is that close to running away with Robert. We have seen how Francesca is attracted to Robert, first by his dedication and talents, then by his gentlemanly consideration and kindness. What is less convincing is the feelings on Robert's part. Indeed, Francesca has asked the same question, that since Roberts has readily admitted that he has close women friends in various cities, what makes Francesca in Madison County any different? To be fair, Eastwood's acting has contributed much towards making Robert's feelings towards Francesca convincing. Ultimately, it's up to the audience whether they want to be convinced or not.TBOMC had one Oscar nomination, Streep's (which was one of her 13 Oscar acting nominations, 10 lead and 3 supporting, in her career so far). She lost to Susan Sarandon, a deserved winner for Dead Man Walking.</fullReview>

They discover pictures taken in 1965 and her emotional affair with famed National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) whose ashes were scattered from the bridge. Her kids read her accounts of those four days. Her family went to the Illinois state fair. Robert was on assignment to film the bridge and stopped to ask directions from Italian war bride Francesca.It's a simple bittersweet story. Director Clint Eastwood doesn't add anything overtly melodramatic. Meryl Streep is pitch-perfect. She's an expert on calibrating her accents but it's her every simple gesture that is so precise. She could teach an acting class from this movie. The story is basically laid out in the first ten minutes before either Streep or Eastwood is even on the screen. That is its most obvious drawback. It's not a movie of twists and mysteries. It is however a movie of emotional depth and her children are a big part of it.</fullReview>

For what seems like forever, I have known that this is the quintessential "chick flick" that makes women swoon and cry. Huh?I found it formulaic and foolish. Hmmm, 4 days? Four days, you decide that a guy ambling through town is the love of your life? Hollywood is pathetic. I kept trying to care about these people and about the cliché'd housewife who agonizes over whether to leave her husband and her children and run off with a guy she just met. We love and romanticize what we don't have and take for granted what we do. --Especially since we only see their best side in the beginning, while trying to compare that with the reality in which we live. Hollywood loves and elevates the superficial and denigrates truth and reality. It's possible that the only way lovers like these could remain in love with such a fantasy is precisely because they never dealt with real life together. It might not have been so romantic. Maybe they would even have discovered that they weren't as compatible as they thought. Still, the mysterious man of the world "that got away" is what makes women cry. I'll tell you what I find romantic. The couple who has been through hell and back together and still get butterflies at the sight of one another.On top of all of that.......Streep is overrated in this.

		<fullReview>The Bridges of Madison County is a moving commentary on the shades of love. It portrays a beautiful struggle between the currents of Agape and Phileo in defining our relationships, esp the ones we want to last. For the uninitiated, Agape and Phileo are both translated love in English, yet are love of different natures.Agape is a love of choice not conditional on feelings or reciprocity. It is an act of self sacrifice to serve the recipient of our love. Phileo on the other hand is the spark, the 'falling in love' of our times, driven by attraction and pleasant feelings, driven by a sense of certainty of the present emotion, powerful and blinding enough to be willing forget our past commitments and to turn our lives upside down.Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for another.Are you in love with your spouse? Or are you at a point where you are telling your spouse, that you have 'fallen in love' with someone else? What shade of love do Francesca and Robert, in the movie, decide as superior? Which shade of love do you think should colour up the portrait of our marriages and our relationships?I guess it all comes down to what values we chose to live by, the temporal and existential, or the eternal and lasting.</fullReview>

His 19th movie as director is a very good drama that shows how much he had matured as a film director at this juncture. Meryl Streep, 19 years his junior, is an Iowa farm housewife who packs her kids off to the state fair with dad to enter their prize cow in a contest. Little does anyone suspect, she would encounter a man, a National Geographic Photographer covering bridges.The weakest part of this film is the beginning where the kids are grown up and at moms after she died wondering why she suddenly wants to be cremated. This is the weakest part of the film. Streep &amp; Eastwood &amp; the central story are great. The film has the looks of a picture post card.

		<shortDescription>intensity of the moment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the only film ever that made me cut a telephone call short for I would not want to stop the film. It is a romantic movie that restricts the technical film-making to the minimum preserving the intimacy of the scenes. The two lead actors, Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood both have the ability to leave it to their gestures and faces to create the intensity of the moment, make the viewer feel the inner action. Consequently the outstanding scene, shot in a car waiting at a red light, needs no talking, pure moving pictures. Almost with every scene the film makes you believe that what you see will happen now, cannot be missed and will be gone forever with the next frame. The drama is presented as one big flashback from the children's perspective. One may argue that this destroys the viewer's perspective and excitement now and then. However it does make the point that this is a once-in-a-lifetime story, there is an end to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A simple, beautiful story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was speaking to a friend about relationships and she made a comment about this film some months ago. I found it whilst channel hopping on Channel 4 and recorded it on my sky+ box. I watched it yesterday and have to admit that I cried. I rarely watch a film and not move throughout it but I did with this one. I urge anyone that hasn't seen it to watch it, the love story that comes from it is beautiful and Meryl Streep's performance is so awesome, she draws you into the story and keeps you there until the very end. My favourite scenes are those in the kitchen when she is preparing the meal for her family, her mannerisms, her eyes and her expressions are all fabulous. " I couldn't wait for them to leave". My emotions ran away with me when the affair ends and she sees Robert Kincaid whilst out with her husband, I was wishing and praying that she would open the car door and run away with him into the sunset. I would recommend this film to anyone. It's become one of my all time favourites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you see the movie "bridges of madison county" based on Robert James Waller's novel you feel enthralled and ashamed at the same time.Enthralled by the sheer magnitude of the canvas the writer and director employ and the timeless beauty and truth of the story.Ashamed because although you want the lovers united but at the same time you feel that as the children of Francesca you would have reacted in much the same manner.That in essence is the beautiful truth that is Bridges of madison county ,the novel as well as the movie.The power of movies is reflected in the hold this gem has over you despite just two real characters going through a small period in their lives very much as any two individuals would do confronted by similar circumstances.Clint Eastwood's direction is so underplayed that it does not take anything away from the two protagonists.To say that both Streep and Eastwood are brilliant would be the understatement of the century as these two thespians cannot help being anything but.There is no feeling of disappointment or 'what if?',everything plays out as it probably would nine times out of ten.Going through the production notes of the DVD I read a line by Eastwood which more or less sums up the greatness of Streep. He writes about the casting of Francesca and says very succinctly "I made only one call." My only reason for giving a 9 is that I never wanted the movie to end which it unfortunately does after 135 minutes.It's no wonder that Streep has been time and again acclaimed as the greatest ever ,this despite the presence of Robert De Niro,Jack Nicholson ,Jodie Foster Katherine Hepburn and many others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such are the dreams of the everyday housewife</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francesca Johnson, the Italian-born wife of a farmer in Madison County, Iowa, meets Robert Kincaid, a photographer, when he stops to ask directions. (Kincaid is on an assignment for "National Geographic" to photograph the area's famous covered bridges, hence the title of the film). A friendship grows up between them, which turns to love, and they have a brief affair while Francesca's husband Richard and her teenage children are away for a few days at the State Fair. Robert wants Francesca to leave her husband for him, but she refuses. Although she has fallen deeply in love with Robert, she is unwilling to hurt her husband and children and is afraid that her love for Robert will fade should she take the irrevocable step of ending her marriage for him.This could easily be the plot of some cheap, sentimental movie, but "The Bridges of Madison County" avoids falling into the traps of cheapness and sentimentality. Part of the reason is that it starred two of Hollywood's most talented actors, Meryl Streep as Francesca and Clint Eastwood as Robert. Eastwood was perhaps an unexpected choice, given that he was in his mid-sixties at the time and that in the past he had been most often associated with violent action films, particularly Westerns and police thrillers. In recent years, however, he has been keen to extend his range as an actor, and his role here is an example. Those who felt that he could not play a romantic hero in a film more concerned with emotions than with action were to be proved wrong. Not only is he surprisingly handsome and virile for a man of his years (how many sixty-five year-old actors would dare do a scene bare-chested as Eastwood does here?) but he brings far more tenderness and sensitivity to the role than one would expect from the man who created Dirty Harry and the High Plains Drifter.Although her previous attempt to play the heroine of a doomed romance, in "Falling in Love" about a decade earlier, was not a great success, Streep is superb as Francesca (but then, she normally is superb). Playing an Italian gives her the chance to add another to her collection of accents, but there is always more to Streep than her talent for mimicry. What convinces us that she is foreign born is not only her accent but also her mannerisms and her slight hesitancy when speaking, as though she is groping, albeit only momentarily, for words in a language not her own.Eastwood also directed the film, and the style of direction is an unusual one for a modern movie. In the thirties and forties many films were made in the "filmed theatre" style (usually forced on the directors of the day by technical limitations). Films of this type were made in a studio, generally with an indoor setting. There was more dialogue than action, and the film's literary qualities were more important than its visual ones. This style of film-making fell out of favour as the technological abilities of the cinema advanced- even when a modern film is actually based on a stage play an attempt is normally made to "open it up"- but Eastwood seems to be reverting to it here. Although there are a few outdoor scenes, including shots of one of the covered bridges which takes on an important significance, much of the action takes place in Francesca's home, particularly her kitchen, where she and Robert hold long conversations. They do not actually move into the bedroom until more than halfway through.This style of film-making has the advantage of enabling us to build up a picture of Francesca's marriage without this having to be shown in detail. In the great nineteenth-century novels of female adultery, such as "Anna Karenina", "Madame Bovary" or Fontane's "Effi Briest" it became something of a convention to depict the husband in an unflattering light, thus providing an explanation for his wife's infidelity. That convention in not followed in this film. We see little of Richard, but from what we hear of him he is neither a booby like Charles Bovary nor a cold bully like Karenin. Francesca describes him as very clean, hard-working, gentle and a good father. Yet from her conversations with Robert, we can understand why she is dissatisfied in her marriage. She married Richard shortly after the war, when he was a soldier stationed in Italy. (The film is set in the mid-sixties). It becomes clear that the young Francesca saw marriage as a means to escape from her own war-ravaged country. She seems to have fallen in love with the idea of America as a land of opportunity rather than Richard as a person, and life as Mid-West farmer's wife has not fulfilled her expectations, leaving her nostalgic for her homeland. The life of the cosmopolitan, widely-travelled Robert seems more glamorous than the one she is leading.The one thing I did not like about the film was the "framework story", set in the nineties, in which Francesca's children, now adults, discover the truth about their mother's affair from documents she leaves behind after her death. I felt that the story of Francesca and Robert was strong enough to stand on its own without this unnecessary addition, especially as the nineties subplot had a rather moralising tone at odds with that of the main story. The film as a whole, however, is very good, touching and well-made, with great insight into what Glen Campbell called "the dreams of the everyday housewife". 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Kind of Certainty Comes But Once in a Lifetime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francesca Johnson (an Italianised Meryl Streep) is an Iowan housewife drifting through life with her farmer husband and two non-communicative teenage children. Like most of us, faced with the realities of life she has set her dreams aside and settled for a drab life of house and farm-work. Then, while her husband and kids are away for a few days, National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (director Clint Eastwood) drives into her life in search of one of the eponymous bridges. Thus begins, a passionate four-day affair that transforms Francesca's outlook on life.I can understand why some would be outraged by the fact that this film asks the audience to sympathise with an unfaithful wife and her lover, but the fact is the film couldn't really succeed if it were any other way. While the story is ostensibly a romantic tearjerker - and it will undoubtedly hit all the right buttons for those who like that sort of thing - I think the film also has a more down to earth message. The fact is, the love that Francesca and Robert share for the remainder of their lives after those four days, would, like all romantic loves, be destined to settle into a less elevated state once familiarity - and the real world, which is rigidly prohibited from impinging on the couple's four days of bliss - set in if she had chosen to abandon her family for him. The ecstatic state of bliss enjoyed by lovers at the beginning of a romance never lasts, and it is the brevity of their encounter that keeps Francesca and Robert's love alive.Whatever your feelings on the matter, the impeccable performances of the two leads can't be denied. Eastwood dispels all memories of his tough guy action man image with his portrait of a man who is perhaps a little too good to be true, while Streep completely inhabits the part of a normal woman who has sacrificed her youthful aspirations for a life of secure mediocrity. The film is perhaps a touch overlong, and the framing device a little clunky, but overall The Bridges of Madison County manages to avoid the pitfalls of a genre that so easily lends itself to over-sentimentalising.</fullReview>

Combine the premise with the dramatic chops of Meryl Streep and cinematic history is made; as it was.I had little regard for Clint Eastwood as a director; for no cause other than I was ignorant of his body of work. But so much empathy is drawn from the viewer of this film that it must be a credit to his skill. The story is great, certainly, but there are moments after moments of incredible poignancy. There can be no need for a spoiler alert. This is a doomed relationship. Tragedy of Shakespearean dimension. There is a scene as they relax ( more like recuperate) in a bathtub together after lovemaking. The utter unrevealed grief they are experiencing is heartbreaking. You feel it just as profoundly as the characters. That is the point of the film.This one will make a bad ass cry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet and Poignant Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Iowa farmer's lonely Italian wife, left at home for four days while he and the children are off at the Illinois State Fair, has a torrid romance with an adventurous, globe-trotting photographer. Although he reawakens her physically and emotionally, she doesn't really believe it's true love until it is too late. What she does believe is that she has a duty to family ("the little details of her life") that eclipses her right to real happiness.One year, we went through Winterset, where the story is set, and found it to be a rather strange place. The rolling Iowa countryside, with its lush vegetation, vast, often stormy skies, and enchanting, white gravel roads, has a special charm, to be sure. But much of the state is nearly flat and it is often bleak and depressing, the unpleasant odor emanating from penned hogs and feedlots often hanging heavily in the air. And Iowans struck us as a very provincial lot -- suspicious, very nosy, and at times downright weird. In fact, some of them looked overly inbred, even potentially dangerous. The movie, to its credit, captured the essence of all that quite well. Francesca deserved more than to spend the rest of her life in such a place, and she owed it to Robert, the photographer, if to no one else. Tossing their ashes off the same bridge was a symbolic gesture, at best, and I'm afraid it was a poor substitute for the few short years they might have enjoyed together instead of just four short days in each other's arms. Even after her husband died, Francesca made only a token effort to contact Robert. While I understood her decision to stay with her family, fearing that her love for him could not last if she ran away with him and that she'd blame him for a growing sense of guilt, once her kids were gone and both she and her husband were getting older, I think she should have found him again, if only to reunite temporarily, rather than going to their respective graves never having known what might have happened. Clint Eastwood, the director, was trying to make a realistic ending, but I felt a little let down by it.That said, the love story was sweet and poignant, certain of the love scenes rather erotic, and other sequences quite moving. I particularly liked the couple's interaction on the second day, after Francesca left the note for Robert and they were hesitantly circling one another, both desperately wanting to make love. Then, the scene in the kitchen, where Francesca blew up and called Robert a shallow phony, I thought was very effective. Finally, we had the climax, where Robert stood in the rain, looking pathetic but sincere, then at the stoplight, he held up traffic for another moment, hoping Francesca would change her mind. She almost did, too, but simply couldn't tear herself away from her husband in time. To his alarm and concern, she broke down in tears as Robert turned left and rolled out of her life, forever. That was some good cinema. At the conclusion of the film, we see an encompassing view of the tidy, productive little farm where Francesca spent her life, giving everything else up to remain there. Did she make the right decision? The scenes where her grown children read her notebooks after her death, trying to understand her final wishes, could have been somewhat better but did not, to an excessive degree, detract from this otherwise excellent effort. In particular, Meryl Streep as Francesca was especially good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>While The Family Was At The Fair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The image of Clint Eastwood, firmly ingrained in the minds of the movie-going public is that of a man of few words and lots of actions to back up what little words he does employ. So to see this multi-talented and complex man directing himself and starring in an old fashioned romantic story is a pleasant surprise. Made even more pleasant in how well it was done.The children of Meryl Streep are gathered for her funeral and are astonished at a request left by her not to be buried next to her husband and their father. Instead she wants to be cremated and her ashes thrown off a wooden bridge in the area and in the creek it runs over. Later on her grown children Annie Corley and Victor Slezak find a letter among their mother's effects and it's a lengthy one and she explains her reasons for this.One day back in the early sixties when the kids and husband Jim Haynie left for the state fair, National Geographic Photographer Clint Eastwood stops by and asks Streep for directions. He's in the area to photograph the picturesque Bridges Of Madison County. Meryl is attracted by the stranger and it takes awhile, but before long she realizes she's found the true love of her life.The issue of Meryl being Italian is there, but not overstated in the screenplay. She like thousands of others was a war bride brought over from Europe by GIs. There was a no fraternization policy that was enforced somewhat, but true love or true hormones obey no government edicts. A lot of these marriages worked. In fact Meryl's to Jim Haynie worked because no one found out about her indiscretion to Eastwood until after both of them died. She says herself that the transition from Italy to Iowa was a traumatic one, but she wanted to make it because she'd be going to America and a better life.Meryl Streep received one of her sixteen Academy Award nominations for this role, the only recognition the Academy gave to The Bridges Of Madison County. Sad too because Clint Eastwood who is a man always challenging himself showed that their could be a tender a romantic side to Dirty Harry Callahan. In fact while watching The Bridges Of Madison County I guarantee you won't once think of any of Clint's action heroes.Director Eastwood also exquisitely photographed the Iowa countryside on location in Winterset Iowa which already had its place in Hollywood lore as the birthplace of John Wayne. The Bridges Of Madison County is one of those tender romantic stories showing the fires of romance can still burn in people other than the young. But the film is for romantics of all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It isn't often I become in awe of somebody's acting skills, however great they are. Mostly, because the very best acting really shouldn't make an impression of its own. That is its very definition.Case in point: Meryl Streep. It is hard to deny that she is more Goddess than actor to most people, much like Jack Nicholson, she's become an icon unto herself. This regardless of whether you like her or not.Which makes it so much more impressive when Streep pulls off a magic trick of major magnitude: making the audience forget it's actually her. She does so quickly and seemingly effortlessly, which is crucial to the suspension of disbelief required to become involved in this sappy love story. It's no minor feat, considering she's Meryl-f*cking-Streep! (attach as many exclamation points as you like, depending on how gay you are).So, what about the movie itself? Clearly a superior work to the underlying novel, thanks to skillful direction and overall good performances. Definitely moving in a bitter-sweet way. In my opinion, it's just a little too soppy for me to think it's truly great. But despite its being such a blatant tearjerker, it's nevertheless appealing and gripping. Something to cleanse your sinuses and refresh your soul.Kudos especially to Eastwood, who has repeatedly proved himself a far superior director than actor (and that's saying some). But overall, this is Meryl Streep's victory over her own cult status. Halle Berry was right: she must be the best actress of all time.</fullReview>

The point of view of both sides is given and it's easy to sympathize with both. This movie made me cry more than any other and I still love watching it after countless times.

		<shortDescription>An Affair to Remember.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bridges of Madison County" is a leisurely-paced, finely-tuned romantic drama beautifully orchestrated by director/actor Clint Eastwood, with a transcending performance by Meryl Streep.Based on Robert James Waller's surprisingly successful novella, this project has Clint Eastwood straying from his formulaic action material and winding up with one of the most lyrical, passionate dramas to come out recently. Who knew Eastwood could aim so perfectly for the heart without the help of a gun and holster.In adapting this rather prosaic piece of prose for the screen, Eastwood shrewdly (and graciously) shifts the point of view from Robert Kincaid to Francesca Johnson. With Meryl Streep as its primary focus, how could anything go wrong? Streep is simply luminous here as the foreign-born Iowa farmwife and mother consigned to a life of drudgery. Her family away for the week, she happens upon a handsome, worldly photographer briefly in town scouting out locations for his next National Geographic spread. What results is a beautifully mature story of spiritual and unconditional love. Eastwood himself displays a rare, vulnerable side as the taciturn Kincaid who has grown accustomed to a solitary, self-serving existence. The chemistry between Eastwood and Streep is surprisingly potent and ultimately moving, a real tribute to their disparate talents. With subtle nuance, we slowly become familiar with these two unlikely strangers in the night. A harmless lunch...a cozier dinner...revealing conversation...a slight brush of the shoulder...the casual adjustment of a shirt collar...a spontaneous mating dance. Once their true feelings finally come to the surface, we feel for them and understand and rationalize their attraction. This is absolutely crucial in maintaining the beauty of the romance for it must reroute the obvious appearance of a housewife conducting an adulterous affair with some fly-by-night Romeo. Significantly, Francesca's husband is not portrayed here as an abusive lout deserving of such betrayal. He is simply a remote, unresponsive farmer who has settled routinely into mid-life -- still devoted to his family.The perfervid affair, of course, is beset with feelings of guilt, anguish and fear, but never regret. Ever mindful of small-town gossip (one cruel restaurant scene has a known ?scarlet' woman openly ostracized by its patrons and employees), the couple find out-of-the-way places to go to enjoy their brief time together, while faced with the dilemma of their futures. The climactic scene in the truck with the tormented Francesca gripping the door handle, torn between staying in the truck with her unsuspecting husband or fleeing to Eastwood in the automobile stopped just ahead of them is one of the most searing, agonizing screen moments ever experienced by this viewer.A minor drawback to the film is the "present day" subplot device, which reappears sporadically and bookends the affair seen in flashback. These scenes involve Francesca's two surviving children coming to terms with the discovery of their mother's past affair via letters, diaries and mementos purposely left to be read upon her death. These segments are integral, to be sure, but awkwardly presented and annoyingly intrusive.Known for his deep love of jazz, Eastwood incorporates a wonderfully lush, often bluesy score, littered with familiar classics, notably by the late, great Dinah Washington, whose exquisite version of "I'll Close My Eyes" is a must for every music library, and Johnny Hartman, whose "For All We Know" highlights the lovers' initial encounter. "The Bridges of Madison County," despite its deliberately languid pace, is an enduring wallow for incurable romantics everywhere. Simply, it is an affair to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfulfilled housewife in Iowa (Meryl Streep) has a brief but passionate affair with a photographer passing through town (Clint Eastwood, who also directed). Sterling adaptation of Robert James Waller's phenomenal bestseller, which had romantics gushing from coast to coast, though one which leans heavily on the stars for much of its charm; the story is unnecessarily framed in corny past-and-present structure, and Eastwood lays it all out in the most elementary of terms. The pacing is much too careful and lethargic, however Clint's chemistry with a curiously cast yet exceptional Meryl Streep is captured well. Her performance alone makes the picture worth-seeing; soft, yet earthy and gutsy--and with a convincing Italian accent--Streep manages a full-blooded character, someone with whom audiences can instantly identify. She makes "Bridges" a memorable entertainment, if not quite an eventful one. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing new here. There was a movie from the early 40s, Brief Encounter, which had the exact same theme.I felt very uncomfortable watching this movie. It was all very obvious, not at all subtle and consequently embarrassing. Also, it was somewhat unrealistic, i.e., when, after they lovers have separated, Eastwood standing drenched in the pouring down rain just staring/glaring at Francesca in the truck. Francesca's "nervous breakdown" of despair in the truck. There she is choking back tears, collapsing into the corner of the seat, hands fluttering all around, while her husband rolls his eyes and keeps driving. Probably attributing it to "womens' issues". I mean, afterall, they were just discussing meatloaf. This thing with the hands was really distracting, it was like she had two pigeons tied to them, they fluttered around throughout the movie, but not in an "italian" way. More like a "unwell Southern Belle" or 1950s East Village beatnik chick.In general, I found Francesca rather unsypmathetic. She turns on the opera on the radio for dinner, her daughter comes in, turns it to rock n' roll. Francesca, the great martyr, sighs and rolls her eyes. There were some nice scenes, but the dialogue was SOOOOO heavy-handed and maudlin. Probably would have made a great stage play...lots of self-revelation.I enjoy Meryl Streep in most things, especially Sophie's Choice and Ironweed. And she wasn't exactly bad in this, but not particularly memorable, either. Eastwood's character, however, was just a rehash of Finch-Hatton/Redford in Out of Africa. He was ghastly. The most emoting he should ever do should be similar to that done in In the Line of Fire. That's about the extent of his range. Anything more just makes me squirm.Check out Brief Encounter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My wife and myself have just watched this film on TCM. We are both in our seventies, and agree nearly completely with the criticisms made of it here in the user reviews, which we usually read after we have watched a film. Interestingly, reading these reviews in chronological order, it seems that the ones over the last few years are nearly all favorable, which says much about present day morals and understanding of mature adult relationships, we think.One reviewer says that he gives the film a zero, but his wife gives it ten, and we suspect that reviews which are favorable are mostly from women.Francesca never matured emotionally. Her teenage longing for excitement and romance may well have been totally repressed, even to a state of not consciously recognizing her condition, but we do not think this excuses her from her infidelity. Her after-death confessions to her children were wicked, and they should not have granted her wish to have her ashes scattered off the bridge. Respecting their father, they should have had her buried in the plot reserved for her, where they could both then attend the graves of their parents, if they so wished.As has been pointed out many times in these reviews, Robert was a deceitful womanizer and a loner, and Francesca had no assurance that he would be faithful to her if she had run away with him. The only thing which held these two pathetic creatures together was lust, not love.Sadly lacking in the film was any real indication of the relationship between Francesca and her husband. At the beginning of their relationship, there must have been romance and excitement for both of them in war-torn Italy. They probably got married in Italy, and she would look forward to further excitement in the land of opportunity, not realizing that he was really only a quiet country boy who just wanted to get back to his ancestral farm and work it until his dying day. He was perceptive, as on his death-bed he seemed to know that he had not been a totally fulfilling husband.We give this film a rating of two, because it has stimulated thought and conversation, but to class it as a romance is absurd.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrealistic "love" story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get what the hype was about this book or this movie. It was FOUR DAYS of her life, yet decades later, she remembers it like it was yesterday? Please. It was FOUR DAYS. You can't fall in love, true love, with someone in FOUR DAYS and then remember every second of that weekend decades later. I don't buy it.Francesca broke the rules of marriage. There was no reason for her to have an affair. None at all. She brought it all upon herself.And what did the photographer care? He was just passing through town and had ladies like her everywhere. What made her so special? She was a married woman with kids. A true love would not make you break your vows to your husband and take advantage of you in your own home like that. I didn't buy the "love" story at all.This movie is about LUST. Plain and simple. No love. If she would've gotten out of that truck it would've been for lust, not love. And then what? Would it have been forever? Anyone who breaks the vows of marriage does not live "happily ever after". If it wasn't that photographer, it would've been someone else. Anyone who gave her the slightest bit of attention. It just happened to be him.If you are looking for a true love story, this isn't the movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece from Eastwood!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a novel, this movie is a real seller. Clint Eastwood really outdid himself in this movie. Playing a fiction photographer for a real magazine is something to look up to. Now I enjoy reading "National Geographic". These magazines are goldmines compared to the others I read. Robert Kincaid(Clint Eastwood) passes through Iowa to take some pictures, there he meets lonely housewife Francesa Johnson(Meryl Streep) who tends the farm while her husband and kids are at a Steer contest in Illinois. Now everyone hates affairs, when you're in a small town the word spreads out like wildfire. For Robert and Francesa, theirs were nothing more than a friendly conversation between two adults. I liked the part when Robert leaves the farm, Francesa cools herself off in the breeze where the bugs feast on her flesh. After their deaths(Mother, Father, and Mr. Kincaid), the kids wondered why their mother didn't want to be buried. This movie has so much to say, you'll have to see it for yourself. It's a winner, a keeper, and a big hit. Perfect for your video library. 5 Stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too bad that this movie has one weakness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bridges of Madison County", that title on its own is already enough to scare half of the male population away. They know it's a romantic drama and don't even need to see it, they are already convinced that they won't like it. And yet, if only they took the time to give it a try, they might be surprised by it. I know I was, so why shouldn't others have the same feelings about it.The movie tells the story of the National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) and the housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) whose paths cross in the sixties. While her husband and children are away at the Iowa state fair in the summer of 1965, Kincaid asks Francesca for directions to the Rosamunde Bridge. He tells her that he's in the region to photograph the bridges for his famous employer. She agrees to show him to the bridges and that's how their four day romance starts. After these four days, Kincaid leaves and Francesca is left behind with her mixed feelings of grieve for a lost love and happiness for her family that has returned. Not able to tell anybody what has happened to her, she has written it all down in a diary that now, after her death has been found by her children. In that diary she asks them not to bury her next to her deceased husband, but to scatter her cremated remains off Rosamunde Bridge, just like happened with Kincaid, after he died...With this movie Clint Eastwood proves to be a good director who is able to do a lot more than to act in Westerns. In fact, this should have been his second masterpiece (Unforgiven was his first one, no doubt about that), but in my opinion he made one small, but fatal mistake. The fact that he keeps returning to Francesca's adult children reading the diary, takes away a lot of the magic. If they had only been in the movie in the beginning and at the end, it would have been a lot better, because they aren't the real stars of this movie. The only real stars are Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood, who both did an excellent job in this movie. Their acting feels so natural that it almost is like they aren't acting at all. The chemistry between the two is unbelievable and pure. I've rarely seen such beautiful moments of passion in a Hollywood production and I certainly didn't expect to get it from Clint Eastwood.Overall this movie is a pleasant surprise. Normally I'm not a great fan of romantic drama's but I will never reject a movie, just because it belongs to a certain genre either. It felt real without being all too sentimental, it was moving without being corny. This is really a very nice movie that everybody should give a try. I'm sure many will say it isn't good, just because there aren't any car chases or big explosions in it, but for all those who are looking for an adult love story, this is definitely worth a watch. I give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance or sordid affair?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was very beautifully made with fine performances from Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep. It is deemed as a romantic movie between two lost souls, but I cannot help feeling that Francesca (Meryl Streep) was nothing more than a shameless hussy. No sooner had her Husband and children went away to a fair for four days (why she didn't go is a mystery) she was jumping into a truck with a complete stranger (who could have been Ted Bundy's Father) offering to show him where he wanted to go, then inviting him in for iced tea, then dinner and brandy and then for the next three days humping his brains out. Her poor devoted Husband if only he knew what a trollop he married. Romantic? I am not sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood's 'brief encounter' movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood directs and stars in this romance about a brief encounter between a photographer for National Geographic and a lonely immigrant woman (Meryl Streep, given another accent to try for size). It is a flashback story, triggered by Streep's children sorting out her belongings years later when she has died, and we see just what this brief relationship meant to her. The film lingers on the objects around the lead characters to put across the experience of their attraction to each other.What could have been preposterous works really well ? the couple dance together in the kitchen, they go sight-seeing, they obviously get along. The story just about sweeps you along, even though you know it is silly, and it is nice to see Eastwood in a quieter role after all the shoot-fests he's famous for. Just the pleasure of watching these two versatile actors together is worth any clunky scenes in ?The Bridges of Madison County'. A film anyone with a touch of romance in their soul can truly appreciate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Someone please find me a man that doesn't slam the screen door!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Clint Eastwood but am very disappointed he decided to put out such a sentimental, immoral piece of drivel. Yes, Clint and Meryl play their roles expertly and are determined to draw the viewer into their illicit, adulterous affair. And yes, we are expected to forgive them this horrible sin, because, gee, she's bored and lonely and has given up her dreams. And he is so exciting, and rugged and handsome. And don't forget he doesn't slam the screen door! That's the ultimate criteria when choosing a soul mate. Who could blame her for cheating on her tedious, sad little husband. Oh yes, and because she ultimately DOESN'T leave her husband in the end, she is quite heroic and self-sacrificing. Give me a break!I especially found the plot device of using Francesca's adult children to reveal the story very creepy. I can't imagine, as a mom, divulging with lurid details an affair I had many years prior that meant I had cheated on their father. Who does this? The most ridiculous part is when Francesca writes to her daughter in the letter something to the effect: "Remember when you wanted to borrow my new dress and I wouldn't let you? That would have been like loaning you my wedding dress.".... gag....gag.... Are you kidding me? How sick! And the daughter just smiles. I would've have been completely grossed out. If I remember the scene, I think the daughter is at the cedar chest and even holds or stokes the dress and then puts it on. "OK mom, so THIS is the dress you wore the night you cheated on my dad - how beautiful!!! I must put it on!" ...Ewwwwwww!!!!! It would be like Monica Lewinsky's daughter one day being proud to put on the infamous blue dress!HELLO Hollywood, please quit trying to glamorize adultery and get us to fall for your trash just because "it's SO romantic" and you guess we are all so stupid. I love a good cry and sweeping love story as good as the next gal , but I don't need it at the expense of having to suspend my morals to do so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chick Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't normally try to characterize movies with cheap epithets like "Chick Flick" but in this case I thought it was appropriate. I found the initial premise of the film interesting and it soon drew me in (i.e. children discovering a hidden side to their mother's after her death). What initially put me off was discovering that Meryl Streep was meant to be Italian. I have great admiration for Streep as an actress but for the first part of the movie I kept trying to work out which country her accent was meant to be from. I decided eventually on Russian. Blow me down if it doesn't turn out that she's meant to be Italian. My parents are Italian and I've heard a lot of English spoken with Italian accents in my life but none of them sounded like Meryl Streep. To compound things even further she later tells Clint Eastwood that she's from a "small town" in Italy that he would never have heard of. She eventually tells him that this small town is called Bari and learns to her great surprise that he has not only heard of it but has visited it and was so entranced by what he saw that he broke his train journey and stopped there for a few days. Now I know that Americans are notoriously ignorant about other countries but Bari happens to be a large urban centre and while it has some sites worth visiting it is hardly the picturesque small town that seems to be suggested in the movie. From that point on the movie began to lose me more and more. I found it generally dull and thought it was exploiting its viewers emotions. A pity really because I thought that some of the portrayals of a marriage that were shown had great insight. I left before it finished. My wife stayed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie dating my wife about 5 years ago. We rented it and thought it would the perfect ending to an otherwise wonderful date. We knew nothing about it, but with Clint &amp; Merril in it, we thought it couldn't be that bad.After viewing it, I was depressed because to me, despite all of its acting and technical expertise, it was still a movie about adultery - not necessarily a subject you want to dwell on when you are thinking about marrying someone.What I disliked most about the movie was that it tried to make a case where adultery is acceptable. It tried to make it beautiful (and it must have succeeded. I've talked with many women who've seen it and many said that they would have ran off with Clint's character - what's going on in their homes huh?). How can adultery be beautiful, especially when the husband was not abusive or an adulterer himself? We are after all human and make mistakes, but the movie did not portray the affair that way.Although the film put a serious damper on my evening, I still got married and it's been great!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, beautiful and Unpretentious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is curious, as some reviewers write what Francesca should have done with his life before she would fall in love with Robert. There is usually a clear trend in some people, trying to impose their morality, and believe what is good or bad for others. So Francesca should do "this" or "that" ... and anything other than that, it's wrong.I'm not interested in making an objection just to go into a matter. For me, the story is quite simple. Probably Francesca was not tired of her husband, or she was not in search of adventure. Just she met a man she liked more, and decided to go with what she felt. Anyway, at the end of four days of romance everything back the way it was, which is quite credible.In the end, the story is beautifully told, and it has moments of uncertainty, sexual tension, drama, love ... and it is stylishly directed.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One again the Cool dude takes the babe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, now this movie forces me to rethink upon an issue that has been troubling me for a long time now. If you married young and have a life and kids and everything, the popular culture portrays it as a failure to live your life completely. Let's get to the movie before I elaborate. Enter Francesca Johnson an Italian war bride who is married to a hardworking, honest, down to soil farmer who loves her but as usual he has many other things to care about rather than serenading his wife all the time. The husband takes the two kids off to Illinois Country fair and Francesa declines the invitation to come along. Enter Robert Kincaid, a dashing devil may care, rangy, cowboy photographer. He's intense he loves his job and roams the world like a free wind. No tangles no relations to hold him down. And obviously Francesca stumbles hopelessly in love with him. Now my point is lady, that guy is like the text book definition of a cool guy he's charming and he has these philosophies and ideas and all this is very appealing to Francesca. But we must keep in mind a passionate 4 day affair is easy a life time of camaraderie and support is another. I hate this idea that it's bad to just be with one person and boring means your life has amounted to nothing. I believe this ideology has increased unhappiness and occurrences of unfaithfulness. Cool kids are fine but they don't stick around. We need to glorify the silent real men who stick through till the bitter end. That's all I have to say. Movie is okay but the idea ruins it for me, although it does have a nice description of the bucolic life. It's a cinematic equivalent of American pastoral.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching, in a homely sort of way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the first few minutes of The Bridges of Madison County, you get an idea of the general direction the story will take.Essentially, it is a story of a relationship of two people. A relationship which is profound yet unconventional. The film is an exploration of how bonding between human beings does not always follow societal rules and norms, of the perennial dilemma of the head and the heart, nature and culture. With great sensitivity, The Bridges of Madison County lays out the relationship in its most honest form and raises the question as to whether there can be a correlation between the conventional, accepted norms and morality at all times. The acting is top-notch, with Meryl Streep essaying a character in agony as only she can. Clint Eastwood as an actor in this film is perhaps not as good as Clint Eastwood the director, but he still leaves behind a few priceless moments.In conclusion, it is a must-watch if you have a thing for romantic dramas.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Emotional romance-drama. Possibly Clint Eastwood's most romantic movie, and one of his most sensitive (only Million Dollar Baby is more so, I think). Though it is quite schmaltzy (and perhaps overly so), it is not your average romance-drama. It is about choices and how these affect your life and the lives of those around you.Eastwood displays his usual subtle direction. No spoonfeeding details or superfluous information. He does draw out some of the moments a bit much though.Superb performance from Meryl Streep, as you would expect. Deservedly got her a Leading Actress Oscar nomination. Clint Eastwood gives the most gentle and deep performance of his life. More than these individual performances, the chemistry between Streep and Eastwood is spot-on.Decent supporting performances, mostly. Victor Slezak, as the son Michael, is probably the weakest link, not being 100% convincing, and often over-acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>from sub rosa to roseman bridge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a description of a secret extramarital relation from the legacy of a widow in Iowa USA early sixties after a book by RJ Waller, directed by C Eastwood. Two things that made this movie interesting to me were the sharp plot and the cinema picture of 'the good America', early 60-ies farmland Iowa. Looks like the way you imagine it yourself, reading fi Steinbeck books reflecting it's culture. For updated feminism (that's early 60-ies ; the population drafted for Nam a few years later) the movie shows a nice contrast in it's public appearance and expression (look), meanwhile some still actual similarities too (relational emotional conflict and decision) ; it's a 1995 movie. The movie is well filmed and certainly not sentimental fi looking through the eyes of a Madison county judge. You notice the community in it's reactions, before the emancipatory development /not stimulated to 'try or do' that/ ; it's very consequential on your everyday legal American reality (she's like Redfield if you skip the emotion) / mad is son feel red/ same town etc ; she finds another answer (see movie plot). The conflict (right choice or not) is presented (intuition and directive talent probably) quite in line with Freud's writing on the female Electra-complex ( it's a more frequent conflict in female deciding minds). Nowadays communities and it's 'procedures' are more tolerant liberal dealing with these themes thanks to progress (question yourself if this is true or merely contract appearances of contract reality) etc. This and even more makes the movie good and interesting ; it easily takes you along in it's 'American Shakespearian' drama development. I would therefore recommend this movie for a priority position in the Amazon IMDb 250 ; watch it if you want to see a mature relational movie, listening to the right voice telling the story./Meryl streep/(by the way, I'd rather nominate her an Oscar for this role since she does very well in Bridges of Madison) Frederick Barendse 13-5-14</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, Emotional Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bridges of Madison County (1995) **** (out of 4) Clint Eastwood does a masterful job adapting the Robert James Waller novel about a lonely Iowa housewife (Meryl Streep) who has a week-long love affair with a photographer (Eastwood) while her family is away. Even though I was just fifteen-years-old, I still remember the confusion when it was announced that a tough guy like Eastwood would be not only acting but directing in what many people considered a woman's film. Whether it was that first viewing or this one, some might be offended that their action star hero would do such a film but it remains one of the greatest works of his career and I think a strong case could be made that a couple scenes are the best directing job he's ever done. I think the film works on many levels but it's certainly a film that deals with regret and I guess a moral question of what's right and wrong is also asked. I thought Eastwood did a terrific job throughout the picture. The first hour of the film is pretty much all dialogue but this is where the two strong lead performances really help. Throughout all the talking you never once get bored because the two actors are simply so great at what they're doing. I think this remains one of the Streep's strongest performances and it's not just for the emotions that she brings to the part. There's also that terrific Italian accent, which remains one of the greatest I've ever heard. The actress just really puts herself into this role and there's no a single second that you don't believe everything you're seeing. Eastwood is also very good in the part and manages to show that he did have a softer side and it's something some of his fans might not like but it proves what a wide range of talent he actually has. The film certainly has some very memorable scenes but there's one in particular, which to me has Eastwood's greatest job at a director and it's towards the end of the film in the rain. There's a sequence at a stop light that I won't ruin but just the emotional impact of this is something I've never forgotten from that first time viewing the film. I think the stuff dealing with the children could have been left on the editing room floor but other than this the film remains every bit as powerful as one would hope for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep, albeit one's willing to endure the contrived writing, middling supporting performances &amp; weak framing device</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Robert, I want you to come" Francesca says with an almost pleading tone over the telephone, thus initiating the four-day amour between her and Robert, a travelling photographer on a short trip to Iowa. It is an adventure for Francesca, who considers herself a common Iowan housewife without a liking for change. She is anything but common, as Robert tells her in another scene, otherwise she wouldn't have said those words; Francesca fully knew what she was doing, yet she on her own accord went ahead. How long her relationship could last with Robert didn't matter to her then; what mattered was that she could find pure happiness with this man, a state she hadn't felt in years.This adventure gradually becomes a spiritual journey for the unhappy housewife, gradually unraveling the mysteries of life and love. But the leap to a spiritual journey requires a renunciation from her adventure; otherwise the love shared between Francesca and Robert would culminate in nothing more than a liaison. And so, Bridges of Madison County does away with the pretty Hollywood ending and still, everything does end up well for everybody.A thoughtful message indeed, but what troubles is that Bridges of Madison County is that it often makes us feel as though we're watching a typical lifetime film whose sole intent is to make big moral observations whenever and wherever possible. So the scenes are often plagued with 'that moment when there's momentarily silence after which a character speaks something big' ? it often is found just before a scene ends. And while Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, our Robert and Francesca, do try not to allow this film to slip into a silly melodrama, the clichéd material sometimes becomes overwhelming for the two. The two other actors playing Francesca grown-up children do not help either, almost making it look as though two separate films of different caliber ? the better one with Streep and Eastwood, of course, were spliced together. Bridges of Madison County begins with Francesca's children Caroline and Michael arriving at their recently deceased mother's Iowa home for settlement of her estate. Both the children are married and both are unhappy with their marriages and yet they've neither cheated on their spouses nor have they thought of a divorce. Michael does have a valid reason for being mad at his wife though, because she says the darndest things at the most inappropriate time; just when Michael is handed the keys of Francesca's safety deposit box, she offhandedly jokes that Francesca could've left millions in the box for her children. No, it isn't a Hitchcock story so forget the millions; instead what's found in the box is an old camera, pictures and letters. Caroline begins reading one of the letters and learns that her mother had written a love letter once to a man named Robert. She talks to Michael in private and the two begin reading the letters after asking Michael's wife and the accompanying lawyer to leave. There's a silly line spoken by Caroline when she opens a magazine which has a picture of Robert Kincaid with the name mentioned clearly on the left; she assumes "This must be Robert Kincaid" even when the names clearly visible to even the audience's eye.Letters reveal that Francesca deliberately kept the items for her children so they may know her secret and not consider her a mad raving woman for requesting in her will to cremate her body and throw the ashes near Roseman Covered Bridge, which Robert used to visit along with Francesca to shoot photographs for National Geographic. At first, both Michael and Caroline are disgusted but as they hear Francesca's story, first through her letters and then through her diaries, they realize how these four days profoundly affected their mother's attitude (positively) towards life, and they slowly begin empathizing with her and introspect on their own outlooks towards life and marriage. Annie Corley and Victor Slezak, playing Caroline and Michael respectively, give stilted and forgettable performances. Slezak especially fails with his 'Chandler' look from Friends that can hardly be taken seriously. They're not completely at fault, as the framing device (kids reading mother's letters with such unwholesome curiosity it feels as though they've been given a copy of Fifty Shades of Gray) is weakly implemented; there's a poorly shot scene when Michael wants to know why his mother didn't leave the family and Caroline and he immediately turn their heads towards their mother's diary and then look at each other. The scene makes you wonder why a great filmmaker like Eastwood couldn't think of a better way of taking us back and forth in time. It's the elders who steal the show. While Eastwood brings a gentle and very likable charm to his Robert, Streep goes way beyond everybody else in embodying Francesca. She's an encyclopedia of body language and came show passion by degrees. Watch the initial scenes where she keeps rubbing her hands and moving a little backwards as she's speaking to Robert, a usual sign for initial discomfort while talking to strangers. Later, when she's closer to Robert and meets him at the bridge, the two shake hands and we see Meryl use both her hands to greet him (keeping one of top of other), usually done while greeting more warmly. A very erotic moment doesn't involve sex but happens when Francesca simply adjusts Robert's collar and places her hand on his shoulder; you know Streep's worked her magic by watching Eastwood's expressions. Bridges of Madison County is a decent film that's worth watching once for Eastwood and twice for Streep. But one should be willing to endure some contrived writing, middling supporting performances and weak framing device.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bridges of Madison County is the most beautiful love story ever told. It melts your heart. You can feel the love of the two characters burn off the screen. The setting is beautiful, the script is amazing, and the acting is in another league. A beautiful piece of art that will warm even the coldest heart. One of the greatest achievements is the simplicity of it. There is never too many distractions, never too much music, never any over acting. It is simple, allowing the brilliance of Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood to captivate your mind and heart in the most beautiful love story ever told. Someone said, 'it is as if they walked straight off the page' and this is exactly what it is like. They have turned the written form into the most stunning visual. A true piece of cinematic beauty and a film that is a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobody but Eastwood and Streep!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The book may have been lame about a four day relationship between a war bride Francesca played by the dynamic Meryl Streep and a National Geographic photographer, Robert Kincaid. Her husband, Richard, and two children go to the Illinois State Fair. While going over their deceased mother's belongings, they discover their mother's secret romance with the photographer. Meryl Streep is sensational and believable as this simple housewife in Iowa. She loves her husband and children but probably wanted something more. Then Clint Eastwood as Robert Kincaid shows up asking where a covered bridge is in Madison County, the relationship is short-lived and a decision has to be made about their clandestine affair. Anyway despite all the obvious problems, Eastwood and Streep pull this movie through. I liked Annie Corley and Victor Slezak as the adult children who make the starting discovery about their mother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a slight movie on paper. Passing stranger falls in love with housewife, but she decides not to follow him when he moves on. Goodness me, what power it has though! All of that power seems to irradiate from the masterful central performances of both Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep (it's Francesca/Streep's film really, but both actors are strong).Naturally there's more to it than the sweetness of true love's inevitability and the torture of the examined conscience. The affair is played out in flashback as Francesca's children read her will (and reassess their own dysfunctional marriages). This naturally recalls the recent Curious... Benjamin Button in which Cate Blanchett cajoles her daughter into reliving her past. The Bridges of Madison County is a more realist adventure in love-in-time. It also benefits from concentrating on a four day period alone with a short 'recent past' sequence within the narrative framing device, as in the film Atonement; the pathos of the love affair is circumscribed with a poignant up-to-date encounter with the narrator, speculating on what might have been in the interim (a similar device concentrates the bittersweet encounter of another of McEwan's books, On Chesil Beach).I think that the thing that really pushes the viewer over the edge though is the sense of something startling, or even catastrophic about to happen. In a sense this happens in a happy reverse. The catastrophe - the couple falling in love - is nothing of the sort and happens gently. Yet the deliberate pace of the lead into and away from the affair primes an audience reasonably versed in such things to expect great drama. It's in the uncoiling of these moments that the heart is strung, as one familiar with the key moments of Strauss' great opera on the assumption and relinquishing of love, Der Rosenkavalier, will be all too aware. Feel free to blub. I did. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Life is complicated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is like Brief Encounter and Casablanca in that it evokes the agony of having to make choices based upon what you think will make your life bearable, at the expense of losing something wonderful, that then becomes a treasured memory. I'm sure many people have had similar experiences in their lives, maybe not as intense as the one experienced by Francesca and Robert in this film. I agree that the performances were impeccable and the limited sets made the viewer focus on the relationship that was central to the plot. It's a very intense portrayal of a very real emotional dilemma, and I empathised with Francesca's difficult choice. I do think she chose wisely but in a way it was a no-win situation for her. Time does heal and make that pain bearable, and maybe it did for her.It was obvious to me that she chose to become closer to Robert - she invited him into her life, and then she realised the impact of what she had done. It is a cautionary tale in some ways as well - I'm sure a lot of people in that situation would have denied themselves that opportunity. Meryl Streep's performance conveyed every aspect of what her character felt, without words in many cases. Clint Eastwood was also excellent but i couldn't help wishing he had been a bit younger. I don't know how old the characters were in the book.This is one of the few movies that tears my heart out each time I see it as do the English Patient, Schindler's List, and some others. The realism of the emotions is so dramatic that it's impossible to avoid being drawn in. I agree with comments that the cutting away to the "present" with her children reading the diary was unnecessary, but this didn't ruin it for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet, Gentle and Meandering</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from the classic romance novel by Robert James Waller, "The Bridges of Madison County" is a quiet, gentle, meandering film which tells of a lonely housewife from Iowa who befriends a visiting photographer from National Geographic. The resultant love affair not only changes their lives forever, but also the lives of her children thirty years later.Eastwood's film is skilfully crafted, though it does have its faults, tending to be over long and self indulgent. Too many of the quiet scenes are drawn out, lessening the emotional impact of Richard LaGravanese's screenplay. Still, everything else is very professional.Editing may be under done, but all other technical credits are superb, especially the cinematography, which captures picturesque Iowa with aplomb. Jack Niehaus provides a melodic score. All this is strongly supported by two expert showings from Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep. The former does very well as the citizen of the world who may have finally found someone to love for life. Streep is at her best as the ex-patriot Italian whose routine life is turned on its head by this perfectly charming stranger."The Bridges of Madison County" is a movie for devotees of true romantic love stories, and for that audience this is a real treat.Tuesday, February 27, 1996 - Lorne Theatre</fullReview>

I prefer this move to other significant achievements such as Remains of the Day. Eastwood created a flawless atmosphere which anyone can hardly experience in other platonic love stories. The colors are exceptionally powerful and carries the sentiment of the process to audience, instantly. If You are in search of some action do not watch Bridges over Madison County and indeed focus on One Night at McCool's. This movie is exclusively for lovers and lonely people!</fullReview>

I've come accustom over recent years to see how much Eastwood has developed as a director. His films have generated a lot of interest and I think it's because how he manages to pull at our heart strings and convey the sentimentality between characters. 'Bridges of Madison' does just that pulls you in by the chemistry of Streep and Eastwood. It's also the beautiful storyline and how it's told through flash back after the death of Francesca. She leaves a letter to her 2 children explaining her love affair with Robert Kincaid, a man she met some 30 yrs prior. This was her legacy to them, and to share the true meaning of love and sacrifice.</fullReview>

Yes the Italian accent was good, by the premier classic bard performance of Ms Streep. For once good Ole Clint got it bang on target, without the use of his .44 The 8 note melody line to the film score, is an irregular syncopated scale movement, in which I once witnessed a TV interview in where Eastwood stated, that he had this piece floating in his head, ala stream of consciousness... All writers have these moments. The story bode well of the bored but loving house wife grabbing her halcyon moment of life...This was a tearjerker extrordinaire second to none...The brief moving scene of Clint getting soaked, while looking on to his love encounter was superlative and gave credence and credit to the fact that this movie deserved accolade allround in which it rightfully did so.

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie for the first time the other day, purely by chance as I was flicking through the TV channels and caught sight of Meryl Streep. Having never heard of this movie before, I was pretty sceptical after reading the write up, but I figured Meryl Streep is usually fantastic, so I decided to watch. And I'm so glad that I did! Such a beautiful film, brilliantly acted. When you consider that the focus is on only two characters for the large proportion of the film, it is incredible that this does not become monotonous or repetitive in any way.What really got me was the intensity of the relationship that the two actors managed to portray, it is very emotional and very real. I was very impressed by Clint Eastwood. Would never have imagined him pulling off a role such as this, but he was fantastic. I personally love the scene where they are in the kitchen dancing. There are hardly any words exchanged throughout this entire scene, but that did not seem to matter, it was just such a beautiful part of the film. The whole thing is a very much a reflection of the normal way in which a relationship develops. No grand gestures, no over the top displays of affection as is common place when relationships are being developed in films. It is just quite simply two people who are drawn to each other in an intense way. I won't spoil the ending, but it had me in tears.Fantastic acting and a beautiful script. Definitely worth a watch!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Miss M.Streep is never happier than when she hides behind an accent. Here she has a cute Italian one and she cocks her head to one side a lot,smiles shyly,keeps raising her hands to her face and employs bits of "business" that clearly indicate "acting".Mr C.Eastwood on the other hand belongs to the "less is more" school and apart from the occasional wrinkling of the brow to indicate moments of high emotion is happy to rely on our perception of his screen persona in much the same way as that other great American movie invention Mr J.Wayne. Miss Streep is very beautiful(even more so near the end when she has aged realistically)but I found her transition from Italian=American earth-mother/cook/homemaker to flirty middle aged woman willing to risk everything for love decidedly unlikely. Equally Mr Eastwood's spartan independence is rather too quickly cast aside as he reverts to lovelorn adolesence in very short order. "The bridges of Madison County" was a very popular story and obviously somebody was going to make a movie of it.Because that task fell to Mr Eastwood what we have is about as good a movie as could have been made out of it.The faults lie in the original material. It is a film about love rather than sexual attraction,and in that sense is "adult".Women will find it confirms their belief that most men lack the capacity to understand what love is,men will worry that they are unable to satisfy all the criteria required by their partners. There are some lovely songs by the relatively little - known Johnny Hartman on the soundtrack that hopefully will make you go and search him out as I'm sure was Mr Eastwood's intention. He may have his critics as a director,but nobody could say his movies are all the same.</fullReview>

It is as fascinating as a fairy tale and yet embraces the reality so dearly that you will feel part of it at all moments. I could not decide, whether its the charm of Eastwood and Streep that brought Charisma to this movie or the simplicity of the story that puts it aside from its genre yet deserving the crown of Love stories.Background scores are apt. I have seen some other directions by Clint, and this one goes no less than those. He has been miraculous whether it comes to acting or to directing. But that does not mean, Meryl is an inch shorter than him in stature. This was my first movie of her. and well I know now why she deserves special credit.To put an end to this review, if you like Love Stories, this is a must watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grown up romance in Iowa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is good enough that even with multiple viewings, knowing what's going to happen, I'm choked up at the off-mentioned scene in the rain near the end.As noted elsewhere, the framing device of the adult children finding and reading Francesca's memoir doesn't work; their scenes are pedestrian at best. Even with this significant flaw, I consider BoMC a great movie. Think of coming across a Vermeer with a U-frame-it. The more you look at the actual painting, the less the frame matters. BoMC is almost that good.Robert and Francesca chance to meet in front of her farmhouse, as Robert has gotten lost looking for Roseman Bridge. Both are long settled into lives that make this meeting stupendously unlikely; he's a globe-trotting photographer and she's been in this house tending her family for nearly 20 years, although she hails from Baro, Italy, making her being there that way at all unlikely to begin with. She's been listening to opera beating dust out of a rug while husband and kids are off showing a prize steer at the Illinois state fair, where they'll be for four days.The two of them are in for a life changing relationship, although it seems at first like nothing more than a small detour for him and a break in the routine for her. They gradually awaken in each other dormant longings for a different kind of life than what they have. At the end of the four days, they are torn, and the movie works because we're torn with them.They have quite a lot to say to each other, but there's more than enough room for the dialog within the farmhouse kitchen, the exteriors around the bridge and the honky tonk joint they venture to on Wednesday, within the score and the Johnny Hartman love songs. (Who knew that old style radio with tubes in it could sound so good?!) Susan Sarandon (in Dead Man Walking) is the answer to who got the Oscar Streep should have won for her performance here, but she needed Eastwood to play against for that performance to have had the resonance it has. When Robert says he's not really an artist, I feel like he's speaking for Eastwood, telling us what he really would like to be but doubts he has the stuff for, although there's artistry there that Francesca connects with. In any event, without Eastwood's physicality, Francesca/Streep's transformation wouldn't make sense. Eastwood's acting is sometimes harshly judged, but I see him here fully inhabiting the character of Robert, perhaps because it's similar to his own.Forty years ago or more everything was "poignant," to the point where the word was a cliché, but the word fits BoMC and the relationship between Robert and Francesca like none that I've ever seen in any other movie. The screenplay, the actors, the cinematography, and the score all work together.Many reviewers have objected to the movie's portrayal of infidelity, some so upset that it seems they've overlooked that this is a work of fiction. I could better understand the objections if Robert and Francesca's affair had a happy ending or was seen to have no consequences. Neither of these is the case here; both Robert and Francesca, having tasted the forbidden fruit, will never recover their previously settled lives, will forever experience a sense of loss. Meanwhile, Francesca's family will never know that anything happened, except that Richard expresses regret on his deathbed that he couldn't fulfill Francesca's dream, a scene that didn't ring true for me.Look at it this way: the book upon which this movie is based was wildly popular in spite of its prose being almost universally reviled by everyone with any pretension at all of literary taste. Were these many readers attracted by the opportunity to be offended by a tawdry affair? Isn't it more likely that there's much appeal from a story of unexamined lives, unrealized potential, the road not taken, of an exploration of what love is really about, even when the story is poorly written?In the end, I think the portrayal of what imperfect people might do seemed real enough to be upsetting to viewers who would prefer to see good people doing good things and being rewarded and bad people doing bad things and being punished. There are movies for these people, and to be sure, Bridges of Madison County isn't one of them, which makes it more interesting for the rest of us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last night Diane and I watched this movie about which we had heard much comment but had not seen it until it came on late night TV. Both of us enjoyed the film greatly and thought that all the elements that make an enjoyable and memorable film came together. I love reading Viewer Comments, depending on the film, before writing my own and please forgive me here; some of them are downright bizarre. Movies are fantasy, even if they want to be factual so treat them as fantasy. I do not think that you should bring out your Bible and begin to thump it because you are there to protect the morals of your kids or as Christians love doing, protecting us, the Great Unwashed Masses, from ourselves. We will succeed in arriving somewhere without the help of the silly churches dotting the land like pimples on the earth's behind. This was a fantasy examination of what is and what might have been. Eastwood and Streep play their roles seamlessly; Eastwood's direction married to Steep's always sensitive acting is superb. I loved Streep's virtually flawless facial expressions mirroring her interior emotions throughout the film. I was not bothered by her accent or how other commentators saw it, her lack of an accent. The film's ending was hard; Francesca had decisions to make, she made them and must spend her remaining years recounting those decisions, as do all of us whether in career, or love or virtually anything in life. It is the old story of the Fork in the Road and the path taken. Yes, that reality is there but the details of this movie are still fantasy and should be seen exactly as that and nothing else.</fullReview>

Everything about this film is stunning. Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep are magical together. It's not often for me that someone eclipses Eastwood when playing opposite him in a roll but Streep does. It is an injustice that she did not get the Oscar she was nominated for. Then there is the direction which again proves that Eastwood is one of the greatest filmmakers period. Everything about it is beautiful! I am not afraid to admit that there were several moments in the film where tears were welling in my eyes. If you have not seen this film, don't dismiss it as a soppy love story. It is so so much more than that in everyway. Quite simply it is one of the most beautiful, emotional and stunning films I have ever seen.</fullReview>

It is strange but a true fact that Dirty Harry could give such a balanced and heart touching finish to the novel written by Robert James Waller.

		<fullReview>I just chanced on this on public television. I had never had any interest in it for whatever reason. Five minutes in and I was hooked. This is a quiet movie about someone who has given up her life for her family. She has left her European home to be with her husband. He is a good man but really pretty dull. Her kids are spoiled and inconsiderate. When Kincaid shows up, he offers her four days to ponder the rest of her life. Some criticize the morality of it. The movie is so well paced and so gentle, that the relationships between the characters come softly in the night. The subtly facial expressions and nuances show us what real pros can do. It's so nice to see Eastwood grow better all the time, not just Rawhide or Dirty Harry (not that there is anything wrong), but a fine, confident performance of a lonely man who finds his four days as well. The worlds of the two characters are so different yet they become kindred spirits and lovers. I appreciated that at no time was there a possibility that they would be caught red-handed. Good writing; good directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romantic masterpiece that says it all!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is so brilliantly made to deliver the message of what you want versus what you should do. I guess this role wasn't difficult to Streep in its essence as she played it already with Robert Deniro in Falling in Love but there was a challenge in this role and it is unfair not to be able to see it as a viewer! The challenge was for Meryle who is in her 40s to act as the teenage who fell in love and found the passion that she had never felt before in such an age and still be lovable to the conservative viewer. I, for one, loved her so much and wasn't intimidated by anything in the way she acted. I was totally compassionate with the character and I have to say that many of the comments didn't quite understand the character. It all lies in the scene where she says to Eastwood that she hoped she didn't bore him with her stupid chatting and he replies back that he could never think of her that way and that she was a smart woman. It's at the moment that she falls in love with him because she had lost her wit in the simple life of the simple man she got married. Just amazing! The story talks about the kind of love that you find once in your life with only one person who can get out the real you and make you feel your importance which life tends to bury down with its different loads.The movie had so many deep and beautiful scenes, particularly the scene where Francesca is in the car with her husband and Eastwood is in his right behind them hanging the necklace on the mirror as a sign for her to leave the car and runaway with him just like teenagers in love would do. Waw, this movie never stops to amaze me with all the details in it. Both characters never knew what love is and they found it together but not at the right time.There is also the scene where her husband is dying and he asks her if he ever did her wrong and she smiles knowing that she had taken the right choice by staying with her family. That's when duty calls and love no matter how big it is fails to surpass doing what's right.And believe me there is so much more to the movie and no matter how much has been said in the reviews, there is still more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uncertainty in a certain world, with two mega-star icons falling in love with no punches pulled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be easy to go into The Bridges of Madison County with trepidation. It looks like one of those real hardcore chick-flick romances, where a bunch of middle-aged-to-elderly housewives and lonely women go in and imagine themselves in the part of Francesca being possibly taken away by Robert Kincaid to far away places. And no wonder since it was first a book that was a major hit - and also, from all accounts I've heard, a trashy piece of mainstream for-women work. But the factor of Clint Eastwood is a curious one, especially since he's rarely had movies that were about just two people in love (the closest one can find are in the 70s with Play Misty for Me, which is more of a thriller, and the obscure Breezy). It turns out he was an excellent choice to direct the picture, as well as appear as co-lead, because he never second-guesses or pushes the material where it would feel false.In fact, this is one of the more realistic "weepie" love story films I have come across, at least from recent memory. It starts with the dialog and the characters, and whatever writer Richard LaGravanese was able to take away from the book he made it work for Eastwood's aesthetic, which is that of two people who meet, have actual conversations without pablum or hokey bits, and even when the occasional self-indulgent narration bits from Francesca come up they're not un-welcome. When we see this man Robert come into Francesca's life it's very natural, or appears to be as much as it could be for these two people. Then as things deepen, albeit quickly, this becomes part of the romantic feel that is captured with subtlety and delicacy. So, when the real dramatic quandaries come around- of whether or not this woman will leave her husband, who is a good man without anything on him to make him villainous, and her kids- it too is dealt with rationally, with a sense of tragedy but humanity.Bridges of Madison County is nothing if not a very human tale of love and loss. It's a "chick-flick" with all of its clichés pared down, stripped away of all their chicken fat and shown with the bones that make them work for just any viewer looking for a good story, love or otherwise. And Eastwood is also very good at including the plot device of the two 40-something kids reading through the late Francesca's journals- their own experiences as people are brought in to the narrative wonderfully. All in all, the story reveals the filmmaker to have such a great sense of what makes a good romance film- a hopeless romance, perhaps, in a similar mold of the films of Wong Kar Wai- while also being able to have us connect with these people. The wife commits infidelity, but it's hard to really side either way. They're too real and too conflicted to stick on any one side (some may disagree, which maybe will reveal more about themselves than the actual film, which is interesting), which is rare.And what about the stars? This and Heat are, clearly, the films that in 1995 had iconic stars of their generation on screen facing off. Whereas Pacino and DeNiro had one scene, Clint and Streep have the bulk of the picture to hang on to. It goes without saying Streep lays bare her characters flaws and conflicts and joy so well, a given perhaps, but the real revelation is Eastwood. Who knew such a man who usually eats grit for breakfast and in later years has a gravel-chiseled profile has such a tender soul to lay bare? There are some who will avoid the picture just for this reason, which perhaps is fair; no one wants to see their tough-guy icon showing how "soft" and vulnerable they can be on camera. But for those willing to take a look, it's one of his bravest and maybe even just best performances (as with a recent Sean Penn in Milk, you'll rarely see Eastwood just smile this much, which is great).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meryl Streep,the best actress I have ever seen,is superb in this romantic movie classic. I loved her Italian accent,her hand movements and laughter is something that cannot be taught. She was born with acting ability. I loved her through out the movie.Clint Eastwood did an excellent job as director,and actor. He seemed to let Meryl do most of the acting,because he knew(as I see it) that she was the one with the talent to hold an audience until the movie is over. I have watched the movie many times ,and each time I find something I never noticed in previous viewing's.Her children,in the early years,and in the later years were very impressive also.</fullReview>

Streep is spot on with her accent, the woman is amazing in her capabilities and you would think she was born and raised in Italy! And Clint Eastwood is ever so sensitive behind the camera and in front of it as another reviewer has stated. I remember seeing this movie when it first premiered and I truly almost had to CARRY my girlfriend out of the theater, she was crying so hard. (I said "Sally! The movie is OVER, we need to go! The attendants are trying to clean up for the next showing...come on!") Truly one of the best pictures ever...right up there (for me) with "The Piano."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sublime Italianate Streep Towers Over a Snail's-Paced Romantic Tearjerker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you want to see an actress make something out of nothing, then see Meryl Streep in this lumbering romance novel of a movie. Based on the ridiculous Robert James Waller bestseller (a book I truly loathed), the 1995 film retains a lot of the novel's unbearable treacle and heaving sentimentality. At the same time, screenwriter Richard LaGravenese's adaptation improves the story immeasurably by shifting more of the focus to Francesca Johnson, an Italian post-WWII bride who has become over the years, a lonely, middle-aged Iowa farmwife circa 1965. Her husband and two children leave for four days to the Illinois State Fair, and by chance, renowned photographer Robert Kincaid accidentally drops by the Johnson farm for directions to the famous Roseman Bridge, one of several covered bridges around Winterset, Iowa. Francesca is fascinated, then smitten, and the two embark on a brief but life-altering love affair.It's fortunate that Clint Eastwood chose to direct this film, as it takes his professional certainty and laconic storytelling style to make this vehicle work. Without sacrificing much of his natural machismo, he's also quite effectively enigmatic as Kincaid, though I think he's at least a decade too old for the part. Whether wringing her hands in anticipation or quietly crying in her mud room, Streep, affecting one of her world-class accents, is at the top of her game yet again. The film's best moments are hers in the rain-soaked scene of inevitability toward the end, when the drama is guided mainly by her mastery of the character's alternating waves of regret and longing. What doesn't work at all is the use of a framing device in having the now-grown Johnson children read their mother's love letters about her romance with Kincaid. It doesn't help that Annie Corley and Victor Slezak play these parts as if they are cast in a sitcom. On the plus side, Jack N. Green's cinematography lovingly captures Iowa's bucolic landscapes. But there is no getting around the slowness of the action, which feels interminable at 135 minutes. The DVD came out just two years after in 1997 and consequently has none of the extras we have come to expect from more recent releases.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bridge Less Traveled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For lonely, bored housewives this film offers a heart-rending love story. An unmarried man on a photographic assignment stops at an Iowa farmhouse to ask directions from a middle-aged woman whose family is away for a few days ... conveniently. Thereupon begins a character study of these two people, played by Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep, and told in flashbacks from the POV of the woman's two grown children, after she has died.Streep's character leads a life of stability and bland security. For her, the stranger represents a more adventurous life, one of excitement and new experiences, and an escape from the mundane details of an ordinary, but stable, life. But whenever a person selects one path, he or she necessarily forgoes alternate paths. It's everyone's dilemma. As usual, Meryl Streep gives a wonderfully convincing performance. Also, I must credit makeup artist Roy Helland, who did a great job, especially at the film's end when Streep's character is made to look much older. And the film has a finale that is realistic, rather than cinematically predictable.This is the kind of story that needs to be told slowly. And it is. But it is way too slow. Several times, as when, for example, Eastwood and Streep are "slow" dancing around the breakfast table, the plot almost grinds to a halt. With a runtime of well over two hours, some of the more lethargic moments could have been edited out. I also did not like the casting of the two adult children whom I found irritating. And, with all those wrinkles, that frizzy gray hair, and that receding hairline, Eastwood was about twenty years too old for the role he plays, in my opinion."The Bridges Of Madison County" has its good moments, especially when it is making some social commentary on nosy, small town America. I'm glad I watched the film ... once. But the plot is too slow. The casting is not very good. And as a man, I found the story to be too sappy and sentimental for my taste.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly Romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before sitting down to watch this film, you need the following equipment : a comfy armchair, a HUGE bucket to collect all your tears and a big Bath Towel to wipe your eyes ! This has to be one of the most romantic and sad films made for decades, at least since the 1940's and 1950's. Not only is it highly romantic, but the underlying eroticism will have you in a state long before the middle of the film.To start with, when the film begins, all its protagonists are already dead..... Eastwood, Streep and Streep's husband. This is already tear-provoking in itself. The film is therefore presented as a series of flashbacks in conjunction with Streep's childrens' reading of her diaries.The whole thing is very thoughtfully done, picture quality is excellent, the sets and lighting are magnificent. Streep's innocence ( "What is this passion that's invading me ???" )is extremely beautiful and natural. Eastwood plays it sober but with just the amount of passion to keep the spectator's heart pounding sufficiently quickly !!Even if you are against infidelity, it's difficult NOT to want these two to make out so to speak, as you can feel the passion "boiling up below the skin's surface" ( excuse the culinary imagery please !! )The tears really start to gush during the scene in the rain when Streep and her husband are behind Eastwood in his truck at the traffic lights -the waiting seems endless and the spectator can feel the frustration Streep is undergoing through this scene. We see Eastwood's truck turn off to the left and .......... oh ! its difficult to describe it !The final scene where the ashes are tossed into the river is of course heart-tearing and we see how Streep's children reflect on their own personal lives in the light of what they read in her diaries.It's very difficult to put into words the emotion felt on watching this film, so I'll stop here but would recommend this as one of the most romantic films of the last century which will be a source of inspiration to future generations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sometimes i like to read a book which has been adapted to a film, which i have yet to see. That way i can image the charcters better, and won't be so annoyed when i watch the movie. Of course this also takes away some of the magic of using your imagination.Bridges, is a short book, only 150pgs, but it moved me so much, and i knew why people made such a fuss over it. I then watched the movie, Eastwood, as a director has yet to dissapoint me, and he does far from that with this film.It captures the essence of the book so well, and is a really good adaptation. Ultimately though, i think those who haven't read the book won't gain as much out of it, the movie moved me more so, becasue i knew more about the characters from the book. I felt as if i had just read someone's diary, and was now watching the home video. So if you are planning to watch this film, becasue you love romance, i recommend to read the book first, it's only a short book, so it won't take long to read -- but it will stay with you for ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern Casablanca</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film portrays a beautiful love story with which we get fascinated if we want so. If we forget that this is just another story, with different characters, different situations, a different time and made in 1995 instead of 1940, we could even say that it's a modern Casablanca. The main elements are there: An impossible love, lovers took apart by almost irresistible forces, and several common scenes: The rain scene, the appearance of Eastwood in the rain (similar to the appearance of Ingrid Bergman at Rick's cafe in the night)... In Casablanca they always would have Paris, in The Bridges of Madison County they always would have Iowa...Thus, in my opinion, this film borrows several elements from Casablanca, but not to copy them, but to incorporate them into a different story.This film is beautiful. Eastwood and Streep are near perfect, to the point that we forget their physical appearances to reach their feelings. We are able to see the inner beauty they have found in each other and get captivated by the atmosphere. There is a fantastic use of light which fits perfectly with every situation, and the music is quite good.When the film finishes, you find yourself in deep melancholy. My conclusion is that Clint Eastwood is better director than actor, I guess.My rating is 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love is where the heart is ? or is it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Apparently this film did well internationally ? nominated and/or winning Best Foreign Film in six countries ? but failed to win any Oscar in USA.It's a well produced and directed film ? as you might expect from Clint Eastwood ? showing fine detail for the 1965 settings, great casting (although you can argue whether Eastwood miscast himself as the romantic lead), lush cinematography in rural Iowa, and period mood music that hit the spots...Despite the fact that I generally avoid romances ? in fact I deliberately waited all this time before seeing and reviewing it ? I found myself liking it very much. In the first place, I much admire Meryl Streep (as Francesca Johnson) who, once again, shows her mastery of acting, period. Her ability to say much more than enough without using words is simply astounding. In contrast, although Eastwood does a credible job, his efforts fall short; adequate, but only near the closing scenes, does he show the real agony his character, Robert Kincaid, must feel while standing in the rain.Sure, this is a tearjerker for many. However, if you can control your emotions for a little while, you'll more easily see that this is a story that confronts the nature of human love as never before, I think. The central question is undeniable: does true love between two people ever truly exist? It's what the two lovers do eventually, however, that puts this story onto a higher philosophical plane ? and thus provides hope for Francesca's children when they learn of her affair after her death (that's no spoiler ? the whole story begins with the reading of her will).The supporting cast typifies the people of the area: rough, inbred, literally down-to-earth, rural people who form the backbone of America ? thus making Kincaid's presence all the more attractive to Johnson, as she digs the dirt and shoots the s*** with the local women. Streep just falls into the role, even down to the blunt and dirty finger tips...I don't know of any other outright romance that Eastwood has made or in which he has appeared. So, for those reasons alone, it was worth seeing from my perspective ? apart from the stunning performance by Streep, arguably one of the few women who could have taken on this part.Recommended for all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Male= Muscles and Sex</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so promising... a sensitive, intelligent, artistic male who will seem to bring friendship, affection, and the world to a world deprived mid-western mother/housewife. But said man's words, style, and genuineness begin to falter rather too quickly for comfort. Maybe it begins with that shower--our thin lover we find is also a very masculine, muscular heroic type male. And then his words become rather trite and at times out of character--in fact his character and his claim to being a special male show through. To cap it off this interlude of friendship, which at times is so compelling as friendship, and would make one of the most revolutionary of Hollywood movies if it stuck with this theme, simply reverts back to the sexual encounter formula. So what we are left with is her drama: should i leave with this new lover before hubby comes back from the fair, or stay put in a good, if somewhat limited, marriage--to a very reliable, and trustworthy male.After she makes her choice, there is a long, drawn out ending, which is so utterly commonplace that even the most involved viewer must wonder just what went wrong with this movie that it has to end with these sorry platitudes. My answer would be the shower scene--which is very much like a long haired man (our male here is described as a "hippy" by the towns folks) feeling the need to balance that off (or off the map) with a superman type torso. This is not a new man story, but rather a confirmation of the forever man who has sex with a woman and then goes off on his horse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before seeing this movie I read a review by Roger Ebert,with dictionary at hand I managed to understand about 50% of it,but it was a rainy night and heck, whats 5 bucks. Told in flashback the story really begins with a truck pulling up to a farmhouse in Iowa. A Man emerges he seems to be in his seventies the truck in its thirties he is a photographer on assignment looking for the bridges of Madison County.he is lost. Considering the age of man and truck,God must have dropped every thing to help them to get this far. The woman of the house is alone, having some sort of death wish she offers to get in the truck and show him the way.right.As they ride off into the Iowa countryside we wonder if they will find the bridges or more to the point,who will expire first the man or truck.Call me a cynic but I took the points and bet on the truck. Returning to the farmhouse Francesca who is on a roll asks him to dinner,she seems to get her lines from a supply of fortune cookies with gems such as "We are the choices we have made" and to break the tension,"would you like some iced tea" not exactly Noel Coward but hey this is Iowa. Francesca speaks with an accent that could only have originated in a Mexican section of Boston. The rest of the Movie or as Roger would say the "Film" is a little hazy as naps kept interrupting my following of the story and vice versa. In the end "The Bridges of Madison County" leaves many questions,did Francesca pass on the secrets of life to her children? Did Robert go on to explore the mysteries of life such as the Subways of Paris or the poems of Bob Dylan? Did Francesca's husband ever plow the north forty? As for myself, I wonder what became of that truck?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a big slob for love-romances, but I must admit I was surfing the web while KCET presented this film.I am a huge fan of Meryl Streep ("Francesca Johnson") and can tolerate Clint Eastwood ("Robert Kincaid"). Infidelity happens every second in marriage, and the trailer certainly lets you know IMMEDIATELY this is a love-affair between the two leading stars. Please give me some d.r.a.m.a. with love-affairs. Humdrum is every day......I suppose the point that I didn't get excited over is how the "kids" became adjusted to their mother (Streep) wanting to be cremated and her ashes scattered off a bridge. Cremation is an every-day affair, now. And, this story reversed the passion in the family: remember how large farm-families used to be? Farmers were hardly ever too tired to make babies. That "Mom" was the horny one should shock no one, if "Dad" weren't romantic enough to quench "Mom's" roving eye. Most moms are clever enough to realize four days aren't going to erase many years of sacrifice and love.....she made "the right" decision, because she knew she was where she belonged.I shed tears even for happy and beautiful movies - "Bridges" didn't open the spigot for me. Maybe I'll give it look-see at a later date, but right now I wouldn't dash out and purchase a DVD. "STARZ" showed it every day for a week ? Wow ! I like to watch movies I love many times, but that's a bit much for me. I guess I would have loved all that cinemascope landscape and beautiful colors - some of the songs in the score I really love. I also feel great acting can be done in a very simple story, but I didn't find it here. Glad all you guys liked it - I AM one to feel love comes at first-sight - and it can also grow on you - but, "Bridges of Madison County" just didn't turn me on. Sorry -</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Barely rises above Harlequin literature</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) is a country woman left alone in her home as her husband and two children drive away to enter her daughter's bull into a prize contest. She decides to relax, perhaps read a book, take things easy while her family is not there to keep her busy round the clock. But, things change when a photographer drives into town. One Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood).As much as I don't like this movie, I must at least admire what Eastwood has managed to achieve with it as its director, given the source material, which is basically just housewife literature, in the most derogatory meaning of the term. But with Eastwood at its helm, it transforms into something almost bearable. It is unhurried, yet never slow. The characters feel like actual three-dimensional people, and not just props meant to fuel our fantasies. The sets are nice, the dialogues feel natural and if only the story had even the slightest bit of substance, this could have been something. Plus both Eastwood and Streep are phenomenal actors.Alas, the story is garbage. I can see Eastwood trying to tell something about the loneliness of house wives, or the loneliness of a traveler. You can see his attempt to build passion where in the book there's only lust. But, the fact remains, that this is simply a movie about an affair. The movie tries to hang bells and other assorted decorations to hide the fact, but it fails. And it's dull to boot. You can guess exactly how the story will unfold from the very first scene, and even the pretentious framing story isn't enough to arouse our interest.The Bridges of Madison County has its upsides. And, honestly speaking, I will be the first one to admit that I'm about as far from this film's target audience as is possible. So my opinion should not count for that much. And yet I'll say that this is one boring film, with horrible, horrible morals to teach and I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie - no one can honestly say anything else. It has everything: an engaging story, romance, passion, moral issues, believable characters, a good picture of the time period, excellent actors, beautiful scenery, etc.. Still, I do not fall head over heals over it in the way I did when I watched it at the pictures when it was new - 19 years ago. The movie has not changed, of course, but I have. I am older, more mature, and have more life experience - including a marriage, two children and a divorce.I can now see the story from the other side. Suppose, that I went away with the children for a few days, in an errand that was fun and good for the whole family. During this brief time, my husband should enter into a relation with a woman whom he considered much more exciting than me. More beautiful, with a more interesting background and profession, and a more exciting life-style... And the reason that I would be less exciting, would be that I - who maybe also had other dreams as a young girl - have given all I have for the good of our family...That would not feel very nice. Also, it would not feel very nice, if he died first, to find out that he has treasured a lot of mementos from this short affair. Without realizing, that the romance would soon have passed and the woman taken on ordinary proportions, if they had lived together in an everyday reality for some time.Basically, I think it is morally wrong to make a movie like this. It gives people the wrong ideas, inspires them to seek illicit love affairs and dampens their conscience, and can even cause family tragedies. Still, it is very good as escapism, if you keep in mind that that is what it is, and that it cannot happen in reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than The Novella</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bridges of Madison County is a romantic film that stars Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep together with Annie Corley, Victor Slezak and Jim Haynie. The screenplay was adapted by Richard LaGravenese and it was directed by Clint Eastwood.The brief, illicit love affair between an Iowa housewife and a post-middle-age free-lance photographer is chronicled in this powerful romance based on the best-selling novella by Robert James Waller. The story begins as globetrotting National Geographic photographer Robert Kincaid journeys to Madison County in 1965 to film its lovely covered bridges. Upon his arrival, he stops by an old farmhouse to ask directions. There he encounters housewife, Francesca Johnson, whose spouse and two children are out of town. Thus begins their four-day affair, a liaison that fundamentally changes them both. Later Francesca chronicles the affair in a diary which her flabbergasted grown children read; never would they have expected their mother to be capable of the passion she experienced.The film is sentimental, slow, schmaltzy, and very satisfying. It adapted a bestseller with heft, wit, and grace.Excellent performances by both Eastwood and Streep.Overall,it was superbly acted with an emphasis on quiet, graceful moments of tender revelation as it builds to a crescendo of powerful and conflicting emotions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Have Dreamed For A Little While Than To Never Have Dreamed At All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood proves yet again what a versatile director he is with this poetic and sensual romantic drama. The main characters are introduced as they are going about with their ordinary lives. Francesca is a housewife going about with her usual household duties and Robert is a photographer for the national geographic magazine. But the union of these two characters gives birth to something extraordinary. We pretty much see the movie through Francesca's diaries which are being read by her children. Reading it makes them realize that there was also a time when they themselves dreamed of more things. 'The Bridges of Madison County', is about unfulfilled dreams and that even though one doesn't always fulfil his or her dreams, it is better to have dreamed even if for a little while, than to not dream at all. On the technical side, Eastwood has kept everything delightfully simplistic. He uses a lot of symbolism with rain, bridges, heat. The soothing soundtrack, especially the piano pieces, and smooth cinematography are splendid. Meryl Streep is very sexy in her convincing portrayal of Francesca. I found her accent a little faulty as it sounds closer to Eastern European rather than Italian. Clint Eastwood is great as the loner photographer who finally wants to hold on to something he can't have. To sum it up, this lyrical movie is like a song, a song about dreams, about love and about living your life the way you want to, even if for a small period.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer poetry on the celluloid unexpectedly from Clint Eastwood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was really surprising to see this sheer poetry on the celluloid coming from a person who is known more for his action and cowboy image, that's Clint Eastwood. This is his emotional and sensitive movie which forces us to think about whether we are enjoying our lives being where we are, or we still regret the decision we made in our lives. I was completely spellbound as the end credits rolled and really enjoyed every minute of this movie till its last scene. The story is about four days in the life of a happily married lady, which she lived with a complete stranger. She cherishes and remembers those four days till her last breath and leaves her diaries with all her confessions for her two grown up children to read. Meryl Streep is superb and lovable as the lady and Clint Eastwood himself plays the role of the photographer who accidentally comes in her life. The movie has some emotionally written scenes which have a spiritual value. The dialogues make you look inside your own life and question your own existence and its worth. The unsaid conversations between Meryl and her husband, who know everything are filmed in the most impressive way. The best part is that as the children read their mother's diaries, at first the boy feels disgusting reading it, but then understands the feelings of her mother who was also a loving women from inside. And its even more beautiful that at the end they both don't feel any guilt for their mother but feel proud at her innocence and truthfulness. Mahesh Manjrekar made "Astitva" in Hindi, inspired from this movie, but changed the sensitive topic into a tense drama which becomes cunning and sarcastic in the end. He kept the character of the lady alive to face all the hardships after her confession. Whereas the original movie is lovable till the last scene,the Hindi version has only one saving grace "Tabu" who has acted brilliantly. For many reasons, still "Meryl Streep" is more believable in her impactful act. She is just adorable in the scenes which show her inner conflicts. Along with "Clint Eastwood" they both look like real life lovers and talk through their eyes.This is a poetic expression on screen straight from heart, not to be missed, even if you have seen "Astitva" or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bridges of Madison County is my favourite film of all time. The acting is totally unblemished - especially Streep who gives her heart and soul to the role and gives one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. Eastwood plays his role straight and the dynamic between the two is perfect, Streep brings the best out of him.Unless you are a corpse it's almost impossible to control your emotions throughout this film, if you have any empathy with the characters by the end you will be crying your eyes out. Every time I watch it I cannot help crying even though I know exactly what's going to happen.To be honest, no other film has ever made me feel this emotional, and it's not so much the storyline but the performances themselves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to do watch this movie for a class project.I have always been a Clint Eastwood fan.At first I didn't want to watch a love movie with Clint Eastwood in it. The Dirty Harry/Bad boy of movies. It put me to sleep at first because it was so slow. But when I put it on for the second time because I had to watch it for the project.I have to say it was a wonderful story of two people who meet for the first time and fall in love. After the story unfolds you start to understand why Meryl Streep ( Francesca Johnson )has to pick from her family or Clint Eastwood (Robert Kincaid )a photographer for the National Geograpic how she fall in love with. It is a great movies that every couple should watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A most surprising approach of mid-life love for a mother and wife, though seen by a male director apparently well supported or supplemented by some women in the team. What happens if for four days you are alone, but not abandoned, and meet a man that reveals to you that there can be some new love in your life even though this life of yours is satisfied, happy, well-balanced and characterized by no particular need nor want, nor even, as for that, wish, except maybe the desire to listen to and enjoy some classical music, some opera singing ? and it could be anything at all ? which is not appreciated by the other members of the family ? That is rather light as for discontentment or dissatisfaction. A short-lived love affair develops during and over these four days and you are confronted to the need to make a decision. The situation has already been considered by many and in many films. You break off and away and let yourself go with that love affair. Then later on you regret what you have lost in the process. Or you resist and do not yield and you regret all your life what you have not done. In both case you enjoy what you have taken or kept and you are divided between the two sides of your decision : does what I have taken or kept balance what I have rejected, refused or let go ? The film is thus not particularly innovative by its theme. Yet it has a special perfume, fragrance. What is it ? Certainly not the reaction of the children when they learn about it after your death. Their reactions are predictable and even superficial. The special value of this film is in fact in the two actors and the way they embody, with their body acting, the meeting of two potentials, the passion and the end of it, the loss of it and yet the survival of it. Apart from this marvelously well rendered flesh of the film the subject is banal. Meryl Streep particularly transcends her part and takes us into the deepest layers of her mind the way they ripple on her surface, on the surface of her body and behavior. We feel her disarray at first, her fascination then and her conservative sacrifice last in the most humane and subtle way. We are suffering and rejoicing with her and each side of her situation or decision has its lot of suffering and its lot of rejoicing. That's why this film should be kept in mind and remembered.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine &amp; University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</fullReview>

On the first day a photographer named Robert pulls up and asks directions to a bridge. Francesca shows him to this bridge and for four days they have a deep and passionate love affair.Who will Francesca choose? Her family or Robert? The movie is so erotic and passion flows beneath it. I loved it. The acting is excellent and the whole time I was washed away in this torn love affair. It was more erotic than I had expected and that made the movie even better. The affair doesn't happen really fast either the movie builds up to it. That is why I think that's what makes it so incredible.It was a love affair under troubled waters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bridges of Madison County has two stellar leading performances by none other than the great Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood. It is directed by the great Clint Eastwood and has very strong story. It sounds like the perfect film huh. Well it ends up being far from perfect. This comes out of many things. Namely the ending which is clichéd and overly sentimental. There are also many scenes that seem very forced and fake. The performances help but come far from saving it. The parts with Meryl Streeps characters children who are reading the notes she left after she died. Even if those parts are better than the rest of the film they still seem very forced. A forced and clichéd films that has some good performances in it that still can't even come close to saving it.</fullReview>

Her immense emotional struggle towards the end of the film was also expertly acted out by Streep to make this character one of the most indelible and unforgettable in the province of love stories.About the film, BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY is one of Eastwood's warmer films. Here, there is none of the cold moralizing and icy insights we are used to viewing in his regular masterpieces like MILLION DOLLAR BABY and MYSTIC RIVER. He made BRIDGES easy to relate to, engaging the audience to a deep emotional journey. There is one scene that will surely overwhelm you--the scene in the truck where Francesca is in a great dilemma.Another showcase of Meryl Streep's unparalleled acting powers!!!

		<shortDescription>Solid Adaptation Of Best-Selling Romantic Novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whilst her family are away, a frustrated housewife in Iowa befriends a touring National Geographic photographer and they have an intensely passionate four-day affair. But when her family are due to return, there are tough choices to be made.Based on the popular novel by Robert James Waller, this is a thoughtful, sensuous, poignant and bittersweet love story. It's really just a two-character drama, with fine performances by the unlikely pairing of Streep and Eastwood. He's the person she'd like to be - a free spirit with nothing to tie him down - but ultimately her love and respect for her family and her sense of obligation to them win out. It's a movie about the heroism and work-ethic of motherhood and how much women sacrifice to care for their families, and it makes its point with great subtlety and insight. A very well-crafted film, with a powerful score by Lennie Niehaus and brilliant editing by Joel Cox. The key to developing character and drama with this type of story is to carefully control the editing to give the performances centre-stage, and this is a textbook example of such judicious pacing. Eastwood's son Kyle has a cameo as a bass player in a nightclub. Shot in the real Madison County, Iowa, on beautifully picturesque locations.</fullReview>

Women do give up their lives for their family. They give to their selves last. And yes children are too busy blaming their parents without really understanding there reasons for doing what they do.The very first time I saw the movie I thought some of the jesters were a a little hokey. And some of the lines they had didn't seem to fit the script. BUT then I kept watching it over and over and it didn't seem to matter to me.When Franchesca just stared at Robert in the rain and didn't get out of the truck I was getting so upset.He smiles and shakes his head yes...God why aren't you going? Shes pulling on the door handle...PULL THE DOOR OPEN...GO WITH HIM. YOU BELONG TOGETHER!!!!! He waits at the light with her staring at his hands taking off the necklace and hanging it over the mirror. Here come my tears.He pulls off to the left and she follows with her eyes...What are you doing you fool? She goes home and collapses with sadness...Will she ever see him again??? Then one day the package comes. Such surprise. She opens his world in a box. She is part of his world...Tears overflow me and bring me to sobs. She gave up her life for her children, for a certainty that comes only once in a lifetime.If you have that certainty....don't ever give it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like these type of films which follow the relationship between two people all the way through without focusing too much on other characters. 'The bridges of Madison County' does just that. About 15 minutes into the film Clint and Meryl meet for the first time and the majority of the film is about the blossoming relationship between them from that first moment. The performances were so great from both of them and Meryl Streep captured the Italian accent so well. The surroundings were very beautiful too, i don't know if this was really filmed in Iowa or not but the beautiful surroundings fitted the film perfectly. It's a very slow moving film but that works very well for this genre. I found it to be one of those types of films were you can't miss a single word, i needed total and complete silence and i couldn't take my eyes away for a single moment. Also this would have to be the most moving and romantic tearjerker i have ever seen. Unmissable entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eastwood and Streep make movie magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ever since I was in the fourth grade and saw Dirty Harry on tv, Clint Eastwood has been one of my heroes. I have cheering for him ever since. Someone said that he dominates every scene he is in like a lion in a roomful of kittens! I have to admit that I was reluctant to watch this film at first. Its hard for me to picture Clint in a role where he doesn't punch out or shoot at least one person. And in a romantic role as well! I thought to myself no way! The Bridges Of Madison County had been a beloved best seller although I have never read it, but I am going to go looking for it tomorrow because Eastwood and Streep make magic on the screen in this sad but beautiful film. They have both never been better, she as a happily married but bored farm wife and he as a kind gentle National Geographic photographer with whom she has a four day fling with. People don't realize that Eastwood directs most of his own films, in fact he won Best Director Oscar for Unforgiven. I feel this is his best work. I have never seen a more beautiful film to look at when they show the lovely country scenery (you have to excuse me I grew up in West Virginia). This is a film that doesn't have action so the dialogue and interaction between Robert Kincaid and Francesca has to hold your attention and boy does it ever. Eastwood never liked to use much dialogue early in his career. In the "No name" Italian Westerns he tore out pages of the script and told them to give him minimal lines. He is wonderful in a role that really requires him to "act" in this one. They are very tasteful and discreet and showing the growing bond between Robert and Francesca (a less talented director would have had them both naked and in bed). Whats so sad in the end is that they realize what can never be and that they weren't meant to be together. It reminds me of that poem "for all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these, what might have been". It is interesting that they began the film years later after the main characters had died and it is her children finding out about it. I just hoped that Robert and Francesca were both together forever drinking iced tea and "splitting the atom" in Heaven. Bravo Mister Eastwood and Ms. Streep.</fullReview>

Clint Eastwood has given us several films of understated elegance and restraint passion. He understands cinematic techniques very well and makes good use of his actors including himself. From the chance encounter in the beginning, to the first dinner alone, the audience can really feel the tension building between the protagonists, so wrong that was so right, at least for that moment. Honestly, I don't condon violating the marital vow, but this film played out that forbidden desire and human bonding in unfortable way. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great acting (as usual) from Meryl Streep!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I regard Bridges of Madison County mainly as a story about a housewife &amp; mother's strength to endure her daily life of serving her family while continuously being ignored. Francesca finds new strength through a romantic, sensual, albeit a very short affair with a worldly and sensitive photographer. I don't approve of adultery yet I cannot fully condemn it here. The film manages to depict their affair as a naturally evolving, mature relationship, as if a ten-year-long relationship were condensed into four days. It is mainly due to Meryl Streep's vivid acting that the affair appears neither trivial nor lewd. Her performance radiates all the love, longing, and passion of Francesca. Clint Eastwood was very believable and had the right chemistry with Streep, but I found his directing sometimes a bit too slow, though overall he created a nice atmosphere for Francesca's story. The only major complaint I have are the two actors who played the grown-up son and daughter. They were always overacting and were rather an annoyance to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Robert Waller's novel wasn't literature, but it was a good read and superb material for a terrific romantic movie. But Eastwood's choice of himself as Kincaid and Streep as Francesca were almost as bad as the polyglot of actors who portrayed her children (except that they were inexperienced actors apart from being miscast). If you really liked the book/story, picture this for the movie: Sam Elliot as Kincaid and Katie Capshaw as Francesca. If you can't picture it, check out the earlier TV film, a modern romantic western, "The Quick and the Dead" (1987, I think), in which Elliot and Capshaw paired in lead roles. Pure love chemistry. Add a little subtlety (and teach Elliot to handle a Nikon camera properly, which Eastwood neglected to learn), and we'd have had a great, instead of a good, flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clint Eastwood's first movie for the female audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During his long and amazing career Clint Eastwood has mostly done strong, violent and masculine movies for men. I'm not suggesting that ladies are unable to enjoy for example his cruel westerns or hard-boiled Dirty Harry series but I got the feeling that blokes have always given his films maybe a bit more value. "The Bridges of Madison County" was the first work Eastwood did completely for the female audience. I have to make a little confession. If this motion picture would not be produced/directed/starred by Clint Eastwood I probably wouldn't be interested in it at all because this certainly doesn't represent the genre I prefer. I went to watch "The Bridges of Madison County" with my mother when it was running at the theaters. I was a young guy so I guess almost everybody in the cinema thought my mother dragged me to to see it when actually it was quite the other way round since I was the one who's the enormous Eastwood fanatic.Clint played retired old gunslinger William Munny in one of his finest masterpieces, celebrated "Unforgiven" (1992). He was 62 years old at the time and since then he's been honest to the audience and has mostly played aged characters - tired wrinkled men in the age of retirement. After the role of a veteran secret service agent Frank Horrigan in "In the line of fire" (1993) he was for example aged swell-mobsman Luther Whitney in "Absolute power" of 1997. ("I've got to go have my pacemaker checked, it has been so exciting talking to you.") Most recently in "Space cowboys" (2000) he played Frank Corvin, retired engineer who got another chance to get into outer space after being replaced by chimpanzee in the late 50's. ("Clock's ticking, Bob. And I'm only getting older.") But "The Bridges of Madison County" (1995) was the exception that proved the rule. Clint Eastwood was already 65 years old and he certainly didn't look like a day younger and unfortunately this turned out to be the biggest problem of the movie.In consequence of Clint's considerable age film isn't necessarily completely believable. When the audience is looking forward to see can the male character of a sentimental, even erotic love story get it up without viagra I could state there's something wrong with the casting - even though I don't personally think Eastwood has troubles in that department. I'm just thinking that female viewers who don't necessarily find Clint's oldish charm extremely appealing will definitely be unsatisfied. Personally I'm more than pleased that Eastwood decided to play the leading role of Robert Kincaid. The fact that he's way too old doesn't luckily bother me at all since I'm a guy, heterosexual even, and I'd much rather enjoy the stylish and talented performance of my all time favorite actor than anyone else. I'll give "The Bridges of Madison County" 10 out of 10 because even though I don't adore the story it's basically a flawless film and one of the best motion pictures of this type I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>135 minutes of pure emotion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes when you see a film about two people in love, you wonder if the writer has ever been through that unique experience. With Bridges you know from the beginning that the writer has experienced these emotions first hand. It is probably the best account of two people falling in love that has ever been seen on the screen, and if you have ever been through something similar, it will all come flooding back to you.There are very few actors that could carry off the part of Francesca and Meryl Streep does so to perfection. Her every movement conveys the character. Eastwood is almost her equal and considering that he is also directing, portrays Kincaid in his usual laid back yet intense way. Ladies I know find him extraordinarily attractive, and this reviewer certainly feels that way about Streep. Jack Green's simple photography does not detract from the story but, a minor criticism, the sound is a little boomy and distant - "authentic" perhaps.If you've ever been in love, or if you want to see what it's like, watch this film. It is a delight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far my favourite love story on film. I saw it twice in the cinema and yesterday a third time on video, and it again made me cry! SPOILER ALERT Although the present day scenes are not too good, the actual love story is fabulous. Streep and Eastwood manage to render true love that gets to you. Everyone who has experienced falling in love in a truly ecstatic way will be touched. Streep is fantastic an actress, as she knows to convey emotions sometimes without having to say a word!The absolute climax of the movie is the heartbreaking scene where Francesca (Streep) sees Robert (Eastwood) for the last time. Robert sits in his truck, waiting for Francesca (sitting next to her husband in the truck behind him) to come to him and leave together. She wants to, but cannot. She firmly holds the door handle, pushing it to almost unlock while her doubts are tearing her apart. Robert lingers at the now already green light to buy her time. Her husband starts blowing the car horn ("what's this guy waiting for?"), not having the faintest idea what's going on... Your heart can only cry "Go to him, go!", but it won't happen. Their love will not develop any further, yet it will be cherished by both of them for the rest of their lives.It poses the ultimate choice between loyalty and true love.Go see it, go feel it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Good Portrayal" of Waller's romantic novella.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The question of "Adultry" doesn't sway my view of this film, however the casting does. For those who have read the book, the film follows the Waller's romantic endeavor about an unattached National Geographic photographer and a naturalized Italian/American housewife in the mid-west. Perhaps contractual or legal aspects of bringing this novella to the screen resulted in an Eastwood/Streep tandem. Streep is a great American actress with tons of credentials. Eastwood has proven his worth in both acting and directing. Without naming anyone, I feel that several other male/female tandems could have made this movie "Great". As it stands I credit it with a respectable "6". Streep's italian accent was off the mark and once more she looks as much Italian as Katie Hepburn. Great love story for romantics, could have been a movie milestone with the right actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love found too late, but never really lost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find myself fascinated by this film about how the paths of two people can cross at what is both the right and wrong time in their lives. Bittersweet romance found too late in her life and with the unattainable woman in his.In spite of her questionable pseudo-Italian accent, Meryl Streep does as fine an acting job as she has done to date. With just the right amount of passion, frustration and limited hopelessness, she brings out in her character what it was Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) found so irresistible. Eastwood, on the other hand, portrays the kind of world-traveling photojournalist I wish I could have been. Here-in lies my personal affection for the movie ~ the combination of a painful love destined to haunt these two characters for the rest of their lives, and the excitement of Robert Kincaid's profession.I recommend "The Bridges of Madison County" to anyone willing to suspend reality for a couple of hours and get lost in a fanciful celluloid encounter, not intended to strain the brain but to entertain.</fullReview>

He did not like it, he thought it was too slow and he doesn't care for La Streep.Streep is burned in Europe, I don't know how she does in the U.S. I loved this movie but if you have this on VCR or any other movie with Streep on VCR, watch how many times she touches her face. Also watch HOW she touches her face.Believe me girls, if you ever touch your face like Streep does, you are pathetic, theatrical or ready for a three months vacation.Anyway, I liked this movie, specially for the dialogues. And... one of the best love scenes. They care for each other and they bring out the best of themselves.I wonder why they needed the flashbacks, obviously it got better sold with the children finding out about their mother, but it's a nice Valentine story. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed movie which still captures the brilliance of love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) is a journalist on a regular job to photograph the simple beauty of Madison County's bridges. He is a journeyman professional with a woman in every port of call; but Francesca (Streep) is different. Not only is she married - she's the only woman he'll ever truly love. And she, tragically, realises exactly the same of him...Robert J Waller's novel is adapted awkwardly here thanks to the imposition of a weak and unconvincing framing narrative involving the children of Francesca discovering her secret love days after her death. Their needs and loves are irrelevent to us, the viewer (and are treated lamely by Eastwood the director), because we want to follow the story of pure love between Kincaid and Francesca: A love that exists tangibly for four days but is metaphysically timeless. This part of the movie offers a romantic drama of considerable grace and power in which Eastwood gives a performance of great strength opposite a Streep of staggering excellence. The closing scenes in which they see one another for the final time - and then she receives his most treasured belongings after his death - are so painfully moving that they will sear into the memory of anyone who has ever really loved and lost; long after the rest of the film has become a blur.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Meryl Streep is almost believable as a middle-aged married Italian woman stranded in Iowa who who falls in love with a photographer (Clint Eastwood) who awakens feelings within her she had thought long-buried. The acting may not be perfect, but this is a film which will continue to strike a deep chord with women of a certain age who awaken to the fact that they have sacrificed more than they realised in bringing-up their families. Eastwood's attention to detail and his unnerving eye for a good script help to ensure that this is much more than a vehicle for entertainment, and help to confirm both his extraordinary range and his place in American cinema.The nature of human desire necessitates the film's moral ambivalence, but it is most of all an affirmation, in an increasingly material age, of the deeper values and feelings that make us properly human.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first heard of this film when people said it was especially good for those married to see it but I did not think much of it. In 1997 I happened to find the novel in China and I decided to have a quick look at it. But I could not read it too quickly and,in fact, I read it and reread it. Then I told my good friend to read it though she had just started to learn English. She begged me to read the paragraphs for her though other people had warned her against reading this novel,which might mislead a woman(they said). I did and I tried to explain it to her. We found we both had tearful eyes when reading Francesca's "fare-well" letter to her son and daughter. We were especially touched by her last sentence in the letter: Go well,my children.I saw the film myself and then tried to search for the novel in the Chinese version. I have failed to do so but have not lost hope.Now, I must tell whoever happens to read this comment of mine something for them to make their own judgments. I met two American engineers from Iowa last month and we talked about the novel and the film. They said the novel had twisted the truth of life of the ordinary Americans,especially those in the quiet and peaceful country towns in Iowa." We don't like the novel and we dislike the film. We folks in Madison County are very traditional," they said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's so rare these days for a Hollywood movie that starts with a major league best seller, to turn into anything but homogenous drivel, particularly by the time you've loaded big-time on-screen, and off the screen talent, and forced the story into a script that provides both strong male and female leads-something required these days to get all the boxes checked on the studio marketing head's questionnaire.My advantage in screening Bridges, was that I hadn't read the book, and had no expectations as a result, I didn't leave the theater saying, ?they left so and so out, or that was different than the book?' You know the drill.What I got was a good, sensitive story, artfully crafted and presented by two premiere film stars, showing their wares singularly and jointly..It is likely that they are both terribly miscast?maybe Streep 10 years ago, and Eastwood 20 would have been a stronger match, yet no one in today's acting circles comes to mind as a preferable substitute. I found their romance by no means unbelievable.Let's give screenwriter Richard LaGravanese some credit-although he bit it a bit with his directorial debut ?Living Out Loud', he's right on target here. Eastwood longtime collaborator Jack Green presents us with beautiful, stirring images-the tent pole to the entire experience.Will watch it over and over again without tiring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Intimate Portrait...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood creates an intimate world as director, staging some wonderfully touching moments. The relational chemistry between Streep and Eastwood sweeps over you; their sincerity and believability is unquestionable. Streep gives a typically brilliant performance where Eastwood exudes surprisingly romantic and warm qualities, not typical of some of his rougher characters.The most unfortunate parts of the film are the scenes containing the present day when Francesca's children are sorting through their deceased mother's memiors and discover the affair. Eastwoods attempts to capture their process of understanding their mother and relating it to their present situations is ruined due to some poor performances by Annie Corley and Victor Slezak. However, this is no reason to omit the movie from your consideration.The Bridges of Madsion County takes you into the hearts of these two individuals who share a precious moment in time that stays with them forever. The leads performances are nothing short of classical stage drama ; eloquent, specific, touching, and innately human. Don't miss an opportunity to view this fine film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bridges of Madison County is based on the novel by Robert James Waller and is directed by Clint Eastwood. The film stars Meryl Streep, Clint Eastwood. The film is a heartbreaking tale of a love that cannot be and the deep hurt of two very lonely people.It's the 1960's and Italian born housewife Francesca Johnson(Meryl Streep)is married and has two children who she adores.Yet she feels under appreciated.One summer her husband takes the kids away for a few days and she meets National Geographic Magazine photographer Robert Kincade(Clint Eatswood).After a couple of meetings the two strike up a friendship and soon fall in love and begin a passionate affair.Both are lonely souls who bring the other out of their shell.Yet both know this must end and that Francesca does love her husband and won't leave him.Intercut with their scenes are glimpses of the present day as Francesca's grown children Carolyn(Annie Corley)and Michael(Victor Slezak)clear out their mums house after her death.She's instructed them to cremate her and scatter the ashes off one of the county's beautiful bridges(the scene of many of Robert and Francesca's happiest moments).Francesca has also written down what happened and left it for them to read.A beautiful love story and Meryl and Clint are perfect together with great chemistry.Clint directs as well with a lot of effort going into translating this story to the screen.A triumph for all involved this is one of the best love stories ever filmed but be warned have some tissues handy as you will be crying by the end.</fullReview>

I think that most of us women in our late 30s and early 40s dream of having such an experience!!! the part of the movie that makes me cry is when she is in the car with her husband and her lover is waiting for her decision to follow him. But she decides not to because she is afraid of many things...the first one to stop loving him when faced with reality...losing her family. Something else is that I think that those diaries were too many to write her experiences of only 4 days.

		<shortDescription>4 days can change your life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a lesson for me. I've read all the reports about this movie, I agree with some and disagree about others. Have you ever come across a person, start talking to them, and all the while you're listening to them you feel as though you've known that person all your life? Many would call that an old soul. Some put that in the reincarnation bit which I don't believe in. I put that into these words. That person is your better half. If that person is of the opposite sex, and you were given the opportunity to have four days with them, what would those four days be? The time or moment that changed your life? Your fork in the bend? I believe in passion and love at first sight. Very few get to experience that kind of passion because most chose what is safe. Most people settle for what they know and what they can handle. Francesca did. The lesson in that movie for me was ... don't settle. Love is too special and worth it all. At the end of your life, when you have to look back on it all, its better to say I took a chance and look at what I got even if it was but for a short moment then to say what if .....Love may hurt more than anything else in this world ... but love can also be the most beautiful thing you will ever experience.

		<shortDescription>A love story for a mature audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a love story that unfolds from a letter addressed to the two surviving children of a mother who accidentally met a man who was lost. The letter was to be read by the children upon the death of the mother with instructions regarding what was to be done with her remains.The man was a National Geographic photographer who was trying to find a particular covered bridge. The man stops in front of a farmhouse and merely asks directions to the bridge. The woman finds it easier to show the man how to get to the bridge than explain the directions.While together at the bridge the woman finds this man quite different from any other that she has ever met. The man, while in the midst of photographing the bridge, is also captivated with the woman. At first neither make any advances toward each other that would cause them to enter into a romantic relationship.After the episode at the bridge, the woman offers the man a glass of iced tea which is gladly accepted during the hot summer day. During the conversation at the kitchen table in the farmhouse the two begin to become more involved with each other by exchanging background information. The result is a very deep emotional bond between two people who would never have met under ordinary circumstances. So they took advantage of the time they had together knowing within themselves that an opportunity such as this may never happen again.In a gentle presentation the audience is guided through the entire story from a chance meeting to a final resting place for two people who never stopped loving each other. The letter addressed to the children fully explains that this is not a sordid love affair or any act of betrayal. It is a story about a mother who still remained faithful to her immediate family but fell very much in love with a man who had a different lifestyle to offer her.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When he's at his best,Eastwood is the keeper of the flame.he makes movies which hark back to the good old days of the old cinema:oldies but goldies."The unforgiven" brought back the western as it used to be;"midnight in the garden..." conjured the Tennessee Williams atmosphere;and "Madison" ,these are the days of Douglas Sirk,"all that heaven allows"With Sirk in "all that heaven allows",Eastwood shares the passion for nature,for this "middle of nowhere" where Streep lives.The cinematography is luminous,and Eastwood lovingly films both the landscapes and the wonderful actress he chose .At the beginning of the movie ,she's a housewife,almost a matrone,and little by little,like a delicate flower,she blossoms and becomes a wonderful woman.It was a very good idea to display the romance as a long flashback,a thing of the past.These foolish things which Streep hides in her chest were the thrill of it all,these memories that make a life worth living. For Eastwood -who 's like a rolling stone,without a home,but has been in the whole world- and Streep -stuck in the middle of nowhere-,this brief encounter will enlighten their whole life,and we feel happy that such things happen from time to time in a world so cold.And if you do not shed a tear during the last sequence,you've got to have a heart of stone</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised by several elements of the movie - Clint directs with more sensitivity than I would have thought possible and his own portrayal of Robert is very good also. I admire Meryl Streep more than any other actor and she is very good in this, too. You can feel the sexual tension between the actors and that is when the movie is at its best - the little moments when dialogue is at a minimum but there is a lot going on. It was also nice to see a couple of approximately the same age, and also nice that Meryl's husband wasn't made out to be this total jerk, thereby giving a segment of the audience the reason to understand why she is having an affair. Sometimes things just happen between people and that's what I got out of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So what?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what? Those are the words I wanted to say after I watched this movie. The number of women who sacrificed their own interests for their families all over the world ever since is countless. What is so special about this plot? Francesca is no exception having a dilemma to choose between dream and duty. Thousands of women strangled the throat of their own dreams and desires under the pressure of society just as Francesca did. The movie is overall slow and sad type. The only thing I intend to emphasize on is Meryl Streep. I really wonder why people respect this "award-winning" actress so much! She is simply pathetic and a clown. She has terrible problem with her hands, especially in this one, she constantly touches her own cheeks, throats, arms, parts of her dresses, this and that, other things, failing to decide what to do with these hands, where to put. She speaks in the most inaudible way as if having an uttering problem, drugged or drunk or sleepy, as if the words are rolling out of her mouth! In all the movies she plays all these same "too-good-too-simple" type female leads. She has got one and only one idea of acting in the world, just leaning her head on one side and a simple smile and a line-delivery that sounds like stoned. I am really curious how can she even survive in the film industry. If one looks at the movie databases, one would find that Ms Streep either practically begged for some roles on her hands and knees at times, or some other times said she would rip some other actress's throat out for getting the desired role! What is the matter with this woman? I am really curious. Film industry does not have to be so stupid in the first place. Clint Eastwood is quite lovely in this movie, and believable as an irresistible magnet to lonely housewives. I have a feeling that he should have thought about doing such roles more than those western movies or one of those stereotype sullen face cops with creased foreheads who never smiles. I do not know if it has ever occurred to him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By golly,Clint can act!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always felt that there was a difference between actors and movie stars.Actors take their craft seriously and work hard to become the characters they portray,while movie stars draw high numbers at the box office with their name alone.It's not hard to distinguish who these people are.However,in the case of Clint Eastwood,I have never really known which of the two categories to place him in.We have all of the "Dirty Harry" type shoot-em-ups and the "The Man with no Name" westerns that would place him in the movie star category,and then we have films such as this one,in which Clint proves to us that he can,indeed,act. Clint can be a romantic lead and compete with the best in that area.I love this film for it's rural settings,Eastwood's direction,and his marvelous acting performance along with Meryl Streep's.Adultery is indeed a touchy subject with me.Being raised with certain values,I can't help but detest the mere subject,but in the case of this particular film it is so well done you almost have to overlook it just this once.This movie is a well done potential classic.One of Clint's best from the standpoints of both acting and directing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unusual Tale of Love, Loneliness and Infidelity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) wanders into the life of housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep), for four days in the 1960s, changing her life forever.This is a very odd tale. On the surface, it is a story of infidelity, and while the son seems to have a more violent reaction than is probably warranted, he is generally coming from the right point of view. But it is also a tale of romance, passion and more. Viewing from the vantage point of Francesca, we do not really find fault in her actions, even though they are probably wrong.Therein lies the problem of this film... is it justifying adultery? It could be taken that way. But, also, it could be taken as a family story, as Francesca felt that keeping her family safe and together was more important than running away... it is so hard to judge. From within her shoes, could we really say she chose incorrectly?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bridges of Madison County</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard many things about this film based on the successful novel, and starring, produced and directed by Clint Eastwood, mostly how much it makes people cry, so naturally I knew to give it a go. Basically the mother of brother and sister Carolyn (Annie Corley) and Michael Johnson (Victor Slezak) has died, and in her will she gives instructions of a new death plan, being cremated and her ashes scattered off a bridge in Madison County, like the man she mentions, Robert Kincaid (Eastwood). In her box of possessions, she has written the story of her and Robert, and this is where the film goes to flashback. Italian mother and wife Francesca Johnson (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Meryl Streep) is alone for four days while her husband Richard (Jim Haynie) are away at the Iowa state fair. She sees a car pulling up to her house, it is Robert asking for directions to a bridge that he needs to photograph, and she decides to take him there. He takes the pictures and takes her back to the house, and she invites him in for a drink, and then a little later when he planned to leave for dinner. You can tell Francesca is really attracted to Robert, but we're not sure about him. Day 2, he comes back and they spend some more time together at the bridge again. It is later in the evening where they become a lot closer, and eventually kiss and end up in bed together. The next day there is a little squabble about the affair situation, and after day four he decides it is right that he should leave, and Richard and the kids (till now) never found out. Years later, Richard is on his death bed, and Francesca every year always visits spots Robert used to go on her birthday. Of course she discovers he has died when his attorney sends her many of his things. Carolyn and Michael of course understand how passionately their mother felt for Robert in those four days, and how the memory of him helped her survive till death, so they honour her wishes. A very touching story that you can feel more than one way about, i.e. is the affair wrong or right, and who should Francesca be with? It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Meryl Streep was number 58, and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Eastwood was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Streep was number 26 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 90 on 100 Years, 100 Passions. Very good!</fullReview>

When the band is next shown the bass player is now black and playing a Fender electric. Later in a final scene of the band, the white dude and his dog house are back. No one else in the band has changed only the bass and bass payer. Couldn't see whether it was a P model or a J model but it was definitely a Fender. The only explanation would be jam session, but since no other personnel were changed in the band and the dog house is nowhere in sight while the other bass player is playing, it would be safe to assume that this was not a jam session.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this was certainly different to Eastwood's usual directed/produced/starring pictures. He is truly a multi-talented star, managing to direct, produce and act in picture after picture - not just that, but managing to do so in brilliant picture after brilliant picture. Since he took the director's chair, has he let us down once? He's had one or two silly flicks - á la Blood Work - but even the worst of which have remained utmost enjoyable four-star flicks... And this amazingly sensitive and warm piece of work is the best of his four-star flicks...His wife has described Clint's character in this, Robert Kincaid, to be the most like the actor in personality out of all his characters... If this is true, then he really deserved to get to where he is. What a gentle, kind man... Clint takes a break from the tough guy cowboy/cop, and takes on a warm-hearted and charismatic photogorapher who doesn't have a threatening bone in his body... He does the part almost flawlessly, showing some real emotion, this a truly three-dimensional performance from Clint.......But it must be said that he pales in comparison to his partner Meryll Streep. I had only seen her in one film before this - Angels in America - and back then, I was just outright impressed. But after this...WOW... What a perfectly emotional and teary performance... We really feel for her on every level... A role worthy of its Oscar, Meryll's 11th nomination I believe... WOW, again...There is no action in this flick... Yes, it will bore your average Scarface/Bad Boys action seeking teen... But if you're patient and can get past a rather slow opening, you will LOVE this... I think this is the kinda film that housewives watch and cry together on their girls' nights... It is just that touching... Exciting? Not really, it's completely laid back and easy-going.. It does not rush at any point, and the viewer will be grateful for this, because every second counts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A eulogy to a really top director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose I have seen every Eastwood film ever made. Some are a great deal better than others but surely this has to be his very best both in the role of actor and director. The character of Robert Kinkaide is so fitting for the mature Eastwood. Gone is the macho, tough icon of earlier movies and in this we see a developed whole actor at total ease with himself both in front and behind the camera. I can watch this film again and again because it is so lovely. It's a gentle film that takes the audience along with it so convincingly. There is not one moment of over acting. The narrative is believable and the ending is exactly correct. Eastwood has created a wonderful atmosphere of high summer in Iowa, you can feel that intense heat that surrounds them. The film is flawless, a rare thing. Meryl Streep, an actress whom I don't always enjoy, surpasses herself as the perfect partner for Eastwood in this movie. This is possibly the best love story that I have ever seen. There is no gushing,Hollywood sentimentality and of course no violence,course language or gratuitous sex perhaps thats why it works so well. I urge all lovers of the art of film making who have not seen this movie to watch it objectively and admire the craft of a truly great director /actor. I cannot believe anyone could criticize this film, When one thinks of some of the garbage that wins Oscars, it shows just how silly the Academy Awards can be. A film for men and women alike because I feel we can all, to some extent, identify with the two characters. Simply a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood, (Dirty Harry) directed and played the part of Robert Kincaid and was nominated for a Golden Globe. This movie is beautiful! The CD and the music is superb! In the movie Kincaid is a National Geographic photographer. There was an insert in National Geographic saying that they never had a photographer by that name and they never published an article about the bridges of Madison County. But when one watches the movie it seems to be based in a true story. Meryl Streep (One True Thing) won the SAG Award Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role. Kincaid and Francesca Johnson, Meryl Streep, meet while her husband and children are at the Illinois state fair. Francesca is honest, sincere, homemaker. They are just two people that meet at a wrong time in their lives. They fall in love in four days, a love that lasts forever. She cannot follow him because of her family and the whole story is sad. There are scenes where it is difficult not to cry. The scene where Kincaid comes back and it is really rainy. They see each other, she begins to cry and her husband is so oblivious that it takes forever for him to notice that she is crying. She grabs the door handle of the car, but she cannot go. It is an asphyxiating scene. Another touching scene: she has grey hair and her husband is old and sick and he tells her "I knew you had dreams but I could not make them come true." The story telling is terrific as well as the photography. I love how the story is told by her kids, and how they go through their mother's things and how that affected their lives. She tells them that "As one gets older ones fear subsidizes." True! There are movies about the same topic but the audience is made to pass judgment, but in this one it is tough to judge. The characters are so lovable and sincere. The ambiguity of the situation leave the audience torn between love, right and wrong and makes the audiences reflect in their own lives. It is a gem of a movie! The entire romance was a serious thing for both of them and throughout the rest of their lives they never forgot each other. I just love this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magnificent romance from a distinguished director!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few stars have had such a huge resurgence in Hollywood both on a popular and critical scale than Clint Eastwood, from Heartbreak Ridge in 1986 to the present. In his little masterpieces, he puts together beautiful photography, sentimental music (his other passion), and enthralling characters. He has covered a range of genres in his career, from action, westerns, suspense, and even musical biographies. The realm of romance is a new venture for Clint, and he follows through with it brilliantly. The Bridges of Madison County is Eastwood's foray into a different part of America's heartland, geographically and spiritually. Robert Kincaid (Eastwood) is a photographer for National Geographic who goes out on assignment to shoot the covered bridges of Iowa's Madison County. Through asking directions, he meets up with Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep, in another fine performance), a farm housewife. What separates this story from all other romances is that they are concerned their running away together will tarnish what strong feelings they already have for each other. Sometimes, the will of the spirit is greater than all else. Clint sculpts some amazingly lush and picturesque scenes, using landscape and atmosphere to his advantage. He is accompanied by a gorgeous score, composed by himself with Lennie Niehaus, simple but fitting to the background. I've often had a struggle trying to prove that Eastwood is more than just a "make my day" stereotype, but a real actor with real characters and real style. With Streep, I've had much less of a problem backing up the same argument. She is much more than just an actress sporting another accent each time she steps in front of a camera. I rank these two among the best in the business, having a genuine love for what they provide to an audience. This radiates with every scene they create, expertly and feelingly. It's very simple and very difficult to explain how romances are able to work for an audience without implying that it is delivering corn or crap. All I can establish is that if you can feel the chemistry working between the couple on the screen, it gets you every time. "Bridges" works for me big time, not just because I idolize these two stars, but because I got an intense calling back to the golden age of cinema, where you could cut the intensity of the actors with a knife. Eastwood and Streep show that they have learned from the days of classical cinema, revealing to us that the old ways still work and still pack a wallop. The Bridges of Madison County is a masterpiece, carefully crafted, lovingly performed and shot, and touchingly expressed. This is one of the best films of 1995. Rating: Four stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't leave this review without making a comment about the movie. Although the situation was not exactly the same, I once had to let go of someone that meant everything to me, for reasons much like the same in the movie, this person had to leave my life. I had this person only a short amount of time, and when it came to an end my world of course had to move on, but the time we had left an impact on my heart, although years later those imprints are still there. Right after this happened, my friends bought me the book on tape, knowing at the time they could never convince me to read the book. I appreciatively took the tapes and a few days later slide the first into the tape player. I was immediately amidst the beautiful relationship that happened between these unique beautiful people. I couldn't stop listening, and stayed up an entire night, letting the novel flow through my ears. I laughed and I of course cried. I have read the book numerous times now, it sets above me on the shelf and I still read it from time to time. Seeing the movie, I was pleasantly surprised, Hollywood had not destroyed the novel, like many books are destroyed. Although the movie had been changed a bit, it was still moving and conveyed the sentiment and the beautiful relationship that Fran. and Robert. I cried tears at the theater like I had never cried before for any other movie. I can't count the number of times I have seen the movie to date, I don't watch it daily, or monthly, but from time to time, I need to feel what I feel when I watch it. I can never believe how I get sucked into the movie time and time again, and without a beat I cry and truly wish she'd open the truck door and run to Robert. Yet, I completely understand, sometimes...sometimes...true love has to wait, b/c life often steps in the way.I realize that many find this movie about an affair that should have never happened, about an unfaithful wife. However, in life, sometimes things happen, which, as hard as it truly is to understand you just cannot control. I believe it was probably one of the few times in Fran. life that she was true to herself. Many may find that selfish. But as the movie says, "love like this comes but once in a lifetime." Many and most people people will never find the true love that was conveyed in this film, and often enough, when you find it, it's truly not yours to keep, but it is nice to have, at least for awhile, I for one can attest to that. The movie is beautiful and I feel that Meryl and Clint were perfect and convincing for the roles they played.</fullReview>

This is nothing like Dirty Harry or The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Clint meanders around like a pretty boy from a daytime soap opera. For two hours, I suffered agonies trying to figure out what was the lesser horror: my wife's wrath (and the prospect of weeks on the couch) should I run for it, or the prospect of permanent brain damage should I sit through this.

		<shortDescription>A Film For The Elders...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film like 'The Bridges Of Madison County' is meant for the elders, it's a touching tale of 2 elders who fall in love with each-other over a course of 4 days.Based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Robert James Waller, Cinema Legend Clint Eastwood directs this sweet tale nicely. Also, Meryl Streep's power-house performance helps elevate the film.'The Bridges Of Madison County' tells the story of Francesca Johnson, played by Streep, a lonely, insightful Italian housewife in Iowa. While her husband and children are away at the Illinois State Fair, she meets and falls in love with a photographer, Robert Kincaid, played by Eastwood, who has come to Madison County, Iowa to shoot a photographic essay for National Geographic on the covered bridges in the area.The film begins well, and the 1st interaction between the hero and heroine is charming. However, the writing falters in the middle, and even the pace dips. But, a emotional &amp; challenging finale makes up for it. Richard LaGravenese's Adapted Screenplay offers some really nice dialogue, while Eastwood proves his mettle as a filmmaker yet again. Cinematography &amp; Editing are fine.Performance-Wise: Streep rules the show with a power-house performance. The Academy-Award-Winning Screen Icon sinks her teeth into the part, and brings it out with flying colors. Eastwood has done a decent job. Annie Corley &amp; Victor Slezak are satisfactory. Others lend good support.On the whole, A Sweet Film, mainly meant for the Elders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quiet and affecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1960s a somewhat dissatisfied farmers housewife Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep meets photographer Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood). Her husband and kids are away for four days--and they both start to fall in love with each other.This was a big hit in 1995 to everyones surprise. It was just a simple love story but everybody seemed to love it. It IS good. The script is excellent--everybody talks and acts like real people. Nothing is overstated--everything is quiet and subtle allowing the audience to discover the characters for themselves. Eastwood is excellent and Streep is superb--she was justly nominated for an Academy award for this performance. It is very good...but it just fell a little short for me.It moves a little too slow--this doesn't have to run over two hours. I also thought the rainstorm ending was a bit much. It just never connected with me emotionally--I usually cry during movies like this but I was completely dry-eyed during this. So it IS a good movie (I give it a 9) but just didn't completely work for me. Worth catching though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Honest emotions, touching story, deeply felt performances...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I put off watching THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY because I expected it to be a lot of sentimental nonsense about two aging fools who fall in love at first sight before the soap suds become thicker and thicker.Well, I was wrong. I have to confess that I was afraid I'd have to put up with another Meryl Streep accent that would leave half of her words unintelligible, but again I was wrong. Streep gets across the Italian ancestry without too heavy an accent and gives a remarkably fine performance, doing so much with her eyes and expressive face that she doesn't even need dialogue. She shows us the pain just below the surface--and the boredom and loneliness of the housewife who yearns for something missing in her marriage relationship.And Clint Eastwood scores too, this time without guns or tough guy lines that we're used to hearing from him. He does an honest, realistic and natural job of acting that makes him seem what he is supposed to be--a traveling photographer with the National Geographic intent on filming some of those lovely New England bridges.The story moves just a little too slowly for comfort at times and this is the only major flaw because it's told in such an honest fashion from beginning to end. Streep's children are extremely well played and their viewpoint is understandable when they discover the diaries she has kept of her four day love affair.Touching and straightforward in its simplicity, there is much to admire about the film. Streep and Eastwood are at their level best. The color photography is a treat and so is the unobtrusive background score.Again, the only real flaw is the length. It's the kind of relationship tale that could have been told just as effectively without scenes that are held too long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film, at its heart is NOT faithful to the intent of the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that it is interesting how many people have written in their favorable reviews of the film, how much they hated the book! I Should think that that would be no surprise to anyone who loved the book, since the film does no real justice to the heart of the novel! What do I mean? Well, that is both somewhat complicated and simple. But in short the screenplay writers and indeed the director have taken a novel which was about a man who was a poet, a visionary and a shaman, (Who was almost completely out of, and beyond time,) and basically turned him into a two bit prick with pants! And if that wasn't bad enough they have also turned the lead female character into a midlife dissatisfied housewife who needs some action, when in the original she was a real, European woman, found as if by surprise in the UnDead Midwestern state of OHiO-IoWa, simply in awe of a man who faced the world completely on his own terms, and who was quite unwilling to try to "civilize" him! I knew, when I saw an interview with Meryl, about the upcoming film, that this adaptation was going to be a total hack job! In the interview she stated that she was given assurances, from Mr. Eastwood, that "all that wordy, poetic stuff" that was in the novel, would NOT be on display in the film.That was also when I knew that the woman I fell madly in love with, who made such an amazing character as Sarah Woodrough, in the incredible film "The French Lieutenant's Woman," was not the same as the characters she has played {big surprise.}I would then conclude that Ms. Streep is far more likely to be like the character she plays in films like "The Devil Wears Prada," than any character she played, when she was a younger actress!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pete Eastwood has written 'Madison County' so so beautifully, that you can't help but fall in love with this GEM of a Film.'Madison County' is a highly-emotional film, The love story between the oldies is very touching. The film has it's share of ha-ha ho-ho scenes, but it's the emotional content that overpowers in those odd 91 minutes.The film has extra-ordinary theme, each &amp; every shot looks wonderful. Music by Michael Giacchino is simply superb.Video Cameos by Edward Asner, Jordan Hursh, Roy Schnieder &amp; others are perfect. Asner's work is truly memorable, standing out without a doubt.On the whole 'Madison County' is one of the finest films ever made with Streep and Eastwood together! Don't miss any little bit of a chance. Thumbs Up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immoral and creepy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clint Eastwood was, and is, a lousy actor. The old actors don't just fade away-they become directors-and lousy directors at that. Clint was good during "Spaghetti Western" days when he had the least amount of spoken word and smoked reefers like no other cowboy could. Give him a dialog-he fumbles and mumbles. The screen writing is the worst. The flashbacks and the letter reading by the brother and sister team is just annoying and boring. Here is a guy from nowhere and has a fling with a married woman. Apparently he has been doing this all over the world including Bari-Itlay, India and wherever he can land himself for a Bed (read-sex) and breakfast. Unless confronted by the wives or killed by the husbands he even manages to publish few nude photos in the National Geographic. The movie is not "On Golden Pond" and these two are not Hepburn and Tracey either. Merryl Streep drifts from her Italian accent (she is the only one who has acted in this movie) to Iowa accent when not cooking country sausage for this "handy husband of three days.' A good porno movie has more entertainment value than this flick. This is an overrated movie that I had the unfortunate displeasure of seeing. I'm not the only one-one out of four thinks this movie stinks. Clint is overrated as a director and underrated as a Mayor of Carmel!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not one of my all time favorites..a bit disappointed after all the hype.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie, in my opinion, was not an "all-time best" love story. Did anyone see the notebook? This was a beautiful love story about sacrifice and love. I thought the other story-line with her children was the true message of the movie. I felt is was more of a realization film rather than a love story. I thought that Clint's acting was very dry, as usual. I didn't fell the energy or get the chemistry. I didn't like Meryl's accent, a bit phony. I thought the movie was a bit slow. It seemed like the relationship was a passing, exciting, fun fling, not a true love. It is definitely worth watching to form your own opinion. Not not one of favorites.</fullReview>
