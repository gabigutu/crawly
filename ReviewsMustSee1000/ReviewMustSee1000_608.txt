		<shortDescription>A decent thriller that was advertised wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The previews and commercials for Dream House led one to believe it was a horror film, it is not, not at all. I think that is where a lot of the disappointment is coming from. It is a pretty good thriller, once you get used to the fact that that is what you are watching. The storyline, basically that horrible things have happened and we the audience have to figure it out along with the main character, is not the tired thriller standard, or at least the details are different enough to not seem tired. It's actually intriguing and the answer to the mystery is not obvious miles out, even if the climax sort of is. The acting is really quite good too. People who like mystery thrillers should enjoy the film, fans of scary movies will mostly not like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Y'all crazy, it's good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Am I the only one that really liked this movie? Am I the only one that thought it was insanely clever, with a sick double-twist ending? Maybe not, but from the other reviews it seems like I'm one of the few! I agree with the other review - I watched this because I thought it was a horror movie, and it is much more of a psychological creepy awesome movie. But it's good, enough said.Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz are great, enough said.Written really well, and directed well. Once you think 'ah, nice, cliché, I see the ending' - nope! Give it a shot, it's a really great movie. I feel like with a few modifications it could've been even better, on par with The Sixth Sense, but it was still great. I'd watch it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz have a great chemistry together, too bad they wasted their efforts on this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generic and predicable thriller made somewhat bearable by the undeniable chemistry and acting chops between Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz, even though both actors involved deserved better than what they were giving with the material. Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz work very well together on screen ( and supposedly in real life as well) but they should have waited for a better film to showcase their chemistry and acting chops then this film, which not only does not respect their efforts in trying to bring humanity and credibility to a badly written script but does not even try to at least capitalize on their efforts in bringing more to the movie. Instead, the movie goes into several different unnecessary directions that goes no where and drags this film down. Naomi Watts is good as well but i just did not think much about her character and found her an unnecessary, forced inclusion to the story that ruins the film by making it even more predictable than it already is. The film also feels like it was two separate movies before it became one. Its a ghost story then it moves into a mystery with out it making much sense, not to mention the fact of how predicable the whole structure is. Let's just say that you have in fact seen this story before.Its alright for what it is but it could have been much more, especially with two great actors (Weisz and Craig) having great acting chemistry on screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit confused but good after all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This begins to look like the story of a successful publisher that decides to quit his job and retire to the house of his dreams to live there peacefully with his wife and children. But the story gets complicated while it develops itself and the dream house soon becomes a nightmare one after husband and wife know that terrible murders had taken place there five years before and strange events still related to it are still happening there and scaring them. But from then on the story loses itself in a lot of loose ends making it very confusing although most of them get tied up in the end in a somewhat fanciful outcome. After a certain time we understand that the story mixes up reality and imagination or even dream. The end of the movie may be considered an open ending, happy or unhappy according to the viewer's interpretation of the surprising final scene. The acting is good, the thrilling scenes are good enough and the plot confusion doesn't spoil the movie whole after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Mystery that Deserved a Better Screenplay</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the successful editor Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) quits his job in the GPH Publishers to move to the suburb New Ashford and dedicate more time to his beloved wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and his daughters Trish (Taylor Geare) and DeeDee (Claire Geare) and to start writing a novel.The family is frightened by a stranger watching them through the window and Will decides to investigate and finds teenagers in a satanic cult in his basement. Sooner he discovers that the family man Peter Ward killed his wife and his two daughters in that house five years ago. Will goes to the police but the officers do not give attention to him. He also learns that Peter Ward spent five years in the Greenhaven Psychiatric Hospital but was recently discharged. Will tries to get more information about the murder with his neighbor on the other side of the street, the divorced Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts), but she refuses to give any information to him. Will decides to go to Greenhaven to get information about Peter Ward and he discloses a dark secret about the former intern that will affect his life in his dream house. "Dream House" is a good mystery that deserved a better screenplay. The story has a great potential and a surprising plot point but does not develop well important characters and situations after the revelation of the mystery. Usually this type of twist happens in the end, like in "The Others", or "Ghost", or "Identity", or "The Sixty Sense". In "Dream House', the mystery is disclosed too early and the last twist is very weak and predictable. But anyway I liked this film.Daniel Craig is one of my favorite contemporary actors and Rachel Weisz is impressively gorgeous. Naomi Watts is effective, as usual, and the relationship of Ann with her husband deserved a better development. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Casa dos Sonhos" ("The Dream House")Note: On 31 March 2012, I saw this film again on Blu-Ray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The shame is not in the copycat techniques but rather in the failure to exploit the stolen ideas to the fullest extent.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dream House had plenty of potential with its story, despite the fact that it's completely derivative of two other movies. Revealing those films would spoil the surprise, as they are both popular and well-received by audiences and critics alike. The shame is not in the copycat techniques but rather in the failure to exploit the stolen ideas to the fullest extent. Dream House fuses the plots cleverly, but fizzles when the first big reveal can be guessed 45 minutes in (if not sooner) ? and is then purposely betrayed at the one hour mark so that audiences can ponder and digest the not-so-shocking revelation.Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) has finally decided to quit his job as an editor at GPH Publishers to spend more time with his wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and kids (Taylor and Claire Geare) and to start writing a book. He moves to a large house in rural Fairfield County, which holds a dark history. In his new home, undisclosed by his realtor, a father brutally murdered his wife and kids. Will eventually learns that the unhinged man, Peter Ward, spent five years in a psychiatric ward and was then released ? to a halfway house nearby.Will's children aren't too fond of the considerable dwelling, especially when they see a mysterious man watching them through the window. Fresh footprints in the snow support their sighting, and Will is repeatedly awoken by bumps in the night. The neighbor across from him, Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts), knows something of Ward's incarceration, but refuses to divulge information. Everyone in the town seems rather tight-lipped about the deadly incident, and Will takes it upon himself to get to the bottom of it. When someone continues to harass his family by stalking the house, he visits Ward's institution to uncover some startling evidence.An accomplished, celebrated cast of characters gives Dream House a higher quality (than its B-movie origins) and greater promise. Some will say they're wasted on this script, but it's not as dismal as that. Unfortunately, it's the kind of storyline that needs polishing, a few more solid thrills, and smarter twists ? or at least more intelligent psychological zigzags. The serene music compliments the sense of foreboding that steadily creeps into the picture, along with the savvy use of mirrors, reflections, general mise en scene, and shuddersome environment (namely the hallway and basement). Most of it is gimmicky but effective. But as with any mystery, the solution is the most crucial aspect ? it's the one element that proves most memorable and determines whether or not the film will be recognized as unique. If a whodunit concedes a letdown, even its high points are unlikely to be forgiven.- The Massie Twins (GoneWithTheTwins.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Sheridan Thriller is for the Thinking Viewer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Editor and author Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) quits a high power job in Manhattan to relocate with his wife, Libby (Rachel Weisz), and two girls to a quaint New England town. However, as they settle into their new life, they discover that their house was the murder scene of a mother and her two children. Will tries to befriend his neighbour Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts) and find out from her what happened but she is not too eager to talk.Meanwhile, Will's younger daughter starts seeing someone lurking outside the window at night. As Will pieces together the haunting puzzle, he must find out who murdered the family in his dream house before the culprit returns to kill again."Dream House" is not a suspense thriller that will jolt you with sudden loud music and cheap scares. Instead, it plays games with your mind, keeping you guessing about what's happening and making you sort out the plot yourself. Now, if you like your thrillers done this way, then go for it. If not, this one is going to be a nightmare...Director Jim Sheridan's plot build-up is almost by-the-book and he makes no apology for it. The opening scenes show Will as a devoted father and loving husband. At first, his daughter's visions of a shadowy figure are dismissed quietly, but when Will gets physical evidence of someone lurking around, our curiosity heightens. Sheridan, who gave us "My Left Foot" and "In The Name of The Father", is not delivering this thriller to his audience in a platter. He just dishes out the cards and lets his audience sort them out - at least until the closing sequences.At first, it feels rather weird to see beefcake Craig as a domesticated guy. However, there is a good chemistry between he and Weisz who also lends a loving and tender touch to the proceedings. The kids, played by Claire and Taylor Geare, are also convincing and adorable. It would have been great to see more of Naomi Watts but her role is rather limited - and she acquits herself professionally. Fans of Rachel G. Fox, the Scarvo girl in TV's Desperate Housewives, will find her in a cameo as Ann's daughter Chloe. All in all, a thriller for the thinking viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ending says it all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if, as in "Jacob's Ladder" and "Siesta", the ending changes everything. In "Jacob's Ladder" we learn at the last moment that what we have been watching has been the thoughts of a dying man. We learn in "Siesta" at the last moment that Claire was murdered, and what we have been watching is her remembering the events of the last few days. In "Dream House" we learn that Will has just returned from a stay in the country where he wrote the book "Dream House". If this is true, what we have been viewing would appear to be the creative process that goes through the writers mind as he is writing his novel. The film, to be sure, has not been constructed as well as it could have been, but viewing it again with the ending in mind may help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Huge Potential, Huge Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Atenton moves into a dream home with his lovely wife and two precious children. Weird things start to happen and the family discovers an ugly secret about their house. Neighbors are acting strange, the local police are no help, and investigating the house's history begins to unravel the family, and gives way to other supernatural dimensions. This movie could have been a terrific ghost story in the vein of Shutter Island, The Others, or The Sixth Sense. Instead it loses focus and turns left into a formulaic and somewhat random "whodunnit". More like "who cares?". About halfway through it got boring and stupid and illogical. What a waste of Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and a totally underused Naomi Watts. Recut and re-release it. There's a really good movie in there somewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once again, "Studio Heads" ruin the Artist's Work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film with great expectations as I'm a great fan of Sheridan's body of work and also happen to enjoy Psychological Suspense/Horror films (NOT slasher film trash). So I was really quite disappointed with this effort by a team that seemed to have so much potential.But now it all makes sense to learn that the final effort was yanked away from Sheridan; which has resulted in a homogenized and generic thriller made up of (and the result of) idiotic random behind-the-scenes "creative decision making" by Test Audiences(?) and less-than-passionate-about-the-story/genre Studio Heads whose primary involvement was solely in getting a "Horror/Thriller" into theaters by October in order to cash in on the Halloween audience.Seeing this happen again and again, I doubt they will ever learn. This is the only industry in the world where one (as a Producer) can "fail upward" just because you got something (anything) produced (in the can).As a final note: There was a fantastic Spec Script floating around a couple of years ago with nearly the same title... "The Dream House." It was somewhat similar, as it involved an Architect &amp; his family who rehab &amp; remodel an abandoned mansion by a lake; but THAT script was a truly terrifying Horror/Ghost Story along the same lines as Shirley Jackson &amp; Robert Wise's quintessential B&amp;W Horror Classic "The Haunting." With this Dream House turning out to be such a dud and a nightmare, hopefully that spec script will resurface in the near future to make up for this failed effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Dream House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those in tune with tabloid fodder, this is the film that brought Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz together, and this closeness got translated on screen as they play husband and wife with two beautiful children who have uprooted themselves from the bustle of the city and settled for a quiet suburban area. From the poster alone you may think you're in a for one heck of a creepy supernatural horror film given the creepy looking kids blending in with the wallpaper of the titular house, but this was one great misnomer, coupled with the fact that director Jim Sheridan and his leading cast have boycotted what was the final cut of the film when it was wrestled from the director's control, so as with all troubled productions, the final film bore the brunt of that falling out, and it tells.If you are really keen to watch the movie anyhow, then do yourself a favour and skip the trailer. You have to, because this poorly made trailer committed two grave mistakes in imagining things not in the film such as its relentless focus and edit in making one think it's a horror film complete with boo scares at every turn, and worse, revealed a crucial plot point of the story, which made it extremely plodding for those waiting for that particular reveal to show itself so that the film can then continue on for them. Granted there were a little bit more twists and turns in store for the final act, though now they become an exercise of futility just waiting to happen, and didn't come off as much of a surprise anyway since the bulk of the game was already out of the bag.Daniel Craig plays Will Atenton, an aspiring writer who leaves his day job in order to relocate with his family to spend more quality time with them, as well as to work on his greatest novel. And what more can a man ask for with a perfect wife Libby (Rachel Weisz), perfect children Trish and Dee Dee (Taylor Geare and Claire Geare respectively) and a perfect, beautiful house to live in. And the narrative really took a lot of pain to paint this picture of the perfect life, that is until a shadowy figure started appearing in the front lawn, with inexplicable situations like a car trying to run Will down starting to increase in number and frequency, leaving Will no choice but to do a little bit of personal sleuthing that led to the discovery of just who he really was, with the narrative then switching gears to discover whether Will was insane, or wrongly accused.Like many shows that featured spirits in them, Dream House follows the mold of having a whodunnit mystery placed into its story, for the viewer to be actively engaged during the sifting through of red herrings, and the protagonist either having to encounter spirits that inevitably assist him in his quest for truth, or impede him by scaring everyone away. Or at least that was the intent and the potential. What happened was a sad state of affairs with a very ordinary narrative void of any scares promised, and came off as more of a mystery, not even a thriller, that took its time to unfold. And with the small number of characters, you'll be able to guess in a jiffy just who the guilty party is. You can probably see shades of Jim Sheridan's intent for a montage of sequences that probably got included by way of being already shot, but alas, that vision he had was not to be.Which is a pity, since this film boasted a strong cast of Craig, Weisz and severely underutilized actors in Elias Koteas who had so much promise to be so much more menacing, and in Naomi Campbell who stars as Will's neighbour who seemed to be ever so interested in Will's state of affairs and may hold they key to the secret he is looking for. Ultimately it is not that bad a film, if one can consider a pretty average fare with ruined twists done in by its own promotional reel, which held so much prospect in being a psychological mind-bender under a proper director's hands, rather than to become a by product of what could have been no thanks to politicking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glad I missed the trailer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>None of the reviews I have read would have prepared me for Dream House. Yes, the trailer, which I watched after seeing the movie, would have ruined much of it for me. The reviews here at IMDb, even skipping those with spoilers, would have had me expecting a very different movie than the one I saw. The biggest problem of the movie itself was, of course, the script. It went beyond confusing, and the final bit didn't help to clear things up for me. OTOH, had it ended without the final revelation that Craig's character had written and published a book, I could have enjoyed the film more than most who have panned it here... that's because I work in a mental hospital. This film is an amalgamation of several genres, including TV's The Ghost Whisperer in which dead characters refuse to fully accept their deaths until things have been put right, secrets are revealed, and justice is done. It also reminds me of Unknown (with Liam Neeson) with a very confused main character whose memories clash with reality. The struggle to understand what is real and what isn't is one our patients live with every day.I do agree that Craig, Weisz, Watts, and the rest do their on-screen jobs very well. And I find myself wondering what the film might have been had Sheridan been allowed to work unmolested by panicking suits from the production company. As it is, I'd recommend folks watch it on DVD once they've forgotten what was in the trailer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is almost unbearable to watch the first hour of it. It was that boring. Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz's characters are to lovey dovey to be a realistic couple though I understand they met and fell in love while making this firm. Sadly most couples together for years and 2 kids are not giddy like these 2. The movie is not scary and slowly staggers on. You then meet Naomi Watts character and a lackluster script and her unnecessary character really make this film a huge disappointment. I've seen all 3 of these actors in good films and unfortunately these 3 got together and made a very bad film. The last 15 minutes of the film does close some loopholes and brought my final rating from from a 4 to a 5 but overall, it's a very disappointing movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'DREAM HOUSE': Three Stars (Out of Five)Psychological thriller/horror film from director Jim Sheridan ('IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER', 'MY LEFT FOOT', 'BROTHERS', 'IN America', etc.). It was written by David Loucka and stars Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts and Rachel Weisz. Sheridan argued over the production of the film and screenplay constantly with producer James G. Robinson and lost control over the final edit of the film. He was so unhappy with it, as were Craig and Weisz, that the three refused to do any promotion for the film. Another constantly noted issue with the film is that the trailer reveals the film's big twist (which happens about halfway through the movie but it's still the biggest surprise of the film and major turning point). Despite these major problems with the film I still found it interesting and effective, to a certain extent.The story revolves around a publisher named Will Atenton (Craig) who moves from New York to New England with his wife Libby (Weisz) and two daughters (Taylor and Claire Geare). He has hopes of writing a novel there but is interrupted by a mysterious stranger watching their house at night and talks of a family that were killed living in his house prior to him. With the help of his neighbor Ann Paterson (Watts), a single mother going through a brutal divorce, he begins to investigate what happened to the family that lived there before him. He learns that a mother and her two daughters were believed to have been killed by the children's father, a man named Peter Ward, at their home. Ward was found to be too mentally unstable to stand trial and was let go after spending five years in a psychiatric ward due to lack of evidence. Atenton begins to panic and suspects that Ward is the man stalking his family for some bizarre reason.The movie is a competent thriller/horror film. Sheridan is a talented director and the movie works on many levels. It is a bit slow at times and has nothing too new or original to offer but it's still a very creepy and intriguing murder mystery. I would have loved to have seen Sheridan's true vision of the film though and wonder how much better that movie could have been. I am upset that the trailer revealed the biggest plot development of the film, it doesn't entirely ruin the movie but thinking how much better it could have been not knowing the twist is coming is upsetting (and it does ruin the overall viewing experience, to a certain degree). The film was good but it had potential to be something really good if not for all it's production and marketing problems.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSwub5D8YiE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monumentally Stupid, Dumbed-Down Lame Exuse of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I am so sick of these types of "thrillers" that have replaced actual horror movies, or even scary movies. It reminds me of the equally crappy "Woman in Black", with no real scares, no originality, formulaic by-the numbers plot, cliché filled, rated PG-13 bore-fest. Also, the actual plot is created by the monumental stupidity of more than one character.Let me illustrate: EVIL money grubbing husband and father wants to kill his wife really bad, for the insurance money or whatever. Well, he is a puss so he hires a convenient bad guy gun for hire. Here is where it gets beyond stupid. The EVIL husband never bothers to show the hit-man a photo of his wife, or even describe what she looks like (blonde hair would have helped!!!). And on top of that, he doesn't even give the gunman his home address! He says something like, "oh it's the third house on the left, or maybe the fourth, I forget..." WOULDN'T THESE DETAILS BE IMPORTANT TO ANYONE WITH MORE INTELLIGENCE THAN A FLATWORM?!?The rest of this crap is just another typical boring ghost movie, with nothing scary to be found. A good antidote would be "A Ghost Story", 1980. That at least had some adult themes and was truly intelligent and scary!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream House was more of a nightmare.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was advertised as a horror movie so if you're expecting that, you will be sorely disappointed and annoyed. As was I. A couple loud bangs and one mysterious dark shadowman were super misleading, as I kept waiting for more scary stuff to happen. But it became evident pretty early on that my hopes would go unsatiated. Second major issue with this movie: the previews totally ruined what could have been ? nay, should have been ? one of the first big ah-ha moments. Instead, as the characters start in on their wide-eyed epiphanies in this supposed revealing scene, we're all sitting there like "yeah, we know. The previews already told us." Major deductions. Beyond that, the other big twist is okay. Not really expected so that's what makes a twist work. It's just so clearly NOT a horror film that it was difficult to get past that and focus on the?well, I was gonna say positive but? *shrug*. I would NOT pay to go see this movie. Especially if you're a horror fan. If you're NOT a horror fan, you may be satisfied. But it's nothing to rush out and wait in line for. Wait, who am I kidding. There won't be any lines for Dream House.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. The horror/thriller idealist in me just never gives up. With three legit movie stars and a director who is responsible for one of my favorite movies, I thought this might just be the genre's rare gem. Instead, it's watchable, kinda fun, and mostly predictable.Much of the predictability comes from the trailer, which inexplicably spoils the key twist in the film. Because of the trailer, I actually expected an additional twist to contradict the give-away. Instead, it plays out pretty much as expected, saved only by the efforts of Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz (now married in real life). Word is that the producer of the film, wrestled control away from director Jim Sheridan (In America, My Left Foot) and edited the film into it's mostly banal finished state. Such a shame.Basic story is that a NYC white collar professional quits his job and moves his wife and two girls to their dream house in a quaint little community. Problem is, no one told them that a few years back a mom and her two daughters were murdered, supposedly by the husband who then spent years in a mental institution. With the help of a neighbor (Naomi Watts), Craig starts assembling the pieces of the murder mystery and his new home. On top of that, Elias Koteas is tracking his every move and watching the house.The frustration with this one lies in untapped potential. So much more could have been done with Koteas, Watts and Marton Csokas who plays Watts' intense ex-husband. For two days after watching this movie, I kept coming up with new twists and turns that could have made the movie more suspenseful and entertaining. It's clear that Craig and Weisz are unhappy with the final product as they have been noticeably absent on the talk show circuit.It's not the worst suspense thriller you'll ever see, but there are better haunted house films on the market.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst movies I have seen this year, with plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. Wooden acting from the supporting cast, and it never really knows what genre of film it wants to be. Daniel Craig obviously wanted a quick pay cheque, take the money and run 007, and don't look back. IMDb wants me to type out 10 lines of text but it hardly seems worth it if I have to reference this movie anymore so instead I will just type random sentences until I reach the minimum limit. So, how about this September weather? What a great fall. So nice to finally have decent,warm days. I sure hope the Oilers have a good year this year. Well, I guess I have reached my minimum line amount so I will be signing off. Daniel Craig I want my money back!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was a bit disappointed with Dream House. When I saw previews for it I was really excited to see it, but you basically see the whole movie in the commercials. Although the plot left much to be desired the acting was wonderful, which is to be expected from the cast. I also enjoyed the cinematography. There were times when the house when from being broken down and turned into a real home in the next second, and they did the transitioning just beautifully. In my opinion there was too much plot trying to be forced into a short amount of time and the result was a mediocre movie with an ending that didn't really make any sense or tie in to the rest if the movie at all. I can be entertained by almost any movie and this one was no different, but it's not something I want to see again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everybody who lives in this house dies... OF BOREDOM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Synopsis: Will Atenten (Daniel Craig) has just moved into a new house after leaving the company he's worked at for five years. He wants to write a book and live at home with his beautiful wife, Libby (Rachel Weisz) and their two perfect children Trish (Taylor Geare) and cutie-pie Dee Dee (Claire Geare). To the untrained eye, this is the American dream. Libby paints and dotes lovingly upon her husband and the two girls are mostly seen and not heard. Only, something is terribly wrong here. Everyone is treating Will as though he is somehow not welcome. Perhaps he had a bad dinner party and offended all of his neighbors. If only it were that simple. The truth lies deep within the nooks and crannies of the small community in which Will once lead a happy life.What a promising story! A mysterious psychological thriller is typically a big crowd pleaser. While this movie sort of leaves the audience guessing until the end, I was not on the edge of my seat. In fact, I was sitting ? head in hand ? wishing for this movie to end. I didn't care if everyone in the film lived or died. I just wanted it to be over. How can a plot like this one fail so miserably? The words aggressively bad come to mind when I am asked what I thought of Dream House. Let's take a look at where this movie went wrong. First off, I believe that a movie can have too much story. When a filmmaker tries to cram in too much detail, the whole thing can come off the rails very easily. In the way that Nightmare on Elm Street keeps the viewer guessing as far as what's real and what is a dream, this movie had the right idea in doing the same sort of thing. The only problem is that it didn't do it right and therefore became a failure from the get-go. As a clever movie-going public, we are trained to weed out the unnecessary bits in films like this one. If I were to do that, I'd say that the movie was approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes too long.The characters were another problem. Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts) is Will's neighbor. She is the only person outside of his house who is nice to him when he returns. Her perfectly shaped eyebrows spend most of the film furrowed and she often looks worried, but it doesn't come across as sincere to me. None of the characters in this movie do. Everyone seems confused more than anything. And even though we know that Ann is the key to uncovering Will's troubled past, it is still all so hard to swallow.Possibly the biggest problem for me was the soundtrack. If you've read my blog before, you know that I am a soundtrack enthusiast. I love a good score and when the music in a movie matches up in that perfect harmony with what is happening on-screen it is some sort of magic. The music for Dream House is offensive. The idea of the soundtrack is to capture the moment. Hearing that music later takes you back to the emotion you felt. It sounds cheesy, but it's so true. I don't know how they screwed that part up so badly, but they did it. Boy oh boy, did they do it.Save your money, readers. It won't be long before Dream House hits NetFlix instant or drops into a $5 discount bin at a Wal-Mart near you. One night when you've had too much to drink and there is absolutely, positively nothing else on, you can fall asleep to this wretched mistake and know that you didn't miss a thing.****See more of my reviews at www.mssilverscreen.com****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good cast lifts this to above just a so-so thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dream House is a film that, luckily, has a decent cast. Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts and Rachel Weiss bring an A-list element to a story that probably would have been pretty forgettable.It's about a family who move into a nice house, only to discover a brutal murder was committed there five years ago.I won't say any more because there are a few surprises in the story that I don't want to spoil.I've read a few other reviews and a fair few people don't seem to understand what's happened. I didn't have that problem and, as long as you keep an open mind and pay attention to the numerous hints early on of what's to come, you should be able to figure it all out.It's a pretty good little film, although it didn't make much of an impact at the box office, largely because the three stars refused to promote it after the trailer was released - apparently they felt like it was giving away too much of the story.So, I guess if you want the full impact of the film, don't watch the trailer! Dream House is no masterpiece, but it's not as bad as it could have been, plus there are a fair few original moments to keep you amused. However, if you're very easily confused, then you may want to skip this one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated film and i was impressed by it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this was a good film and i don't understand the hate it has gotten,but i guess everyone is entitled to their own opinion,and in my opinion this is a great film,i thought it was a very heartwarming film and i found myself caring about all of the characters. i thought Daniel Craig's performance was great! and i liked Rachel Weisz in this film i thought her performance was also very good,Daniel and Rachel are both very good actors and i thought they wen't great together as husband and wife in this film,And i'm probably the only one who feels that way,i'm sure everyone else thought differently!. If i'm wrong then i'm wrong but i just feel that this film is underrated because it does not get enough respect and i think it deserves it! because everyone in this film was great!.I didn't notice a single bad performance from anyone,i thought they all played their rolls well and i thought every one of them could act and i was especially impressed by the performances of the two little girls in the film who played the role of Daniels daughters.that's why this film deserves an eight,because even the little kids did good!. The only problem i had was with Naomi watts,i just felt she could have been given more to do because she didn't do much and we don't see her much in the film.but that didn't bother me that much because i was too busy enjoying this excellent film. i thought the film was very suspenseful and interesting. The film may have been a little slow at the start but that didn't bother me much either because it made the film more mysterious,and it kept me guessing as to what was to come so strangely the slowness was actually a good thing!. i quite liked the story i thought it was kind of sweet and the more the film went on the more the suspense built up and i thought that was good. i thought the film was also very well directed and the director did a very good job!. This film was strange and mysterious but in a good way and i thought the scenes with Daniel Craig and his family were very touching and the mystery of the film was very captivating to me,and all through the film i wondered what was going on and what was up with all of Daniels strange neighbours and why they kept giving him weird stares through the film,and the twist that came in the film was quite good! and i never saw it coming so that made it even more impressive!. i thought the ending of the film was very exciting and explosive! and Daniel Craig really shone at the end of this film!,so people should stop complaining about this film!,it was good! and Daniel was great! and if people can't see that then they must be blind!.All in all i thought this film was very touching,very exciting,and very suspenseful and i loved the music they played in the film,it matched the film perfectly!. This film is very underrated! and it kicks Ass!. This film deserves a solid 8/10 for the twists and turns the story took and for the good performances from everyone as well as the explosive ending!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, smart, decent thriller, good cast,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this movie a 7. The premise was pretty good, the cast was good, and the twists were pretty smart and executed fairly well. I do however think it was a little slow, and there were a few tiny technical details they should have not played with that were just annoying.The biggest thing that killed me is accents. Yes, accents. First, if you want to make a film that is firmly rooted in the U.S., why does someone go out of their way to hire foreign actors. OK, Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig are probably a package deal since they are married, then they throw in an Aussie with Naomi Watts ( who, by the way was probably the only one that pulled it off). Daniel Craig's character, whether by plot design, or just plain bad fluctuates between his regular British accent, a plain American accent, and a tiny bit of an American southern twang accent. If this isn't bad ( or at least confusing) enough, you have the beautiful European ( Hungarian/Austrian) woman that grew up in England, Rachel Weisz, speaking in a southern accent. Please, just let Rachel Weisz use her own accent, it is sexy, and it would not have made a difference at all, but alas, it was the little thing that annoyed me the most.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unusual Film... Better than what most reviewers are saying... Blu-ray: Very Good A:9 V:9</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, do NOT watch ANY trailers for this movie or it WILL ruin it! 2nd, I STRONGLY disagree with others who have quite inaccurately said that the movie is 1) Predictable, which is surely NOT the case if you have not read or do not know anything about it beforehand - the initial 'Twist' caught me off guard like a punch in the stomach; I thought that it was very well done. ...and 2) that this film was like a lot of others that we have seen before, which is absolutely not true. Taken superficially, IF the film were to end with what happens with the first twist (which would still be a HELL of a twist) THEN, perhaps you might say that, okay, this films ends like a lot of others, but that is NOT the case.What I found intriguing about this movie is that the powerful 'Twist' hits about 45 minutes in, so I'm thinking not only 'WHAT THE HELL?!!!' but also, 'Well, what the HELL are they gonna do with the story now...???' But, that is the key; it is what happens after this and the 'Real' story, if you will, that makes the story structure of this one rather unique.I noticed the 'Trivia' section mentions that both Christian Bale and Brad Pitt were considered for the main role. Other than the BOND films, I am not really a big fan of Daniel Craig, however, I do not think either of them would have been right for this role. I felt that Daniel Craig projected the PERFECT psyche for what this character is all about. I cannot see the other 2 AT ALL in this role in any way, shape, or form.Don't get me wrong, this is no masterpiece, but the extremely grave error of showing the main twist in the trailers not withstanding, I felt that the overall idea of the FULL story and what really happened was quite novel...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I expected a horror film but was surprised by this thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really got a kick out of this one. Thought it had potential as a big scare horror film. The beginning definitely gives that feel. I appreciated Daniel Craigs performance it was very convincing. The movie kept me guessing from beginning to end. Naomi Watts was effective but I felt somewhat underused. Definitely lets the anxiety build up as you watch. Keeps you guessing throughout and I don't want to give anything away. Good suspense and a good story I felt entertained and was able to derive good conversation with others that have seen it. I kind of felt like I missed out on a horror film but the film had suspense and was intense moves quickly with very few lulls a good watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream House Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dream House (Jim Sheridan, 2011) follows a father who quits his job in order to spend more time with his family and work on a novel at home. This movie begins like any other horror film, where the protagonist, and in this case his family, live in a world of tranquillity. This equilibrium is however swiftly broken when one of the daughters sees a figure watching them outside the window.A "spoiler" is already leaked in the trailer where we find out that at some point in the film, presumably the end, the protagonist will find out he is the man responsible for murdering the family in the house he has been living in. The problem I had with this twist was not that the trailer already showed it to me, but that it doesn't occur at the end of the film and instead actually appears about halfway through. Leaving me to wonder how an earth the film can possibly progress any further.In all my other reviews I concentrate heavily on actors' performances, but in this film there is not a single actor that stands out as fantastic or appalling. All I can really state about the actors is that Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz portray loving parents with ease and the two daughters seem sufficiently talented. They all provided realistic enough characters for me to feel empathy towards them and their plight throughout the movie.The one film that I kept comparing the plot of Dream House to was Shutter Island (Martin Scorsese, 2010). In Shutter Island we see Leonardo DiCaprio seemingly as a detective investigating a missing inmate, but as the film progresses we find out he himself is an inmate creating a fantasy persona to escape the truth. It is a very similar truth to that in Dream House where Daniel Craig lives in a house where doctors say he murdered his family, which was discussed in the trailer. Both are still noticeable psychological thrillers, although Dream House does contain more elements to that of a horror film than Shutter Island.Another noticeable aspect of this movie was its lack of locations. Most films, even horrors, contain multiple interior and exterior locations and so it was a surprise to find this film only used the "dream house", the neighbours home and the psychiatric hospital. This lack of locations restricts the characters, as the film progresses, from having any safe haven, which in-turn increases our sense of horror.Dream House was a mediocre film. It was a very restricting psychological horror thriller where the plot stretched on for too long due to an early twist. Daniel Craig, who I praised in my The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn review didn't stand out so much in this films, although my hopes are still high for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo which I hope to see (and review) soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Either the studio got in the way or the screenwriter must be really lucky to have all this talent working on a mediocre script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Dream House" is marketed as a horror/thriller film. There are two things wrong with this. Firstly, it is not a horror film, it is a psychological mystery drama/thriller. Some people will no doubt get turned off by this. Another thing is, a vital plot point was given away in the trailer. This is unacceptable as it ruins the film for the unsuspecting audience.There's something that doesn't feel right about the film. Maybe its because the screenplay is a pastiche of psycho thriller clichés and doesn't go further than that. Maybe director Jim Sheridan lost himself after directing a string of great dramas that he decided to take a break by lazily making this apparently by-the-numbers thriller, or maybe producer James G. Robinson somehow tinkered with the final cut of the film - against Sheridan's wishes. Indeed, because the plot starts off interestingly and subtly, before careening off the cliff of logic and common sense. Maybe it's because that vital plot point that I mentioned earlier was placed in the middle of the film instead of the end, thus losing much of its intended power.As much as I would like to complain about the film, it has its ups. Daniel Craig is great and really convincing in his role while Rachel Weisz also gives out a good, solid supporting performance. Naomi Watts had quite little screen time but she was okay. The rest of the supporting cast are okay but by-the-numbers. The production value is good and the cinematography by the great Caleb Deschanel is, as usual, very good. I liked some touches of the film, like when Craig communicates with his hallucination of his dead wife Weisz even after both of them know that she is a hallucination, you don't see that every day.Overall, the film felt uneven and incomplete. I suspect executive tinkering, and hope that an extended edition or Sheridan's director's cut of the film will be released so that perhaps a better, longer and more fleshed out version of the movie. As it stands now, its an average Hollywood thriller with great performances out of three A-list actors and competent direction by an A-list director working their way around a ludicrous script. Quite disappointed, but at least it was interesting to watch.Like I said, either the studio got in the way, or the screenwriter must be really lucky to have a cast and crew this talented working on his mediocre script.Overall rating: 58/100</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ho-Hum and Humdrum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More psychological thriller than horror, Dream House goes EXACTLY where one would expect it to go and that keeps the film from earning any kind of praise whatsoever. More-and-more we hear about a film's trailer giving away too much of a plot and NEVER has it been more TRUE than with Dream House.The only surprising thing here is the decent cast the film put together for such an unremarkable story. Daniel Craig (Casino Royale, The Golden Compass) and Rachel Weisz (The Constant Gardener, About a Boy) move to a small New England town with their young girls only to discover that their "dream home" was actually the murder scene of the house's previous inhabitants. As Craig grows ever-more-curious about the case, he finds a neighbor who has quite a bit of knowledge on the subject -- played by Naomi Watts (Mulholland Drive, King Kong). And ... the story "develops" from there.Dream House is rather humdrum and ho-hum and I am not going to waste any more time writing about it. There really isn't any reason to recommend this one as all three stars have been better and there are better films out there that tread in similar subject matter (you can also click to watch the trailer here on IMDb ... and you'll save yourself an hour-and-a-half of your life!).The entire film was a let-down to me; but that this came from master, Irish filmmaker Jim Sheridan (In the Name of the Father, My Left Foot, The Boxer, In America) REALLY saddens me ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a sweet, psychotic trip about a dad who was framed and who lives a schizophrenic second reality every time he's in his house, where there was a tragic accident, for which he was framed.

This films draws a perfect picture that is heartbreaking and shows the extent of love, justice, and a broken, but beautiful love story.I loved this movie so much. It was so sweet and exquisite, like gourmet food, in the beginning and then the story folds out as you normally think it would, being a thriller; but there's an unexpected twist that is so freaking brilliant and the every event that follows will make you roll out one tear at a time. It's definitely worth a watch and I've already made plans to re-watch. With a bit of romance, mystery, and definitely suspense, this is one of the best films I've seen in the past twenty years. The casting could not be any better and with a plot that is just as freaking amazing, you have this amazing underrated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Psychological Thriller Who-Dun-It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me first say that I was really impressed with this movie. This was a psychological thriller who-dun-it. It was so seamlessly done that some earlier parts had me bothered but then became crystal clear towards the end of the movie.Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) just quit his job to write a book and spend time with his beautiful family. He has the most perfect life. A lovely wife, two adorable daughters and a house in suburbia. He's happy and they're happy until it's all interrupted by a stalker.As we follow Will around we find out more about the house he lives in, his family and the family that once lived in that house. Needless to say there are secrets in the cozy town of Ashford and Will is in the dark."Dream House" uses some established and tried plots and reshapes them dreamily. Let me say this: you know there is merit to a movie when you find yourself frustrated because you're not getting the answers fast enough. If it were a lousier movie I wouldn't care one way or the other. The writing and Daniel Craig's performance just draws you in. I was enthralled, I was engaged, I was enraptured which is to say: I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was one of the best movies I have seen in a while. Wasn't scary, but it was quite suspenseful. It kept my interest, wasn't slow or boring at all. The plot twists were great, and it was hard to predict what was going to happen next. After I read about what the movie was about in the description, I really had no idea that it was going to turn out like it did. It definitely takes you by surprise. But it was a pleasant surprise, because the movie turned out better then I thought it was actually going to be. I even cried at the end of the movie. There was no flat acting detected, and the way the movie was filmed was done well. I think this movie is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow! What an Amazing Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movies years after its release not knowing what to expect. I expected to see a horror movie, but was still engaged with the movie when I realized that it was a psychological thriller. Daniel Craig was amazing in this movie as Will Atenton as was Rachel Weisz who played his wife Libby Atenton. Craig and Weisz have amazing chemistry together playing husband and wife. The movie starts with Daniel Craig leaving his job to move to a small town in his dream home with his wife and two pretty daughters Trish and Dee Dee, age seven and five, respectively. Shortly, after moving in, Atenton noticed strange things happening in his home. Mysterious people are constantly watching him and his family. The police treat him as if he is a mad man and no one will tell him what is going on like the whole town is against him. Even his wife eventually wonders why the police refuse to do anything when someone in a car tries to run him over in front of their home. Naomi Watts was excellent in her small part as the next door neighbor Ann Patterson, who is separated from his husband Jack Patterson played by Marton Csokas. Jack obviously doesn't like his estranged wife and is trying to win sole custody of their teenager daughter. The movie has three acts. The first half is the introduction of the cute family of four. The second act is the twist when Will learns about Peter Ward, the previous owner of the home who was accused of murdering his wife and children. The final act is another twist when Will begins to learn the truth about Peter Ward, and the movie dwelves between the worlds of fantasy and reality and takes a little supernatural twist. Dream House was a great movie that I recommend if you like thrillers. I will definitely watch this movie again because it was so enjoyable and to catch the little pieces that I missed that led to the conclusion. Some of the supernatural scenes in the trailer are a flashback Will has while taking a bath. So for those of you who wanted a haunted house movie and horror and guts and gore, you're going to be disappointed. But any of you who enjoy a good psychological thriller with good actors,a good storyline,and cool twists and turns that will creep the heck out of you than you will enjoy the movie. Excellent movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few faults, but watchable enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No way near as bad as some people would gave you think. The three leads are all very watchable, it's shot lovingly, and there is some interesting ideas ( even if they don't all work out, and it loses its way at the end). Most of the films problems came from studio interference, so much so the director tried to disown the film, and Craig and Weisz refused to promote it. The one or two disjointed scenes, and the very melodramatic ending, all point towards the studios heavy handedness. That being said, there's enough of the original directors vision here to enjoy, and Craig does pretty well in most scenes he's in. Not great by any means, but very watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Dream House" marks a crossing of paths. Director Jim Sheridan has long been known for serious movies: "My Left Foot" and "In the Name of the Father" are probably his best known works. So now he directs a psychological thriller. Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz play a couple who move into a house only to discover that there's more to its history than they realize. The twist comes a little too early, but I found it to be a solid movie over all. I'm torn between thinking that the ending was too flat or more creative than I expected it to be.Anyway, it's an OK movie. I would actually prefer to see Craig in movies like this instead of the stale James Bond franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well worth the time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dream House is, in my opinion, underrated by other IMDb voters. It is not a ghost story and it is not a horror movie although I suspect that some reviewers have rated it as such to its detriment It is a very professionally directed and acted thriller with a difference. I don't intend to include any spoilers in this review because they would certainly be just that - real spoilers to the point where it wouldn't be worth watching if you know what's going to happen. So, for viewers who have some weird compulsion to read plots before watching movies, don't waste your time on this one. The whole purpose of Dream House is to keep the viewer guessing and it does that very well.I loved the Geare sisters as Will (Daniel Craig) and Libby's (Rachel Weitz) daughters and wonder how they were equipped to deal with some quite scary scenes for kids their ages. it was, as others have written, a bit difficult seeing Daniel Craig in such a different role as 007 where he didn't skillfully strike back when faced with adversity. But then I guess that's what happens when an actor becomes best-known as a particular character.Without giving too much away (I hope), the only thing about the whole movie that mildly puzzled me was the guy in the hoodie. Why was he needed? Watch Dream House and enjoy something different and then, if you want to write a review, perhaps you can figure out why the guy in the hoodie and tell me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good twisty, thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bit of a late review; oh well. As with some other thriller-y type movies I've really dug, this one provides that cool little 'twist' about 2/3 of the way through, which sort of ties up all the strange, confusing and seemingly-inept bits of storytelling and brings everything into focus. Perhaps I was too tired - or just inherently slow - but I didn't see all those twists and turns coming.The only gripe I've got is having to endure yet another sloppy, quickly-slapped-together ending, which always both bugs and insults me; it's almost if the filmmakers thought, 'ok, we've got the punchline out there, let's just get this baby wrapped up and into the theatres.' So essentially the last 10-15 minutes or so turned me off of giving this movie a big fat 9.Regardless, well worth a watch :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although I greatly enjoyed the story and the psychological roller-coaster of the main character, I was very disappointed and annoyed that I figured out "who done it" and what was going on very early on in the story. Actually, I knew almost the entire plot within the first 15 minutes. I am not usually one who is able to figure out what is going to happen, my husband is ridiculously good at that, so the plot and story direction must be painfully obvious to others. For the simplistic predictability of the plot, I deducted 2 points from the final score.Daniel Craig gives a convincing performance and the chemistry between him and Rachel Weisz is palpable and very believable. Without that chemistry, the story would not have worked.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it is that bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(12%) An oddly well cast, yet plodding, run-of-the-mill, and not at all scary horror that boggles the mind in how its script ever got picked up then managed to attract not one but three big name Hollywood stars. As this drags its clumsy feet from scene to scene you begin to wonder whether this has a ace card up its sleeve, sadly it doesn't, in fact the only interesting plot element doesn't really make a whole lot of good sense. Daniel Craig to be fair is trying to drag something out of this turkey, but it's not enough to make this anything other than a disappointingly below average, dull offering; and to claim that the trailer ruined the ending is giving the plot more respect than it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deceptive: Not the Horror Movie I Was Expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting a long time for a good horror film. So far, I was not satisfied with any of the horror films released this year, like "Insidious" or "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark." Then quietly, ads for this film starring an A-list cast composed of Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts comes along and my hopes were lifted. The intriguing poster of Craig about to open a door with his family's faces reflected on the knob added to the appeal. TI decided that this is a movie I should watch on the big screen."Dream House" is the story of Will Arterton, who gives up a successful job in the big city, to move out and live in his suburban "dream house" with his beautiful wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and two adorable little duaghters. Later on, Will discovers the terrible history of his new house, about a family who were murdered several years before. I will stop the story description right there. Critical revelations will be made midway through the film that will would be better appreciated while actually watching it.It is refreshing to see Daniel Craig in a vulnerable role after knowing him more as James Bond. I have to admit that he and Rachel Weisz look good together as husband and wife. I guessed that this was the film that drew them together in real life. They also had good chemistry with the girls who played their daughters. The both of them do very well as tormented parents, particularly Craig. The rest of the cast, including Naomi Watts and Elias Koteas had rather thankless and purposely confusing roles.I was surprised to see Jim Sheridan (who directed Irish-themed movies like "My Left Foot" and "In The Name of the Father" back in the day) at the helm of this film. The ads for the film, then treatment and execution of the first half, were deceptive. Comparisons with "The Sixth Sense" or "Shutter Island" are inevitable, but "Dream House" pales beside those two screen classics. "Dream House" was a watchable movie, but again, I was disappointed that this did not really turn out to be the horror film I was expecting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The poster catch phrase says it all: "Once upon a time there were two little girls that live in a house"SPOILERS!!!!!Other than the fact that they were dead (along with their mother) the children had very little to do with the story/plot other than to look cute. They were killed, they may have been ghosts, or hallucinations, but the plot didn't concern them at all. I really love the evil kid, child ghost genre, and the trailer and the poster seems to say that the children were the focus of the plot...NOT!!Even the two little girl ghosts in the Shining left more of an impression on me after 30 plus years...and those ghost girls were only on the screen for a minute or two at most!The film, as some have said, had potential, but this is one of those movies that should have been a Lifetime Channel program that you could after about 40 minutes, switch to a rerun episode of Seinfeld!!!I gave 5 stars because I did see it all the way through to the end...BIG MISTAKE!I watched the CAM torrent and I still want my money back!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad in the way most say, just terribly boring and lacking any scares.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read a lot of reviews for Dream House and there's a lot of talk about the film originally being a lot different that the finished product, I would love to know what the differences would have been because wowee this was a letdown and just a plain old bore fest. The marketing, trailer etc all make this film seem like a smart horror film that is obviously aimed at adults, however after sitting down to watch it you quickly realize that it not the case. This film has a rather good plot and the performances are great, it's just lacking any scares or great scenes that make you really enjoy it.I agree with a lot of other reviewers when they say that it borrows a lot from other films, I found a lot of similarities to The Sixth Sense and Amityville Horror amongst others. Another big problem with it is the pacing, it's too slow, than fast, than slow again and it all ends with a really uneventful conclusion, and the twist is given away a tad too early. Daniel Craig is OK I suppose, he doesn't do very well on the accent scale though, is he American or English? Rachel Weisz is spectacular as usual, but she is wasted, she is far to superior of an actress to be doing roles like this, same goes for Naomi Watts, she is good with the small amount she is in the film but all the way I was just saying "more Naomi less Daniel, more Naomi less Daniel", I'm guessing they both thought the film was an easy quick film, but they are both stellar actresses so this won't harm their career at all.Fans of the horror genre, steer clear, no horror here, just cheap and boring drama about a boring character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very watchable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I picked up this movie on a whim and, before I watched it, I went on the Internet to check reviews. They were not promising. Rotten Tomatoes 'tomatometer' was 6% - and I usually agree with their reviews. IMDb currently gives it 5.9. Not good but I've viewed a number of movies with this kind of rating. For me, some deserved it, most deserved a lower rating and a pleasant few deserved a much higher rating.This movie tends toward the last category. It's not a great movie, but it deserves a higher rating than 5.9 - and my rating system is fairly critical. Nowadays I find most movies disappointing, derivative, pointless and, too often, just plain silly. For me, a movie would have to be pretty fantastic to get a 9. Four or five movies I have seen in my 64 years would rate a 10. Perhaps as many as 20 might deserve a 9. I would say Dream House deserves a 6.5 or 7.Rotten Tomatoes says "Dream House is punishingly slow, stuffy, and way too obvious to be scary." I don't agree. For me, the plot was not obvious early on. I was reasonably surprised by both major plot twists. The acting of the main characters was capable and convincing. Most of the apparent inconsistencies were resolved when the true story became clear. The script was pretty good. The filming and music were competent.All round, Dream House is a very watchable movie. And that's high praise from someone who thinks most movies he watches are pretty much a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Daniel Craig met Rachel Weisz</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was certainly interested in seeing "Dream House," since I just got back from seeing this couple in "Betrayal." Let me tell you, from a strictly visual point of view, both of them are gorgeous, not to mention both wonderful actors on stage and on screen.I gather from reading a few reviews that this film suffers from the director having the final cut taken from him, a bad trailer, and being incorrectly advertised.I had never heard of it until I rented it. It's a thriller about a man named Will Attenton (Craig) who quits his job in order to spend time with his wife (Weisz) and two daughters. They have bought a place away from the city, but they didn't know that three of the previous four inhabitants of the house had been murdered by the husband and father. After some strange happenings, Will tries to find out what happened, which includes going to the institution where the father, Peter Ward, was sent after the murders. He was incapable of standing trial. What Will finds out is a huge shock.I actually liked this film, and I would have liked to have seen the director's cut, since apparently the actors were all up in arms about Jim Sheridan not being permitted to do what he wanted with the final product.I think for that reason, it's a tad confusing, nothing that a second viewing wouldn't solve. It's not as bad as it's been reviewed to be, and I think one poster was right - people were expecting a horror film and were disappointed. Well, I will never be disappointed about not seeing a horror film. And I'm a sucker for Daniel Craig.</fullReview>

He knows his neighbor Ann across the street who is divorced and her ex-husband passes on to take over their daughter. Using the help of Ann, Will soon finds out that in his house a long time ago occurred some horrible crimes and the author has not been caught since not sufficient evidences were found. Residents are convinced that the culprit is Peter Ward who had shot his two daughters and his wife and who was hospitalized in a mental institution. After he is willing to know the truth Will discover a terrifying past and chances that the assassin to be discovered grows along with a plan that he had, but never came out at that time.Dream House is a strange movie park out of the Twilight Zone series but with the help of some valuable actors who are able to pull the viewer in doubt, I can say that it came out a psychological thriller that gives you thought.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a fine story hiding behind this often bewildering thriller about Daniel Craig, his wife Rachel Weisz, and their two little girls moving to the snowy suburbs to live in a house in which some tragic murders have taken place.I won't run through the plot. It has some elements of interest and could have been an admirable descent into the supernatural/psychiatric. But it looks as if the writers haven't thought the story through or, having thought it through, recklessly decided to disregard everything that wouldn't lead to an immediate shock. Examples? Someone rushes in from off screen and jumps someone from behind, but it's a friend -- twice. A cheap cliché. A car pulls to a stop in the driveway and there is a big WHAM on the sound track, as if the vehicle had run into a bass drum. A red Buick tries repeatedly to run over Craig on the street in front of his house. Who's driving it and why is he trying to turn Craig into road kill? Who knows? Who cares? Certainly not the writers.The acting can't be faulted. Daniel Craig is quite good. Watch him handle the news when he's told about the murders that took place in his new dream house, across the desk from the psychiatrist. The two women -- Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts -- are decent performers, though Watts has generally minimalized her acting, as she does here. She doesn't have much to do. Both of the ladies -- Betty and Veronica -- are babalicious but that's beside the point. The point is: What are these actors doing in such a sloppy horror flick?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very unusual ghost story, not horror in the slightest, but still very engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dream House is very interesting film experience and your enjoyment (or dislike) of it may be more effected by your expectations than in most other films of this type. It's not horror, let's get that out the way right now. There's clearly no intent by the director to scare the audience here. It's not really a psychological thriller or a drama either, though it has heavy components of both. It IS a ghost story, but it's one that bridges a variety of tones and styles in unusual ways and that's why I liked it. I'm a fan of ghost movies, they're easily my favorite subgenre of horror and I lap them up like an addict, from the best to the most trite and obscure. The problem with many such stories is that they're so damn predictable. Dream House is predictable too, but in an entirely different way. I spent the first 45 minutes thinking I was watching an standard cliché ghost movie and my wife and I both verbally predicted the ending to each other. But at the mid point the (too obvious) reveal that we thought would wait until the end occurred - with an hour of movie still left - and the remainder of the movie went in a very different direction than we expected. It was a jarring but clever diversion that reminded me of how I felt when Janet Leigh's character got killed off in Hitchcock's "Psycho" forcing the story off in a different direction. I really enjoyed this, it was refreshing in a subgenre that's filled to overflowing with almost identical plot arcs.The acting from Craig and Weisz is exceptional and they're a joy to watch even at the points where you know where the story is going. Their real life relationship shines through and adds a depth and realism to the married couple. The child actors are not in any way annoying and although the case and trailers make the film seem like it is centered around the children, it really isn't. The real downfall of the film to me was the choice of music, it was far too sentimental and in-your-face and it turned what could have been a much darker, lingering tale into a sort of high-quality Lifetime movie. It was so bad, in fact, that I think if this movie had been released without a music soundtrack, people might have taken to it more warmly and its score here on IMDb might have been higher.I would conclude this: it's not a great movie, but it is a very good one. Check your expectations in at the door and take what it gives openly. Don't expect a horror, or gore, or big scares; don't expect a taught thriller; do expect a little sadness and sentimentality. It's well worth watching, especially for ghost movie fans who feel like they're bored with the stagnant tone and style of current offerings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good idea, good cast but movie has its problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Will Atenton is an editor who resigns for his job to dedicate himself to writing a book. He also just moved in with his wife and two daughters to his dream house in the country.The dream house is nothing special really, but it becomes creepier and creepier as Will discovers that some murders took place there. The previous owner killed his entire family. He also finds goth kids doing ceremonies in the basement and there are all sorts of secret rooms. The wife is starting to freak out. A strange neighbor is sort of nice to Will but also avoids talking to him. Law enforcement isn't helpful either.Then there's a twist in the middle of the movie that changes things quite a bit and we learn more about the murders that took place and about the identity of Will.Dream House has a good cast and overall a good idea. But in my view, the twist came a bit too soon. Or there wasn't enough build up to it. Despite the strange things that happen, I didn't expect it at all. But from there things become more generic. The whole issue of the murders is explained in a way that also doesn't have a whole lot of meaning. There are only a few characters here and they aren't fully developed to make things dramatic enough. Too much time is spent with Will's family and the girls. Oddly enough, Craig's performance is much more interesting in the second half.Sounds like there were some problems during production and unfortunately, it is always the case that the movie suffers as a result. Producers really need to plan and think things through. If they don't like the director's vision they need to make changes from the start. Despite the issues, Dream House is enjoyable but you can tell it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first and last third of the movie were at least okay, but the medium one (when events from the past and Will's state of health were disclosed) became annoying quite soon. However, the outcome was better than expected, because a real evil in person was involved, not a ghost or someone's spirit (if I am not mistaken, the movie was advertised improperly, in the respect of a horror movie).In actual fact, it is a psychological crime thriller where a protagonist's mental condition has its role in solving an old fatal mystery.Although the leading parts are performed by celebrities and multiple award winners and nominees Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, Naomi Watts, Marton Csokas, and the name of the director (Jim Sheridan) is not unknown as well, it has too many too much exploited ideas and scenes. On the other hand, it is no flop either, followers of "spiritual thrillers" would not be unhappy or angry when the credits appear. And the movie is less than 1,5 hours long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jim Sheridan and Mediocre??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first question that comes to mind is how can a Jim Sheridan film that involves Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts be so mediocre? After all, Sheridan's the guy who gave us gems like 'In America', 'In The Name of the Father', 'The Boxer' and 'My Left Foot' (just to name a few). I had heard that there were some conflicts between the director and the producers. However, I don't know how much of it has affected the film for 'Dream House' is just as forgettable as any of those hundreds of other thrillers Hollywood churns out. At best it's average except for some of the performances. Daniel Craig does a decent job and Rachel Weisz is terrific. Naomi Watts is wasted. What a letdown but I hope Sheridan goes back to telling those precious stories he's done previously and not head down this path that 'Dream House' may lead him to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically this is a movie with some good- and some bad points to it but overall it still remains a watchable enough movie, that is not as bad as some people try make you believe it is.It's definitely true that this feels and looks like a very typical genre movie. It starts off like a typical haunted house flick, like we have seen oh so many of already. It's clichéd and formulaic but the movie still manages to throw in a couple of twists to keep things interesting and going.Not that all twists are great but some of them still work out well for the movie. It's best to simply watch this movie without reading or seeing anything about it. Let the story surprise you, even though changes are you will probably not going to like everything that the story will be offering you.I feel that the movie would had been better off if it simply went for one clear approach. It now instead is a bit of everything; a haunted house movie, a mystery, a thriller. The movie keeps switching styles a bit too often.Problem with the movie is that it's also being a bit of a slow and boring one at first. Luckily the movie starts to pick up some pace later on but this of course doesn't make the first half of the movie any better to watch.Of course the movie gets also uplifted by its cast. It was great watching Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz but Naomi Watts is a bit wasted. Her role is too small to really make an impact, even while her character still seemed to be an important one for its story.Not great and really nothing too special but also nothing horrible either!6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and Naomi Watts star in Dream House, another one of the year's worst reviewed films. Maybe a lot of critics missed out on it, that's why it did so bad, but really I didn't think it was as bad as I read. But it needs work.Craig plays a writer who has just moved into a new house with his wife(played by Craig's actual wife, Weisz) and kids, and across the street from a mysterious woman (Watts). But what they don't know, but Watts does, is that a family was murdered in the house.Apparently when the production ended, nobody was pleased with the outcome. And after seeing it, I finally see why. Dream House isn't exactly a bad movie. It's fun, thrilling, and has a good twist. But there has to have been a huge problem in the editing process. Because Dream House is a mess in that sense. A lot of the story doesn't quite add up.Director Jim Sheridan, who has directed such great works as My Left Foot, In the Name of the Father, and Brothers, could have had a really good movie. But what they needed was more plot attention. Do they really expect us to believe it the way it turned out? Overall, good twist, okay movie.B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warning: This is not a horror movie. If you were expecting one you might as well pass this one up. It's more a drama/suspense than anything else.The plot of the film sounds like a horror movie and the trailers lead you to believe it is too. And might I add that the trailers are better than the actual film, even though they give away entirely too much of the plot but that's just my opinion.Nevertheless the film centers around Will, played by Daniel Craig. We believe him to be a publishing exec who quits his job in order to spend more time with his family and finally write the novel he's always dreamed of completing. Both of these reasons are ironic, and you'll know why after seeing the film. He, his wife, and their adorable young daughters have recently moved into a home that was the scene of a brutal murder of a woman and two children. You get the picture. I won't venture to say more. If you want to know more go watch the trailers, they give up some rather juicy twists, which is a shame because the twists are really the only high point of the film. And once they're revealed the movie really kind of loses it's momentum. There's a final reveal towards the end but by that time I had already lost interest.It's OK for a one-time watch, but not something I'd like to see again. The story is unique, but the execution needed some work. All in all, not bad though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So Bad It's good rating: 5/5 Most movies that are "so bad they're good again" descend into unintentional hilarity because of bad acting, poor special effects and lousy dialog. "Dream House" is a whole new kind of "So Bad It's Good Movie", one that isn't really funny as much as it is so insane that it demands to be seen. There are some unbelievable plot twists present so I'm going to try and keep the spoilers at a minimum. I sat down and watched the movie with two other people and all three of us made predictions just before the first big reveal towards the end of the story. All three of our predictions were completely different and seemingly contradictory, but they all ended up being true. Another special note for anyone that might be interested in this film: do not even look at the Wikipedia page or at the trailers because the film is so inept and simultaneously good at keeping its plot twists hidden that people have just assumed you're supposed to know them and have included major spoilers in the first sentence.It's about a man named Will Atenton (Daniel Craig). He and his family move into this lovely new house. Libby (Rachel Weisz) and the two girls have a bit of trouble adjusting though because there are some weird things going on. There are people spraying graffiti all over the house for unknown reasons, there's a guy looking into their windows in a most creepy fashion and no one will give them any answers as to what exactly is going on except for the fact that some time ago, there were a series of murders inside the house! With that setup, this movie shouldn't be too far from ghosts, murders, hallucinations, psychiatric wards, split personalities and all sorts of crazy developments. The scariest thing of all though, is that this is not a horror movie, it's a drama! You can't intentionally make a movie this nutty. As I mentioned earlier, there are several really big plot twists throughout the film, one of which comes in about forty five minutes in. When you are served this revelation, you think to yourself that it's really weird. Normally that kind of reveal would come right at the end of a movie and we'd have maybe a big special-effects sequence or a complete mental breakdown sort of dramatic climax. Well, we kind of get that... and then the movie keeps on going. Our protagonist Will confirms himself as a person who gets more and more mentally unstable as he decides to accept this revelation and just go on with his day as if nothing happened."Dreamhouse" is simultaneously predictable and so original you can't really see it coming. The main reason is that when it begins, the movie really, really resembles Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining". I don't usually like to compare one movie to another, mostly because everything borrows from something else and that if you haven't seen one of the movies, the comparison would be lost upon you, but hear me out on this one. So we have a family, moving into a new house in the wintertime so the father can work on a novel. There are creepy, unexplainable things that happen in the house. There is a scene where some writing on the wall is seen in a mirror and reveals a terrifying message, there is a vibe that the father is going crazy, maybe even murderous. We even get a scene of two little girls standing in a hallway in a spooky manner! All of that is in the first half of the movie though, the second half is some kind of weird drama with one of the most obvious and incompetent villains ever. It's a mesh of bad writing, over-the-top character design and "so obvious you couldn't see it coming" plot twists In a way it's kind of beautiful. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a horror movie, a thriller or a weird genre drama but one thing is for sure, it's utterly inept. The acting is pretty good and like I said, there's no way you can see it all coming but unless you want to watch the cinematic equivalent of a squirrel that runs across the street, dodges a car only to get eaten by a dog, then spit out as the dog get bitten by a tiger and then vaporized by a meteor don't even come close to this one.For you fellow bad movie fans, my advice is to run out and rent this one without looking at any trailers and without do any additional research on it. Grab your friends and hand out some pens and papers. Tell everyone to guess what the ending will be and at the end of the film, have everyone read what they predicted. One thing's for sure, it will be a memorable experience and one that might even be enlightening depending on what people ultimately think. "Dreamhouse" is pretty awful but it's also fascinating.

		<shortDescription>A bit of a mess with wasted talent but I didn't hate it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well yes, this was a bit of a mess, I didn't hate it though and parts of it were actually good but it just kept losing itself. I also went in expecting a horror movie based on the scary poster attached but its more of a mystery/thriller. Daniel Craig does (take his shirt off several times) ehem... does a decent enough job (considering) as a family man to Rachel Weisz, who soon after moving into their seemingly idyllic new home learns that a brutal crime had been committed against the former residents.The first half of this movie was pretty bad, terrible actually considering the talent attached -which includes a bit of nothing, fluff role for Naomi Watts as the neighbour. I did get into it for a while after Will's visit to "Greenhaven," I liked how they changed his hair and appearance while he was there, and then the whole story as you knew it changed too, going along the lines of 'The Others' which opened up a ton of cool possibilities. Unfortunately none of these avenues were ever explored as events went into the ridiculous. A big waste of talent in a movie that almost tells a clever story. Oh well, at least Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz had a good time filming together (they're married in real life now). 9/28/14</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's not bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Trying not to spoil and talk in general words, but anyway, its better if you watch the movie first. There is just no way this movie is so underrated. I found it really good! Obviously I didn't watch the trailer, so I had no expectations. The film caught my attention entirely. At the beginning you try to understand what's going on and you start to think you have figured it out, and then it leads you to another path, I just like that about a film, that it's not predictable. It's a sad story also, you care for the characters so when you learn what's going on it really breaks your heart. I don't know why it has such low reviews but to me, it has good acting, nothing less expected from these three amazing actors; it has tension, mystery...I really liked it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective psychological thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dream House is a standard chiller in which Daniel Craig plays Will Atenten, a husband who has to confront a difficult reality. Craig tackled the part well, managing to make his character into a likable but vulnerable protagonist. It seems like he has the perfect family, with two pretty young daughters and a wife whom he really loves. Rachel Weisz as Libby Atenten isn't just eye candy here. Weisz is very attractive but scenes with her and Craig generate genuine emotion. Weisz is a wonderful actress, and she certainly seems like the ideal (even angelic) wife. But even the supporting actors like Naomi Watts do a good job. One may get the impression that Dream House is a horror film but it's really a psychological thriller. It certainly delivers the scares, though the first part of the film builds towards a twist after which it stops being a shocker. The direction by Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot) isn't strong but the good cinematography by Caleb Deschanel and score by John Debney make up for this. The story is interesting too. The conclusion is that the film, while being rather ordinary, is still entertaining. Its particular twist is a real surprise, something which is rarely done in films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not the worst movie ever but......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i guess i might give this movie a 6. i don't think it was the worst movie ever, but like stated in other posts the insanity angle was the best twist. with that gone and known halfway through the film it really does become a who done it. at that point they throw together a 5 minute scene that shows the neighbors husband and his reasoning. really dude? you still get to see your daughter all the time and it seems your some big shot at a corporation. why try and kill your wife. not to mention that other guy doesn't know right from left or get an exact address. why no exact address? the only other scene that would give him motive to kill his ex wife is the weak scene in his office. "here sir, the numbers aren't exactly what we were hoping for"....."hows the custody coming" (loosely quoted seeing i cant remember exactly what was said). either way this movie could have and would have been better had they not thrown in that part at the end and that one scene. the only other 2 ways they could have done it was if he had actually killed them or if it was a random break-in and murder. either way probably still would have made the ending better had they done it right. with that said i give it a 6 because it does seem sloppy in a few parts of the movie. the writer's intent seems to change once whoever was writing its script got too close to something that resembled another movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Dream House' is a film that really should have just been the plot of a TV show like 'The Twilight Zone'. It's far too predictable to be a film. For a start the advertising for this film is all wrong; before you watch this film do NOT watch any of the trailers, they all give away the major plot points of this film. In fact, even if you do not watch the trailers you will still be able to predict the ending to this within the first ten minutes of the film. The plot is pretty poor, the dialogue can be a bit basic at some points and it was obvious director Jim Sheridan had to add a few pointless plot points to the ending because he realised just how predictable it was.It is a shame because the acting overall was really good. Rachel Weisz was probably the best in it and really carried a lot of scenes. Daniel Craig was also very good but his accent varied at some points, he was American with a hint of British in his accent then in other scenes he was just British, making no attempt at an American accent. Naomi Watts is a good actress but she was undermined in this film because her character was so basic and one-dimensional. I gave this film 5/10 purely because of the acting, if had not been for their performances this would have been a lot worse. Overall, the film had a lot of potential but it was nothing special. It's not a film anyone needs to see. If you decide to not watch this film you won't really miss anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This dream house is anything but!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A psychological thriller directed by Jim Sheridan. Successful New York City businessman Will Atenton(Daniel Craig)cashes in his retirement and decides to move his young family to the peace and tranquility of New England. The Atenton family's dream house quickly causes suspicion of something unsettling. Strange figures are seen in the snowy darkness and neighborhood kids are up to no good in the basement. Will's wife Libby(Rachel Weisz)soon begins finding reasons to worry about their safety staying in the house. Will finds out that the home he just bought is the scene of multiple homicides still yet to be solved. The more Will investigates, the more he has to deal with facts from his past. I really like the snowy atmosphere that lends to the chilling story. Original music by John Debney is a perfect fit for this film shot entirely in Canada. Others in the cast: Naomi Watts, Elias Koteas, Jane Alexander and Martin Csokas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of potential but less than great delivery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dream House was rife with problems behind the scenes. Unfortunately sometimes, in fact, usually that means the film will be marred and dragged down and that seems to be the case. They have a top notch cast, a decent story, potential for a great twist and yet all of that gets completely underused and under delivered. The film still has some charm in the way that it is dark and suspenseful at times but you are just left feeling empty and disappointed. Even the 'big twist' to the whole story is given away in the trailers and is completely disappointing when it does happen.Daniel Craig tends to be hit and miss with his roles. Having seen him in a few personal interviews I think he is very pompous and self involved and sometimes that comes through in his performances. I still like him a lot, he is a powerful actor at times but this was like drivel to him and he looks like he just constantly wants out of the role. Rachel Weisz gives a pretty solid performance considering the content she is given. Her role as Craig's wife is nearing excellent and gives the film the edge over being awful. Naomi Watts is completely underused in her role as the neighbour. Her role should have been saved for a second rate supporting actor, because she is a great actress and her talent is completely wasted.Director Jim Sheridan is an acclaimed director, with multiple Oscar nominations. I'm sure part of the behind the scenes issues were him trying to make this mess a little bit better and being stone walled by the studios but we can only speculate. Dream House borders on being this terrific dark thriller but due to pathetic performances, sub par directing, and a lack of ambition on the part of the cast it is left in the dust and comes across as a made for TV movie...and not a good one at that. Its average in every way. 6/10</fullReview>

I admit, it is bias also in this case and Daniel Craig ... Of all "Bonds" he is definitely worst, but his acting in this movie was ... OK. No superlatives, mediocre-to-good.

		<shortDescription>Very watchable, subtle mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was sort of misrepresented in its marketing - I was expecting a (perhaps low-key) horror movie. What I found, instead was a well-played drama/mystery with plenty of twists and turns. And, bonus - because I didn't know what sort of movie it was, I didn't waste time or energy trying to 'figure it out'...at least not in the beginning.We meet Will Atenton (Daniel Craig), an editor who's just quit his job to spend more time with his family &amp; write a book. He arrives at his (relatively) new home to his loving wife, Libby (Rachel Weisz) &amp; two boisterous daughters, Trish and Dee Dee. His joyful reunion is soon marred by creepy spies on the property and mysterious discoveries within the house itself. Some occurrences can be chalked up to the local teens, who he finds commiserating in his basement. Here, he learns that the house was the site of a murder 5 years earlier.No one will talk to him about this tragedy - including his neighbor Ann (Naomi Watts). She clearly knows something about the house's previous occupants, but won't divulge.Will takes it upon himself to research the killer, Peter Ward, and finds the path of discovery both disturbing and unbelievable. He journeys to the halfway house that was the man's last- known address, as well as the mental hospital he was sentenced to.Along the way, he begins to doubt the identity of the killer. And, as his own family becomes more personally involved in this mystery, he finds a suffocating need to find out the truth.Without spoiling specific plot points, I will say I found this movie easy to get into, with plenty of twists and effective foreshadowing. There were scenes and interactions which didn't make sense until the second half of the movie. Overall, I think director Jim Sheridan does a good job threading the web of intrigue. Craig, Weisz &amp; Watts likewise play their parts to a tee. Also of note, the cinematography and music are well-constructed to follow the nuances of the plot.I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. It was well-played, and tied together nicely. However, I think there was potential in some areas to punch it up, expand some of the background characters and storyline, and maybe add a few true chills. Overall, a good effort and pretty solid story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream cast for a most unremarkable film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dream House seemed to get a real kicking from certain critics upon it's release. I don't think it's all that bad at all. My guess is that the mauling it got was partly due to the talent involved. It's fair to say that with Jim Sheridan in the directors chair and a dream cast onboard, better might have been expected. What we have is a pretty straight up episode of 'The Twilight Zone'. Early on we get a few loud annoying bangs that suggest a more sinister tone, but before long it becomes very clear what's going on and the rest just plays itself out. It's not an awful film, it's just very steady and very unremarkable from a quite remarkable cast. Naomi Watts' presence in the film is puzzling. An actress of her skill and depth playing a part that anyone from 'One Tree Hill' could have churned out is head scratching. Daniel Craig is an actor i enjoy as Bond, but i have to say find ever so slightly unconvincing outside of that character. On the whole i'd say that Dream House is not the disaster some critics might have you assume it is, but at the same time, there's similar films out there that you might have seen that leave it well and truly in the low rent category.</fullReview>

A great director, two very competent actors, and a writer who helped write "The Dream Team" for gods sake. This should've been a no brainer, a home-run, yet the proverbial cinematic ball is dropped so badly at some point in the film (no spoilers but you'll know when it happens) that I was left dumbfounded.My Grade: D+</fullReview>

What is going on with his family, life, and house! Then there is a plot twist where Daniel Craig is trying to figure out what is real. What happened? Who is the murder? Did I do it? The middle part of the movie gets bogged down. the middle is either information overload or the director's intention was to create a foggy middle for the film. Another surprise plot twist for the ending of the movie. I did not mind the ending of the film. I love surprises. I just wish the the middle of the film was like the beginning and the ending. I may not be objective when viewing the film because I had a parrot running around on my shoulder while watching the movie! I give dream house a 5 or 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you hear the name Jim Sheridam it comes to mind films like "In the Name of the Father", "My little left foot", etc.., Good movies, and then you see Dream House, and you say, "Sheridam again". Dream House is a movie that clearly bears the stamp of Irish film director, in the shots, the atmosphere and more. But unfortunately, in my opinion is a bit tangled in the storytelling, you must be very attentive to what happens to understand the times they are telling, details, and introduce you to the movie. Having placed all the way on the screen, you get into the story and understand it, so see who should be available to have a couple of hours in front of the screen and expect nothing distracts, so enjoy the movie. Special mention was worn by actors, Daniel Craig (James Bond), Rachel Weisz (The Mummy) and Naomi Watts (The Ring), who to achieve a good performance. Notably Elias Koteas, actor who at times steals the movie. Recommended to see, but with time and disposition.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Dream HouseThe best thing about buying a murder house is you won't need to put any Halloween decorations up to scare trick-or-treaters.Unfortunately, the new owner of the infamous crime house in this horror movie refuses to acknowledge that benefit.Shortly after Peter (Daniel Craig) moves his wife Elizabeth (Rachel Weisz) and their daughters in to their new home, he learns from the locals that the previous resident had killed his wife and children.His frustration turns to confusion when Peter begins to notice cracks in his reality that suggest he may have been more involved in the slayings than he'd care to admit.While the ending does offer salvation for those able to wade through the convoluted storyline, Dream House is ultimately primed for foreclosure.Besides, during this economic downturn, it's more beneficial to stop snooping for the truth and just open your home up to busloads of murder tours.

		<shortDescription>After all these years, it's simply nothing special anymore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Advertised as a horror movie with the charismatic Daniel Craig, the talented Rachel Weisz and the beautiful and charming Naomi Watts, this film sounded highly promising to me but it didn't manage to pass above an average quality. The acting of Daniel Craig is quite convincing but the other two ones sadly don't get enough screen time in this short flick. Let's also add that this movie is not scary at all. What we have here is rather a mix between a predictable psychological thriller and a fluffy drama.The movie itself is surely twisted and keeps you watching it until the end. On the other side, it also tries so hard to impress that it gets quickly predictable and redundant. Truly suspenseful or gripping scenes are therefor missing throughout the entire slow paced psychological thriller that lacks of true highlights apart of the acting and maybe the final twenty minutes.If this film had been released twenty years ago or so, it would have hit harder but these days the story isn't all that original anymore. Just like this, I could easily mention you more than a handful of easily better and more gripping movies with quite similar so called twisted story lines: Lost Highway (1997), Fight Club (1999), The Sixth Sense (1999), Memento (2000), A Tale Of Two Sisters (2003), Identity (2003), Hide And Seek (2005), Shutter Island (2010) and so on and so forth. The movie makers should seriously invent something different than always the same stories with little variations.I would only recommend this film to fans of Daniel Craig and those who really collect and want to watch all movies of this genre. Anybody else should head for any other example I've mentioned above and will get a better and especially more original entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is definitely an enjoyable movie. It's confusing at parts and not very realistic, but the story is decent, the acting is actually amazing and the dialogs are realistic. I think i know why do people rate it so low... Just check the reviews: Many people saying: "This was so predicable". It' sort of a typical mystery movie. I agree so far: Many parts of the story aren't new at all. However, compared it to typical blockbusters example: "Spiderman 3", this story is still rather "unpredictable". Now, people don't really like being surprised. Ask anybody working in television. Look at any sitcom, soap opera... It's a problem of cognitive balance: Extraordinary things break our flow and force us to think even if it's about a totally pointless issue. We tend to avoid that.I think it should be at 7 stars and believe it will be there overtime. As more mature reviews come in through the TV audience, the rating will turn average which would be more justified, considering that real boulder-crap gets 6 to 7 stars easily. This is movie is at least decent, even if you don't like the story.Spoiler: Another obvious issue: You'd intuitively want the institutionalized psycho to be the bad guy, and that prolly would have been more realistic. However it turns out differently. That is pretty much the main twist in this movie. I know people hate that. It's sort of preachy. A lá "Not everything is what it looks like" and that messages been send many many times, so people get annoyed =) thanx for reading</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie ruined from the get-go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Once upon a time, there were two girls who lived in a house¨I was really disappointed with the trailer of Dream House. It gave away too much and I would've preferred not to know as much as I did going into the movie because the first 45 minutes of the film are totally wasted thanks to the trailer which gave away the twist that happens about midway through the movie. I have no idea what the producers were thinking about when they did this. I don't know if it was because of the trailer, but everything was obvious and predictable from the beginning which took away much of the suspense and thrills. If you haven't seen the trailer going into this movie then I think you're better off, but I still wouldn't recommend this film unless you are a fan of any of the actors or Oscar nominated director Jim Sheridan. Sheridan is known for making hit or miss films; his latest films Brothers was great, but before that he directed the mediocre Get Rich or Die Trying. One thing is for sure, he always works with some talented actors; and that is perhaps the best thing about Dream House, its cast: Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts, and Rachel Weisz. The weakest link is the script which could have been great if written by a talented writer, but David Louka isn't known for writing interesting scripts. The story had a lot of potential, but the delivery was just poor and everything became predictable. The film was saved from disaster by the strong cast, but I still wasn't pleased with the end product.Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) decides to quit his publishing job in the big city and move to a quiet country house with his wife Libby (Rachel Weisz), and two daughters Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare) and becoming a writer. They seem to be living a perfect life, but one night one of his daughters claims she's seen a man outside staring at the house. At first Will doesn't pay attention, but after beginning to see things himself he begins investigating the house. Someone is definitely outside stalking the place. He discovers that about five years ago a family was murdered in that very house: a young wife, two daughters, and the father who became the prime suspect. His name was Peter Ward and police never seemed to gather enough evidence to lock him in, but he was institutionalized at a mental hospital. Will begins investigating and discovers that Peter has been released from the institution and is convinced that is the man who has been threatening his home. In the meantime his neighbor, Ann (Naomi Watts), seems to know what happened that terrible night but isn't willing to tell him the whole truth. As Will continues to uncover the secrets that the house hides he begins making some unsettling revelations.Dream House is a very predictable film and in my opinion the cast was wasted in this film because they could have made a much more interesting thriller with a decent script. Instead the producers ended up making a movie we've seen hundreds of times before. It was a cheap imitation of Scorcese's Shutter Island. I couldn't help but compare what was going on with so many other similar films. Ever since The Sixth Sense, producers have tried to find better twists for their thrillers, but have mostly failed to do so (with the exception of Shutter Island and The Others). Dream House is supposed to be a thriller but it has little thrills, it's supposed to be a mystery but the real mystery is why the producers decided to reveal so much in the trailers. There are a lot of things that went wrong in this film, but I guess Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz won't be complaining since they got married shortly after working together in this film. I guess some movies are much more fun to make than to watch. I am still waiting for a decent 2011 thriller, this was definitely not it. This isn't a scary movie either, like some people might expect from a haunted house film. It's a plain suspense thriller that gives away a lot of the thrills in its trailer. Enough said.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie thinking it was a horror story. I never read the plots before seeing but do check the genre and the rating. This time I wasn't able to... So my expectations for horror were gone when I saw the man driving his car in a huff at he beginning (the neighbor). So I checked the genre and there it is a mystery, thriller. Then I thought that was something about the neighbor and no supernatural thing. Still changing the point of view, the movie could be nice! Mr Bond was acting so solid, so I was thinking, "What's the problem with you man?" When he came to his house, a lovely wife and two adorable children were waiting for him. Everything was perfect. Till they began to figure out there was a massacre there. So what can happen? A mysterious man came ahead, a man who killed his whole family! Spying on them? That wasn't a thriller at all. I never scared when I saw the foot prints and etc. Still trying to understand, what about the neighbor woman? Why is everybody acting weird? Why did the neighbor bring food? So it all become clear when he went to the ward (and Peter Ward) and saw his family's photo there. Oh, "Shutter Island" type! They actually wanted us to believe that Peter Ward went to their home and took their picture? I hope not! Afterwards the movie was clear but still what about the neighbor? Did they kill the family? Was he having an affair with her? Oh, I got it, brilliant idea! It was a misunderstanding! OK, I didn't like the movie at all. Could be good with unpredictable ideas, twists etc. Would prefer a dream house with scary ghosts or "Shutter Island" was really good...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing attempt at a psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last month I started going to the theatre again for the first time in 3 years (seriously), and one of the trailers that intrigued me was Dream House. It looked like a chilling ghost story with the great Naomi Watts. Alas, Watts is wasted in this movie, which failed to grab hold of me at any point.The basic idea is that Daniel Craig's character, his wife and two girls move into a new house without realizing it was a crime scene in which Craig's family was murdered- but Craig, now insane, still sees them. Craig himself is suspected to be the killer, but Watts plays a neighbour who assures him he didn't do it. It appears Watts is right, but the bad guys come back.It seems like the insane person who's not who he thinks he is has been done before (Fight Club, Identity), so I was disappointed when the movie went down that old route. But even before then, nothing about the writing, acting or look of the film was compelling. Watts is hardly in this before the revelation. The idea of a crazy guy who's innocent has also been done better in Hitchcock's movie Spellbound (1945). Dream House only achieves a couple of startling moments that made me jump, but nothing afterwards put me at the edge of my seat. The characters just weren't worth much emotional investment, and the climax didn't stand out as great, original action suspense. For Watts in a real ghost story, stick to The Ring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, it's that time of the year... just before Halloween, and time to trot out the worst of the worst... the most ill- conceived, hideously boring, pretentious mess of a supposed thriller, and this year the stinker of the season is....Dream House!!But it's no dream.. it's a nightmare... a bloody awful snore-fest, stupid, slow, stolen and ripped off and cut and pasted from everything from "The Shining" to "The Others" to every good horror or suspense film you can think of....... and all for what?!For nothing. Absolutely nothing makes sense. Characters behave as if they exist in some parallel universe. And to think some idiot actually green-lighted this turd.Well, it simply proves one thing: we once had Polanski and Kubrick and Jack Clayton and Hitchcock and Robert Wise.... And now, morons who shouldn't be allowed to go get coffee and donuts are handed the reins of $55 million dollar productions. Idiots without a clue about story structure are hired, no questions asked...without sense enough to recognize and fix the storytelling problems long before the post-production traumas begin.I don't blame the screenwriter or producer. I blame the director. This picture shows Sheridan's limitations. It shows that he's either completely blind to the problems of a bad script or hasn't got a clue how fix a broken one when he sees it... Either way, he's failed as a director. He only knows how to get decent performances from actors when he has a good script to start with. That essentially means he's an acting coach. Not a director. Directors understand storytelling. This is what separates the men from the boys, Jim. Sorry, pal. You were out of your league on this one. You might want to take Robert McKee's story structure course and try to learn something. Even Syd Field would help. Start with the basics. You'll learn. Maybe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You must be dreaming if you think this movie was disappointing. No doubt it could have been better if fewer hands messed with it. However, I went in with low expectations. Kept waiting for it to get stupid like so many reviews would have you think. It was well-acted. Had a great look. The story was creative (unless you saw the trailer). For those who were disappointed, go rent a Jason vs. Freddie Krueger and get your brainless slasher thrills. Me, I'll take this over most of the artificial, big budget shlock and hope that Hollywood runs out of comic book characters so that more movies with interesting characters can be made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak, illogical script defeats an admirable cast...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always in the mood for a good ghost story, so I assumed I would find one in DREAM HOUSE--not to mention the fact that the cast was headed by Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts.On the plus side, the snowy New England effects work to provide the right atmosphere, as does an eerie background score that ramps up the shock factor at every possibility. Unfortunately, there are very few genuine shocks and the suspense stays at a very even level throughout.The performances are valid enough too. Daniel Craig does a fine job of acting while keeping his shirt on for most of the film and Rachel Weisz has some nice chemistry with him as his devoted wife. The children are played with simplicity and charm by two adorable youngsters.But that's not enough. There has to be some logic behind the haunted house story and the discovery that a family had been slaughtered there years before. And when the final twist comes, the viewer will be fighting off boredom to such a degree that the surprise factor in the final scene will be a mere blip on the film's radar. And then, abruptly, the film ends.Surely, something went wrong in processing the script and bringing it to a final resolution that bears close scrutiny. But with all the talk of Jim Sheridan wanting his name off the directorial credits, I should have been forewarned that this would not be a good, coherent ghost story. Somewhere, a good story is struggling to get out.To make matters worse, I viewed the film in a theater where two girls in the row behind me never stopped chattering and laughing inappropriately at all the tense moments. If the story had been really gripping, I would have told them more than to stop kicking the seat. Alas, they were immature and totally unaware that they were movie pests of the first degree and spoiled whatever enjoyment I could get from the film.Summing up: The script for DREAM HOUSE was a muddled mess before Jim Sheridan ever chose to direct it. He deserves to have his name remain on the director's credits if for no other reason that he should have known better than to lay a finger on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pathetic psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jim Sheridan's filmography includes various excellent films (The Field, The Boxer, In America and Brothers -2009-). That's the reason why it was very weird for me to see his name associated with such a weak and unsatisfactory film as Dream House. Sure, the conflicts Sheridan had with the producers of this movie were recently revealed, as well as his disagreement with the changes made without his permit, which took him to the extreme of requesting his name to be retired from the credits (something which was rejected by the Directors Guild). However, none of that "industry gossip" decreased my enthusiasm for seeing what this talented director would do with a horror story. Nevertheless, I ended up hating the film, and besides, I would not consider it from that genre.The screenplay from Dream House is absolutely tedious and uninteresting. In spite of that, Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, Naomi Watts, Marton Csokas and Elias Koteas somehow managed to bring decent performances.Going back to the initial subject...What happened to Sheridan in here? I am not sure. I would like to think that the "suits manipulation" was what ruined the film, but I could not see even a remote trace of Sheridan's talent in Dream House. My theory is that Sheridan did not feel himself very comfortable with the thriller genre, and as a consequence, his work in Dream House feels like the one of an insecure rookie who limited himself to film what the screenplay says, but without any vision nor style. In conclusion, I genuinely wasted my time watching Dream House, and I suggest you to avoid this psychological thriller completely lacking of any suspense at any cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>B-Picture with a Great Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm glad I read all the negative reviews of "Dream House" before I saw it because I went in with low expectations and I was able to enjoy the film. It is not a great film. It is not even very good but it is a decent diversion and I'm glad I saw it in the theater instead of renting it on DVD.The frustrating thing is that the film is so flawed and it could have been so much better. Jim Sheridan has made some acclaimed films but visual style has never been his strong point and "Dream House" really could have used more visual style. Also, as much as I like Daniel Craig, he is not very believable as a mentally disturbed man who may or may not have killed his family. He's a good actor but he is too much of a tough guy to be playing a victim here.The other big flaw is that they gave away a big plot twist in the trailer and tried to market the film as a horror film instead of a psychological thriller. This is not a horror film and it shouldn't have been marketed as one. As for the twist, the one in the trailer happens about halfway through the film. There is a second twist near the end. While it is somewhat predictable, I enjoyed all the same.The real reason to see this film is for the acting and all the actors did a fine job. Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz are excellent and I wish they had given Naomi Watts and Elias Koteas more screen time.All in all, I found "Dream House" satisfying for a B-picture. If you go in with low expectations, you might find it enjoyable also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than you've heard.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For the entire first half of the movie I kept finding myself thinking, "This really isn't that bad." Yes, the trailer ruins the movie (it's not the only twist but it is the major one, and is the primary reason that I've stopped watching trailers unless I'm unsure if I want to see the film) and so in the back of my head was always the knowledge of what was going to be revealed; I love that the producers tried to say that it doesn't spoil the movie, so stupid.Still though, it was a relatively interesting story and Daniel Craig is almost always a commanding actor who can keep my attention. I was interested enough to keep going, despite some of the more obvious clichés of the horror genre, like building up suspense then dropping it and then having a loud noise to make the audience jump. Then the trailer twist was revealed and everything goes downhill after that. The tone of the film entirely shifts from this horror setup to a drama about an unstable man. The middle act was incredibly dull, despite Craig's best efforts it just felt like nothing was running well at all. I kept waiting for the film to end before it got worse, but boy it got to a level of bad that I was not expecting at all.The producers kept saying that the twist in the trailer "wasn't the big twist" and they were right, but damn I wish they had been lying. When the "big twist" comes it all feels so rushed, underdeveloped and absolutely absurd. My mouth almost dropped open from just how hilariously stupid it was. As a huge fan of Craig, Rachel Weisz and horror, this ended up being a major disappointment. No wonder the two of them and Jim Sheridan refused to do any promotion for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the trailer ruins the film as much as any spoiler-laden review, there isn't much off limits. Showing restraint becomes a true skill, and for Dream House being tasteful is as much of a task.Will (Daniel Craig) has just left his job as a paper editor in the big city. He's ready to retire and live along side wife (Rachel Weisz) and kids in a newly renovated home near the woods. The neighbors aren't as inviting. The stare down Will every chance they get and question his motives for moving into a home that served as a murder scene 5 years earlier.Here's the tricky part to Dream House; the trailer is selling a haunted house that isn't in the movie. Collectively, I like to think of this as a marketing failure, building expectations that aren't going to be met. Alternatively, I am one who enjoys surprises. So in that regard if the bait-and-switch led to something better than The Amityville Horror, then the end justifies the means. What happens with Dream House is a case of the bean counters realizing that this sullied together film can only be marketed as a ghost story.Logic and reason fly out the double pane windows in Dream House. Some of the questions raised include how a convicted murderer can be freed after 5 years in a mental ward, how the stay in the halfway house is somehow nullified, and how one can hire a (omit word to avoid spoilers) without giving them details such as hair color. It's astonishing that an accomplished director is attached to the credits. Jim Sheridan (In the Name of the Father, My Left Foot) manages to never find a standout moment from the drab screenplay. How names like Daniel Craig, and Naomi Watts got attached is something of amazement, especially since the latter has such an undeveloped role that you'd prefer to see a lesser talent have a shot.The greatest trick that Dream House pulls is on itself. It doesn't know if it's a supernatural or psychological thriller, and it may not even be either nor thrilling for that matter. There's no message to be taken from Dream House other than to not sit through it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read a few reviews of 'Dream House' before I watched it and saw that it had a lot of haters. Half way through and I was struggling to see why, everything was going so well. It was building up nicely and I was expecting a dramatic and revealing ending.Instead I was left somewhat perplexed as to what had actually happened. Once it had finished I still had plenty of unanswered questions and it was only once I'd thought it through several times over (with a little help from the internet) that I got my answers. Even so, it was far too complicated for my liking and the plot was hardly convincing. As if one ludicrous plot twist isn't enough, this film springs 2 or 3 on you.The absurdity of the plot completely ruins this movie, which is a shame because it had potential. The film itself isn't that bad, it's well written and acted, which makes it even more frustrating. They tried to be too clever and it backfired badly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Daniel Craig can act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate Craig's Bond and in general, he's always been a bad actor in my opinion. But he was good in Dream House. DO NOT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!!The twist is that Craigs character Will is really Peter Ward, whose family was shot by mistake. And in order to protect himself he has created Will and a fantasy world where his family is alive and well. But at the same time his wife and two daughters are more than just figments of his imagination. They are actual ghosts. The truth is that the neighbor hired a man to kill his wife because he thought she was cheating on him. And the man he hired went into the wrong house and killed Peters wife and kids instead.Ever since then Peter has been committed to a mental institution, thinking he killed his own family. But eventually he he is released for lack of evidence. Peter then goes back to the house and slowly finds his way back to reality. It all ends with the neighbor trying to kill his own wife and Peter. But he and the man he hired ends up dead, shot and burned to death in that order. Next time we see Peter he's normal again and has written a book about what happened that has become a nr. 1 bestseller. How he was able to proof his innocence when the guilty men died makes no sense. Maybe if the movie had another ending or it had been 15 minutes longer it could have been explained better. It was an interesting movie but it suffered from a bad ending and to many things left unexplained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly a Dream Script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dream House (2011): Dir: Jim Sheridan / Cast: Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, Naomi Watts, Marton Csokas, Jonathan Potts: Visually well made yet contrived haunted house thriller about the seemingly ordinary. Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz play a married couple with two daughters who move into the country suburbs so that he may concentrate on writing. When he learns that the previous owners were murdered he decides to investigate. He learns that the previous owner murdered his family via shotgun while surviving a gun wound himself. What is even more alarming is that he discovers through a visit to an institution that the previous owner was indeed himself. Could have blocked out a crime that he had committed? Could the family he engages with daily be a figment of his imagination? For director Jim Sheridan this is not as involving as Brothers, but it does have fun with reality and fantasy of the mind. The ending unfortunately, is corny and contrived nearly sabotaging any interest the plot sustained. Craig holds strong as a writer struggling to differ reality from fantasy while dealing with certain facts. What works is the screenwriter's ability to render Craig possibly guilty. Weisz holds strong as his reassuring wife who may be a mere image. Naomi Watts plays a neighbor going through a divorce and custody battle. She knows what really took place but the role isn't very broad. Even worse is her ex-husband, played by Marton Csodas whose revenge driven role is unspeakably dull. While visually well made, its contrived storytelling is best dreamed by big horror film fans. Score: 6 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After moving to the idyllic countryside from the city, a family soon realizes that their country home contains a dark and deadly secret.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What happens when you take a re-hashed who-done-it ghost story, throw in accomplished Irish director Jim Sheridan (Bloody Sunday, In America) and add an overly controlling production company? You get Dream House, a psychological ghost story centered around a sloppy murder mystery that offers a keyholes worth of insight into a potentially fruitful script. Without any press promotions, interviews, or test screens, Dream House quickly became a film destined for the gutter. What came out of all the tinkering and reworking is a film with an A-list cast that continually struggle and fail in their attempts to lift their film to something above the abysmal, plodding, and completely forgettable film it is.Beginning with the willful resignation of publisher Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) so he could spend more time with his family and his novel, Dream House introduces us to our titular house and the family that now resides within (Rachel Weisz, Taylor Geare, and Claire Astin Geare). Soon afterwards the daughters begin seeing a man lurking outside, and Will encounters a group of stereotypical goth kids who lead him on to the misdeeds that have occurred within the houses walls. With help from neighbor Ann Paterson (Naomi Watts) and her daughter Chloe (Rachel G. Fox), Will begins to dig deep into the murder of the home's previous family, only to discover something far worse.What plays out throughout the rest of the film is an endurance of patience, one that has no real reward or payoff. We are treated to a loving family and what they do within their home, to the investigative search of a man who must protect those he loves. All of this builds to almost nothing of what we have come to look for in a psychological thriller. Gone are the tense feelings, unnerving thoughts, white knuckles, and inevitable head rush as the story takes us in another direction. I almost don't know who to blame for this absence of anything resembling psychological horror, but Dream House seems to keep it under the floorboards, hidden from anyone who cares to enjoy its company.Surprising me the most is Daniel Craig as Will Atenton, who six years earlier gave us an amazing portrayal of crazy and paranoid in The Jacket, easily outshining its lead actor, Adrian Brody. What we are given as a representation of insane is slicked back greasy hair, a worn army jacket, and an empty stone look. Dream House also never bothers to truly show us a real descent into madness, with everything sort of blurring slowly into one mishmash of botched storytelling. Even Naomi Watts comes off dead in her tracks, delivering lines like the pouring of molasses; slow and wasteful. Whether or not you put blame on Jim Sheridan who has delivered excellent films in the past, or the production company Morgan Creek, Dream House is a film that delivers on little it has to offer. What begins as a potentially promising ghost story ends up unraveling into a yawn inducing attempt at psychological thrills. When we aren't being dragged along for the chase as one man uncovers the truth, we are treated to sappy, nightmare inducing family moments that feel carved out of an L.L. Bean catalog. Behind all of this poor execution is a small glimpse of what could have been an enjoyable yet been-there-done-that film, a glimpse that only adds to the disappointment. Dream House never manages to get its foundation established, causing the rest of it to sag and eventually collapse on to its own emptiness.</fullReview>

Or could.Daniel Craig in a horror movie.. Well mystery, thriller.. I had to see that! And Naomi Watts, and Rachel Weisz! That's three solid actors. And the acting is solid, too. The story is pretty good, not excellent, but better than many. It's always pleasant to watch this kind of movie with real actors. Unfortunately it's not that good. Can't really say what's wrong, I just wasn't that entertained. But the real reason I write this review, is that it has this one short scene, that almost brought me to tears. It was so warm and touching. And that my movie-seeing friends, is not often in mystery-thriller-horror movies. That one scene made me like the whole movie a lot better. I even get the feeling now, that I got from watching the scene when I did.So yeah. Not that good of a movie, but has it's qualities, and one really nice little scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Execution Still Makes For A Semi-Enjoyable "Horror" Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, don't believe the official ruling - this is NOT a horror film. I don't know what exactly to call it, but it sure as heck isn't horror. It's not even that weird side of horror that's scary, but not typically. I would have loved some horror movie clichés in this film. No jump scares, creepy children, blood on the walls - I would've loved some of that in this film. Horror can't exist in a vacuum. I'm at a loss for words to pick a genre. It has slightly eerie elements of a horror movie, it has touching aspects of a family drama, even some comedy.And it's badly executed. The way the movie unravels is the only true horror element of it. The movie does not know where it's going. The plot ambles through, making a 90-minute movie feel long. So why is this movie enjoyable? The acting. Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, and the whole cast deliver such a powerful, emotionally- charged performance, it almost makes up for the lack of horror and story. That's pretty much to say. The "twist" in the movie isn't a twist at all if you've seen any of the ad campaign. So see this movie if you want good acting and nothing else. I had a reasonably good time for seeing an hour and a half of basically nothing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a bid to be all fresh and original on us, and to avoid predictable cliché, DREAM HOUSE turns out to be a right mess of a movie. The set-up is a familiar one indeed: Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz move to a rural dwelling with their kids, only to learn of sinister shenanigans in the neighbourhood. The house was the scene of a brutal massacre and the killer's still on the loose.So far, so predictable, but halfway through there's a big twist that you won't see coming. Unfortunately after this stage believability goes right out of the window with one muddled, nonsensical idea after the other. It becomes a pure fantasy film, one that bears no semblance to reality or indeed has a proper structure or plot either. We're supposed to believe in the dumbest character actions and the most ridiculous situations.Needless to say, nobody comes out of this looking good, particularly the interfering producers and the writers. Craig and Weisz turn in staid and dull performances and even reliable supporting stars like Elias Koteas and Martin Csokas are wasted. The less said about Naomi Watt's insipid turn the better. No, this turns out to be a godawful thriller and one to avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

Will finds outs that five years earlier a man called Peter Ward killed his wife and his two daughters in the same house and that Ward spent five years in a psychiatric hospital but was recently released.The deeper Will investigates the more disturbing is the truth he uncovers and that his wife and daughters may not be who he thinks they are.The film is set up as a spooky, mystery house thriller. It starts off eerily and slowly. The picture reveals its twist midway through and then it suddenly perks up a lot. Its not the most in depth mystery and the casting of Craig and Weisz gives it more class than it deserves.Naomi Watts and Elias Koteas are wasted in their roles. The production values are not always that great, the climatic fire scene is poorly realised.I understand that the film was subject to studio interference. The result being the main stars and the director Jim Sheridan were unhappy with the film.A passable and average thriller but Shutter Island is far superior.</fullReview>

Craig's acting (and abs) is the only thing that saved this 90 minute dump bucket of side plots, red herrings, poorly dropped foreshadowing, and mostly weak character development. Despite the attempt made to create a deep, multi-layered mystery (not the horror promised), the films fail in creating any suspense given that within the first 35 minutes the whole plot is clear due to the aforementioned poorly done foreshadowing. And the characterization could not be more inappropriate. Before the 35 minutes were up that it took to see where the plot was going, I had already given up on any sort of realism in the film given that apparently in this alter universe average, middle age men who never exercise somehow all look like Craig's Bond character and the same can be said for his wife and neighbor. I would advise skipping this one and seeing Craig's good acting (and abs) in something better.</fullReview>

The best thing it has going for it is the great people working on it. It has the incredible director Jim Sheridan and an A-list cast. The movie looks great. But a battle with the studio really made this a problematic movie. As a horror thriller, it moves rather slowly for quite awhile. There is a mystery but the movie doesn't push the danger. It needs to put the family in peril quickly. Maybe Sheridan doesn't have it to make a thriller.All we have here is a mystery where the audience is trying to find the question. There is a jarring reveal midway through the movie. The more I think about the twist, the less sense it makes. There are a lot of inconsistencies earlier in the movie. The script needs a lot more reworking especially at the start. After the reveal, there is a slightly better movie. It's moody and creepy with Elias Koteas.

		<shortDescription>So wake me up when it's all over?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's very admirable of Daniel Craig that he still wants to star in other movies than the tremendously successful new generation of 007 James Bond flicks, but then he really ought to read the scenarios a bit more skeptically! Especially his choices in Sci-Fi/thriller genres are rather questionable, with mediocre titles on his repertoire like "The Invasion", "Cowboys vs Aliens" and also this "Dream House". Apparently ? according to the trivia section, at least - this was another movie plagued by disagreements and conflicts between the director and the production company, leading to re-shoots, alternate endings and nearly a complete boycott by the principal people of the film. I reckon director Jim Sheridan could have delivered a slightly better film if it was entirely up to himself, but I sincerely doubt he would have saved the whole thing. "Dream House" suffers from its derivative and predictable script right from the beginning. Anyone who has seen just a couple of ghost/haunted house thrillers will be able to figure out the main plot twist quite fast, and it's just as dire and clichéd as I feared. Moreover, "Dream House" struggles with a personality complex just as much as its protagonist does. The synopsis clearly hints at supernatural events and horrific atmosphere, but all the dark and morbid themes are oppressed in favor of sentiment and family drama. Class actors like Naomi Watts and, especially, Elias Koteas are dreadfully underused and there isn't a single noteworthy or memorable sequence in the entire film. Quite frankly, the only thing I like about "Dream House" is the film poster and I think even that is stolen from an Asian ghost movie I can't remember the title of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who the hell has the surname 'Atenton'?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Either it's all happening inside his traumatised head, or his family are all ghosts, or it's merely the story that he has written for his new novel?or perhaps it a combination of all three. These trite possibilities qualify Dream House as a rather unremarkable spooky thriller, albeit one with solid performances, some reasonable chills and a fair amount of atmosphere.Daniel Craig, who I've repeatedly been disappointed by (three crap Bond movies and Cowboys &amp; Aliens), is actually pretty convincing as a man who returns home to his loving family only to discover that all is not as it first appears to be, but he can do little help the film rise above it's well trodden premise, which unfolds in a predictable manner right up to the expected twist ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Few scary/horror movies deliver an emotional element, and Dream House certainly has that. There is a sense of feeling that you develop for the characters. You may even wish that they were your next door neighbors. It's a clear sign that a film is on the right track, when you see a family on the screen that you can really care about. How can you not like the young girls? They're adorable, and they just melt your heart. And Daddy is just the "family man" likable kind of guy. Add Libby in the picture, and you suddenly have the desire to invite these people over for dinner. So then why doesn't the film work? Well, for starters, it just seems like a movie that we have seen many times before. You almost feel like you're watching a Lifetime movie. It's predictable, and doesn't really offer anything new to the table. In spite of it all, Dream House is overall a decent, likable thriller. Will Antenton has just accepted his severance package, and left his well paying job behind voluntarily to spend more time with his family. Everything seems to be going great, until unusual incidents start to happen. The kids keep seeing a man looking in the window at them. Teenagers are sneaking in their basement. What is going on? A personal investigation from Will leads him to a mental hospital, looking for a man by the name of Peter Ward. What he's about to find out, is so shocking, that his entire life is about to change. It appears that there was a murder that happened in the very house that he bought. Nobody told him? Ann Patterson, the neighbor across the street, provides an excellent source in solving the bizarre mystery revolving around his home, and maybe even the murder that took place in the house. Will just wants to protect his family, and it looks like the cops and doing little to nothing to help him out. Once he uncovers the truth, he is forced to look at everything differently, including who he is, and what the house is. What's real, and what's not? Dream House is a "mess-with-your-mind" film, but if you've seen enough of them, you're quite invulnerable to the method of madness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film started really good, especially with the kids that said everyone who lives in he house dies. It was reminiscent of shining. Yet at a certain moment it is revealed that peter ward is the main character and that his family was killed. The fact he did not kill them is not a twist and is rather expected. When I saw it I thought just "meh... it is k". But a little time after I started thinking about the film in the idea that I might find some redeeming quality. This was a mistake as I found a lot of inconsistencies and logic errors. I will list my questions in hope of better understanding it: 1. If no one else died in the house except his family why did kids say : "everyone who lives here dies!"? This seems illogical 2. Why did the neighbor let the man he payed for the murder (but failed) live for 10 years? 3. Why did he not try to kill his wife in those 10 years? (it is not like he was afraid, and home accidents can be staged really easy) 4. If the ghost of Elizabeth can open the door she can move objects, but she does not do anything to help her supposed husband. Why? 5. The neighbor comes visiting him, even if he acts as a crazy person bringing cookies. Why? 6. Peter Ward gets hired under an assumed name and nobody does a background check or ask for credentials and gets promoted. Really? 7. The police is totally incompetent. 8. No one would let a crazy maniac go so easily as they did.The movie is disappointing at so many levels if you are someone that has a brain. Also I do not know what it is , it is not horror,thriller, psychological, drama. It tries to be all but fails miserably. My advice skip this movie. You will not regret it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This isn't a terrible movies like some critics are claiming. It's watchable but it's pretty dull to sit through it all. It just lacked the thrills and more of an original twists. This movie has quite a lot of twists going for it but it just isn't much of a shocker at all, especially if you seen a lot of these type of genre. It feels like it took ideas from other movies and crammed it into one. One movie that has Russell Crowe comes to mind even if this one lacks heart. The trailer really ruined this movie and usually when a trailer gives away a pivotal twist it usually isn't a good movie. And that is the case for this one, they knew this wasn't a good movie so they gave away a pivotal twist anyways. This movie just needed better thrills and more original twists and the only thing that stands out the most about this flick is that it has Daniel Craig in it. I think most of the bashing comes from the fact that they marketed this movie as a horror flick when it's actually a psychological thriller that lacks the thrills.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going in, I thought this was going to be some kind of a spooky story involving the supernatural or possibly solving a murder mystery. And it really wasn't. There is a little supernatural thrown in, but the ghosts never do what you think they are there to do. And it's not supposed to be scary.I don't want to give it away, but Daniel Craig plays, Will, a man whom has just moved into a house with his family. Neighbors and cops treat him weird. Then the twist is thrown in half way through the movie, so you are like, what is the rest of the film going to be about. That was done way too early.FINAL VERDICT: Sort of dull and not enough build up. The writer should have gone with the scary/thriller route.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally got around to watching Dream House. I wouldn't say I was "let down" since I had no real expectations, but it was definitely bad. The build up is slow, the "twists" are obvious, and the acting is surprisingly awful considering the talent attached.I had to laugh every time a twist happened, since everything was so slow and anti-climatic. If anyone was confused by the film, it was probably because the reactions of the characters to these ridiculous situations are so subdued and strange. The plot is actually very simple, and yet the oddly catatonic tone of many of the most poignant scenes makes it seem like there's supposed to be something important happening at times where there really isn't. There's really nothing here that you haven't seen in better films. Avoid this film unless you're a glutton for punishment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this move, kind of. The pace of the movie is slow and I found it hard to concentrate a few times also Daniel Craig is a great actor, but, his accent is a little thick sometimes and it was difficult a few times during the movie for me to make out what was being said over the volume of the music.The plot was decent, and there was a nice twist in the movie to keep it interesting. The only problem was that the movie dialog, cinematic presentation, and pacing, seemed a little like a cookie cutter approach to moving the plot along. It would have been nice to have an occasional ominous music score, an upbeat tempo, a loud outburst, etc. to break up the monotony. Instead the plot flowed along like a lazy river, the high points mere ripples instead of splashes.I enjoyed this movie, but, it is the sort of movie, at least for me, that I can only sit through once.</fullReview>

Her part was not that big but she kind of walked through it. The cinematography was beautiful and the sound was especially good. The little girls who played the children were very good actors.

		<fullReview>Dream House is a limp, ineffective thriller that has a great cast and...well, really nothing else.&nbsp;I was well aware of how poorly Dream House had been received by critics and most audiences, but I was convinced I should see it, regardless. I'd yet to encounter a movie that Naomi Watts didn't make at least somewhat worthwhile for me. Until now.&nbsp;There's a fine line between an interesting story and a ridiculous one, and this movie spends way too much time on the wrong of it. It's advertised as a ghost story, and it is (a very poor) one in a way, but it's also something of a (terrible) murder mystery and a (mess of a) psychological thriller. It reminded me of Shutter Island in some ways, but not in quality or coherence. Dream House is just so ridiculous and ill-conceived that I could barely make it through it.&nbsp;The best cast in the world can't save a true dud, and this is just more proof of that fact. Even the biggest fans of Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz or Daniel Craig should do themselves a favor and skip Dream House. They're all wasted, as would almost surely be your time.&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream House perfect name for a distraught father/husband living in a "dream" world,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was great to me. The writer didn't spoon feed everything to viewers and I think that's the reason behind all the bad reviews. Of course, it could've been better, but it wasn't a bad movie at all, it's just for an audience who likes to think and I'm one of them. The problem is, everyone doesn't like to think and they want everything to be given to them on a silver platter. Well...this isn't a movie for them. In a nutshell, the ex-husband of the next door neighbor, Ann,(Naomi Watts) hired someone to kill her for insurance money/fraud but the guy went to the wrong house...the house of Peter Ward/Will Atenton and thus, killed his family, the wife(Rachel Weisz (Libby) and their two children. Libby shot Peter accidentally in an attempt to kill the intruder and I imagine after Peter, her husband, was out, the intruder finished off the wife and the two children and fled and thats when the cops and ambulance or whatever arrived and discovered Ward shot in the head along with his dead wife and children...but Ward didn't die, he was sent to a mental institution and they assumed he was responsible for the killings because my guess is the intruder was long gone when help arrived. Ward got out of the the institution 5 years after the killings and returned to the home where he lost his family and the entire time, they were only a figment of his imagination and he was living in a dream world. While in the institution, he had everyone call him Will Atenton because he didn't want to accept that his real name was Peter Ward...the guy being accused of murdering his family, so he created a new name for himself and tried to relive his life with his wife and children who were deceased, but in his mind, they weren't until he was able to come to grips with what happened and accept that they were gone and no matter how many times he changed his name, he will never be able to have a life with them. Of course, all of this didn't come clear to me until the end and hey, that's the type of movie I like...one that will keep the viewer guessing and this one really did. It definitely wasn't the worse film I've ever seen and I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first sense of disbelief came in wondering what Daniel Craig was doing in a mystery thriller, that too one that sports subtle elements of horror. However, by the time I got to the part where the so called mystery unravels, I was drowning in a second yet overwhelming wave of utter disbelief. Simply said, this has to be one of the worst movies of 2011, especially since there was a lot riding on the directorial approach of master storyteller Jim Sheridan. Yes, THE Jim Sheridan, six-time Oscar nominee and THE driving force behind actor Daniel Day-Lewis and their mutual claim to fame "In the Name of the Father".It all begins the day New York publisher Will Atenton (Craig) quits his job and moves into a nice piece of real estate with his wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and their daughters. Before the family can settle in, they learn that the previous inhabitants, a woman and her children, were brutally killed with the husband being the prime suspect. Will begins to dig around and with the help of neighbor Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts), opens a big can of ghosts from the past. Literally.Perhaps the studio and the distributors made a blunder by marketing this movie as a horror thriller instead of a mystery thriller (yes, there is a big difference). At one point it actually sets off in the direction of a psychological thriller before doing a complete 180 degree spin in the opposite direction. An error like that is quite understandable considering how misleading movie trailers can be. But how do you explain making a movie from a totally ridiculous script? On one hand it is always good to have a clever plot twist. On the other hand, an ill-conceived plot twist becomes a no-brainer when it crumbles under its own weight.You can't really blame real life couple Craig and Weisz for the failure of this movie when its failure is mainly due to an underwritten screenplay that gets totally gutted after the mystery unfolds. I am not sure what Sheridan saw in this story or how he expected it to play out, but from where I'm sitting, I see this movie on the exact opposite end of the spectrum when comparing it to "The Sixth Sense".If you are wondering whether Craig can fit into any other character besides Bond, my answer is yes, but not quite snug. At least not in a mess of a movie as this turned out to be. Together, Craig and Weisz are well cast and believable as an on screen couple, making their portrayals the only saving grace here. Watts, on the other hand, is miscast and doesn't appear to add anything worth remembering, even in her limited screen time. Elias Koteas and Marton Csokas appear mostly towards the end. Although their characters adds some reveal to Will's foggy mystery, it is the plot twists that come with these characters that ultimately cause the ending to crash and burn. Literally.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I go to the movies all the time with my cousin and we love suspense/thriller/horror (even the bad ones).This movie was okay, but don't expect much. The story (for me) was a little bit Amityville Horror, an iota of Shutter Island, a taste of the Wicker Man, etc. etc. Even though we stayed for the entire movie, while I was sitting in the theater watching, I didn't really care about the characters or what was going to happen. Also, there appeared to be plot holes in the story, which were explained by the end of the film, but I couldn't get over a couple of scenes where what was taking place didn't seem plausible or rational.If you are just looking for fun and like the cast: Daniel Craig, Niaomi Watts, etc. then you might enjoy this flick. If you don't have the money to blow on just any movie, go rent a great suspense thriller, or wait until a better one comes out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Once upon a time, there were two little girls who lived in a house.' Entering into the ream of this film written by David Loucka and directed by Jim Sheridan (In America, The Boxer, In the Name of the Father, The Field, My Left Foot, etc.) is more of a challenge than the viewer is ready to understand. The apparent story is so tightly written that all of the elements of the real story are placed before our eyes, but as in so many life instances, what we think we see and understand is a mirage: the story being told is occult until the film is over. Similar films that use this technique include The Sixth Sense, Shutter Island, and The Others. Sharpen your observational skills and this film will be extremely satisfying.Opening with a New York City farewell party for writer Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) who is leaving his high paying job to spend more time with his family, we soon find Will in front of his dream house in the New England where is beautiful and passionate wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and his two young daughters Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare) are in the process of fixing up an old deserted house. Some strange things happen - as in all good ghost thrillers - and soon enough Will learns that the house has been vacant for five years because of some heinous murders. A neighbor across the street - Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts), seemingly estranged from her husband Jack (Marton Csokas) who is attempting to gain sole guardianship of their daughter Chloe (Rachel Fox) - visits and shares with Will some of the grisly details. At this point the story begins to unwrap the real situation of Will's identity and the real history of the house of memories. To share more story would be unfair to the impact of the illusion of this film.Daniel Craig is superb as Will, and Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts are excellent, as are the supporting actors which in addition to Koteas and Csokas include Jane Alexander in a pivotal cameo role. What appears to be an enigma at first is resolved with great skill. A thinking person's movie, this. Grady Harp February 12</fullReview>

I didn't watch the trailer and had not read anything about it, maybe that's why I enjoyed it. I really cant understand all the bad reviews about it. If you liked 'shutter island', or 'the orphan' it's likely you'll enjoy this one. After being shocked at the movie 'in time', on my list of worst movies ever, this was really a breath of fresh air. It could have been better of course, but nowadays any movie could be better. I thought the movie could actually have been longer, as things happened so fast at the end.It feels like a thriller from a book, much less predicable than 'The Shining'.

I don't go into a movie trying to predict things because I like to be surprised, but I was easily able to figure EVERYTHING out way before the end of the film. It was slow, doesn't challenge the mind at all, and nothing about it was scary. You couldn't pay me five bucks to sit through this trash again. A current 5.7 rating is waaaaay too generous.

Also what on earth is Naomi Watts doing in this movie? Has she succumbed to the paycheck? The acting is just horrible and reflects the lousy script.

		<shortDescription>Decent Movie Overshadowed By Poor Marketing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very excited to see Dream House. A thriller/horror movie with a trio of my favorite actors is too hard to resist. However this movie was marketed as a lot more of a horror movie than it is. In fact its not even close to a horror. The other huge misstep was the "twist" of the movie was shown in enough detail in the commercials that it was common knowledge. However in the movie's timeline, it takes a while for said twist to occur and a lot of the movie's appeal is tied into it.This movie had excellent acting and set the mood perfectly. At the end of the day, I still enjoyed the movie, even though I felt tricked and it turned out to be more of an ominous romance. Other than that, Daniel Craig impresses and though the twist is forthcoming, the actions and how it plays out with him afterwards are well executed.Not to harp, but more than the movie's misrepresentation, I would say the advertisements divulged WAY too much information. Also the ending seemed a bit lackluster. It really seemed that the movie wanted to rely on its central twist. But anybody can think of a different way to tell a story and a different outcome. Given the goals the movie was striving for, the ending fits.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys the top 3 billed actors and wants a thriller/romance. If you haven't seen the commercials, than I highly recommend it because at least you can enjoy the meat of the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream House (2011)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An intense performance by Daniel Craig. He's one of my favorite actors but think he does well portraying Peter Ward.Alone and paranoid can be scary for a suburbia man without friends other than a sympathetic neighbor in Ann Patterson. Sometimes ignorance is bliss, in this case amnesia from his gunshot wound. I can't envy his state of having to reconcile the dreamworld in his mind with reality outside.I love the lack of a love scene between Ward and Patterson. It would have taken away from the overall story I feel. The director and his writers let us realize gradually that Ward is actually delusional.I would actually label this film both heartwarming and inspirational. It warms the heart to see that someone's care to those among us with mental disorders can actually do wonders for such persons. Ward returning to New York as an author, part of his mental fantasy world that comes to pass is what I deem inspirational.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It sounded like a great storyline but the movie fell very short.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Promoted as a Drama, Mystery, and Thriller, Dream House dragged on with a bit too much drama, it lacked enough mystery, and it drastically fell short to even qualify as a thriller on today's cinematic standards. The acting was on par with most A-list movies, but the delivery of the storyline left you feeling disappointed upon the ending of the movie. You will find yourself waiting for a twist and turn to occur at numerous times in the movie only to be disappointed when the scene changes and the movie continues to roll on to the next act without a noticeable climax to the scene that just passed. As a thriller, you will experience more suspense and fear by looking at the promotional marketing for this film than you will ever experience by actually watching this movie.I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10, due to the fact that the storyline actually had a lot of potential, so I actually wanted it to be good. Also, the acting was very good and the movie was only about 90 minutes long, which did help a lot since it did drag on at times. Other than that, it wasn't very thrilling, some scenes tended to seem noticeably unrealistic, and the lack of suspense during the movie, left you eager to just get to the end of the movie.I'd save your new movie release money and just wait for Dream House to show-up as a low-budget rental in a few months.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is not a bad movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Really really good acting!, Naomy Watts, Rachel Weisz very solid acting and Daniel Craig, the 007 in a totally different role with a quite believable acting. The story is not absolutely new but in some point is different, you will see. I don't think they deserve so many critics, maybe some things could be better but in general is quite good, and can makes you cry more than once. I can recommend it for a Monday night movie, and maybe not "the Sunday movie". I am not going to tell you "go and watch it" but I can tell you don't you believe all what you read. And please don't watch the trailer, Thanks... P.S: sorry for my English.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't like horror movies. But I do like to think. I watched this film free off the internet. Someone filmed it on a cam. (sorry I'm broke)The audience in the theater talked the whole time and I also heard children talking who were bored.(um, why bring your children to a movie about dead children?) Then in the last 30 minutes or so someone was snoring really loud. I suspect it was the person filming it. I know why the Craig's made this movie. It's just to bad that while they were filming at a stoplight, someone carjacked them and drove them to crazy-ending-ville. That is not their fault. See this film in a quiet theater, and pay attention, you will not be disappointed. Since it was a cam, I could not read what was in that e-mail.But I did enjoy what was in the neighbors bathtub!!Today's audience would not like Hitchcock, or the Twilight Zone. Too bad for them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An engaging thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a man who moves into a beautiful house in the suburbs with his wife and two children. His dream house soon turns into a nightmare when the secrets of the house is unfolded."Dream House" is a well made thriller. Initially everything seems to be perfectly clear and straightforward. When the twist comes, things are confusing in the sense that you still don't know whether the twist is real or not. I think that is good film making, as it makes you think what event in the film is real and what is not. Both Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig are captivating on screen, and they make a convincing on screen couple. I enjoyed watching "Dream House".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Briefly treads original ground. Craig is on form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A family unknowingly moves into a home where several grisly murders were committed... And the killer may still be at loose.The snowy setting from the city to the suburbs gives the film a crisp eerie quality.&nbsp;Director&nbsp;Jim Sheridan's&nbsp;Dream House is &nbsp;lovely looking film. What appears to be a run of the mill mystery becomes an intriguing story and somewhat unpredictable drama.Rachel Weisz's odd&nbsp;American accent aside the cast are on top form with Daniel Craig pulling out all the stops. David Loucka's&nbsp;screenplay takes an unexpected if somewhat unorthodox turn which is probably the films main strength. That said, the closing is messy as it tries wrap everything up quick and in a Scooby-Doo like fashion. It's a shame as it spoils much of what came before.The stellar cast make it work for the most part and while it contains elements of other psychological films it briefly treads some original ground.&nbsp;Worth watching if only for Craig's performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A family unknowingly moves into a home where several grisly murders were committed...only to find themselves the killer's next target.Successful publisher Will Atenton quit a job in New York City to relocate his wife, Libby, and his two girls to a quaint New England town.But as they settle into their new life, they discover their perfect home was the murder scene of a mother and her children.And the entire city believes it was at the hands of the husband who survived.When Will investigates the tragedy, his only lead comes from a neighbour who was close to the family that died.....Believe me when I say this. If you have not read any reviews, but have heard how dire the film is, and the fact that the two leads have disowned the movie, watch it and revel in the fact that this is one good movie.I can understand that this has been compared to 'The Shining;, thanks to the advertising, and the trailer makes this look like any other horror movie (insidious and the afore mentioned came into mind before seeing this), but it's something so very different, and the surprise is just how well made the film is.Craig and Weisz are very god in their respective roles, and although Watts just spends the majority of the film leeching over Craig, she plays a big part of the overall story.I was thinking that halfway through the film that this was mundane, and where was Sheridan going with it, and then something happens, and the fact that this film has been slated so much, it literally made me sit up and take notice in what I was seeing.and from there, it turns into a completely different movie, and it becomes evident it has more to do with 'The Jacket' than anything else.it's not worth spoiling, but there are two big twists in this film, that make it one of the most under-rated films of last year.See it, thinking it will be a piece of garbage, and you may enjoy it more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream House, a horror story with twists and turns. A Dream to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not much of a reviewer, but I enjoyed this movie so much that I wanted to contribute a few words.So many horror movies are predictable. You pretty much know what's gonna happen, who's "ghosty", who done it, etc. But I was caught completely off guard by this one...several times!There are multiple twists in this movie, and just when you think you might have a notion, a new twist spins you away from that notion and heads you in another direction ultimately causing me to stop guessing along, to just watch the movie and enjoy it.(spoiler alerts below, as I continue)Daniel Craig is good, putting aside his "tough guy" persona and adding a new dimension to what we are used to seeing from him on screen. Rachel Weisz is also good, never giving away her role, befuddled and confused at the right times, (in character), as a spectre might be. Beautiful, of course, is Weisz as Craig's wife. Naomi Watts, also very good, and equally beautiful, gives nothing away, enhancing the suspense and keeping me guessing as to her part in the movie.The only part of this movie that could have been considered a "love story" is between Craig and his family. I was pleasantly surprised that the love interest did not extend to Watts in the end.All in all, as horror stories go, something a little bit new here. A horror story with twists and turns is not new, but the use of these twists is new, and they are used well.I enjoyed it, gave it an 8. Well worth watching, even owning.ps...The movie and its characters have much more depth than this review. I did my best :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utterly Incoherent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Magazine editor Will (Craig) leaves his job to spend time with his family at his new home outside the city. A bizarre nightmare awaits him.This is one of those films that starts out like a predictable haunted house movie pretty much like we've all seen before. What follows makes no sense as we see the main character struggle with trying to figure out what is real and what isn't. It becomes unpredictable but nonsensical.Then there are the questions about casting. I adore Rachel Weisz and Naomi Watts but we see them here acting opposite Daniel Craig (Whose accent keeps breaking), Marton Csokas, Elias Koteas, Gregory Smith (who is on screen for a but a moment or two) is all wrong. They are evidently meant to pass for Americans but Americans are better at playing Americans don't you think? The cast is on screen looking almost as clueless confused as audiences must be. What the hell is going on? All I could think throughout this movie was "Huh?" or "What?". The editing is so inept I kept wondering if I was seeing the deleted scenes.The estimated budget for this turkey is $55 million prompting familiar questions as to what the cash was spent on other than the very talented cast and director. Pretty much zilch in the way of special effects and a shoot in Brampton. Brampton! Not Geneva, not the French Riviera, not Florence. A run down house in Brampton! Of course Paranormal Activity 3 came out around the same time and debuted big at the top of the box office despite a minuscule budget and succeeded in terrifying audiences of all ages. Compare the two. What's wrong with this picture? Gregory Smith is one of those child stars who began his career like a ball of fire. Now in his late twenties he has returned to Canada and ended accepting projects that are well beneath his level of talent and fame. As a domestic star in our local industry he deserves better from us if for no other reason than because he returned to Canada to work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed this film it is great to see the married couple work so well together on screen and provided such chemistry within their roles.Although sadly this movie however was very predictable, rather then keep you guessing it gave away its clues early. It was not a horror as there was no real scares, nor a suspense as it didn't really want to make you guess rather it gave away the story to you. It made a good thriller though. I have never read the book so I cannot comment on the obvious differences. Although this film has a great feeling throughout it and was enjoyable to watch.6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>dream house is a physcological thriller about a family who just movies into a house that happens to be the same house of a murder. it is said a husband murdered his family and he was put into a mental institution. now will (Daniel Craig) Libby (Rachel weisz) and there two daughters have moved into the house, will quit his editing job to spend more time with his family and is working on writing a book. suspicions of the house start when one of the daughters see someone looking through the window, then later that night will hears a noise and he goes down to the attic and he sees these kids i guess praying for the house. the whole town was shocked my the murder it being a small town and Ann (naomi watts) the neighbor knows what happened but has kept it secret. there is a twist at the end i didn't see coming until end. the story evolved as the film went on. the mystery just kept building as you kept watching and you were at the edge of your seat the whole time wondering what was going to happen next. there was also great chemistry between Daniel Craig and Rachel weisz. she says through the whole film that she feels safe around will. and when something bad happens and he is not there she feels relieved and safe that he home. thats an important part for you to remember in the film. a part that many people in the theater watching the movie probably overlooked. but when you see the movie you will know why it is an important part. its an entertaining film to watch and you will be satisfied knowing the seven dollars you payed or ten dollars you payed was worth it. my opinion. my recommendation. see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dream House</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I was originally planning to see this film when I saw the DVD for it, I guess it was the because of the good actor and actresses in the cast that persuaded me, and I knew the title was ironic because of it being some thrilling or scary thing, from director Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot, In the Name of the Father). Basically in New York successful editor Will Atenton (Daniel Craig) who works for GPH Publishers quits his job in order to move to the suburbs of New Ashford and spend more dedicated time with his beloved wife Libby (Rachel Weisz) and his daughters Trish (Taylor Geare) and Dee Dee (Claire Geare). He plans to start write a novel while in the new dream house, but a stranger is frightening the family looking through the window, and investigating Will find teenagers in the basement is a satanic cult, and chasing them out one of them says that something bad happened in the house. He does some research and finds out a man called Peter Ward murdered his wife and two daughters in the house five years ago, and after the police ignore his concerns he finds out Peter Ward was discharged from Greenhaven Psychiatric Hospital following five years of incarceration. He tries to talk to the neighbour on the other side of the street, divorced Ann Patterson (Naomi Watts), but she refuses to give him any information about the murder or anything else, so instead he goes to Greenhaven to ask about Peter Ward. He discovers a dark secret about the former inmate that means danger for him and his family, Will is in fact Peter Ward himself and invented his new identity to get over the loss of his family, but of course his other personality comes back out to terrorise once again. Also starring Marton Csokas as Jack Patterson, Elias Koteas as Boyce, Jane Alexander as Dr. Greeley and Rachel G. Fox as Chloe Patterson. Craig for the first half does okay as the investigative family man, but turning into the villain he does not do as well, Weisz and Watts could have both had more screen time being petrified and concerned, the story is not original at all, it reminded me of the low of The Shining with the normal man turning bad, and the twist does not work, the only slight grip I got was the house catching fire, but nothing else interested me, a boring mystery thriller. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very uninspired horror movie that is filled with great acting. The acting does makes the movie watchable though. I say B-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"You've been living here and you don't know about the murders?" Will (Craig) and his family have found the perfect house in the perfect neighborhood to move into. When a local teenager is caught in their house she tells him about a murder that happened in the house 5 years ago. Will starts to investigate what happened and his neighbor Ann (Watts) helps. Will finds out a horrifying secret that may change the life of him and his family forever. This is a very strange movie in a couple ways. First, the acting and idea are great. All the main actors do a great job. The main problem with this movie to me is that nothing seems to happen. The acting keeps you watching and interested enough, but eventually you grow board with the lack of anything. For a horror movie this is very slow and drawn out. This is not a bad movie, and the last maybe 15 minutes is exciting, but as a horror movie it is very weak. Overall, a very slow and drawn out movie with great acting. I have seen worse though. I give it a B- (because of the acting)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ludicrously unbelievable script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually got angry while watching this film that I'd wasted my time and money renting it.The cast is excellent, as you'd expect from such a high-powered cast, but every single action, nearly every single line of dialog, was so utterly unrealistic and unbelievable in light of actual human nature that it was painful to watch. The family, the neighbors, the police, the social workers. It was all as if the screenwriters have never dealt with real human beings before.It's painful to watch people behave in an aggressively stupid or unrealistic manner just to advance the so-called plot, a plot so full of ludicrous turns that it could only be held together by assuming that everyone involved chose precisely the dumbest option available to them. I shut the movie off less than halfway through because I was just so angry at what a waste of time it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Editor Will Atenton (what an unusual name, it almost sounds like 8-10-10) quits his job in order to spend time at home, writing a book, with his wife and two small daughters in the house they have just bought. After worrying moments involving people outside, intruders, and neighbours who won't say much, they discover that the father of the family who previously lived there murdered the mother and the two daughters. Will tries to follow this story backwards, but even the police won't tell him much. He finally traces the murdering father down to a psychiatric hospital, where the film's big twist is revealed. Unfortunately, it is also revealed in the trailer, so it came as no surprise to me whatsoever.From there, the film takes us into fairly familiar realms of uncertainty - is this a psychological thriller? Is it a ghost story? Is it a crime suspense thriller? It pushes on with further twists here and there.I think people who try to figure these films out won't have too much trouble. I don't, and I found a couple of the wrinkles quite pleasing although I do wish that the big central twist hadn't been revealed in the trailer.Daniel Craig, as Will, is very good in this. I was as indifferent to Rachel Weisz, playing his wife, in this as I am to her in anything else I've seen her in - she joins Natalie Portman on the list of actresses in whom I am spectacularly uninterested. The kids are OK, Naomie Watts can do better, and Marton Csokas and Elias Koteas are reliably intense in small supporting parts.I was distracted by the way everybody blithely left doors wide open in a cold and snowy setting.Although it's not quite as bad as it has been painted in some quarters, this should have been a much better film than it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie expecting to see something like "A Haunting in Connecticut" or something like it. It wasn't quite what they had made it out to be and it turned out to be more of a psychological thriller.I found myself looking at my watch way too often during the first half of the movie because it was moving slow and it didn't look like it would ever get moving but they did a nice job of stitching it together at the end.I'm glad I hung in there because in the end I really enjoyed it.I've been in love with Rachel Wiese since the first Mummy movie and I thought her and Daniel Craig had good Chemistry on screen.

		<shortDescription>Terrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoy all three actors in this film separately, and thought them coming together would make for an interesting picture. I was sorely disappointed. The movie was slow and not suspenseful. The only suspense was waiting for the movie to get more interesting (which it didn't). The first half of the movie seemed like they had filmed too much material and then clumsily pieced it together. My partner and I figured out the plot a fair bit in advance of the turn referenced in the main review and then waited for something to happen which never did. The movie had an abrupt and terrible ending making me think the producer/studio probably ran out of money and couldn't afford or be bothered to try to make it better...that they had realized how bad the movie was and they may as well just release it to try to recoup some of their losses. The actual end of the movie after the narrative peak (small as it may have been) was probably one of the most clumsily attempted Hollywood wrap-everything-up / feel-good endings I've seen in a long time...I actually think they did this so that the audience wouldn't feel angry at how bad the movie was. Whoever directed and produced this should be ashamed.</fullReview>
