		<shortDescription>Entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Im not sure what video gamers were expecting when this series was turned into film. Just like books, comic books, and whatever else, the source material will more often than not be different from the film. However, that is not always a bad thing. Take Jurassic Park for instance. The movie was phenomenal, but nothing like the book. Anyways, the reason i'm saying this is because I myself have played the games and have enjoyed the movies quite a bit. Sure, there not masterpieces by any means, but I think they are time well spent to escape reality for a couple of hours. I think Milla plays a great heroine in distress and a serious badas s. The character development in this is non existent. You get a little speech to bring you up to speed, but if you haven't seen these before, you will be lost in the film. (A friend that I had brought asked me how Claire Redfield knew how to fly a helicopter.) But you're not in this movie for the character development. You want to see zombies die and Milla kick butt, and that is what this film delivers. There are some great scenes here and some pretty fun kills, not a whole lot that you haven't seen before, but still entertaining. The movie goes pretty quick and has some very nice things to add. Alice's telekinesis was very cool to watch, and I can see why she didn't get to use it a lot. A lot of the special effects were much better here than they were in previous films, and that was a definite plus. The bad is that it ends for another to be made, and this is supposed to be the last. A lot of main players lose their lives, and that's fine, cause the movie doesn't give you time to care for them. Nope, the main focus here is Milla and she delivers the goods. Good fights, good kills, not much logic, pretty decent special effects, and the greatest pot smoking scene in history make this worth seeing in my opinion. If you liked the first two, you should enjoy this just the same. Personally, I don't think any of them have been too bad.P.s. why did they keep airbrushing Milla's face, she is entirely too beautiful for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Resident Evil: Extinction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Extinction, the Resident Evil franchise perhaps have made its mark as the most enduring computer game turned movie to date. Most of such movies usually make for cheesy lazy weekend entertainment, little in depth but filled with plenty of set action pieces, which for the most parts are nothing groundbreaking. But what this franchise has to credit for its longevity, is Milla Jovovich.OK, so she has made mostly mediocre movies of late (I sense some fanboys will get me for this, but let me put it straight, I'm a fan of hers too), especially with the lacklustre Ultraviolet, and the really showy .45. If not best remembered for her role as Leeloo in Luc Besson's The Fifth Element (still credited in my books as the ONLY film I watched with having zero prior knowledge on anything about it), then it'll be for her role as Alice, the zombie butt kicking superbeing whose blood holds the key to a reversal of the effects of the T-virus engineered by the evil Umbrella Corporation.The premise here is similar to that of 28 Days/Weeks Later, where the virus is now out of control, and mutates humans into flesh chomping zombies, spreading mayhem worldwide. Human survivors are few and far between, and where we left off from Apocalypse, Alice is now travelling the world alone, seeking refuge and peace, while evading Umbrella's gunsights. It presumably takes place a significant amount of time after the predecessor, given that Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) doesn't return for this, keeping the doors open for either an unlikely spin off, or a revisit into the gap in timeline should Guillory sign on the dotted line.But I guess as Juvovich fans, we don't really care, do we? So long as we get to see our heroine in action, we're satisfied, whether she's causing misery to her opponents from her twin handguns, double Kukri knives or just her incredibly toned limbs, we're rooting for her all the way, dressed in garb personally designed by Juvovich herself, which provides for both form and functionality. The trend of casting pretty women to pair with her continues, with the first movie having Michelle Rodriguez, the second with Guillory, and now, Heroes' Ali Larter and Spencer Locke join the fray. However, they are relegated to more pedestrian roles as compared to previous partners, so don't be expecting much from them, especially for fans of Larter.The story can be no more simpler than Alice serving as a messiah for a small convoy of survivors headed by Larter's Claire, delivering them a message to journey to the promised land in Alaska. But of course the road to Peace and No Infection is plagued by challenges which culminates in a big battle in Las Vegas, where the trailers have teased with the entire city being semi-buried in sand. And like a video game, all levels will lead to their respective Big Boss to do battle with, and Extinction doesn't evade that formula too. Watching Alice grow in power, provides a lot of kick in some of the cool things she can do, enhanced with special effects of course.Don't expect the franchise to slam the door of opportunity shut on itself. By the look of things, we might even see a fourth movie coming up in perhaps two or three years time (the interval between the movies thus far). Expect plenty of blood and gore as our heroes cut through ugly zombies like hot knife through butter, and none other does it more balletic and graceful than Milla Juvovich. You go, girl!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lot better then i expected!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the second movie i was ready for this one to be cheap and boring... But this film totally proved me wrong. It contains The plot and suspense the first film had and the action the second film had. Perfect combo! The story is beyond amazing, Very creepy in a way yet totally awesome for the people in the theater watching it all play out. An apocalyptic world with few human survivors banding together, fighting, traveling etc. to try to find a place of safety from the infection and all the dangers that come with it. I'm guessing if your on this page you have read the plot so Anyways back to the review. The film was a pleasant surprise... though there was one setback, There wasn't much time for any info or background on important members of the convoy, all you know is they are there... Your not really given time to hear a little out each one and kind of get each one to have there own amount of screen time due to the lack of time the film was working with, I mean come on... Why not make it 2 hours and add a little more in? Anyways besides that i thought the movie was a blast to watch and i am definitely going back to the theater sometime this weekend to see it again...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil: Jumping the Shark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The increasingly tired premise of a zombie-producing virus has been around for some years, having replaced the seductive living dead mystery of prior generations. I don't expect much of horror films, but I expect more than this. RE:E is just silly.The cast is all here: evil corporation, out-of-control scientist, hapless minions who get locked in with the experiments gone wrong, multicultural gang of human fugitives strangely dressed in skimpy clothing and carrying military grade technology, etc. The story is advanced, but only in the direction of absurdity. Alice is still alive, but this time it would appear she's an android not only with superhuman agility and strength, but also with the ability to shut down satellites in space using her mind. She's always been one. And if that wasn't enough, she's also psychic--with the ability to generate force fields around herself and her friends. Most of the zombies look alike this time, strangely clothed in identical gray jumpsuits. You can now kill them by cutting their throats, shooting them in the abdomen, or dropping them off short buildings.A few dozen overly loud bangs, crashes, and gunfights later and we get a showdown between Alice and the mutated evil doctor, carried out in a bad paste of unconnected rooms from previous films.Close on a scene with the greedy corporate suits getting a holographic warning of their impending doom from a snippy Alice, and you have a film designed to sell wholly on the game's reputation and not because it's sincerely engaging, scary, or even interesting.PS: here's an idea for a drinking game. Every time Milla Jovovich is on screen and her face has been digitally altered to look smoother than it actually is, that's a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A BIG disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see how anyone could compare RE: Extinction with the first two in this series. In addition to a lack of plot altogether, there are more holes in RE:3 than a golf course and more ripoffs of other movies than I've ever seen. The characters are so undeveloped that most shouldn't even have come equipped with names. Both Olivera and LJ, who were the two leading males in the 2nd movie, are without energy and lack inspiration. The vehicles were outright ripoffs from Road Warrior, especially in the desert setting. In fact, you really get the idea pretty quickly that this movie is set in a desert to save money, whereas the first two movies obviously were pretty expensive in the setting department. Umbrella's board of directors, who meet several times in the flick in an underground bunker, appear to be of the under thirty variety; perhaps they are the descendants of the former management. The bunker is a shameless ripoff of Day of the Dead. The zombie scenes are actually very limited, with few traditional up close yet slow battle scenes. Mostly the zombies in RE:3 jump out of closets with ferocious speed and bite somebody. There are running zombies in this movie, which do not fit the sequence at all.In general, this was a very poor finale to a good series.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserving and Disturbing Sequel but NOT the Conclusion of a Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We saw this at our local hometown theater, Movies on the Parkway in Sevierville, TN. I have to start this by saying that this installment is a bit reminiscent of George A. Romero's 1985 cult classic, "Day of the Dead," in one major plot element. I won't give it away, but if you're a Romero fan, you'll see it for yourself when you view this film.This work is wholly entertaining, whether you are a fan of the games, or not. There are new elements, old friends, and a plethora of great innovations - some of which I've never seen present anywhere, and a few which were reminders of former masterpieces. I would name them, but to do that would spoil these innovations for those of you who have yet to experience them.The acting, direction, and quality were above par, while the style was more that of the action flick with horror elements. The predecessors were horror movies with great action. The suspense, the intrigue, the atmosphere were all horror-oriented. This time, the horror elements were minimized and the action reigned. This is not a bad thing, fans. Without some change like this, the franchise will suffer franchise sickness! As it stands, there is no danger of that happening.All in all? We were totally entertained, enjoyed our movie experience, and were blown away by the wrap-up. See it for yourself to understand what I mean.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my goodness i haven't reviewed a movie in so long on here but after seeing Resident Evil: Extinction and knowing fanboys are gonna give it a bad score i was compelled to completely gush about how completely awesome this third installment was. To recap my opinion i thought the first film was really cool some little thrills, some neat special effects, but Alice was just so cool, i fall in love with bad@$$ heroines like that character with the exception of Halle Berry's Catwoman for obvious reasons lol. The second film only furthered my adrenaline rush with Milla doing all kinds of crazy stunts and that film felt closer to the games also made nemesis look amazing thank god they didn't use CGI. The third movie takes place in the Nevada desert.. well for the most part anyways Alice and a core few of the survivors unfortunately not including Jill *cries* are scrounging the world trying to survive and find food, gas, supplies etc without being eaten by the massive army of zombies that surrounds pretty much the whole world. Milla is amazing once again but this time she takes the reigns from Sigorney Weaver because this time Alice is no sex symbol she's an angry woman on a nonstop rampage not afraid to kill and think twice. The action in this movie is so amazing the change of directors really helped get away from the choppy hand to hand fights in Apocalypse plus this is the director of Highlander here mister Russel Mulchy is no stranger to great action films. There's a lot more scares in this one and a lot more gore and grizzly murder creating entertaining mayhem on the big screen. I love truly epic films like Alfred Hitchcocks work, The Departed, and Requiem For A Dream but i go to the theater to be massively entertained by more than just my bucket of popcorn and Resident Evil: Extinction keeps your eyes on the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie defines the term Epic Fail. If you are a fan of the games or zombie lore at all, you will walk away wondering how anybody let this travesty run amok so badly. While there were plenty of scares (cheap startles and loud noises), this movie fails to deliver on every other level.****Possible Spoilers***FOR THE GAMERS: Just because there is some guy with sunglasses and slicked hair, do not actually expect any actual representation of Wesker. Additionally, red-hair and a gun do not turn Ali Larter into Claire Redfield. These were simply manufactured (forced may be a better word) elements to keep the fans happy, but after doing such a great job with Jill, S.T.A.R.S, Nemesis and Carlos in RE2, this was pretty insulting. Also, wasn't RE about skill and willpower in the face of nightmarish odds and monsters? Meh...who needs shotguns when you can use your "magic" powers? I never minded Alice being super strong and such (it is the t-virus after all), but when did Invisible girl/Jean Grey fit in?FOR THE ZOMBIE FANS: I don't even know where to begin. It would seem that slashing a zombies throat is just as good as shooting it in the head (and Alice is even carrying the finest chopping blade in history). The prop crew must have gotten a great deal om zombie masks in bulk, because most of the "Umbrella soldier zombies" are identical looking to me (and who thought putting them in uniforms made any sense at all). There is also a main character (LJ) who gets bitten, and despite battling zombies for the last few years, decides to conceal it from his allies. Can you guess what happens next? If you are looking for good combat against hordes of undead, you are not getting any here. The clichés are stale, and the tactics from the heroes are unimaginative. Despite shots that had throngs of the undead, most fights are against 2-3, not hundreds. As others have stated, this movie is a poor remake of "Day of the Dead" with better effects and Alice tossed in.FOR THOSE WITH ANY STANDARDS IN ACTION MOVIES: Why is LJ still carrying that ridiculous GOLD desert eagle? Why, in a gun fighting movie, would they not have competent tactical advisors? Clearly, someone showed the stars of RE1&amp;2 how to move and fight with a gun, but I guess that detail was deemed unimportant this time (even though I thought everyone except Carlos looked very...awkward in their scenes). Further more, and this is just me, the yellow Hummer2 from a NAIL SALON was the lamest and most pathetic product placement I have ever scene. Kinda ironic to use a such a trendy and gas guzzling truck in the back drop of a global warming message.I could go on, but I think the point is made. I'll let you go see this movie yourself, so you can discover all the other atrocities that this movie commits on the unsuspecting viewer. It is a shame this movie was poorly done, because I really enjoyed the first two. It may have tried to achieve too much, and ended up falling short everywhere because of it. It was nice to see Johnny Cage though...I guess Anderson threw him a pity role. I liked him in Mortal Kombat and Wyatt Earp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Follow-Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am happy to say that Resident Evil: Extinction was a great entry into the franchise. Being a fan of the games since their original inception, I was very skeptical seeing the series turned into a movie, as the trend for video game movies is to be completely terrible. I didn't hate the first two movies, but I definitely left the theater disappointed. The first film tried to invent an original story line revolving around similar events which didn't work that well because it just felt like the connections to the game were tacked on. Apocalypse delivered on the fan service by adding characters Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera, and tying in the movie to the third game in the series. And now with Extinction, Resident Evil has finally found a good balance. With characters from the games making appearances, nice comedic moments, and a gritty style of action I was not disappointed in the slightest bit. I also feel like with the third film in the series, it could finally open up into a more mainstream audience. The characters from the game give nice feelings of nostalgia for those that have been playing for a while, but their stories from the games are not necessary for any one coming to see this movie without any prior knowledge of the game series. My only two complaints with this film is that it doesn't over view the last two films (which doesn't bother me, but I can see how it would for any one who is just coming to see the movie without seeing the others. Although, it might spark their interest to check out one and two), and the film ends on a cliffhanger. With Milla Jovovich stating that the film is written as a trilogy, it makes me wonder whether or not there will be another entry. Overall I couldn't recommend this movie more for some one who is looking for an enjoyable time at the theatre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post-Apocalyptic fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing that's for sure is that the "evil" of the title is becoming less and less "residential." This time around the nasty T-virus has spread all over the whole world and humanity is in grave danger. I guess that's where the "extinction" part comes in.Once again we find ourselves not too long after the previous film left off. Humanity is in shambles and "Extinction" plays itself like a post-apocalyptic thriller, no pun intended. Alice is evading the evil Umbrella Corporation who needs to conclude some experiments but they can only do it with her blood and clones don't work. While wandering the desert Alice finds out she has mental powers, meets a group of survivors, and happens to be tracked by Umbrella all within what must be one hour. I guess it's not her lucky day. The audience however, providing you're fans of stylized carnage, is in for a little treat. "Extinction" not only provides a more interesting plot than the previous film, it also provides much better action and special effects. These effects feature zombies (naturally) but also demonic crows and a nasty mutation at the end. The action scenes are nicely done with somewhat unpredictable approach to who gets munched and who doesn't so tension is there throughout.There are also many absurdities, but they can only be expected in a film like this. For instance, the film is set in a desolate world with supposedly little supplies yet the women look like they put on make up every morning and regularly get a manicure. The GOOD women that is. Alice meets some BAD people in the beginning and these people somehow haven't picked up any of those bathroom supplies and make up kits that are laying around. Those bad people are another thing, they appear in an early scene that demonstrates that Alice can fight and kick ass... seeing that this is the third movie in the series do they really need to make this point again? If they avoided it, then the climatic fight might have been longer and a bit more, you know, climatic. But I guess that wasn't the point of that fight since right after it we are set up for Resident Evil 4."Extinction" is enjoyable for what it is, but that's it. --- 6/10Rated R for violence/gore and horror. Ages 13+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie disgraces the name of Resident Evil. In all honestly, all three movies disgrace the name of Resident Evil...But at least the first two were entertaining. The characters from the games barely make appearances compared to Alice (Whom they created for the movies. I feel that was a completely stupid idea.) Alice has some idiotic telekinesis powers in this movie. Why add magic tricks to a zombie franchise? They changed the storyline around, killing off key characters (such as Carlos) and turning it into an almost new story, basically turning the characters from the games into completely new people. They never mentioned what happened to Jill...or Leon or Chris or Rebecca Chambers for that matter. If you are going to see this movie because you are a hard core fan of the game since the mid nineties when resident evil first came out...(as I did), I recommend not going to see this. It will only upset you. I give this movie 2 instead of one star, because there were a few pretty good action scenes. Again...what a horrible let down...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Completely worthless plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What made the resident evil series interesting is that it is the thinking man's zombie movie. It offered a typical sci-fi plot but it kept things based around certain rules, threw in some twists, and maintained at least reasonable premises.This movie strays from having any remotely rational plot and feels no need to offer explanations when it does. As a result it is a huge disappointment if you slow up looking for anything more than hacking up zombies for 94 minutes.(SPOILER ALERT) Here are just a few of the needlessly ridiculous premises you are asked to just accept without any further explanation...1. T-virus has spread and essentially wiped out humanity. Surprisingly, this caused all plant life to die and the earth turned into a desert. Take that greenpeace! 2. Alice is now a jedi and can use the force to move rocks, bikes, and flaming gasoline at will.3. Zombies are incapable of climbing the 8 foot chain link fence surrounding Umbrella headquarters, but can easily scale the Eifel Tower and with surprising stealth.4. Olivera shoots a zombie which is clearly munching on LJ but thinks nothing of it. The entire group has apparently adopted a don't ask, don't tell policy regarding infection.5. Zombies have been functioning without any actual need of food or water (according to doctors) and will continue to for, and I quote, "DECADES." No further explanation given.6. Too much T-virus antidote turns you into an octopus.7. After reading an incoherent diary in Utah, the group decides to drive to Alaska, but opts to gas up in....LAS VEGAS! (damn these Umbrella maps) Umbrella anticipates this move and has an ambush waiting at the exact casino they stop at.8. Umbrella installed an on/off switch in Alice and cameras in her eyes but apparently did not find those things useful in tracking her the past 7 years or in confirming her identity when they spot her via satellite. Either that or Alice has no bars in rural Utah.9. Umbrella is cloning Alice and finds the best way to extract her blood is through repeated unnecessary and exotic deaths. Unfortunately cloned blood isn't as 'magic' as regular blood and they only end up piling up Alice corpses in the back yard like lawn clippings.10. Umbrella is developing a nation of domesticated zombies for use as Walmart photographers.11. Umbrella is developing an army of extra angry zombies and goes to the trouble of putting them in matching uniforms.12. In the event that society falls, mormon hillbillies will opt to lure innocent people into their lairs to feed their zombie dogs. Remember that then next time a missionary stops by your house.13. Eating infected meat causes crows to get infected...but not really. It also causes them to go blind...but not really.14. Zombies rule the earth and Umbrella is essentially trapped underground but the primary challenge the company is facing is the shortage of cheap labor.15. Food, water and fuel are almost gone, humanity is vanished, zombies are everywhere but the primary challenge facing survivors is...Umbrella Corp.</fullReview>

But here goes my review: From beginning to end, this movie just really makes it as a hypnotically entertaining science fiction suspense/action film. Directing, acting, special effects, plot, all came together into a well executed cinematic creation. I was glued to the screen and even jumping out of my seat as surprises awaited every turn. I found no dull moments as each scene was entertaining in its own way. I would give this a higher rating, but found myself holding back because I generally do not like this genre of film. 8 would then be my highest rating for this genre.

I think I need to wash it out of my system with 3:10 to Yuma, or maybe eastern promises. i can't decide what is worse: the quality of this film, or the fact that they're making more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) will hopefully extinguish any plans for a 4th installment. The thin plot is held together by banal dialogue and cookie cutter gore that has become standard fare at the box office. Overall, very unimpressive and unoriginal. It is just another zombie movie except is has nothing scary or exciting to mitigate its lack of anything else. And most of the audience will walk out like zombies after about 2 hours of mind-numbing twaddle culminating in one of the most ho-hum endings in the annals of cinematic history. My recommendation: Avoid this grotesquely boring movie. It is really bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all movies made of video game franchises, Resident Evil is by it's own right a fairly entertaining series of films. The games have always been a standout amongst others, so why shouldn't the film adaptations.Extinction is by far the best of the three. Mulcahy was the right choice of director for this one. His atmospheric eye and fearless sense of close-ups take you for a 1 1/2 hour ride (that doesn't feel like you wasted your 8 bucks).The attention to detail and finally plot that that resolutes, not to mention the film's tight editing make this an entertaining ride.You finally care about why this event has happened, and most importantly you have characters who seem to care as well.Not a perfect film, but reasonably close. Will there be a fourth installment? I am pretty sure we all know the answer to that.Who will take the responsibility from here? That we must wait to see...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing (spoiler)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to the movies expecting an awesome movie. I am a huge Resident Evil fan and to tell the truth, this movie left me leaving the theaters shaking my head. The previous two movies were better than this movie.It seems like everyone dies in this movie, of course the black guy has to die too...what's up with that. Carlos dies too... Lame, he couldn't have died some other way, he had to go and get bitten so he ends up just sacrificing himself.Claire Redfield... Her role in the movie was nothing like the game (at least in the last movie you knew that Jill was with S.T.A.R.S.) you might as well name Claire Lucy Ricardo because her name was just a name. She had nothing to do with the games or anything; her role didn't mention anything about her looking for her brother Chris, or the fact that she even had a brother.Claire acts like such a bad ass and she reminds me of Sarah Conner from Terminator 2. Claire, a leader of this group she organized? It also seems like she has had some military training or something by the way she acts and also the fact that she can fly a helicopter! There were no Lickers in this movie, c'mon, Lickers are so awesome! And what the hell happened to Jill Valentine? She was such a bad ass in the 2nd film and now? Poof! Doesn't exist! Never happened.Leon? Omg! He wasn't even in the movie or mentioned.And to just throw in Wesker!?!? What the hells with that? He's like the leader of Umbrella or something, but like I said about Claire, wesker seems just like another name or person. He has no back story or anything.This movie totally blowed! A nd then Claire and the rest of the survivors must make it to Alaska because supposedly there is no infection there.But what happens to Claire at the end of the movie? The movie just ends with all these open questions! Did they ever make it to Alaska? Was is true that there was no infection there? My god this movie made me upset.What else, Clones!? Oh my goodness! Clones! Man! Alice has all these clones that are apparently going to go after umbrella at the end of the movie and shut them down.It was ridiculous that the ending battle between Alice and the Tyrant ended the way it did. It ended with Alice's clone saving her! Man that was totally lame.Also! Oh! I can't forget this, Alice, what is she? A mutant from X-men? She freaking had all these powers to generate force fields to protect herself.My god I thought that was so lame when they showed a scene of her having a nightmare and he body starts generating all this power and then all these things around her start to levitate! Once I saw that, I felt like walking out of the theater.This movie feels like it just went off in some totally different direction leaving me feeling like a little kid who just got his balloon popped by a big fat guy...In other words, this movie was sad I am sorry to say.Well, hopefully Resident Evil 5 for xbox 360 doesn't blow!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In every movie masterpiece there is that one scene or factor that grabs the audience and pulls it in, trapping it for the duration of the film. Sometimes it is an action sequence, sometimes a drama sequence, other times love or just odd. RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION does NOT have that scene. The only way this movie manages to keep your interest is to have you on the edge of your sit waiting for that scene to come, waiting to finally be pulled into the movie.This movie was mediocre at best. None of the characters, including Alice were developed at all. So much lack of development was there that I didn't care for any of the convoy people at all. That's a shame cause they had real potential with the Alice romance.I wish the directors would not have changed. This director tries to be a great cinema director, with great scenes but just serves to show that Milla does have blemishes on her face when the camera is a millimeter away from it.THE FOLLOWING COMMENT IS A SPOILER. DON'T READ IT IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE SPOILED.In what I have to deem one of the dumbest and most far fetched moments in comic/ vigilante/zombie/video game movies a Fourth movie is left open for in which an army of fighting Alice will destroy the umbrella corporation. AN ARMY OF FIGHTING ALICE. HUNDREDS OF THEM. What in gods name? Come on I know that in a video game that would look cool, but it has already been proved that if you have hundreds of the same person, i.e. the agent in the matrix movies it just looks corny and stupid. This movie proves that Hollywood is beginning to make movies that will appeal to the ignorance out there. The people that don't have enough sense to understand good movies. This coupled with Superbad proves what our parents have feared for years.It is you people who watch these movies and go, "Wow that was good," that will be responsible for the destruction of not this country but the world when you take charge. You don't even have enough common sense to understand the smarter things in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK...The plot - which is "kinda" important if the movie is to succeed - of this movie, I must admit, is an utter failure. If you're a serious movie fan, don't bother to watch this. This movie has NO plot whatsoever; it's only made of pointless action scene and OMG zombies.The parts of the plot (you know, stuff we learned from school - rising action, climax, resolution, etc - you get it) do exist, however, they are very, very poorly presented to say the least.The turning points are there, say, the scene in which Carlos sacrifices himself. Is that supposed to be sad or something? It didn't do squat. It wasn't convincing enough that it was any important part of the plot. He just drives in and, boom, he dies. Wow, how very heart warming. Yeah, whatever.Fine, the action scenes and graphics are good - but now it's just like watching god-darn flash animations, e.g. Madness series. If one wanted to see blood spilling everywhere and people dying pointlessly, just go watch the blasted flash clips you can find online for free.What the heck.I want 95 minutes of my life back.</fullReview>

The scenario is completely out of line (Alice with X-men powers) I mean why couldn't they just go with the original idea of the games. The special effects are either too dark, too close, too fast, or too short... They just zoom until u can see the bacterias on the skin of a character and then something jumps to the screen, come on... Or what about the big questions left by the second movie? Nothing is clearer than before... I mean, the first two movies are bad but this one takes the cut. Congratulations Hollywood, you just destroyed a masterpiece...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was a huge disappointment for both my friends and myself. First it completely departs from the game, they just throw in names from the game and no story line actually occurs. Second the continuity errors are so prevalent, the point in the movie where the rage zombies come out, the survivors killed like 30 of them and more were just spilling out, how many were stuffed in there plus they were able to climb and kill chase and a few survivors? When in the hell did zombies gain the abilitiy to climb? That was also a huge 'wtf'. Also, Alice and her "psychic abilities" is just silly and completely retarded. Now she can manipulate fire and levitate cars and rocks? What is this XMen? You can't get a bigger zombie genre fan other than myself and am a huge fan of the RE series, but this was just a giant letdown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Third spectacular and stirring installment of the ¨Resident Evil trilogy¨</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The deadly virus has decimated the world, exception a little zone in Alaska where live people no-infected . Years later , one time Racoon was destroyed , the Umbrella corporation led by ambitious Dr. Isaacs(Iain Glen) continues his weird experiments with the deadly T-virus. But the Zombies spread the epidemic and those exposed to cruel bite suffer a complete transformation turning into meat-eating sickos. Alice(Milla Jovovich)is attempting to survive , and she finds new survivors(Ali Larter, Ashanti along with Oded Fehr and Mike Epps who repeat characters) traveling throughout Nevada desert . They must confront carnivorous crows, hordes of zombies starving of human flesh and an evil corporation chief who creates the most horrifying creatures ever made .The survivor group are surrounded , facing the world destruction by deadly epidemic.This exciting picture contains thrills, chills, action-filled with fierce combats and lots of gore and guts.The horror and action moments are fast moving and compactly realized. The film turns out to be a crossover between 'the nuclear apocalypse of Mad Max 2', the 'George A Romero's Zombies' and genetic experiments from 'Sigourney Wever-Ripley in Alien saga '. Of course, the film takes ideas from former parts as 'Resident evil'(2002, Paul W. Anderson, here also producer and screenwriter) and 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'(2004,Alexander Witt)resulting to be a nice following. The creepy images of wide range from the genuinely fantastic to the bizarre along with an eerie and amazing frames. It's predictable but we have seen the previous chapters but also its predictability is redeemed in part by the charismatic acting from the action-women, Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter. The flesh-eating mutants appearance deliver the goods, plenty of screams, shocks and tension. The make-up assistants create a truly horrible zombie cannibals. Horrifying and astonishing images about apocalyptic events with deserted and destroyed cities, such as the creepy scenarios in Las Vegas without people, totally uninhabited and covered of sand. Cool,luminous cinematography using steadicam by David Johnson and haunting musical score by Charles Clouser.The motion picture is surprisingly directed with startling visual style by Russell Mulcahy(Razorback,Highlander, Resurrection).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Transcript of a pitch meeting between Paul W. S. Anderson and Screen Gems studio suits. In the interest of not being sued, all dialog but Anderson's has been removed."So here's a pitch for a new movie I want to make. First off, it's set in a post-apocalyptic desert, like "The Road Warrior". Oh yeah, I loved that movie. I gotta use that tractor trailer rig with the fuel tank in it sometime. I always wanted that thing to explode at the end, instead of being filled with sand. I'll fix that in my movie! Anyway, Sarah Connor, you know, from "T1" and "T2", leads a group of expendables around. Hey, remember when she said, at the end of the first one, "There's a storm coming"? I'll drop that line into my movie, just to show the fan-boys I like the same movies they do. Hey, did you ever see "The Birds"? I did. Man, was that creepy! I got it! The rag tag fugitives are attacked by birds at some point! I'll figure out why later. Maybe they're robot birds or something?Let's see? these survivors are looking for a safe refuge. How about some place far away from the desert, someplace isolated, so they're safe from the cyborgs. An island? No, that's too much like the remake of "Dawn of the Dead". And "Damnation Alley" had them going to, like New Jersey or something. Hmmm... how about Alaska? Yeah, that's it! They're going to Alaska.Hey, did you ever see "Planet of the Apes"? Not the remake, but the original. I did, and that scene with the Statue of Liberty really stuck with me? hey, they're in Vegas! New York New York Casino has a statue like that! I'll do an homage!So anyway, speaking of "Dawn of the Dead", I like zombie movies. I've done video game movies and horror movies and sequels and stuff, but not a straight up zombie movie. Did you ever see "Day of the Dead"? The one where the scientists are underground, trying to work on the zombies to see if they can cure them or control them? It was cool.Speaking of movies I saw, did you ever see John Carpenter's remake of "The Thing"? Man, that was one batsh*t scary movie! I love that part where the floorboards are being torn up form underneath as some kind of monster comes after Kurt Russell? I could use that bit. Oh, and the creepy dark lab, where stuff runs past the camera in the foreground? Classic Carpenter bit. I'll borrow that, too.Hey, did you ever see "Re-Animator" or "From Beyond"? Some good horror creatures in those films. I ought to introduce poor Johnny-come-lately horror fans to the monsters from those movies.What do you mean, you don't want me to make this movie? Are you nuts? It's a sure fire thing!"Resident Evil 3"? Yeah, I did the first two, but I'm done with those. I don't want to do that one. I want to make this big budget tribute movie to everything cool I ever saw growing up, the one I just told you about!Hey, I think we may have a 'You've got your peanut butter in my chocolate' moment here, guys? but can I direct this one? No? What do you mean, Russell Mulcahy! That guy may have done the original "Highlander", which was actually very cool, but he hasn't directed much of anything of note since then?Fine, just pay me and I'll have a script for you in two days."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction continues a great series of Resident Evil films and I still can not believe how much I am enjoying this movie franchise that on the surface I would have assumed I would just hate like most films of this type. It just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. The third movie takes place in the Nevada desert, for most of the movie anyway. Alice and a few other survivors are driving around the continent just scrounging for fuel, water and food, basically they are just trying to survive. Milla Jovovich is amazing in this movie with some of the best stunts of the series, she is just a rampaging force going up against the entire zombie army. Well maybe not zombies but whatever you want to call them. This movie is scarier than the other RE movies and there is a lot more blood and gore.Anyway this is a hugely entertaining action/sci-fi/thriller/horror movie, however you want to categorize it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love this series. I love some of these movies more than the others, and for different reasons. I won't go into those reasons, I'm just glad I can talk about another Resident Evil movie.I will tell you that I am happy that Milla Yovovich is back in this third Resident Evil movie. In this movie though we see multiple Alices, as Umbrella has cloned Alice in an attempt to figure out why the T-Virus reacts the way it does in Alice. Unfortunately for Umbrella without the real Alice, they can't complete their research.Joining Milla Yovovich is Ali Larter as Claire Renfield, returning is Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera, and joining the cast is Spencer Locke as K- Mart. The story line is pretty good in this Resident Evil. Paul W.S. Anderson did a very good job creating a story line that catches and keeps the viewers attention; only a little absurd toward the end when we get to Dr. Isaacs becoming a mutant.My favorite scenes begin with when Alice joins Claire Redfield's convoy, about 10 minutes or so into the movie. The convoy has stopped at an abandoned motel for the night. When they wake in the morning it is to find a couple hundred crows all over the camp site. At one point K-Mart notices the eyes of a crow and asks about them. Claire replies that the birds have been eating infected flesh; crows being carrion birds. However, the best part of this scene is that the crows start attacking the different vehicles and are successful in many respects as they kill several characters. But it is when Carlos runs the protect a young girl from the crows and then a flame thrower that Alice joins in the fight. Alice stops the flames from reaching Carlos and then turns the fire against the crows, killing them all.I loved the scene closer to the beginning of the movie where Alice goes to an abandoned radio station. Alice gets ambushed by what appears to be a family of degenerates. One of the men attempts to prove how much of a man he is by attempting to rape Alice. Unfortunately for the man, Alice kicks him in the face and kills him. One of the other members of the family knocks Alice out. Alice wakes in a pit, and realizes that there are some infected dogs. Alice avoids the dogs and uses some electrical cables to tie them to a support post holding up the floor the family are on watching the events below. The dogs are pulling so hard that they pull the post down causing the floor to come crashing down. The family are deposited for fodder for the dogs, and Alice escapes.My next favorite scene is the fight scene between Alice and Dr. Isaacs, or I should say the mutated Dr. Isaacs. Everything that Alice does to try to kill Isaacs is a futile attempt because Isaacs can heal himself. However, Alice and Isaacs make it to the corridor with the lasers where Alice attempts to sacrifice herself in order to kill Isaacs. Killing Isaacs is successful, but an Alice clone saves Alice by turning off the lasers.A bonus scene I liked was when the different department heads are "meeting" with Albert Wesker to discuss the different items going on around Umbrella, especially in North America with Dr. Isaacs. After deciding to writing off the North American facility and deciding to transfer all data to China, Alice crashes the meeting (holographically) and warns everyone that she is going to hunt them all down. When she leaves the meeting, the camera pulls back and you see how many clones of Alice Umbrella has made.I give this 10 out of 10 stars. The story is great, especially depicting Las Vegas being reclaimed by the desert. The fight scenes are more elaborate. Milla Yovovich teaming with Ali Larter in this movie just increases the eye candy; it doesn't hurt to have Spencer Locke either. And for the ladies, you have Oded Fehr and a few others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the plot (the filmmakers did) this is worth seeing for the action and monster sequences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Survivors of the virus that has ravaged the world, turning the dead into zombies and the world into a vast wasteland, have learned to keep moving least the zombies find them. Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, zombie killer number one.After some lone wanderings in the Desert she hooks up with a band of travelers and looks to stop the evil Umbrella corporation once and for all. Not as good as the last film but better than the first one. I don't think that the film's plot makes a whole heck of a lot of sense, which is fine since the numerous action set pieces are so tightly wound you can pretty much forgive the poor plotting. I mean the last time I checked people tended to watch these films for the blood, the gore and the monster killing. Upping the ante with some killer crows and some beast which shall remain nameless this film just moves like the wind with in each extended action sequence (Forget Hitchcock's birds these things are lethal). Each scene of violence left me exhausted and willing to deal with the non exposition of the main plot(okay its stupid I admit it). Worth a look for horror and action fans, though I'm not sure its really worth 10 bucks to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 6.2 rating is ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Anderson needs to be stopped. These movies have gotten out of hand, and are getting worse with each one.The first "Resident Evil" was a good movie. It could be approached as a sequel to the game series, and really had an eerie video-game vibe. "Apocalypse" could have been so good, following "Resident Evil: Nemesis", but Paul Anderson completely screwed it up.Resident Evil: Extinction is awful. Milla Jovovich is getting horribly tired and the "badass superhero chick" thing is so cliché and stupid it makes you roll your eyes.It takes place mostly in a desert, as the survivors of the T-Virus head to Alaska, for some stupid reasons, and in the process FIGHT ZOMBIES! Nothing too intelligent for the audience here. The "gore" is upped a bit, but it's still extremely tame and only somebody who hasn't been exposed to real violence would be disturbed by it.The film easily could have been called something else, as it has NOTHING to do with Resident Evil at all, except for character NAMES, Umbrella Corp. and the T-Virus. Claire Redfield makes her first appearance on film, played by...Ali Larter? Yes, a bad actress who doesn't come close at all to resembling the Claire from the RE games. Blonde hair, badass attitude, stupid dialogue, everything that Claire was not. Wesker also makes an appearance, for about 2 minutes, once again ONLY carrying the name Albert Wesker, not resembling the character whatsoever.There are numerous pointless and drug out scenes, an example being the scene at the beginning where **Minor spoilers** a gang of inbred rednecks attack Alice and force to fight some creatures or something?? Stupid, unneeded scene, only there to show how freakin' badass Alice can be.Paul A. only used the RE name to cash in on his cheap, straight-to-DVD scripts and obviously it's working. I don't know how in the hell this pile of crap gets anything over a 5.0 rating, as it's barely an average movie. The only reason I give it a 4 is because Oded Fehr is great, and seeing the Tyrant, if only for a while and to have him horribly, lazily killed off, on film was a treat.Watch out for the awful, eye-rolling inducing ending to this junk. Reall, only see this if you're just following the series. If you're a TRUE Resident Evil fan, avoid this at all costs..Resident Evil: Extinction gets a generous 4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I am so glad I didn't see this in theaters and watched it on DVD at home instead.This movie was so poor I could nearly predict what a character was going to say before they said it, and when they said it it was straight out of another film. Additionally, every scene in the movie is a scene I swear I've seen somewhere else before, or I knew exactly what was going to happen (although there are some unpredictable demises). The writers in this movie are the absolute worst writers I have ever seen in the industry, period, and they make more money than me- unbelievable. There was zero plot development, maybe even negative plot development, because every character you get introduced to is quickly reduced to a cardboard cutout. The two characters you expect to see a lot of- Claire and K-Mart have one line of character development/ introduction each. I feel like I know that guy in the Ziploc commercial better. When I thought this movie was going to redeem itself with an ending (Alice going underground), it just unraveled at the seams with the worst climactic ending ever filmed. When I realized it was the end, and that was the grand finale, I just stared at my screen in disbelief and shock. Even as I write this I cannot believe an end sequence that lame is even possible.There are some positives- one of the action scenes is actually done pretty well, showing Milla Jovovich at her best, and well, that's about it. Oh yeah, Milla Jovovich doesn't wear a bra underneath her paper-thin tank top. That's a plus.Please, don't see this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What's wrong with you people? You currently have this movie rated higher than both previous installments of the series. I've done what I can to right things by awarding it one more star than it deserves (even though I know it won't make a dent). I would definitely rank Extinction last in the series thus far with Apocalypse by far the best. You guys have Apocalypse ranked LAST in the series! LAST! It was infinitely better than this tripe. It was better than the first one.Okay, I've checked the spoiler box (the irony was well noted) so here goes: I was intrigued by the opening (remake?) sequence, but began to worry as the camera swept over the ditch full of Alices. How well preserved they were. Wouldn't Umbrella like, dig a hole and cover them up or burn them or something? You're not supposed to be thinking about things like this when you're watching a movie. You should be taken along for a ride...not questioning the production values of the producers, the intelligence of the writers or the competence of the director. I did all that throughout this film.I'll be honest, I love Milla. I'm probably not alone here. I love the games, too, but for me Milla looking great and kicking ass has been a huge draw with this series. Am I alone here? So, yeah we get this short (remake?) glimpse of our muse el buffo and then briefly in that skimpy red dress that we know and love (but really, we've seen this) but for the rest of the film she's decked out in thirty pounds of designer spaghetti western garb. HUH? Let's take this ultra hot bona-fide action heroine and cover up every inch of her glorious body except her airbrushed face. Who's idea was that? Which brings me to the subject of Jill Valentine. It's been discussed at length on these pages and pointed out repeatedly that her absence could have been easily explained with a few lines of dialogue. Don't the fans DESERVE at least that much. I say NO! This particular fan felt he had the right to expect no less than Sienna Guillory to reprise her fantastic portrayal and her very embodiment of the character Jill Valentine. Lucky for Ms. Guillory, ultimately, that she had no part of this mess.So anyway, there's this loooooonnngg boooorrriinngg stretch where they're in the desert and I started getting drunk, but I remember hoping and believing so hard that the movie would get better....that IT DID! Finally, at the end, I think. But it wasn't enough to erase the horrible memories of what these sadistic filmmakers had previously dragged me through. At least it was over, though.And it could've been worse. I could have bought this DVD (I own copies of the first two RE films on DVD). But I didn't buy this one, I rented it. AND I took it back the next morning earning me a $1 credit to my account. So I guess Sienna Guillory and I both came out on top here.And those CGI crows were just lame.KA 1/3/2008</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only The Original Is Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This one is close to being as good as the original. It moves very quickly with almost no slow boring parts. It opens with a great demonstration why helping people can often be a perilous undertaking. See what the mantra,"No good deed goes unpunished," means when Alice stops to help people at a radio station. What I loved about this one is there are many pop out 'scare the living crap out of you' moments. Often, in scenes that seem placid, like the lab, get ready to choke on your food. 'The domestication project' is another good source of scares as Dr. Isaacs comes up with the brilliant idea that he can tame the killer zombies. It doesn't go well, the zombies are not quite ready for class. Alice has 'super' powers due to the virus which adds realism to her usual killing skills. The effects are quite well done with the crow scene being the trademark image of this installment. I found this one, set in the desert, to be the most intense of all of them. The original featured a better all around cast but this one has plenty of creeping about in dark places with lots of flesh eating weirdos popping out on you. The movie follows Dr. Isaacs trying to recapture Project Alice because he is disappointed in his clones which are always slaughtered trying to run his obstacle course.This features one of the best finales as Dr. Isaacs gets bitten and begins turning into a freaky hybrid of some kind. The last part of the movie is almost all in the dark of the lab basement. Alice needs her extra powers to fight this thing, believe me. This is why this works so well, her powers give her more believability fighting hordes of undead as well as Dr. Isaacs who has a real problem with his hand. There is the beginning of the quest for Arcadia which continues on into Afterlife and Retribution. For me, it is so fast moving, intense and scary that I forgave it occasional acting flaws. Hey, this is an action movie, I turn all of my philosophy off when I review these. Readers want to know two basic questions from me: Did it scare me and Is it boring? Yes, there are moments, when you least expect it, when you need to have a firm grip upon your food. As for boring, parts of Afterlife bored me, I found Retribution even slower. I own all of these, being a Milla devotee, but it really is one of the fastest moving ones of the series. The photography is well done with sudden grabbings, bitings and, in general, run for your freaking life moments. As an action movie, even the original did not move this fast. Dr. Isaacs and the slime-ball Wesker are great villains here. Dr. Isaacs shows you why you should try to not report your boss to his superior, it is really a bad idea when he is a psycho like Isaacs. Yes, detractors, there are a few scenes here and there that misfire but, on the whole, it is way above the other ones with the exception of the original. The final showdown is worth owning the movie for, of all of the collection, this is the one I watch over the most. Milla never looked more beautiful and with her 'powers' the leaps of strength seem much more believable here. My Second Favorite. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Milla Jovovich reprises her tough-girl-in-sexy-thigh-boots role, and the survivors travel in Mad Max conveys up and down desert highways in search of fuel. Zombie sequel is just as grisly as the first two. Director Russell Mulcahy is revered by genre fans for his work on the original Highlander, he will gain many more followers inside Fangoria circles with this over-the-top splatter fest. The action at times is pretty effective, from an attack by an infected flock of crows, to some brutal fighting in a sand-engulfed Las Vegas. Aussie filmmaker Russell Mulcahy piles on the atmosphere to make up for lack of originality in the script or production design. He also knows which bones to throw zombie movie fans, who relish the methodology of destroying the slow moving freaks.A grimly efficient horror thriller that delivers exactly what the other two entries did: monsters, gore, and a heavily armed Milla Jovovich in boots and garters.Equal parts Mad Max and Day of the Dead, this third and supposedly final entry in the Resident Evil franchise is no less derivative than its predecessors but moves along at a brisk clip.With clever lifts from "The Birds" and Cormac McCarthy's bleak "The Road," you have a rare movie that wasn't screened for critics yet is actually worth watching.</fullReview>

Those are the 'epic moments' I refer to in the review title, and namely are the moments when Alice first shows up at the survivor 'camp' and roasts a few birds, and naturally the scene where we see who Alice's "one woman army" consists of.This was a good cast, as I am a definite Ali Larter fan (she's another who does well in 'kick-arse heroine' roles. It was sad, because some of the survivors of the previous movie didn't make it out of this one, but I guess that seems to be a bit of a tradition of these movies! Anyway, I really enjoyed this one, even the zombie birds (ew), and look forward to watching #4.After that, I guess I'll have to wait #5!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil: Extinction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the disastrous previous sequel I was expecting this third film based on the popular video games to be just as bad, but I was actually reasonably surprised at how it had improved a bit more. Basically Raccon City is where the T-Virus first broke out, but it has spread rapidly that now the entire world is infected with few survivors up against the living dead people. A few years have passed, and bio-organic superhuman Alice (Milla Jovovich) is on her own fighting against the threat from both these creatures and the Umbrella Corporation that created the virus. Despite knowing that she can tracked and wanted back at the Corporation, led by sinister Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) and evil head researcher Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen), Alice is determined to find a way to bring them down. She winds up with a gang of survivors fighting their way through the hordes of infected undead, with members including Carlos Olivera (The Mummy's Oded Fehr), Claire (Ali Larter), L.J. (Mike Epps), K-Mart (Spencer Locke) and nurse Betty (Ashanti). When the overhear a radio broadcast by someone claiming that Alaska is decontaminated and virus free, they all make their way through the now Nevada Desert sand covered Las Vegas ruins. They are up against not just the flesh eating zombies, but also killer crows, and of course the forces of the Corporation, who do manage to control the newly developed Alice, and also capture her in attempt to steal vital DNA. We did see it earlier, but Alice was unaware that her original DNA had been cloned into many dozens of copies in order to perfect a replica to find a cure for the virus. In the end, after suffering a zombie bite, the evil doctor dies from his monstrous transformation, and leaving her friends to go to Alaska without her, Alice is seen in the room with at least one hundred copies of herself. Also starring Matthew Marsden as Slater and Christopher Egan as Mikey. With obvious and inspired homages to Mad Max, Planet of the Apes, The Birds, some kung fu movies and some spaghetti westerns, Jovovich and new addition Larter are good heroines, the outdoor scenes are improved with sunlight, and the special effects are better, all in all, not a bad science-fiction action horror sequel. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow they somehow made a movie worse then the second</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The story is like something a 8th grader would come up with, and there are many things that don't add up in the plot. For one how does a Chopper carry all those people and still have gas to make it to Alaska and where do these people get water? Or why do they keep cloneing Alice when the 1st one just broke out and now wants to destroy umbrella? Or how does that fence hold off over a 1000 zombies? There's more then thatThe action isn't even that good just over the top stunts that suck like Alice making a fire shield or that stupid tyrant that looks just as bad, possible worse then nemmy looked in the second and then there's that fact that this movie has almost nothing to do with that game.I would not hate this movie so much if it had'nt destroyed the chance of a good resident evil based movie.And the way the movie ended the climax fight between tyrant and Alice was ended by a clone waking up knowing how to use an umbrella computer and turn on lazes that kill off tyrant. I could go on and on about how bad this movie was but there is a good chance this will never be read so I will end it here</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Evil Extinction of the Resident Movies !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hi, Just saw the long awaited movie Resident Evil Extinction and was actually very disappointed and will explain why. I really enjoyed the 2 first movies as they were very well based on the video games with very interesting scenarios. It was a good combination of the T-virus story, the characters, the zombies, the escape, Umbrella Corporation. Everything fit very well. Very entertaining and true to the original scenarios (video games).Now, Resident Evil: Extinction. Is this the same movie we are talking about? It has nothing to do with the first and even less with the second Resident Evil. The story does not fit at all. It is a very basic escape-run film with poor action and no story. Very typical if you want to make a follow up film to a previous one and do not have a good idea. The characters are not developed at all. Alice is just "showing up" without any consistence to the previous sequels, Carlos Olivera is badly doing his part and where is Jill??So much left from the 2 movies to be developed to make the 3rd one good (3 principal characters, the Virus, the evil corporation, end of the world etc). I looked up who wrote the Manus for that movie and saw Mr Paul W.S. Anderson!! I could have bet on it. He did the same crap on Alien vs Predator. Pity that story repeats itself again on Resident Evil.Well, a movie to forget and not to be associated with the Resident Evil sequels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Full of Action Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the outbreak of the T-virus initiated in Raccoon City, the whole world is destroyed and crowded of flesh-eating zombies, and the humans keep moving fighting to survive. Alice (Milla Jovovich) travels alone in her motorcycle through the Nevada Desert, where she meets a convoy of survivors leaded by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) with Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and helps them to fight against a bunch of zombie-crows. The group decides to travel to Las Vegas first to get fuel and supplies and then head to the decontaminated Alaska. Meanwhile, in an underground facility of the Umbrella Corporation, the evil Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) is researching an anti-virus to domesticate the zombies and cure people using clones of Alice. When Dr. Isaacs locates Alice through the satellite, he forges an order from the president and the troops chase Alice, while the group of survivors fights against a horde of zombies in Las Vegas.The full of action "Resident Evil: Extinction" is another great sequel of "Resident Evil". The story is a sort of "Mad Max" with George Romero's trilogy, but never disappoints. The acting is great, highlighting the gorgeous Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter (from "Heroes"), and top-notch special effects. The end of the movie is a great hook for another sequel. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Resident Evil 3: Extinç?o" ("Resident Evil 3: Extinction")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a surprisingly good movie. Definitely the best one out of the three made. I think this film is somewhat under appreciated and under rated. In fact, the more I think about this movie the more I want to see it again, its that kind of movie.It had scary parts along with well done action sequences. Milla Jovovich was really good in it, you can tell she was in great shape for the movie. It was an entertaining movie to watch throughout and never got boring.Nice cinematography in the filming of the desert, and a world that was devastated in the future was presented in a believable way. The evil villain was played well by the actor and was memorable. The story moved at a good pace and made sense in the "universe" the movie created. Some good performances by other actors also, the acting all around was better than expected. This is a movie I would consider buying and I don't think that of many movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Despite looking so, this series is not extinct just yet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Resident Evil: Extinction elevates itself slightly higher than its two predecessors and slightly higher than I thought it would in general. On one hand, it is a series of bizarre and somewhat illogical events that transpire under the scenario of an apocalyptic event's aftermath but on the other, it is a pastiche of 'zombie' films gone by; a crude study of one man's obsession with his research and a somewhat guilty action film. I liked Resident Evil: Extinction a little more than others of its type because it gives us more of a sedate look at the situation rather than a mere exploitation of special effects, attractive heroines and needless gore. Yes, it's true to say that this film has action scenes of a silly nature but they do not seem as stupid as previous Resident Evil films in which the protagonist is able to use kung-fu on dogs and make impossible shots to defeat her foes.The action scenes here are paced better and do not rely on the mere visualisation of actually seeing a Licker monster or Nemeses himself as the reason to keep watching. The enemies here are unspectacular and familiar and all the better for it; we get the feeling this is more of a survival film about the beasts and beings that would actually be out there rather than dumb scenes that try to impress us with a mentality: "Look, a Licker." or "Look, this is what Nemeses would look like in reality.". In the film, there is a scene in which several zombies come charging out of a metal crate. The scene works on the level of realism within the film because the film could so easily have substituted them for a larger, more visually impressive enemy that would've sufficed for the following action scene.I mentioned the word 'realism' in that paragraph, perhaps crazily so. But Resident Evil: Extinction takes time to present its heroes, all of whom travel in a procession of large vehicles, with every day issues that would affect them. Things like 'how much fuel is left? Where is the nearest petrol station?'; 'Where is the next meal coming from?' and 'How can we bed down for the night safely and free from attack?' These sorts of questions were lost in the previous films and are empty from other recent post-apocalyptic horror/sci-fi films like Blade: Trinity. Additionally, when the film does reveal its particularly large scale monster for the film's climax it does so in an effective manner. This is because we have had the monster and the source for the monster presented to us on another plot line. We get a feeling that it may happen within the world of the film unlike when Nemeses popped up in the last film merely because he's had the injection and must now just keep destroying stuff until he meets the hero for the finale fight.Although it takes on the matter of the pacing and the clarity of the action scenes, Resident Evil: Extinction is still guilty of one or two things. The film actually begins in a manner than had me dreading it would be as bad as the previous two. Alice (Jovovich) meets some human survivors but discovers them oddly unfriendly which acts more of a surprise than a dramatic twist. It's a scene in which implied prior victims have been conned, raped and then fed to the dogs; in this case infected dogs and sure enough Alice finds herself in the said situation ? a sequence of events that plays out in a daft manner that reminds you of the prior films. It had me thinking 'how do the renegade survivors lock the infected dogs up for next time once they've had their fun?' Then there was the rather careless scene in which Alice falls asleep in the middle of the desert, at night and with the fire still burning ? not smart considering the situation. The film is also disappointing in the sense that when the procession of vehicles housing the characters Alice, they are spread evenly in ethnicity and attitude meaning each individual 'type' could be killed off accordingly.But for the best part, Resident Evil: Extinction is a surprisingly enjoyable film with an interesting set-up and I was really quite fond of the story running parallel involving Dr. Isaacs (Glen) and his research in developing the un-dead, albeit a clear reference to Dr. Logan in Day of the Dead. This plot line runs alongside the development of the convoy and the situations they must deal with, the thing I like here is that these people are not world savers; they will not go on a cause and effect fuelled story and make all the un-dead disappear, they are just there to survive and through Alice their goal is to make it to the icy regions of Alaska.The bizarre thing about this latest Resident Evil instalment is just how good it might've been had it cut the action scenes down a little and tidied up the opening twenty or so minutes. It is disappointing that the convoy is made up of a Redneck (who's naturally good at sniping); an Aussie; two African-Americans; a Mexican and a wise-talking white American, all of whom exist for zombie fodder at the end of the day but this film instils me with hope that perhaps the films can be as good as the games ? in the games, ammunition was a very sacred thing and the tactic of running from enemies rather than shooting them was a good one. In the films, the producers are gradually realising this and the next film may well surprise a few people in terms of how watchable it actually is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Zombie film, Yes - Resident Evil film, No</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this RE3 was a cracking zombie movie, it strayed to far from the original concept and excepted storyline. In my opinion this has rendered the movie pointless in the RE franchise.Let's not forget that Resident Evil owes it popularity to the game series, so I think it's only right that they try and stick to it, even if it's just a little bit. It seems very much like the director wanted to make an updated version of Day of the Dead, if you've seen DOTD you'll see what I mean in the first 5 minutes of RE3.If this were a stand alone movie I would have given it 10/10, but it isn't, they've tried to be too creative and the director has tried to make a different movie. By doing this he's make a cracking zombie film. but a Resident Evil film, I think not.I only hope this isn't the last one, it would be a terrible waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think critics were unfair on this addition, my guess is that they just assumed it's another Resident Evil that will be like the others in their opinion. In actual fact, Extinction is far better than Apocalypse and more exciting than the first film because the story is better developed, the writing is solid and the characters are richly constructed, especially Claire Redfield's convoy who are essentially one big caring family trying to survive. The action is breathtaking too, Alice' powers really come to full effect, and the Las Vegas scene sets an uneasy atmosphere and the whole construction of that set is stunning. The infected crows scene is bloodily glorious, and when Alice uses her powers to deflect the flamethrower it looks incredible and shines bright, just like the Air-Brushing the editors used on Jovovich' face. This is the strongest in the franchise for story and character, and the balance between the two and action is brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly impressive sequel effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the T-virus circles the globe, Alive joins a caravan of survivors trekking across the American landscape hoping for salvation against the never-ending hordes of undead and mutants on their trail. Overall this is one of the better efforts for the franchise. One of the better parts here is the rather high-quantity action throughout here which gives this one an incredibly fast pace that makes this one really enjoyable. Some of the big action scenes, like the battle with the mutated dogs in the pit or a later scene in the underground complex are all about giving it some impressive gore while others figure to be more based on spectacle and action. This is mostly covered by the two big scenes in this which really give off plenty to like about it, the assault by the numerous birds on the bus campground and the battle with the zombies at the casino grounds which provide this one with plenty of dynamic and impressive actions as the spectacular image of the birds flying into and swarming the buses before being burned up by the flamethrower while later scenes of the horde of creatures battling in the sand-covered dunes of the casino grounds provides this with a large quantity of action and some decent gore. Likewise, the big mutant scores really well with a rather thrilling and ingenious battle that really makes for a fun battle as the back-and-forth nature of the brawl comes to an appropriate end, dealing nicely with the early scene of the creepy run-through of the house alone which results in one of the creepiest and most surprising twists at the end of this which gives it a rather creepy air to go along with those action scenes. That tends to be its good points and are more than enough to hold off the few flaws. The fact that the film really tends to feature a lot of rather useless scenes to pad time out and hammer home what we already know by in the series. We already know Alice is handy with guns and weaponry, so the tedious scene of her confronting the family in the desert trap makes no sense as to be included beyond the gore, and scenes of the facility testing the attempts to control the virus and mutations is nothing new that we haven't seen already as we know they're devious and underhanded. That's in addition to the rather obvious CGI which pops up here for the scenes of the creatures' appearing en-masse, the more extreme gore scenes and the more spectacular action scenes that are quite obvious in their execution. It's all that really holds this one down.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil: Extinction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A change of pace for the third film as we move outta urban settings and weapons/laboratory facility type settings for the open desert. Yep Resi Evil goes for the 'Mad Max' look complete with heavily armoured vehicles including the good old petrol tanker, you just can't go wrong with a tanker in your desert based fantasy flick.The image of Alice being more of a elemental/supernatural type superhero is enforced more in this new film after we learned how badass she was in number two. A motley band of survivors once again are in deep doo doo being attacked by hundreds of ravenous crows (crows in the Mojave desert?), until Alice pops up and saves the day by scorching all the crows to a fiery death with the mind powers she learnt from Professor X.The plot is just like all the other films, a small group of survivors in a different setting, getting taken down one by one, until only Alice and maybe two others remain for the next sequel (where those two normally get killed off early on). I quite liked the idea of Alice roaming the Southwestern US outback looking for supplies and survivors but stumbling across crazy killers that like to watch people get eaten by zombie dogs. You could totally see that happening in the US with all those religious nut jobs over there, real 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' type folk in the sticks over there.On the subject of zombie dogs, why are they always rottweilers? what has happened to every other type of dog? is there some kind of special sale on zombie rottweilers?? cos they are everywhere!Actually this film felt somewhat muted and not as action packed if you can believe that. Looking back over all of the films this one definitely has a slightly slower pace, less interesting characters and less action...apart from the usual mass of gunshots to zombie heads. On the other hand the visuals seem more realistic (deserts always seem to look good on film) and the zombies look good, grittier. The sequence where the main bad scientist guy tries to domesticate a captured zombie harks back to the classic 'Return of the Living Dead' zombie franchise (third film), nice touch.Despite a more straight tone as it were, this film does suffer from not being quite the ballistic overdrive of action the rest are. It almost doesn't quite fit within the franchise really but I liked the fresh location. The whole film does feel a little bit of an anti climax though, the finale with the mutated creature sums that up pretty well, but as usual the setup for the next sequel intrigues.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Worth a Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having escaped from the Umbrella Corporation in the last picture, "Alice" (Milla Jovovich) is now on her own and is riding a motorcycle in the middle of a desert wasteland somewhere in the vicinity of Nevada. On a separate journey is "Carlos Olivera" (Oded Fehr) and "L.J." (Mike Epps) who have joined a caravan of survivors led by a person named "Claire" (Ali Larter). The problem that both Alice and the caravan face is that the zombie population has grown on such a large scale that the zombies now inhabit the entire planet. There doesn't seem to be any safe place and so the only solution is to keep on moving. Because of this, and the desolate desert environment, this movie probably captures an apocalyptic scenario better than its predecessor, "Resident Evil-Apocalypse". The action is fast-paced and the plot is a slight improvement over the last film. And while Milla Jovovich displays good acting abilities, the addition of attractive newcomers, Spencer Locke ("K-Mart"), Ashanti ("Betty") and the previously mentioned Ali Larter certainly doesn't hurt this film. All things considered then, I believe this film is slightly better than its predecessor and as good as the original ("Resident Evil"). Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy this series.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After the second Resident Evil movie, I would figure a next one is up. Looks like the Umbrella Corporation is up to its old tricks again. This time thy are trying to make an army by using the undead to their advantage. But what do they use? Blood from Alice( Milla Jovovich) since she has immunity from the dreaded T-Virus that makes the dead be less than dead. Now there are some survivors from the last battle who are in a convoy trying to avoid not only the undead, but the Umbrella as well. When they meet Alice from the infected crow attack, they are more than ready to take down the Umbrella and the undead. When one of the Umbrella members tried to use Alice's blood to his advantage, his arrogance really showed. He wears Alice down temporary, he forgets her allies. Especially when he was in that lethal trap from the first Resident Evil movie. Saying that "I'm Invincible" is one thing, but in that room, you're just a cut up for laughs. I mean literally. Plenty of horror and gore to say the least, Milla puts the "A" in action. Enjoyed it very well. 2.5 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's rare to find a sequel that puts an original to shame. So you can imagine that it would be almost impossible to find a fourth installment that is better than the first. Well the search is over. Not only does "Extinction" beat out the other Resident Evil's in scale of action, it edges them in overall quality as well...not that it matters. If you're watching a zombie movie based on a video game, you probably don't care how deep the plot is. In this installment, Alice continues her search for the mythical, virus-free "Arcadia." While flying her plane over a desolate, post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, she decides to land on the roof of a maximum security prison to come to the aid of some survivors. It's hard enough to escape from prison, but how do you pull it off when the prison is surrounded by a zombie army? Loading your shotgun shells with metal coins is a good first step. "Extinction" would fit nicely in a list of the Top 20 zombie movies of all. It would also not be out of place on a list of the top 3 video game films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At its best, this movie has great style. Watch the first scenes, as the director poses Milla as a piece of angry candy in beautifully framed shots and lovely moments like a sliver of a dress sliced in slow motion, and you can't help but be impressed. The movie doesn't consistently maintain that supermodel-of-the-apocalypse quality, but when it hits it, as in another scene with Milla and a wall of flame, it's stupendous. While the scenes without Milla are never quite as visually striking, it is all pretty exciting, including a transparent rip off of Hitchcock's The Birds. For me, the Resident Evil series represents the best of movies pulled from video games, offering pure escapist fun that is fast paced and never tries to either mock nor run away from the game's sillier aspects. At the same time, the movies all kind of run together for me; they're all good, but they are all pretty forgettable. If you're looking for pure popcorn entertainment you can't go wrong with this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that RE3 really has many good aspects going for it. I mean this one took the cake, and it showed it's true colors. It developed on little plot lines that were confusing in the 2nd film, it gave us some excellent characters again and it look upon developing the location even more this time by making every extinct: using a deserted area, along with the infected now being zombies, re-animated.The plot is still the same really, the Alice characters is roaming around, gets into trouble, escapes and then finds a group of survivors taking camp in the middle of nowhere. She decides to team up with two characters seen in the previous installment, along with some new characters. I believe this sequel is a tad better than the 2nd film, because the atmosphere of the film I feel is more scarier and creepier.Instead of taking a more modern tone like RE2 did, RE3 goes for a very isolated, deserted, scary feel where the dead become more brutal, the characters must be more smarter and the addition of the crows which was a creepy touch. The music as always was also good and Dr. Isaacs as that creature was pretty insane.I think RE3 is definitely a worthy sequel, and works on many levels. I also found it a tad better than the 2nd film because it's plot lines were less confusing. But it's installment 3, and in RE, it's all about the action-packed violence which is all good fun.I would give this undeniably bloody sequel a 7.5/10</fullReview>

This time the virus has spread and has encompassed the world, so Alice is out and about, trying to avoid the undead. Now toss in Ali Larter, the tough, smokin' hot gal from Final Destination and Heroes, add in some Ashanti, and spice it up with the return of Oded Fehr and Michael Epps, and you have an action film that is sure to please. The Umbrella Corporation is well represented, with Iain Glen returning as the infamous Dr. Isaacs, the Frankenstein of all Frankensteins. When he learns Alice is still around, he tries every trick in the book to get her back. Be careful what you wish for, Doc. Great stunts, great action, and every bit as exciting as the first two films, Resident Evil: Extinction is sure to please the fans of the video game and the movies. And for us old guys, there is an "homage" to the King of Horror himself, Alfred Hitchcock, that is sure to please. Rated R for brief nudity, violence, and language, if you have the others, you have to have this one in your collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well i waited a long time for this one to come out,, it was pretty good,, but not as good as the first,, but then again when are movies as good as the first,, i think the first half of this movie kicks ass and takes names,, and Milla Jovovich is as sexy as ever,, even Mike Epps is fun,, and the dogs are back for a little bit too,, in the second half of the movie,, the story loses some of the original punch,, it slows down a little too much for me,, but it does manage to pick it up a notch again,, for a decent ending i thought,, i just think this movie like most,, in this genre that are a sequel,, is it was disjointed ,, meaning the pieces just don't seem to fit,, i mean all the action was there,, and Milla was great as usual,, and the Umbrella Corporation is mentioned quite frequently,, and the return of Alice not to mention,, so it's a good movie,, but can't top the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hey I liked it!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off let me say this, "I really liked the film!" I have read a quite a few reviews of this film, and some of them were positive a lot of them were negative. Some people were poking holes in the plot of the story, credibility, the acting, the writing, the directing, etc. Let me tell you something you find your favorite critically acclaimed Oscar film.You look at every single possible angle, really put every scene under a microscope you are bound to find mistakes. Also when one does this, does it not take away some of the joy of sitting back and watching a movie? Next I will say is this "People lighten up; the film does not take itself so seriously why should you? Have you seen other zombie films? I have. Have you ever wonder about the depth of characters? Especially the supporting cast? The answers to these questions should be no. I mean you and I both know they are going to get it. The whole point to going to movies like this is to suspend one's own disbelief and to let your mind be entertained. I mean that is why so many of use read comic books, futuristic novels, about science, space travel,horror etc. Also to people who have said oh it rips of that movie, or that! Here's some food for thought, the writer himself has said that he wanted to pay a tribute to movies like Mad Max that inspired him, but put his own updated twist on it. What's wrong with that?...Nothing! Hell creative play writes have been doing this for a couple hundred years with Shakespeare. Not that I am implying the Anderson is any were near the same league as good old Billy Shakespeare. But if something inspires you, you may want to put your own twist and stamp on it." So in conclusion you don't like it? Fine go off and watch something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so i was hoping to see black sheep at the cinema with some mates. When i got on the train I met my movie loving friends but they told me angrily it was not on. They then said the only other film that looks OK that is on is resident evil extinction i had only seen number 1 and this was the third so i was thinking i would'not understand the movie at all but in actually fact it had a very easy to understand story. Packed full of over the top violence and lots of gore with fantastic acting (particularly by Milla Jovovich). This film is guaranteed to make you jump out of your seat. The film also like the others made you feel very attached to Alice (Milla Jovovich) and the rest of the characters. Overall if you love Zombies and lots of violence this is the film for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think , as a Resident Evil fan , that this movie is really the best approach to the franchise. The tension in some scenes are really awesome, the character's searching rooms, finding clues and things, shattered rooms with electric cables hanging , sparkling , i mean , this is Resident Evil! The action is intense, but not stupidly intense as in the 2nd movie, it takes place when it has and not all the time. The constant running for their lives, makes it a really great survival horror movie. Speaking of characters, i think Alice finally evolved to something else, she has power , but she doesn't make an excessive use of it, she's not a super-action-Kong-foo fighter 24H/day anymore. I'm a bit disappointed with Wesker, as a player , i thought he had a different role, i am mostly mad about the fact that his role has not been respected, but this is a movie, glad that they didn't turn him in a good guy ( Nemesis ??). In order to conclude, the movie could've had a different name, with different character's , because it isn't 100% related to the game, except for the names used in it, but it's a great movie, can't wait for a Collector's edition DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Human Nature to the Test in "Resident Evil: Extinction"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Raccoon City T-virus Outbreak is scary. Its spread in the USA is scarier. Now, global infection is a lot scarier. This is the premise of "Resident Evil: Extinction".I like how the Raccoon City residents are now living like the ancient people. They hunt for food, water, and other supplies vital for survival. You'll feel bad for the children in the school bus. Seeing Las Vegas in ruins is fascinating, as it is always alive. During the story course, you'll get confused about the events in a certain Umbrella underground lab. Dr. Isaacs is seen a lot, but his purpose is hidden to the audiences. I like how Alice uses the kukri knives against the zombies, which signify the scarcity of long-range weapons. This is also a horror movie, so expect some characters to die. The death scenes are accompanied with good musical score that I really felt moved by these scenes. A death-related plot twist comes along, and this is very tough to watch. I can't believe it happened. The final scene of this film will make you scratch your head about where Alice's fate is actually going.It's great that "Resident Evil: Extinction" has surpassed "Resident Evil: Apocalypse". This film's ending is a loose thread, which calls for another movie to continue. If the production crew plans to make a series out of the popular video game, then they should have titled the 2002 film as "Resident Evil: Infection".This film is amazing, and it deserves to be watched for Halloween.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love the resident evil films as I have watched them all lots of time, it might be just me who is taken in by Milla Jovovich,Oded Fehr and Ali Larterand acting skills but this has to be one of the best films yet and me being a huge fan of the films thought they wouldn't be able to do a better job. Although the film has its flaws like the new easier killing zombies who can be killed by slashing the through or shooting them in the mid-drift a slight flaw they didn't think through but it is still an outstanding film! The thing I love most about this film is that it doesn't fit into the stereotypical zombie film, like running round a confined space like in the first film or set in the middle of a big city over run by the undead like in the second film instead it is set slap bang in the middle of a desert in the day time only a really good director could make that type of a film scary! This film is so grate because I can watch it 10 times in a row and still not get bored, I really don't no how they will top it for a forth time!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By far the best of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With Extinction, the Resident Evil franchise sees a huge shift in gear from the previous two instalments. While RE and REA were action movies riffing off "Aliens" and "Dawn of the Dead" respectively, this is far more pessimistic, more ambitious and, in all senses, better.Extinction, unlike the quasi-faithful Apocalypse, takes a huge departure from the games that are its source material, re-imagining the series as a post-apocalyptic sci-fi/horror, perhaps best described as a hybrid of "The Road Warrior", Romero's "Day of the Dead" and Richard Matheson's classic horror novel "I Am Legend", as we are shown a scorched world overrun with zombies and populated by only a few survivors, though isn't quite as effective as it's progenitors.Essentially, the film follows two parallel narratives which ultimately connect at the film's finale. The first one is a basic Mad Max affair, as Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) leads a ragtag convoy of survivors across America in search of sanctuary from the undead hoards, meeting Jovovich's telekinetic super-soldier Alice along the way. The second, which is in many ways far more interesting, follows the work of Umbrella scientist Dr Isaacs (Iain Glenn) as he labours in an underground bunker to domesticate the zombies in search of an eventual cure (a storyline lifted almost wholesale from "Day of the Dead"). There is also a subplot involving the shadowy Albert Wesker, a fan favourite character who seems to be directing things from behind the scenes, but doesn't really have much to do (though is set up as the next film's big bad).Technically speaking, the film is light years ahead of the last two. For one thing it is helmed by "Highlander" director Russell Mulcahy, who, despite a dubious resume is a far better action director than Alexander Witt or Paul Anderson and also brings with him a far more mature, impressive, eye for images. Sure, Anderson is pretty good at claustrophobic horror (well, variable. Event Horizon was fantastic, RE good, AVP atrocious) but less skilled at this kind of epic scope, so Mulcahy seems a good choice and conjures some effective George Miller-esquire set pieces.In terms of cinematography and editing, the film also outstrips its prequels, especially its immediate predecessor, creating an effective feeling of tension while brilliantly conveying the twin worlds of the film: the scorching, death choked and sun-blasted deserts and the clammy, clinical world of the scientists. There are also some truly wonderful moments: an attack on the convoy by T-virus infected crows, the crumbling ruins of Vegas, Isaacs attempting to teach a zombie using kids toys and, best of all, his transformation into one of the games iconic "Tyrants" for a thrilling climax.The acting is far more variable. Milla is once again great as the now iconic Alice, while Iain Glen is sublime as the sinister antagonist Dr Isaacs. Ali Larter should also be praised, as while her Claire Redfield has nothing in common with her game counterpart, she is suitably feisty and charismatic to convince as a hero for the survivors (though the question of what happened to Jill Redfield is never answered).There are some character problems. The rest of the supporting cast are 1-dimensional, and attempts to give them Whedon-esquire quirks don't always come off, making it difficult to care about their survival. The storyline is also sometimes muddled, and Alice's development of telekinetic powers is handled very badly, coming across as little more than a deus ex machina. Albert Wesker is also miscast, appearing more as a cocky American executive rather than the calculating and charismatic English mercenary beloved by the fans, though there is still time to sort this out in the sequel (or possibly recast).Overall this is a very good action sci-fi film in the Terminator/Mad Max molds and marks a real positive improvement from the last entry. Stylish, exciting and visually impressive, this is a great popcorn film, and I eagerly await the next instalment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil Extinction Okay But Still Flawed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil Extinction is okay but still flawed from director Russell Mulcahy who's admirable in making this third film but the lack of character development, more suspense, and a disappointing third act surprise villain are what weighed this one down the most at least to me. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, Ian Glen, Mike Epps, and Oded Fehr who's part like many others unfortunately is cut kind of short near the end. The rest of the cast including a brief cameo appearance by Ashanti are okay in their small parts but none of them get a chance to shine because they're written out of the movie rather quickly. The action sequences are well executed and paced. The special effects including the zombies and brief appearances by other creatures are impressive. The villain near the end known as The Tyrant who Glen's character turns into looks terrifying and deadly but his anti-climatic showdown with Jovovich near the conclusion is a letdown. The twist at the end was a bit of a surprise and the ending does leave it open for another one but I think three is enough for now. This movie isn't really that bad there are just flaws that weigh it down which could've been improved . Overall Resident Evil Extinction is decent with enough action, bloody deaths, good special effects, some suspense, a little humor, and solid performances by the cast who make this third entry in the trilogy worth watching but it could've been a lot better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as Apocalypse, but better than the first film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a general rule, I'm not a fan of zombie movies per se, so although I thought the first Resident Evil movie was entertaining, I wouldn't say that I'm a fan of the film. However, the sequel Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a personal favourite, because it sneakily switches genres and is essentially a big-budget action movie... that just happens to include zombies. In my humble opinion, Apocalypse was the best action film of 2004, the year it was released. It boasts some highly memorable sequences, in particular the initial confrontation between Alice and Nemesis, which is an incredibly exciting set-piece.And now we have Extinction, which switches genres again, giving us a post-apocalyptic movie... that just happens to include zombies. The plot is non-existent, the storyline merely consisting of three groups - Alice travelling solo, a convoy of survivors (including L.J. and Carlos from Apocalypse), and employees of the still-villainous Umbrella Corporation - all travelling across the dustbowl that used to be America, occasionally intersecting with each other and trying to avoid having their faces eaten off by the walking dead. Don't expect any characterisation either. The cast do their best, but have nothing to work with, other than reacting to events by looking anxious, frightened, angry, determined or sorrowful. The only major new face is Ali Larter, who at least gets to channel Sarah Connor.Extinction is helmed by Russell Mulcahy, who I consider to be hugely talented and much overlooked. His previous films include Razorback, Highlander, The Shadow, Blue Ice, Resurrection, Silent Trigger, and Highlander II: The Quickening (which was sunk by a truly awful script - but there was nothing wrong with Mulcahy's direction). Unfortunately, Extinction lacks Mulcahy's distinctive stamp, although the set-pieces are carried out with plenty of visual flair. The only real disappointment is that the battle between Alice and end-of-level baddie Tyrant starts very promisingly but is over far too quickly. The reappearance of certain key elements from the first film (the laser grid being the most obvious example) may bring the trilogy full circle, but it's clearly a blatant attempt at pleasing the series' fans. Such a tactic smacks of desperation and dangerously flirts with becoming annoying. That said, I loved the scene in which Alice meets the White Queen, sister A.I. to the Red Queen from the original movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How many second sequels can you think of that hold up as well as the original or even the first sequel? RE: EXTINCTION does just that, thanks to a clever plot, fine performances from several seasoned actors plus some eye-popping special effects and set designs. A ragtag group of Raccoon City survivors is trying to find its way to a place of safety, and ends up crossing paths with Alice, who by now is so powerful she can actually control the elements. Meanwhile, the creeps back at the Umbrella Corp. are still after Alice, mainly for her blood. There are fights galore against an endless army of zombies, but the most amazing battle occurs between the survivors and thousands of zombie crows. For those old enough to remember Hitchcock's THE BIRDS, this confrontation plays out like that old classic on steroids. Oded Fehr from THE MUMMY movies and Ali Larter of the FINAL DESTINATION flicks are on hand as leaders of the caravan of survivors. Milla Jovovich is once again on hand as Alice, but there is reason to believe this will be her final performance in that role should yet another sequel get green-lighted. The end is a real kick in the head, by the way. The film has some awesomely gory moments and is not suitable for young children.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Milla Kicks Some Ass!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Call me old fashion, but I just love to see a good looking gal with sharp weapons beheading zombies. The gal is none other than Russian-born supermodel turned action star Milla Jovovich (ULTRAVIOLET). Most will probably remember her from the sci-fi comedy hit, THE FIFTH ELEMENT where she played Leeloo (aka The Fifth Element). The movie was an astounding success and helped launch her into more mainstream films and out of her B-movie dregs.Milla was also picked up by the Resident Evil franchise in 2002 (films based on the computer game), and she seems to have found her footing in these betwixt-type slasher/zombie movies.Reprising her role as Alice, a genetically enhanced human-machine, Milla kicks some serious ass. She is reunited with love interest Carlos (Oded Fehr, THE MUMMY series) and her wayward band of zombie dodging wanderers while trying to keep a low profile from the genetic seekers that live in an underground complex in desertville. These scientists are trying to find a way to combat the increasing zombie threat. Problem is, though, is that a power hungry mad scientist named Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris, LADY IN THE WATER) is developing a serum to help cure or tame the zombies' insatiable hunger for human flesh. But the serum goes awry and Dr. Ashford becomes something of a monster himself.Meanwhile, Alice and her buds are fighting off zombified crows and left-over gamblers in Viva Las Vegas, all while the mad scientists bear down on her.The movie is what it is: a zombie flick that goes overboard when it comes to the creation of a new creature. But the zombies are realistic looking, and Milla looks (and acts) great as the reluctant desert hero, trying to find out who she is and where life is taking her. You don't have to do a lot of thinking during the entire film; it's all laid out for you in wonderful slash-o-vision.It would've been nice, though, if the screenplay hadn't incorporated this new creature I mention. That went so beyond anything that it truly spoiled much that had come before.Still, RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION is a fun film to watch. And a must for Milla fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best yet!!!! could be classed as spoiler as storyline is mention but twists aren't given away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know that there are a lot of Judas's out there who are extremely stuck up about game-films, and will always give them a thumbs down regardless of seeing the film or not, however to give this film a thumbs down, is almost criminal. Obviously the first film was full of holes and was generally a sloppy mess i'm sure plenty of people will agree with me, apocalypse was actually decent, the stunts and visuals were very entertaining and nemesis debut was warmly welcomed. Moving onto number 3. One of the best things about this film is the story, it's actually believable because it could happen one day; in fact its a story similar to the 28 days later film. The story is set soon after the sanitation of raccoon city where the T-Virus was supposed to have been obliterated. It wasn't. The T-Virus spreads globally and infects the entire world, drying up lakes and turning the planet into a baron wasteland. Caught up in the midst is a convoy lead by Claire Redfield, Carlos Olivera and LJ, the remaining umbrella corporation lead by Albert Wesker, and of course, the heroine, Alice. Professor Isaac (the bad dude) is trying to find a cure for the T-Virus to end the zombie infestation but runs into a few complications.This film boasts action more than any of it's predecessors and will not fail to impress you with it's improved fight scenes, the only real downside is the absence of one important character and another, but not so important character, Jill and Angela, which is disappointing because they were a likable characters. There are quite a few dramatic scenes, so it's not all blood, guts and senseless violence, there is a sense of loss and sadness in it. Talking about blood and guts. This film is much bloodier than any of the previous films and does add a bit more eye pleasing scenes if you like seeing blood spraying everywhere and people being slashed to pieces. Another thing that is quite impressive, is the very slight hint of the G-Virus coming into effect, even though it hasn't a label clearly saying, 'G-Virus, Big Daddy's Only' you can still see the similarities and could aid the story in a 4th one. Yes, that's right folks! It's pretty certain that there's going to be number 4. Overall I give this film 10/10 because I can't really find anything highly disappointing about it. I wont downgrade it because it's based on a game, that would be very narrow minded, also because it's not meant to be a film thats meant to make you walk out and say that it made a valid point, or it was hilarious, or for whatever reason because it's a film thats meant to be entertaining and something to enjoy on a rainy evening or afternoon, not something you can have a 5 hour debate discussing the moral rights, or historic event that the film is based on. To be completely honest with you, films like that are rather boring and often send me to sleep, I'd much rather watch resident evil extinction than "Gone With the Wind", or "Syrianna" any day. You go to a cinema to be entertained and come out thinking 'wow those fighting scenes were amazing, well worth the money' not to come out and discuss politics. Anyway enough of my ranting, some of you will agree with me some of you will lob rotten lettuces at me, but if you enjoyed the Resident Evil films, then this film is for you and I fully recommend it. If you just want to watch it for the eye pleasing stunts, fight scenes etc, then I fully recommend it, but if you want a film based on historic events such as apartheid, sorry do not watch this you'll just come out wishing you spent the last 2 hours in the pub discussing various topics. All I can say now is......Bring on number 4</fullReview>

Good movies based on videogames are possible like Silent Hill but the only thing this has is the Resident Evil name and nothing more. Good points: It's supposed to be Resident Evil! Yay! Bad Points: Abysmal acting, no continuation whatsoever, too much loose ends and finally ALICE! ALICE! WHO THE F**K IS ALICE?!? Anyway the first movie was not that good but not that bad either, the second one was a huge improvement with the inclusion of the nemesis and story wise quite good but this one? Were are the important main characters? sure there were Claire and Wesker but were almost put there as an after thought. Were are Chris and Leon? And all the umbrella abominations and mutants? In Extinction there were only zombies( how original ), crows, dogs and the inclusion of a tyrant at the end with the world most overrated and clichéd corridor ever. A word to the producers, play the f**kin games before trying to direct any video game license! Do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague, I think even Black Sheep is better than this humongous piece of crap, at least it looks funny! And also let's hope that Resident Evil Degeneration, the new CG movie is faithful to the Resident Evil universe! Leon and Claire seem to be in it! Fingers crossed Resi fans!</fullReview>

If you must see it wait for it to come out on video...please don't help the execs find an excuse by box office receipts to make a fourth movie. There is no story to it, the dialogue is poorly written, there are a few special effects that are descent. You get the idea that Mila's character is very powerful creature, but she only displays these powers two or three times. There are many plot errors in this movie (one day perhaps writers will learn to research what they are writing about as well as settings crew )I hope Mila will be able to survive what these movies may do to her career.</fullReview>

And then of course after he turns he bites the main character.. Who else? They are supposed to be pro-s at killing these things. Well they were less then amateurs.

		<shortDescription>Alice in Zombieland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Extinction, the third instalment of the Resident Evil series, the deadly T-Virus has escaped the confines of Raccoon City and contaminated the rest of the world. Zombies now outnumber the living and, as the number of survivors on the planet's surface gradually dwindles, Umbrella Corp experts deep beneath the Nevada desert attempt to perfect an anti-virus.Meanwhile, genetically enhanced zombie-killing babe Project Alice (Milla Jovovich) travels the country searching for other uninfected humans.Sporting the latest in sexy post-apocalyptic desert-wear (which naturally includes stockings and suspenders), the drop-dead-gorgeous, high-kicking, gun slinging, slayer of the undead cuts a swathe through legions of shambling corpses (and zombie crows!), rescuing a rag-tag convoy of demoralised people in the process.Alice convinces their leader, Claire Redfield (Heroes hottie Ali Larter), to lead her convoy to Alaska, where she believes they will be safe from contamination. But first they must head for Las Vegas, where they hope to find enough fuel to last the journey North.Unfortunately, nasty Umbrella Corp scientist Dr. Isaacs, who has been tracking Alice via satellite, has a nasty surprise in store for our heroine and her new pals when they eventually reach Vegas: he's prepared a container full of extremely nasty zombies to greet them!Helmed by hit-and-miss director Russell Mulcahy, and written by the equally unreliable Paul W.S. Anderson, Resident Evil: Extinction could have gone either way. I am pleased to report, however, that the guys were on form with this film, and deliver a hugely enjoyable and visually impressive sci-fi/horror yarn that, despite being rather derivative (Day of the Dead, anyone?) and occasionally a little too silly (Alice's telekinesis), is packed with enough action (great stunts, explosions, crashes), gore (juicy zombie bites, knife attacks, bullets in the head), and scares (yes, I admit that I jumped) to guarantee horror fans a good time.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

My favorite scene is when Alice burns all those crows and you see sky is on fire and she is on the center of all this that was an amazing scene. Also the final battle with Dr. Isaacs was amazing it takes place in the rooms of the original movie and i found that being amazing.

		<shortDescription>The T-Virus has spread around the world</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Five years have passed since the events of the previous instalment of this zombie franchise. The T-Virus has spread around the planet; this has not only turned most of the population into zombies, it has also affected wildlife and caused almost global desertification. Alice is travelling alone through the American West where she meets up with a convoy of survivors just as they are being attacked by a giant flock of infected crows. She manages to help them but there are inevitably casualties. They find evidence suggesting that there are areas still unaffected by the T-Virus in Alaska but that is a long journey that will require a lot of fuel. With the smaller filling stations now drained they will have to brave the city of Las Vegas if they are to get the required fuel.While Alice is helping these survivors the Umbrella Corporation is still looking for her; Dr Isaacs needs her blood for his experiments to create a serum that will create tame zombies. He has also been working with clones of Alice which he tests to destruction. His schemes don't exactly go according to plan and he becomes infected after one of the 'improved' zombies he created bites him; he gets the antidote but mutates into a new more powerful creature; inevitable Alice will face him as the film reaches its climax.I think this film was a step up from the second in the series despite the absence of Valentine who seems to have gone AWOL since the end of the previous film. Things start well as we are introduced to Dr Isaacs' Alice clones in a scene that is so similar to the start of the first instalment that I wondered if I might have put the wrong disc in! When we get back to the real Alice it is quickly established that there are some survivors who are almost as dangerous as the zombies when she meets a family that behave as though they've just come off the set of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. That isn't the only film similarity; the convoy of survivors is an enjoyable nod to 'Mad Max 2' and the crow attack is clearly inspired by 'The Birds'. This scene is one of the best in the film as there is something inherently frightening about being attacked by something as common as a crow. The effects for this scene were pretty impressive. On the down side the creators' desire to take things to another level went a bit far; now Alice isn't just an awesome fighter, she has telekinetic powers and the final fight against the mutated Isaacs felt as though because this is based on a series of computer games it must end with a 'boss fight' against something much more dangerous than the regular zombies. The cast did a solid enough job, by now Milla Jovovich has almost become defined by her role as Alice and Iain Glen is pretty good as Isaacs. Overall this is a decent enough sequel with some great action and some nicely scary moments although you really need to have watched the earlier films, especially the first, to know what is going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice's Fight Continues In This Decent Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this 3rd installment of the Resident Evil series, we find that the T-Virus has spread out from Raccoon City at an alarming rate and has infected practically the whole of mankind. Alice continues her fight against the Umbrella Corporation and has now reached the baron deserts of Nevada where she joins up with a small band of survivors. Acting on information that the T-Virus hasn't reached Alaska, they all decide to take a chance and make the distant journey. However, Alice still has the Umbrella Corporation in her sights, so she now has to make a decision on whether to stay with her new friends, or continue her fight against Umbrella.I think it's pretty safe to say the film adaptations of the Resident Evil games have taken on a whole new self perspective as they don't really have anything to do with the game series now. Yes there's the Umbrella Corporation, the T-Virus, the zombies, but that's about it really. That's not a complaint, though - just a mere observation, because this is still a decent film and if you go into it just to watch it for what it's supposed to be, then you shouldn't really be too disappointed.Like the 2nd film, the story obviously isn't the main ingredient and it's the action that keeps it going, but in saying that I did feel that there was more of a developing story than what was in Apocalypse, but not by much. But let's be real here - we don't watch this type of movie for the riveting plot &amp; gripping story lines...we watch them for the action and like I say, the action &amp; visuals that are in the film is good enough to keep you entertained.Another thing I like about this movie is that it does continue the story (even if it is thin). It's not a sequel that has absolutely no bearing on the previous movie(s) and just uses the film name. You can watch it as a stand-alone film, but you'll not really have much idea what's going on so it's best watching the previous movies 1st.Definitely worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>better than part 2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>W hat a great opening this flick has, it takes you back to the ending of part 2 and the start of part 1. It picks up exactly when Alice (Milla Jovovich) breaks free of a new experiment being hold on her body but it also takes you back to the original Resident Evil when Alice wakes up in the shower. Finally the effects were much better than Resident Evil, here they went back to real effects and less CGI although CGI is still an important part in Extinction. Also this time things are seen on-screen instead of being done off-camera.I wont go into the story itself because Alice has new abilities and is confronted by...Alice. Further she a loner in a world gone by but when a weird dream happens she has to join another group. Together they're of to destroy the Umbrella company and of to Alaska, were there is no infection.I liked it because I just watched the previous parts otherwise you wont understand all what's going on. There's no explanation who and from where the group comes that Alice joins. A nice entry and for me better than part 2.Gore 2/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Step Up From the Previous Two</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) ** (out of 4) Third film in the series has the zombie outbreak wiping out the majority of human life across the world. Alice (Milla Jovovich) leads a small group of survivors through the Nevada desert as they try to make it to Alaska where there are reports that no infections have happened. RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION is a step up from the previous two films but like those this one here starts off extremely well but slowly loses its way as it drags on. I thought the story here was actually the best of the three films because it could have made for a very entertaining survival picture. I thought the idea of these people traveling through the desert and heading towards Alaska could have made for a great adventure movie but sadly the screenplay goes off this mark and instead just goes for routine gunfights and zombie attacks. It's a real shame they didn't try to do more with the story that they started because it could have made for something so much better. Instead we just get the same old stuff as one survivor gets eaten after another and in your typical, boring manor. What's worse is that the final thirty-minutes just drag to the point where you'll be nodding off from boredom. It's a real shame that they couldn't have done more with the final act. Still, Jovovich turns in another good performance in the lead, although it's too bad they decided to wrap her up in a thick jacket instead of the skimpy clothing she wore in previous films. The supporting cast is also much better here, which is a plus. The CGI zombies are quite boring and all the fake computer effect gunshot wounds really add up to little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now i don't give long rambling reviews on films, i don't drone on about their effects, casting, writing or directing. I could for this film, the effects were great, simple, believable and effective. The casting was meticulous, (specifically the gorgeous Milla Jovovich). Basic writing and decent directing.However i feel the main issue with Resident Evil, is that the plots are becoming rather stale, take this one, Predictable end and action scenes. I will give credit for the opening scenes, they did grab my attention, however i feel the film would of lost my interest if Milla Jovovich wasn't kicking ass in shorts.Basically the film is relying on the simple format that is zombie films, Girls, Guns, Guts and Gore. But this system has made good films in the past and so probably will for Resident Evil.Obviously we can expect another, following the same typical ideas that conclude all Zombie-like films. Hopefully it will have a more interesting plot. I found this film to be worth viewing, but not twice, its good for a spare evening and especially if you've seen the others.Overall, quality, easy on the eyes, action is all anybody wants from a zombie film, and this delivers it perfectly. Worth Watching</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not too sure what happened with this movie but I don't think it was as good as the first one, and was equally as 'weird' as the 2nd. I do think that this trilogy is an example of what happens when a director takes on a project and another director tries to do a sequel to it.It's the same story with the 2 remakes of The Hills Have Eyes. In that case the guy who did the first apparently backed out of the 2nd one. In the case of Resident Evil, it's pretty much the same story. Paul WS Anderson did a pretty good job of the 1st movie, but the 2nd, directed by someone else, wasn't nearly as entertaining.This one, the 3rd installment, proved to be borderline disaster, especially with some of the dialog, was bad at times, survived only by a few good scenes (death scene near the end with the red lasers). I also noticed that the 3rd one took a few scenes from the original, and I'm not too sure if I liked that. Milla Jovovich looked stunning as normal, but now I am hoping she can talk Paul WS Anderson into coming back for the 4th. I really liked the last death in the movie where the zombie was sliced by the intertwined lasers but that was one of the few bright spots. I really think that to make Resident Evil Degeneration any better, you need the movies' original director, Paul WS Anderson. The other thing I liked about it is the last couple camera shots tell you there is going to be a 4th.I find it hard not to get hooked on the story, though. I really thought the 1st movie was good enough to buy the DVD but thought they took some steps backwards with the 2nd and this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew it wasn't gonna be like the first two when I saw the preview, but I was set on seeing it anyway. Well, it was disappointing yet satisfying, if that's possible. It didn't disappoint on gore, awesome zombie kill scenes (the highway/truck kill) and action. They changed too much stuff that was cool in first and second movies (like the digital Queen and the box Alice was kept in after the crash). Had some good lines and scenes, but overall, I didn't enjoy this as much as the first two. It's like Blade Trinity, which was good, but not as a Blade movie. Extinction: Good as a movie, but NOT as a Resident Evil movie. I'd watch it again, but there isn't as much enjoyment in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The latest remake...of extinction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Extinction follows much of the same structure as earlier sequels; the biovirus is out in the wild, zombies everywhere, Umbrella corp. Is the trying to benefit from its disastrous deeds and Alice(Jovovich) is developing overwhelming mutational skills. Comparing to earlier sequels this one is more like the first part, less humorous and action movie style than Apocalypse. Plot is not very convincing, main thrills seems to have been borrowed this time from Mad Max, Aliens, perhaps Hitchcock.Also, characters are indeed very thin as typically in action movies. However, Alice developing her physical and especially psychokinetic powers is very impressive theme (and as becomes evident in the film probably this will be developed in following parts?). All in the film goes on like freight train, much of action, much of horror, nothing much to note, nothing much to complain.Although the film may not be very satisfying itself (as compared to first part), the main theme (extinction) is. Haven't seen a movie, so successfully describing the deserts and hopeless lands after the world wide catastrophe. Extinction very successfully creates the feeling of post Nuclear War world. For that, watching it as an picturesque example of its theme, the film is just perfect. The colors, the deserts, the road movie theme (stolen, of course from Mad Max II), all seems to fit just fine. In that the film saves the day and probably boxed it home too, so hopefully we are too see more sequels (which probably won't be as much of quality(?). One more thing, the music is again quite impressive, a bit of ambient, a bit of metal. There's an interesting remake of White Rabbitt but I don't recognize the band...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, confession time. I like Milla Jovovich. I liked her in "Messenger", and I liked her in other roles. She is a good actress, and she is very cute.Here she is back as Alice, with fighting skills like no other mere mortal, and best of all, an immunity to the deadly virus that the undead are now carrying. A research group recognizes this and they have been cloning her in a deep underground research center, hoping to use the blood to develop an antidote that not only will prevent their getting the disease, but will also turn the undead into docile animals that they can train. With all this they could rule the world, and rebuild it to what they want.Ali Larter is good as Claire Redfield, leading a caravan of others, looking for a safe place to relax and live. One challenge is getting supplies, especially fuel. They find some notes that lead them to believe Alaska is uninfected, and they hope to travel there.For what it is, a very entertaining movie, its 90 minutes moves along very quickly, and the ending sets itself up for the next sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The third installment in the Resident Evil franchise is-the best. Now of course that doesn't say much-because the first two films-while completely fun-were mildly retarded.The film is another action horror romp with which we are all familiar with. The film's action is it's strongest asset (besides Milla). It has pretty amazing fight sequences-although they are far apart and short. They just leave you wanting more. It isn't a bad thing-it kind of restores excitement into the series. Another large asset, as previously mentioned is the ever beautiful Milla...although they almost photo-shopped her face out of the film with retouching. Still, she is as beautiful and edgy as ever. The CGI is well done too...not amazing...but it'll do.The film's weakest aspect is the acting. It is terrible-along with the casting of Ashanti-tisk tisk tisk-it doesn't take much talent to act and succeed in a Resident Evil film-but the fact that she couldn't is really depressing. Everyone else is just mediocre at best-and that is being nice. Another weak aspect is the diologue...it is so unbeleiveable, corny and campy, and not in a "we know we are corny...just go with it" way either, a "it is the end of the world...and I am gonna make an obscure-not funny joke OK?" sort of way IS THE DIOLOGUE IN THE FILM. The other weak aspect of the film is unfortunately the fact that Alice once again is devoid to any emotion-BIG SURPRISE-but it wasn't Milla-it was her husband. Alice see's a DITCH of dead clones of herself and doesn't say anything-she gets a slightly angry scowl on her face, but nothing more-no "I am gonna kill these motha f****as", just "It is payback time buster".So all in all the film IS FUN-while reserved (considering its predecessors) but this isn't "a revenge flick" or even "a horror flick"-it is an action flick and unfortunately it doesn't manage to be all three (even though it could have been done SO EASILY)! Well...we still get to see Milla, so...I guess it is an OKAY film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again Alice (Milla Jovovich)is place in a quest for survival from the undead created by Umbrella's T-Virus. To make matters worst her powers have become more dangerous for her to use.This time however she is a loner trying to stay away from others as often as she could because she is scared that anyone she comes close to would be place in danger.Dr.Isaacs (Lain Glen) has been creating clones of Alice to learn more about her powers and how to improve on it only if he can convince Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara) (Personally I don't think Jason was a good wesker whatsoever). Wesker is not impress with Dr.Isaacs plan to see if they could control the undead infected by the T-Virus.A brand of Survival lead by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) with members Carlos, SJ, Kmart and many more.They drive across the country to find a safe place that is left on Earth after the t-virus has spread through most of the world leaving only a few survivors.The movie takes place four years after Resident Evil Apocalypse and the virus has spread through out the Earth leaving few survivors and only a small band of survivors are willing to fight Umbrella.The movie feels a good mix of action and horror with many new characters and new monsters like the Crows make their debut in the movie replacing the lickers from the first two movies.Also the music fix the story of the movie for fans of the Resident Evil Series.I love the action scenes in the movie and how Alice and Claire become the real heroes of the movie. Both going through the challenges such as Alice's new powers and Claire's role as the leader of a convoy.All in all still a very good movie in the series if you're a fan of the series so I would give it a recommendation.I give Resident Evil:Extinction a 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid But Entertaining Junk Food</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I reviewed "Resident Evil: Afterlife", I mentioned that a lot of today's franchise movies-"the "Saw" sequels, the "Underworld" movies, and this one-just don't appeal to me. Sure, I can understand why they appeal to so many, but for me, they're nothing to go crazy for. However, I believe I also mentioned that the third entry in the series is the only one that I find worth watching, so I figured "Well, why not review it?" Taking place after "Apocalypse" (which is the worst entry in the series), this movie sees Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her crew-Clair Redfield (Ali Larter), Carlos Olivera (Oded Feher), Nurse Betty (ha ha) (R &amp; B singer Ashanti) and others now venturing the deserts of Post-Apocalyptic Nevada, looking for a way to survive. In the process, Alice has now gained a sundry of superhuman powers thanks to the Umbrella Corporation's T-Virus, and they haven't forgotten about her or the survivors. So now, Alice and co. must battle undead animals, a newer strain of fast zombie, new mutations, and more from the corporation.To enjoy a movie like "Resident Evil: Extinction", you must at first acknowledge that this isn't much like "Resident Evil" the video game series. Sure, it has Clair Redfield and the Umbrella Coporation, as well as monsters from the game, but this is ultimately "Resident Evil" fan fiction author's interpretation of the "Resident Evil" universe with a fan made character in Alice. Also, while I abhor the term "turn your brain off" when it comes to movies (even if I did, I'd still hate the "Transformers" movies), that's what you should do with these movies, because there isn't a whole lot going on from a thematic level other than "Billion dollar corporations are evil." This is pure, mindless crap from start to finish.However, this is shockingly enough, sort of fun crap. That's largely due to director Russell Mulachy (whose credits include "Highlander" and the underrated "Razorback"), who knows firsthand that he's directing B-Movie bulls#!t, and does it with a sense of playfulness and fun that's lacking from the other movies. The acting is also noticeably better from the prior installments, with Jovovich finally getting comfortable with the role of Alice, and everyone else-well, they aren't great, but they aren't terrible either. Add a few suspenseful set pieces (the best one involving zombiefied birds), a nice Industrial Rock score from "Saw" composer Charlie Clouser, moments of humor, some fun action, and a sequel ready conclusion that didn't annoy me, and you've got a watchable little movie.Sure, I could complain about the lack of logic, Alice having superpowers, the fact that the movie cribs lovingly from other, better movies (Romero's "Day of the Dead" for example)and so much more, but you know what? I won't. This is pure, stupid movie junk food. It might not be good, but it's satisfying for what it is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not everyone who watches Resident Evil movies has played the games - myself, for one. This means I can watch the films without measuring them against the computer games from which their inspiration is drawn, and consider them simply as films on their own merits.So, as episode 3 opens, the Umbrella Corporation's virus has successfully turned the majority of the world's population into ravening mindless zombies except for small pockets of nomadic normal people, an alleged normal community in Alaska, the remnants of the Corporation itself in its underground base, and Alice (it has also turned the world into desert for reasons which don't appear totally clear). Alice (Milla Jovovich, from the first 2 movies) is a lean mean fighting machine - sudden death for zombies. Also, she is in some respects specially developed by the Umbrella Corporation, whose resident mad scientist keeps trying to develop a cure from her blood.After a weak start - very much as if a particularly feeble video game was throwing random obstacles in the way - Alice falls in with a group of nomads and suddenly there is something at stake. The strength here is that the members of the group are particularly well defined individuals, unusually for this sort of movie, so that you do actually care about what happens to them.To be frank, there is nothing of any great consequence here to condemn or praise - it is a satisfactory zombie-killing movie, and provides an adequate conduit from episode 3 to episode 4.</fullReview>

This is the world where ravenous zombies attack in broad daylight.Resident Evil Extinction definitely takes the zombie genre in a new direction, breaking the conventions of the usual films in this category. Gone are the days where zombies roam dark, fog laden roads, where the survivors have only everyday items as weapons, where the zombies are the primary threat...The film uses wide camera angles to show the isolation of the last strand of survivors in this desolate environment. The cinematography is beautiful, from the wide open plains of the Nevada desert to the confined spaces of an Umbrella Corporation facility.The soundtrack follows a similar style from the last two films, with pounding techno-rock numbers that really get the blood pumping and mirror the relentless action that's on screen.Overall, this film follows the style over substance feel that the series has followed since day one however, it's one of those films you can watch with little thought. Pure entertainment! Worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The series of "Resident Evil" is the most classic movies among many which are also adapted from games. Surprised, in every sequel, the qualities of movie-making are above the average. Every time I watch it, it always can heavily strike terror into me. I think that the acting of the characters, the absorbing plot, and the excellent special effects are surely the causes of it being so popular.In "Resident Evil: Extinction", I find it quite astonishing that Alice can exert her mental supernatural power. This is totally different from its original settings. Before it, Alice showed her body strength to fight against the dead-walking all the way. In this 3rd sequel, Alice is not only a woman but already a savior of the whole world. It seems to be something excessively exaggerating to me. I like Alice who defeat all the dead-walking and save the survivors by her own strength, not supernatural power. Despite of something I dislike, I, just like a maniac, still love this movie very much. I really appreciate the bravery of Alice. Not fearing anything, Alice can survive on her own. I really wish to become her someday. I have already seen it many times. I enjoy every scene and the development of the story. After I watch it, I often feel excited and joyful. As long as you have once seen this movie, I bet you'll fall in love with it unless you don't like action sci-fi movie.</fullReview>

I'm not a fan of 'super' zombie's, however, I enjoyed this one more than the second.It was good to see zombies in a desert wasteland setting but the film has a cheap look to it in parts. Oded Fehr, Iain Glen and Mike Epps return, Ali Larter is a welcomed new addition as Claire, but the rest of the acting from the supporting cast isn't too wonderful.Milla Jovovich (despite a odd hair-cut) once again is just what the doctor ordered as Alice who develops her 'powers' throughout. There are plenty of tussles, zombie action, killer birds and it has some great ideas, themes and a surprise electrifying closing.Under Russell Mulcahy direction it has it's moments. There is one stand out segment at a gas station, but again, like it's predecessor it lacks the pulsing, foreboding, suspense and mood created by Paul W.S.

		<fullReview>Whereas it is easy to sympathise with Alien, Terminator, Matrix (etc.) fan boys for feeling shortchanged and insulted as they watched their beloved franchises complete the circle from B-movies masquerading as A-movies to ending up as D-movies, I'll never understand the Resident Evil crowd's objection to these flicks. The original video games were not brain food with lines like "Jill sandwich" and "you, the 'Master of Unlocking'" delivered by the most stilted voice actors heard since the Zelda CD-I games. Also, considering Romero and Co. have botched the simple concept of the zombie genre, it's fun to just escape into the post-apocalyptic fantasy land where slow moving flesh-eaters 'live' again.It helps that I never enjoyed the entirety of Mad Max, Alien Resurrection, The Matrix, Land of The Dead and any number of other movies this steals from. And that they only chose to steal the good stuff and trim away all the talky bits. So instead of all that cod philosophy horsesh*t and exposition meetings with the Yoda Oracle that bore you to tears, you get Milla Jovovovovavich able to bend time and space until Umbrella turn off her power switch. Simple.The film starts off with a clone Milla biting the dust: 'Evil corporation constantly cloning until they find the perfect specimen' cribbed from Alien 4. Steal from the best, I guess. This was cool. A concept so illogical that it pulls you into the fantasy. Cut to a Mad Max rip off of a truck or bus or whateverdafu*k pimped out in faux-Megaweapon armor dicing the head of a zombie as the kids aboard Dead Reckoning cheer. This was also cool... just because. Some other stuff happens like that annoying comic-relief character from the second movie getting bitten and Milla acting a more likable lead for once. Both very cool. Come to think of it, this movie is perfect at quickly dispensing with secondary characters you had just assumed would become permanent fixtures. "Mar, I don't like her... oh cool she's enveloped by crows!" it took him two movies to get there, but Paul Anderson now knows that people don't want to be annoyed by those on screen.Although this movie lacks fundamentals like a fortified mall or a Tenpenny Tower safe zone, a Milla ginger muff shot, and a scene of a drunk sniper in a cowboy hat taking gleeful potshots of ambling zombies fueling every ten-year-old boy's dream lifestyle (they used up all three by the second pic), it does have Super Milla64. An indestructible super badass who's super motorcycle boots drove me to cross dressing with super envy. All the wire work in the climatic super duper zombie showdown in a very sandy Las Vegas elicited the same "woah!" from me as when I first saw Ted Theodore Logan bouncing off the pillars wasting regenerating video game enemies with unlimited ammo. And that's kinda the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best in the Resident Evil series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was surprisingly watchable and I rate it the best in the Resident Evil series. The film carries on from where 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' stopped. The action is better staged and the VFX much better than the previous two films. There are some genuine scares and there's a chilling scene that works well as a homage to Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. Milla Jovovich has very few lines as always, but carries the film with her presence. The story is needlessly complicated and the climactic action sequences a letdown. Still watchable at least on television/DVD.Overall 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My summary title is thanks to professional reviewer Philip French and appropriately sums up this flick and my account of it.The opening scene shows the female lead nude in the bath and in the version of the movie I watched on cable has her naked body "bubbled out" and when any actor smoked a cigarette there was similar censorship; yet countless scenes of bloody killing with heads and bodies blown to bits are left untouched! This film is part of a series itself but basically the world is infected with a virus, zombies walk the earth, our heroine has supernatural powers,a few "goodies" are trying to survive in the desert, there is a mad scientist who is part of an evil underworld etc and whatever. Some clever special effects makes this "nonsence" more or less watchable. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very hyped for the release of this film, especially as i enjoyed the first 2 so much, and have played the computer games. Also i like Milla Jovovich a lot easily the best Female Action Superstar around today, she can kick Ar"". Very sexy and hugely enjoyable for all the boys. She's made a big impact on the action flick scene, and raised expectations for all future flicks, it's gone of the days where action men dominated the movie scene, we now want to see hot chicks with guns, and major cool action stunts and Milla always delivers, you want more and more. This movie does have it's high points and continues the story from the first 2 films, which is good, and often takes you back to the first and second films, the film has evolved from much more than just a zombie horror flick it has become a series like the games, and has been left wide open for a 4th because more needs to be answered, and I'm dying to see what the creators come up with next. And yes we do get a lot of blood, a lot of guns, a lot of zombies with more dogs and crows!!!! it was nice to see the cast from the second film return. I don't have anything that bad to say about it really just didn't quite reach the mark the second did, but still highly enjoyable. It was nice to see Ali Larter from Final Destination, i find she looks a lot like Milla, and before now got them both mixed up. I feel they could've used Ali more, but most likely didn't want to take the shine off Milla, not that you could! these films are her own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So the "Resident Evil"-movies have reached the trilogy-mark. Apparently the first movie trilogy based on a video game. I have to question if this is something admirable or not. The first two movies were mediocre at best, and this third installment is no exception.First of all the story (if it matters). The world has been completely destroyed by the virus, almost all humans are zombies and the whole ecosystem has failed because of the virus. Basically the world has been turned into one giant desert. In this wasteland a few human survivors roam, among them Alice (Jovovich). Meanwhile The Umbrella Corporation has continued their research.First of all i can say that this is probably the best-looking of the three movies. The sets are very nice and the world does feel desolate. But mostly the positive comments end there. Like in previous movies, the action scenes are the major problem i have with the movie. I don't understand what's so hard about making decent action scenes. Here we have crappy choreography, boring fights and firefights that look like people are just running around shooting randomly. There is a lot of blood and gore (obviously), but not even that manages to spice things up. I wouldn't go as far as calling the movie boring, but the more quiet moments in the movie are actually the ones that work best. And for an action movie, that's not a very positive remark.What surprises me most about this movie is that they let Russell Mulcahy direct. There are a few directors in the industry that i wonder why people hire, Mulcahy is definitely one of those. Incidentally, so is the even-worse Paul W.S. Anderson. If you look at Mulcahy's track record, there is very little (if anything) to be impressed of. He has churned out almost exclusively crappy movies. And you can also see that in the last few years he's mostly had to settle for directing TV. Why they would hire him for this movie is impossible to understand. But i guess that it's yet another sign that the bar is not raised very high when making a Resident Evil-movie...In the end i found this to be about as enjoyable as the first two movies. That is: not very. It's not utter crap, but it's still light years away from better action movies. The problem nowadays is that there are other zombie-movies being made that are so much better than these. "28 Days Later", "Dawn of the Dead" and "28 Weeks Later" for that matter, have raised the bar for the genre. Resident Evil doesn't even try to catch up. Which is kind of sad. I rate this 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very good Sci-Fi with violence throughout. Alice(Milla Jovovich)has been subjected to biogenic experimentation. She is pretty and pretty damn volatile with super-human abilities. Superior strength and dexterity and she is hiding in the shifting sands of Nevada. She joins forces in the desert with Carlos Olivera(Oded Fehr)and L.J.(Mike Epps). There are new survivors Claire(Ali Larter), K-Mart(Spenser Locke) and Nurse Betty(Ashanti) combining forces to eliminate a deadly virus that has been created to turn every human on earth in the living undead. Outstanding F/X and visually exciting with hard hitting action. Ashanti is very impressive. Others in the cast: Christopher Egan, Matthew Marsden, Joe Hursley, and Linden Ashby.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must admit, I had some high hopes after thoroughly enjoying the first &amp; second Resident Evil movies. The second more so than the first, left me interested to see what road they would take in the future if/when they did a 3rd film. Last night I got my chance to see this progression, and I turned the TV off wondering how I could regain the time I lost watching it back.In classic form, Milla Jovovich does well in the role she has taken on in these films. However, aside from reappearances Oded Fehr (Carlos), Mike Epps (L.J.), and Iain Glen (Dr. Isaacs), I thought the casting was simply a dice toss for the team behind this film. Ali Larter's part could have been much better, and the lack of characterization among the "Envoy" left absolutely no connection with them, resulting in not even a single care for who lived or died in the film. Roles I thought would be built upon would have been Ali's and Spencer's (K-Mart), but the script barely writes them in other than a few lines and some action sequences.Throughout the film there's little explanation for what happens between the 2nd and the 3rd film, other than the gradual "sucking dry" of the planet and some brief information from Milla regarding the situation with hacking satellites to stay hidden. It's unfortunate, as the 2nd film did well in creating the "Sci-Fi" element, blending a bit of "T-Virus" mutation with the "Super Human" element in which her character is built upon. Although the "Super Human" element was done well in the 2nd film, the 3rd goes a bit overboard with the "Ultimate Zombie Killer" persona as well as the "Now I have super telekinetic abilities as well" which was only -hinted- at the very end of the 2nd film. As such, the lack of explanation regarding the telekinetic abilities leaves a "Wow cool effects" but "boring" feeling.The end, however, is so forced and absurd that I almost shut the movie off minutes before it actually ended in absolute shock as to what was being implied. Not only did they leave an opening to film #4, they did so in such a pathetic and "how-the-heck-are-they-going-to-do-that" way that it's almost like they flopped film #4 before they even officially announced it. Likewise, absolutely NO follow up as to the status of the Envoy survivors almost completely removes the purpose of watching the hour of the film before the ending. What happens? Who knows...and who knows if we'll ever find out.3 out of 10, for cool effects, Milla in a Sci-Fi uber outfit that shows some leg skin, and the fact that it is, after all, a Resident Evil movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Countdown To Extinction or Shall We Await The 4th Part?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have been waiting for the third part of Resident Evil for so long that the very expectation has somehow overgrown the film itself. We had it all in first two parts ? great, sexy, smashing Milla Jovovich; dead men walking; suspense; special effects to the fore; always tense line of plot? And what did they offer us in the third and seemingly last part? Milla is still very sexy, she looks great even with her incredibly bad hairdos, she is sporty, strong and she fights like a man. There are dead men aplenty, and there are pools of blood a lot. The film starts not so convincingly and it goes a bit too slow and too repeated some time. But then, when other heroes appear and the action gets very tight, the film gets much better. Mind it, in today's realm of 4-hours monsters, this part with its mere 90 minutes seems a short condensed blast of pure energy. Maybe, there is not so much to think or ponder about, but who cares? After all, Milla is true to the end. She is cool, she may cry, she fights, she has a great physique, and yes, yes, fans of her body, she does appear completely naked couple of times. What else can be dreamed of? Jokes aside, the third part is a good entertainer and it holds your attention all 90 minutes + and you never regret you started watching it. The only question remains ? what does the end mean? Will there be the Fourth part? After the Apocalypse and Extinction, should we expect some Retaliation or, maybe, The Last Judgment? I do not know. But if the next part is the same fast and ferocious shot of naked energy (no pun intended), I would vote for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sorry for my English.It's a great zombie/action movie, but not in a Resident Evil style, the trailer lies about this movie, so don't watch the trailer before you watch this. This time Alice is on Nevada Desert trying to survive, with a little group of people, including Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), from Resident Evil 2 and RE - Code Veronica, K-MART played by the charismatic and pretty Spencer Locke, Carlos Oliveira (Oded Fehr) and the Nurse Betty (Ashanti). Best Scene: The best action scene for me, was the attack of the crows, was a really fun and very well made scene, after i saw this scene i was wishing that Hollywood made The Birds remake, and the only thing that was very disappointed for me in that scene was see Ashanti die. About Wesker: I loved that they put Alber Wesker, for me he's a really important character in the Resident Evil series, but the actor that they put to play him, it's just awful, terrible acting from him, they should have put someone else, someone with more experience.My conclusion: The best of the three? No. But it's not the worst of them. The worst in my opinion is still the second one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>endtroducing... Resident Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I just watched RE 3.. and I really have to say the writer (some Paul Anderson, apparently) does deserve credit for taking his profession to a whole new level. Seriously, he achieved something DJ Shadow did for music back in the days: making a whole album/script out of samples, without ever using one bit of content he came up with himself. Just that for a film, this concept somehow doesn't seem to work as well as it did for electronic music. The most obvious ripoff, as others have remarked before me, is of course from Day of the Dead - RE 3 is in fact barely short of qualifying as a remake: cf. the underground base with the zombies around the elevator area, the virtually identical telephone-scene with the "educated" zombie and the mad scientist etc., etc. But by no means does it end there. Other "featured" movies would include Mad Max, Alien(s), Matrix, X-Men, even The Birds... you name it. Virtually every scene feels like you have seen it somewhere else before, and as usual the originals were somewhat better.To be honest, apart from this, it wasn't that bad. Holes in the plot are frequent, yet not big enough to earnestly distract you, and dialog/acting is not bad enough to ruin the tension. Alongside low expectations, not having any relations to either the series or the game plus having a soft spot for Milla Jovovich (I loved the 5th element when it first came out) certainly helped making this flick quite tolerable for me. All in all, I felt adequately entertained, which after all is about the only reason one would watch an action/horror flick like this. Clearly in the "If You Got Nothing Else To Do, Might As Well Give It A Try"-category, 4/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never been much of a fan of the first two films (nor the video games), but this one I thought is somewhat an improvement in that it was entertaining and less showy. Thankyou. However I wouldn't make too much of it, when I still found it to be quite one-note with its plotting and covered with terribly conceived special effects. This one looks cheap, and it kinda shows in many aspects. What it concentrates is on its flashy style to storm up blistering action sequences and lets the expansive camera-work do its trick. The barren locations are well shot and the action is well handled without overplaying it. I wasn't so crazy about the erratic editing of the previous two "Resident Evil" films, but this one wasn't so bad and more often suitably focused. Some edgy, gripping and scorching set pieces do standout and the glum tone holds tight, but Paul W. Anderson's choppy story (which seems like a mixture of the first two movies) doesn't skip away from the basic one-tune to have much of a dent. Minimal post-apocalyptic b-grade nonsense with a standard script. The characters are so paper-thin, that they're never really annoy or gain your interest. To make matters worse the climax is pretty much a whimper. The performances are nothing special, and everyone goes by in a forgettable fashion. Well nearly everyone. Milla Jovovich's hell-bent turn is compelling, and Oded Fehr has a likable presence. Ali Larter is simply going throw the motions, and Ashanti is wasted but that's no complaint here. Russell Mulcahy's glossy direction stays snappy, and controlled. He throws in his fair share of cheap thrills, and the bloody make-up f/x are soundly executed. Some visuals do remind you of Romero's vastly superior "Day of the Dead (1985)". The soundtrack doesn't lend much of an impact, and the same can be said about the music score. Filled with flaws, but it works as enjoyable brainless fluff that keeps a fast-pace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-rated yet room for improvement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Resident Evil films have always been the centre of wide debate and opinion, with many people arguing they should have made the resident Evil films more... Resident Evil. Others say that they are still good action films that bring new elements to Zombie films. They are both right.It's hard to give a review of Extinction without some reference to the other 2 films so I will warn people that haven't seen them to not read any further for potential spoilers.In my view, Extinction brings to Resident Evil what we should have seen from the start: more imaginative ideas, the Umbrella Corporation and an improved storyline. However, disappointingly, it is too little, too late.For example, you cannot make a Resident Evil film without some reference to Umbrella and preferably, the characters from the games. Without linking the games to the films, there is the risk of creating a more bland plot.In the second Resident Evil they got the setting right and even added a character or 2 from the game (even the STARS briefly) but failed to provide action sequences that kept you glued to the film, with only one notable exception of the monster chasing Alice (it was only a brief scene, though). And the end battle was probably worse than the first.With the third Resident Evil, I was surprised at the inventive abilities of the film makers I thought were lost. First, (RE3 SPOILER BEGINS) we are given an introduction which makes you think we are seeing the first film, then perhaps the second film again, and for a few moments the viewer is confused. Then the film shocks you, and you think "That can't be right." You are confused some more, then you finally start to see what's happening. I don't want to go into details, but the way the film begins is excellent.We also get a heads-up about what has happened since RE2 and how the Earth has changed, why everyone has to stay on the run and the introduction of the main characters. Speaking of which, they finally did what they should have done in the 2nd film: introduced Claire. Jill appeared in the 2nd when it should have been the first, then she disappears and replaced by the much more talented Claire. She definitely helps the film become great instead of good, and her and Milla make an effective duo, with Oded Fehr supporting well. There is a good action sequence at the beginning of the film as well. Unfortunately the film does not contain any comedic phrases which I thought would be appropriate in the film, but it seems to me that they wanted to keep the film serious.In addition I felt that the general communication between characters and character development (except Alice) was weak; most talk that was done was insignificant and fairly frivolous. This was one point I felt they could have spent more time on.There are a few surprises throughout the film, however, which make up for the lack of lingo: some great action sequences, frights and unforeseen developments which are welcome additions. A quick example would be the crow scene - lots of crows and a disgusting thing to happen to you. So to an extent, there is horror - more than in RE2, but that isn't hard, and action and cool sequences tends to remain the focus of the films in this one. Personally, I would have preferred there to be an extra 20 minutes or so of character development and a longer lab scene at the end - the fight was too quick and generally Alice spent too little time underground.It was a welcome addition to see the Umbrella Corporation too, as well as Wesker, but I felt he could have looked more like Wesker from the game better. He doesn't play a major part in the film, but I felt he was assertive and cool/calm enough for Wesker's character, so I was happy with that.So overall I give this film an 8/10 for the great action sequences, imagination and surprising events in the film. It's what they should have done since the first film, however I felt it was a little too short to properly develop the characters and fine-tune the film to make it excellent. However I would still recommend the film as it brings a new feel to Resident Evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really not expecting that much from this movie - I just expected a followup to the previous ones. Especially since the producers hid the movie from the press, a move I can really not understand now, and since the last movie of Milla Jovovich, Ultraviolet, got horrible press and never was shown in any theater near me at all.But I have to say this movie exceeded my expectations and turned out to be really suspenseful and full of atmosphere, and overall a lot better than the previous one. Milla Jovovich is cooler than ever. The story is a lot more straightforward as well, and the action and fights could have been hardly better. Like all good action movies, it also contained humor, which, in this case, was rather black.It was however a bit sad that you had to know the previous movies to really understand this one and to fully comprehend all story twists, and I missed a bit the link between the last movie and this one.Its a good straightforward action movie, I can only recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another zombie movie that almost lives up to the hype</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw RE:E last night and I have to say that I was almost impressed. The movie plot borrows heavily from other zombie movies (the entire sequence where they attempt to "domesticate" the zombies is ripped directly from "Day of the Dead") but it still develops the series. I was disappointed at how LJ's infection and death were handled, his character had been shown to be a good guy who tried to do the right thing and yet when he's bitten he hides it and ends up infecting his own friend and letting his girlfriend give her life for him even though he was infected. The Olivera/Alice romance angle was unnecessary and poorly depicted, and the romance between LJ and Betty wasn't explored at all. The ending also comes up a bit short, we see the final convoy survivors boarding the helicopter and taking off for Alaska, but it's never revealed whether or not they made it and what happened. The movie was too concerned with an Alice/Tyrant battle scene and some plot points are forsaken for it.If you liked RE and RE:A then this movie sticks to the plot points and does fit the series well. If you're a zombie movie connoisseur, you'll likely hate this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent continuation to the RE series.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film I feel goes to extremes in areas, while on one hand it is extremely unlike the resident evil we all know, it is at times more like the games than the first two. Examples, the world has ended more or less and the Zombies have taken over the surface is very unlike the games, but the film is full of things from the games, but used subtly enough so as not to shove it in your face. The whole trapped obstacle course at the beginning screams the games (while the set is different the whole area rigged with deadly traps is very RE) The plot is driven forth by finding documents/notebooks again very RE and the Umbrella Lab looks brilliant, better than anything they designed in the games by far. Now for the plot, it was very simple, but then the film would have suffered from a very detailed plot, what was more important were the characters which were far superior to the previous films, and I suspect it has to do with Russel being appointed Director. Easily Anderson's best writing to date for characters although it's punch scenes seem to be a little less grand than the other films (the laser corridor in re and the nemesis shootout with the STARS in re:a) and the biggest disappointment was there were no monsters in the film apart from the staple Dogs and Zombies, the crows, while cool don't count and the Tyrant is only in it at the end. But that is more to do with budget than the script.The acting was far better in this film, and for once the supporting characters were well enough done for you to care about them or even just get a sense that they are real people in a bad situation. Unlike RE:A in which the main characters were planks and the support characters basically were just warm props.The action scenes were done very well, although at the beginning there is a little of the shot too close cut too fast syndrome but that evens out in the later scenes. The gore was good, not over the top like some rubbish zombie film but not as mild as the other RE films.The ending was a little off kilter, and lacked the big WHAM that Anderson usually ends the RE films with, I think less would have been more for this films ending, when you see it you will know what I mean.POSSIBLE SPOILERThe Tyrant was not too bad, but he didn't really grab me by the balls. I don't care if the Tyrant could still manage to talk a little, as after all he is still in the early stages of mutation but since the dialogue he did have was pretty cheesy and added nothing to the plot or film I think it could have been left out.Over all, I think it is a very good film, and I hope a 4th is in the works and they bring Russel back to direct.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually quite surprised at how good R E Extinction was, the other two were entertaining but didn't quite match this one i not sure why this was better though so you'll have to watch it yourself.There were a few confusions that i suffered during the movie the main one being that i wasn't aware there was a Statue of Liberty or the Effle Tower in Las Vagas, now i haven't ever been to Las Vagas before in fact i haven't been to America period so i can't comment that much apart from that i'm 99 percent sure the Effle Tower is in France. (i'm not sure where the Statue of Liberty is but i think it's on an island), For some reason they no longer have to shoot zombies in the head to kill them they only have to shoot them in the stomach of slit its throat in Millas case, Millas character of Alice was really strong in R E Apocalipse she could get thrown through a wall and get back up again where as in R E Extinction she gets a knock on the head from a ordinary guy and shes unconscious. Something i found funny was that Milla Jovovich has a new hair style which in a zombie infested world i think it would be hard to find a decent hair dresser.(Milla does look great i might add.) The fights and general action in extinction was good and the violence has stepped up a notch on the gore but not much else has changed.Resident Evil movies do take a lot out of other zombie movies but extinction does stay true to the original story of the other movies, i just wish they had brought Jill Valantine into this movie it didn't say whether she had died or separated from them or something.The characters in this movie all had very decent firearms they must have raided a gun shop or something, Milla had dual colt 45s which was cool and a lot of the other characters had glock 17s police issue in England, It was interesting that the truck driver had a SA80 assault rifle which is also English Armys chosen weapon. Resident Evil Extinction was a very good action/horror movie and i would recommend it as it does actually class as a horror since it was tense and made a lot of people in the cinema flinch. There are a lot of R E haters out there and i'm not sure why but thats just their opinion so who cares.I give Resident Evil Extinction 8 out of 10</fullReview>

Now when the third movie was released i was stunned, the effects and acting was better than ever, and the whole thing with Clair Redfield and Carlos etc was amazing, almost every game character was in the movie and they were very much alike the characters in the game.

I also love it for its' elements of love, friends and sacrifice. Well, I was pleased with the writers choice of adding characters from the game such as Claire Redfield. Form the 2nd installment, Carlos Oliviera and Nemesis were introduced. I felt that the writers gave every character some say in the movie. Everything was clear and straight-forward. Nothing was fuzzy for me. Yes, I would definitely ask anyone to watch this movie. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Middle of the road zombie flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I kinda expected to hate it. A work friend really wanted to see it and I got dragged along. I saw the first film, played the games and skipped Resident Evil 2. I wasn't expecting anything super amazing, but it is exactly what it claims to be: a rip off of every zombie movie ever made and a mash up of the games...so I can't complain. Don't expect Shakespeare and you should have a little fun. Pros: Some good action set pieces. Lots of Milla kung-fu against zombies and lots of blood splatter. Not actually scary but startling at a few points. Doesn't take itself seriously and gives a few nods to its predecessors and the game itself. Cons: Huge leaps in logic. Creating super zombies with the ability to think...uhh...bad idea. The good guys weld protective cover over their vehicle windows that can be ripped off without a thought. Flamethrowers that should have been used at the BEGINNING of the battle. They also occupy a camp and don't even search the buildings first to see if maybe a zombie is creeping around. Too much slow motion. Also, anyone can fly a helicopter! Overall: its a rental or matinée. Not terrible and not great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie rocks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all if you haven't seen the first two Resident Evil movies, you will probably be confused if you try to see this one. The t-virus has spread tremendously and has taken over the world. Alice is still trying to take down the Umbrella Corporation and they are trying to take Alice down, but she isn't going to let that happen. The movie takes place in the desert where Alice is traveling on her own because she knows that if she is with other people, she can put them in danger. That is why after the Raccoon City disaster, she took off on her own. Meanwhile other survivors of the Raccoon City incident, are looking for gas, food, and whatever other supplies they can find to help them survive. Alice eventually joins the survivors, including the familiar faces from apocalypse Carlos and LJ, and suggests to Claire that there is a possibility that the virus has not spread to Alaska and they should try going there where they might be safe.So now the new goal is to get to Alaska but of course they have to fight some zombies along the way. What I love about this movie is all of the action stunts and there is more action than the second movie. Its always fun to watch Alice fighting the zombies. I wish they hadn't killed off some of the other characters because it would be interesting if they had more about these characters in the story line. Overall I loved the movie it was well executed and exciting, I definitely wasn't bored. If you liked the first two movies, you will like this one so don't listen to those reviews that completely bash the movie because in reality it was not bad at all and I enjoyed it a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never thought that Alfred Hitchcock and Mad Max would meet this way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For continuity, let me just mention that the main difference between this latest installment and the previous one is an actress by the name of Sienna Guillory. In Resident Evil 2, she was really good and stole at least half the show from Milla Jovovich, giving the movie an additional dimension. When I watched it, I was so na?ve as to think that because she was so good, she'll be brought back on RE-3. That, of course, would be exactly the reason why she would NOT be brought back.RE-2 is basically a continuation of Project Alice's saga in a Mad Max setting, a post-global-disaster world that we have grown used to, even if not already tired of, seeing in movies. The structure of parallel action lines that was so effective in RE-2 was once again deployed, a wise decision. We have the global underground (literally meant) evil powers (dressed in business suits), the please-come-root-for-me convoy (dressed Mad Max style) and of course Project Alice (dressed too heavily). They eventually converge, needless to say, and propel towards a grand finale, all nicely by the book.For a movie of this genre and this caliber, nothing much needs to be said. After a slow and formulaic start that relies far too much on the cheapest and most incompetent tool of scare-by-loud-bang, the movie did pick up momentum and entertain me. What I like best about it is the retro aspect. I don't mind their "borrowing" a scene from Hitchcock's "Birds"; in fact I rather like it because the special effect is well done. The employment of an post-apocalyptic Las Vegas is a cute little idea, and good marks to the crane shot of the Statue of Liberty (replica in Vegas) paying tribute to "Planet of the apes".The ending is hinted right at the beginning. Will RE-4 be far away?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you've seen Day Of The Dead, you've basically seen Resident Evil: Extinction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, a warning. This is extremely filled with spoilers. I checked the box but there is a lot of spoilers. Just wanted to give you that preference first.I had really high hopes for this film but from beginning to end, it just left me utterly disappointed. If you're expecting much from this, readjust your radar or else you'll be disappointed like I was.My biggest gripe was this was just another zombie movie. Truly it was that. There wasn't much intrigue, not a lot of suspense, it wasn't even really all that action-horror that the other two had. It was simply... Resident Evil characters layered of the plot of George Romero's Day Of The Dead. Let me summarize why this is for you: 1. A group of scientists and the military hide in a bunker underground as the world is over run by zombies. In RE:E, Umbrella is hiding in underground bunkers throughout the world as it is being over run by zombies.2. The scientists are trying to domesticate the zombies. In RE:E, Dr. Issacs is trying to domesticate the zombies.3. Domestication goes badly and Bub the zombie turns on his "trainers" shooting them with a gun. In RE:E, Dr. Issacs is bitten by one of the super zombies he creates with blood from Alice's clones.4. The group of "heroes" takes a helicopter and escapes to a remote island where there was no chance of the infection spreading. In RE:E, Claire and the remaining members of her convoy escape via Umbrella helicopter to Alaska where radio transmissions state there is no infection, and that people are living happy lives outside.There could be more, but this is just me going on what I definitely saw.This movie wasn't enough of a Resident Evil movie and became much more of a typical zombie movie. We had your stereotypical guy gets bite by the zombie and hides it only to turn at a critical time (LJ), someone holds back a group of zombies to save others (Nurse Betty), and the guy bitten by zombies who forfeits his life to save others (Carlos). All of these were played out in all the other zombie movies we've seen. And it's especially unfortunate that Carlos is fate is so stereotypical. The actual event was decent but it still boiled down the same old plot device.And then let's talk about plot holes for a second. There is no explanation of what happened to Jill Valentine or Angie Ashford. Oh and as for why Alice separated from the group and was by herself for the part of the movie, that was covered in like a minute conversation between her and Carlos. And they barely explain Alice's new found powers and why she suddenly has psionic powers.And character development. Really, and truly, this was sad. Claire Redfield is brushed over. She runs a convoy of survivors, looks for ways to survive, but they don't really do a lot on her background. K-Mart, who is Claire's "baby sister" in a way, has a brief conversation with Alice simply covering the fact that she was found at a K-Mart and everyone she knows is dead. Not a lot more then that. I would have cared more if they had developed these characters better.The best character development was that of Dr. Issacs and Albert Wesker, even if Wesker only appears via hologram from the Umbrella facility in Tokyo. Wesker's evilness is portrayed well in the brief scenes we see him in and Issacs is shown to be a true son of a bitch which makes you definitely enjoy it when he comes to his demise.I will say this on the positive. The actual action sequences were very good and still hold true to those of the previous ones and definitely seem like something you could see in the games. This was a nice touch. Alice vs Tyrant, convoy versus seemingly never-ending box of zombies, and even the infected crow battle were definitely things you'd expect to see in the game.Unfortunately the ending left me a little sour. Let's just say they leave it open for a fourth, but you probably won't want to see it by the time you get done. Let's just say it appears every facility has a Queen and Alice makes nicey nicey with the White Queen in this one. Oh yeah, and we never actually do see if Claire's group actually makes it to Alaska... guess that could be another tie-in for the next one.... if they make a next one.It gets a 4 for the action spots and showing how truly evil Dr. Issacs is, but everything else came in sub-par. Doesn't seem like Anderson really tried like he had in the first two movies. Just a shame. If there's a fourth one, I hope it redeems some of the badness of the third.Bottom line rating, a good time-killer, go see it with friends and have fun movie. But if you're looking for something that takes the Resident Evil franchise in the next direction, don't look here. Go play the next game when it launches, that will move the franchise. This unfortunately took it a step back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad. However, worst of the series this far!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I want to make clear that this movie did not live up to my expectations given the characters that are depicted. For instance, Albert Wesker is in this movie but they didn't use him at all! Albert plays a vital role for the Umbrella Corporation and he is not a meeting chairman. I don't believe his name was even introduced leaving people who don't know about the characters in the game would never have known. Also, Wesker was depicted horrifically wrong in my opinion. Overall, this movie gets 5 of my 10 stars. Although the entire Resident Evil movie trilogy doesn't follow the game in anyway, their versions are horrible. This is the worst of the Resident Evil movies that were produced. I don't understand why they wanted to do drastic leaps in time from the second movie. How on earth did the entire world get swarmed into darkness and become an almost complete wasteland and why would they want to film it in that condition? I might never find out... The good things about the movie is that they are finally progressing to utilizing the t-virus to make more powerful creatures, the Tyrant for example. Also, the countless attempts to domesticate the zombies to create a living world again is pretty cool. When I was in the theater that part of the movie received a lot of laughter as the zombie tried to use the cell phone and put shapes into the child's toy that they gave him. The laughter ceased as the zombie couldn't get the last shape in and killed 2 of the 3 scientists trapped inside. The special effects in this movie were pretty good as well. Overall, I really hope that they re-think their plots and create something that follows a little but of the Umbrella/Resident Evil storyline instead of creating their own storyline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Resident Evil: Apocalypse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RE:E was a much better entry than the second film in this series because while there were a number of problems with the film that others have noted (kill zombies by cutting their throats, predictable guy-hiding-infection, etc.), this film did not feel like a pure action film, which is what I felt RE:A degenerated into.Milla Jovovich is as attractive as ever, and there are a number of nice homage sequences to the first film (including the demise of the megalomaniacal researcher from hell). There is an interesting infected bird attack sequence which was somewhat suspenseful though it suffered from "gee, look at all the CG birds" and what I feel was a survival rate that was too optimistic?given the whole one peck and you're dead scenario.One flaw with the film is that it falls back on the old ugly stereotype. If you're not hot, you must be evil/psychopathic/quite stupid (e.g. the apparently only surviving rednecks in Nevada who trick Alice into assisting them before letting a bunch of infected dogs attempt to maul her). Also, it would have been nice for Alice to actually look like she was surviving in a post-apocalyptic world rather than like some nice makeup lady was rubbing glittery gold makeup on her face after every take. Milla is hot?she doesn't need makeup distracting from what should have been the overall grime and dirt of the film.Overall at the end of the film one gets a distinct impression that the only way to stop an army of Alices will be with a neutron bomb?especially given her newly acquired, though draining, psychokinetic powers. Hopefully such a flick won't become just an action movie, though I don't quite see how suspense might be maintained unless Alice somehow loses control of her army to the Umbrella Corp.?or they create one of their own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. RE:E was actually watchable...!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RE:E is entertaining and quirky in the spirit of the first Resident Evil. Having been psychologically scarred for life by "Ultraviolet," I for one was all too wary of placing credence on Milla's name alone as an indicator of a movie's quality. But, fortunately, RE:E comes through. It is decent. Hooray. I think what makes the Resident Evil franchise (the games and the films) successful in general is that it is inventive and interesting. While RE:2 may have had the largest budget of the series, it was bloated, plodding, and artistically threadbare. With RE:E, you have a more refined and engaging film experience without all the overpriced gimmicks. Yes, it could have been more, but, in terms of expectations and actual product, I felt RE:E was rather well done.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was great although there were a few things I found weird in the movie...as for e.g. the way Olivera and LJ were killed...Weren't they supposed to have the anti-bodies since the last movie? They should have killed them some other way...like being eaten to death or their eyes been eaten by the crows and then let them be killed in some funny way..like a zombie coming for them and them blind. Something else I didn't like were those "superhuman" powers Alice and Dr. Isaacs had. I think a sword fight ala Jet-Li style would've been better And there's some other flaws..like..right in the beginning...the bus kills a zombie and the blood splatters all over the people on the windows, isn't that supposed to get them infected since its a blood virus? or when LJ turns and bites Olivera, and the blood on Olivera's arm is dry. And why couldn't Alice just kill zombies with her thoughts since she had special powers? Like..make their heads blow off? Overall i give it a 7 because right now to me its one of the best movies compared to whats in the theaters right now</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing more than Chapter 3.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a Horror fan who has learnt of Resident Evil not through the original Capcom game, but through the Hollywood films, I've very much enjoyed the first film, and very much more the second. Extinction, the third title in the Resident Evil anthology, on the other hand, has very little (if at all) cinematic value besides being another chapter in the story.The screenplay is nice and fits right in with the rest of them, but in this case lacks the good plot twists we've learnt to expect after the first two films. The story connects beautifully with the ending of the second film, is a great start for the coming fourth, but not that goo on its own. Not much good or bad can be said about the script.The acting by the cast is good as always, Milla Jovovich and Oded Fehr are a great as they've been before, and Ali Larter (as this film's female addition to Jovovich) isn't another Femme Fatale like in the first two films, but more of a leader. Not much good or bad can be said about the direction and cinematography.All in all, as I've said, besides being a nice conclusion to chapter 2 and a preparation for chapter 4 - chapter 3 isn't much. Definitely my least favorite of the series so far. I very much hope that Afterlife will return to the glory of the first two films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never thought Post-Apocalyptic Horror with Zombie Birds would be this decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oh yes, I enjoyed "Resident Evil: Extinction" quite a bit. I liked the first one, nothing wrong with it really. I was a little bit disappointed with how the second one turned out, on some levels. But this third one really felt to me like it put the whole concept and storyline back on the rails again. As far as that goes, the post-apocalyptic setting - and me being a sucker for it - had even little to do with it. But in general, yes, it did grab a hold of me. For such a setting, it totally had the right look &amp; feel, just like it should. The zombie crows were undeniably cool, whether you liked them or not. A bit sad they only had them featured in one action scene. What I did like about the previous film, was the hint at the ending regarding Milla's character developing telekinetic abilities. I was really satisfied to see a bit more of them in this film. I'm granting "Extinction" a whole extra point for the sole reason it managed to entertain me the most out of all three films so far. Unexpectedly, this turned out my favorite so far. Not bad, for a third film. And for once, I don't mind seeing a horror franchise go on, as I have some hopes now for 2010's "Afterlife" installment. And I fear the day they'll write Milla Jovovich out of the series. I hope they'll call it quits before that ever happens.</fullReview>

THis one is just plain awful.From the where did the telekenisis that came out of nowhere and was not even really explained(bird scene), to characters we don't care about(just about all of them) to characters just inserted to do nothing but die to the characters that we kind of liked from the first that don't do anything interesting. I guess that what it is. It's just not an interesting movie. You leave the movie saying "that was just boring" I thought the idea of Wesker was going to be awesome, but they did nothing with it. It seemed as though this script was a first draft that no one did any work on.A bad director with a bad script with a bad movie. I liked the first Highlander which is the film this director did early in his career, but check out the straight to video garbage he has done since and you will see how he is just a hack director with not directing ability.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three years after "Apocalypse," "Extinction" finds our heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich) on her own and in search of survivors. The T-virus that was unleashed on Raccoon City has now expanded all over the world, and now the majority of humanity are now the walking dead (they're never referred to as zombies), and the survivors are trying to band together.She makes her way to the desert of Nevada, and come into contact with her old friends Carlos (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps), who have joined with other survivors led by the gutsy Claire (Ali Larter).Unbeknownst to Alice, she is being tracked by Umbrella Doctor Isaacs (Iain Glen), after she thought she destroyed the homing beacon they placed in her during "Apocalypse." The gang heads to Las Vegas for food and gas, and plan on heading to Alaska where Alice discovered there's a group where the virus never reached. But in Las Vegas they're attacked by hordes of the undead, and Alice realizes that she's still being tracked.She heads to the Umbrella compound in the desert to settle the score once and for all, and to hopefully put an end to the virus for good.Just like with the first two "Resident Evil" movies, "Extinction" delivers on the thrills and action, but falls short on the storyline and characterization. So if you're looking for a film that has nothing but mindless action, this is the one for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of the games, then you would have probably mildly enjoyed the first two films in the "Resident Evil" franchise. Part one found a group of soldiers exploring an underground labyritnth of lab rooms and crawling with the undead, with only a few people making it back to the surface alive. The "T-Virus", created by scientists working for the Umbrella Corporation was unleashed into the lab, which started the whole horror. "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" found the "T-Virus" making its way to the surface, killing off the residents of Raccoon city, beneath which the Umbrella Corporation had built the secret lab that contained the virus. When it broke out, the Umbrella Corporation blockaded the city, attempting to keep infection within its walls.Where you thought it was over, it turns out the horror had only begun. The T-Virus, which is spread from one person to another through blood contact, has plagued the world and all of the continents have dried up, turning into barren wastelands in "Resident Evil: Extinction". Milla Jovovich returns with another strong performance as Alice, who was the main character in the first two films, having survived and then kidnapped and tampered with by Umbrella now. Now she's loose, fighting the undead and trying to stay alive in the Nevada desert. When Alice comes across a convoy making a desperate stand to stay alive, together they join ranks to bring Umbrella down and to find a cure for the virus.Highly unbelievable, Resident Evil manages to be an exciting horror fantasy, and this third installment is the best. The cinematography, writing, and acting are all top notch here. Director Russel Mulcahy makes this entry run smooth, with plenty of gore and scares to keep die hard horror fans interested. Milla Jovovich is still the best, the tough girl who can do anything. It's campy and fun the whole way, but with a rather disappointing climax. The action is absolutely the best here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im a big fan of the Resident Evil franchise and play the games often. I have now watched all three movies and can say that I am Extremely disappointed in extinction.1. If the planet has been infected for the last few years, then why haven't any of the zombies rotted away? Virus or not, the elements are going to eventually wear away dead flesh, so why not just wait them out? 2. What the hell was this new psychic ability Alice had? 3. Why didn't all the trucks in the convoy have a mesh on the front windshield? Isn't it convenient that when the school bus is attacked by infected crows that this is the vehicle that doesn't have a mesh on the front windshield.4. If the convoy had been out there for a few years, then why was this the first time they had ever encountered the crows? 5. Why is every scientific or military facility ALWAYS overrun or manages to become infected? 6. The facility had hundreds of Zombies pressing against the fence but they couldn't get in, but a few infected crows pressing against an OSHA approved school bus windshield where able to smash through....7. Why was the ambulance able to travel all the way across the desert but when it was time to haul ass they conveniently got stuck??8. Of course the school bus crashes into the only utility pole in broad daylight.9. If fuel was so scarce then how was the overloaded helicopter supposed to transport all of the survivors to Alaska?10. Knowing there is a possibility of Zombies around, then why in the hell does every passenger in the convoy get out when they arrive in Vegas? Very very very disappointed, I love horror and Sci Fi, but at least make them plausible......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil Extinction Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ridiculous, nonsensical and grossly unnecessary, Resident Evil: Extinction is quite possibly the most contemptible film so far this year. Lacking any faithfulness to the original video game franchise, as well as failing to expand upon the already pointless plotting of the first two films, this rehashed mishmash of utter idiocy is a giant leap in the wrong direction for film-making. The saddest part of this whole ludicrous ordeal is that despite what critics will inevitably say about Resident Evil: Extinction, the fans who actually expect something out of this farce will be even more disappointed.Alice (Milla Jovovich) rejoins a group of weathered survivors of the T-Virus zombie invasion of the world, which has led to the near-complete annihilation of humankind. Teaming with Claire Redfield (Ali Larter) to help plan an escape from the barren deserts of Nevada, Alice must also uncover the plot behind her mysterious cloning and the key to stopping the zombie outbreak for good.Starting with all-too familiar scenes from the first film which doesn't serve as a recap but begs the audience to question whether this is actually a new movie or not, the purportedly final chapter in the Resident Evil film trilogy lunges down the racetrack with an awkward stumble. Instantly milking each scene for as many cheap scares and sudden loud noises that it can muster, the camera mimics the style of the video game, tiptoeing down corridors and hallways, and peering through bloodied doors. The detail oriented sets and wonderfully ghastly locations and props are perhaps the only noteworthy aspect of the film. It's a shame that as make-up and creature effects get better, the story and acting get exponentially worse.Milla Jovovich is a total badass ? thanks to the editing which is careful to make sure the audience is completely disoriented and unable to focus on any of the stunts or martial arts moves in any of the fight sequences. Mutilated dogs, long-awaited zombie crows, and frenzied super-aggressive zombie mutations are all a blur as Alice dances about in mid-air and in slow-motion, a la The Matrix. While a few of the zombie encounters demonstrate decent shotgun-to-the-head, close-encounter originality, the majority of the gunplay and wire-fu stunts are hokey and downright laughable. Which perfectly matches the acting, replete with cliché lines, bland characters, expected deaths and moronic sacrifices.For all the time the film takes to develop its paper-thin characters, it shovels them out into clamoring blood-hungry zombie hordes to be made quick work of. Several of the character names match those from the video games, but you won't find an ounce of authenticity to any of their performances, physical appearance or backgrounds. Which, again, makes it all that more appropriate that so many victims are thrown into the wake of the living dead.Alice gains a bit of telekinetic superpowers (I don't recall that in the video games), the world becomes a desolate post-apocalyptic desert wasteland (I don't recall that in the video games) and Alaska may be the last hope for uncontaminated survivors (that has to be in the video games). Umbrella Corporation still runs everything, mercilessly experiments with the T-Virus, and employs psychotic scientists who are destined to become more powerful, evil and mutated than the zombies. At least the humans are more prominent villains than the bumbling undead. I would hate to think what would happen if the audience was actually frightened by flesh-eating, blood-starved, maniacally-crazed, decomposing zombies.- Mike Massie</fullReview>

It is incoherent, nonsensical, boring, meaningless, unexciting, tedious, stupid, moronic, and just plain utterly deadbeat. There is no proper story of any kind, no characterization that makes the least bit of sense, and to top it off they go and retouch beautiful Milla's face, as if she didn't look good enough alfreakin'ready. The sheer dumbness of this production is just off the scale. Complete trash, waste of celluloid, time and people.And that's the best I can say.Spoilers? This entire movie is a spoiler. A spoiler of life and time. Avoid like the plague. 'Tis the reign of resplendent incompetence.I have given a name to my pain, and it is Resident Evil: Extinction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The desert agrees with her</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody loves Alice (Milla Jovovich). Every time I see her I think she never looked this good. Although from a strictly logical perspective this seems dodgy at best, it's true in a way, since she keeps changing her look and refining her style. None of which helps "Extinction", of course. It has its moments, but those are the scenes reprising Alice's stunning entrance from the first movie. "Extinction" really feels like the third installment with the ideas running out. They even lifted the subtitle of the "Jurassic Park" franchise. It will be especially disappointing to those who have seen the out-of-this-world cinematic trailer. It's not so much that the trailer compresses the movie's best bits. It's more that, in retrospect, the trailer seems like a preview of an entirely different movie. Also, I'm not sold on Alice's outfit, credited to Jovovich's fashion label Jovovich-Hawk. Although it doesn't look bad, it falls way short of the red dress, no pun intended. Also, I have a nagging suspicion there is no other girl in the world who could get away with these rags. The same goes for her haircut. The role of the hard-bodied super-powered trans-human desert doll obviously agrees with her. Get over Alice, I tell myself. It doesn't work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this movie to me was very good and action packed. However, I am not a movie critic just an average guy that likes to see loads of head shot action. If I were a movie critic I would probably say it was not very good. I was impressed that they picked up from the last one, as they did not seem to forget plot points I thought they might have from part two. The only thing missing were the little girl survivor from the last movie along with the Jill Valentine character (which made me a bit sad). Still, one could just figure they died along the way so their absence by no means hindered the plot. So what is the plot, the world is overrun by the undead, infected by Umbrella's t-virus. Umbrella still exists, still experimenting for the good of themselves. Survivor's roam the lands, some by themselves...Alice for example, some as tightly knit roving communities on wheels that include a couple of familiar faces from part two, and then there are rednecks, who are idiots that deserve what Alice does to em. Alice meets up with her old friend and the caravan and plot a course towards possible salvation, meanwhile an Umbrella scientist once again locks in on her and needs a blood sample. Yes, this movie has loads of zombies and other nasty creatures and it has lots and lots of action. From an undead crow attack, to a Las Vegas zombie attack to a final showdown in one of Umbrella's hive facilities. This movie was very good and if this is the last one it ends on a good note in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil, part 3. The story continues so it would be a good idea to watch the other two as well before seeing this one otherwise some things will be missed. So where are we now? Alice is roaming the Earth, the T-virus has escaped from the laboratory, and survivors are on the run. Oh, and not to forget, Umbrella Corporation is chasing Alice. So, all in all, more of the same.When I was watching this film I was more than once reminded of the Mad Max series and some other post-apocalypse films but not in an entirely bad way. The start of the film is a wee bit slow and there are a few odd bits in there that don't exactly match up with the previous two films, but the complete set is pretty much OK, apart from the slow start.The ending gives a good reason for a part 4 to be made and if it does get made I will be seeing it. This film could have been better, but it was a worthy watch as it is, if you liked the first two that is. Personally I loved the soundtrack, it matches the film very well. Especially the song that plays when the ending credits start.Good enough, 7 out of 10 shooter up games made into film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've been waiting for this movie to come out ever since I walked out of the theater after watching "Resident Evil: Apocalypse", and I must say I wasn't disappointed. Well, maybe a little, but only because Jill Valentine is missing from this installment...where did she go? This movie does a great job delivering what it promised...thrills, scares, zombies (though not enough for my tastes) and a kick-ass heroine who may have super-human abilities but is still human at heart. The storyline, I thought, was fine; although not as fleshed-out as it could have been. I would've liked to know how Claire and her caravan met Carlos and LJ or what happened to Jill and Angie. It would have been nice if they'd tied some more elements of the games into this.** SPOILER! ** But the writers did a good job of reminding everyone that even though you can be tough and quick, you are not invincible...which they made clear when LJ turned zombie and Carlos sacrificed himself to help the others escape and to get Alice underground to face Dr. Isaacs (I still can't believe Carlos is gone!) Clearly, the ending indicates there will be a 4th movie, which will be interesting to see how they'll do it...looks like it'll be an original story, just like the 1st movie. The only thing I'm worried about is that it'll end up being stupid, with Alice and her hundreds of clones trekking to Japan to take out Wesker. And I'm really hoping it won't be. Overall, a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must profess to being somewhat a fan of both the first and second RE movies (having watched both several times), so was quite looking forward to the third instalment, especially having read some of the comments by other posters on the site. Unfortunately the film failed to live up to its predecessors in every way. The musical score, right from the start, was poor and largely grated on the nerves, unlike the smooth hypnotic sections from the first two movies. The film had 'b' movie written all over it, the acting was passable at best, the script poor and some of the set pieces laughable (alfred Hitchcock anyone). Its a shame the series has ended (assuming it has) on such a low note.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jovovich in Tomb Raider and X-men mode against Zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My comment isn't that different from what I wrote under 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse'. Of course the reason why I watch this one is quality time with family and curiosity regarding the 'heroine's quest'. If this one's a hit then there will surely be another sequel.It ain't that different 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' except that this one has a few more famous actors, it takes place in the desert and it's mostly set during daytime. Our 'heroine', next to being a Tomb Raider hotty, also acquires some X-men superpowers. She's fighting zombies again but this time she's accompanied by the talented Ali Larter and the non-talented Ashanti among a few others. You alos get to see a lot of blood and gore which is (un?)intentionally presented in a comic way.This time the zombies are a result of bad makeup as they look a lot tackier than before. The background score is very similar to that of 'Resident Evil'. Also the director tries to pull a little bit of Alfred Hitchcock's 'Birds'. There are several laugh out loud moments (which certainly wasn't the director's intention).Jovovich's acting is alright. She does look very beautiful in deglam. The rest of the actors don't have anything to do. Even the talented Ali Larter is wasted (but maybe there's something for her in part 4).This film has absolutely nothing new to offer as it's full of clichés and predictability. It seems to be leaning more towards one of those mindless forgettable summer blockbusters. Forgettable entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two Hundred of Milla's Legs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this with mixed expectations; ever since "Transformers" caught me by surprise and thrilled me, I never know what to expect. Perhaps some clever artist usually in the background might do something special that grabs. Later chapters in series films often allow this, as they are better engineered generally.I saw the first of this series and thought it surprisingly full of cinematic ideas. Not particularly novel, but notable. Milla understands the camera. There's something happening in film types for women and its not inconsequential that Milla's body type is working where Tomb Raider's didn't. This body type is usually associated with Eastern European women in porn and its cousin fashion modeling at the supermodel level. It starts with Nastassja Kinski, and how Polanski and then Shrader directed her. I think she was a significant influence on this.And there's the fact that Nastassja was lovers with those two directors, and Milla also with her two best. I expected that to show here. Even though her husband isn't directing, he is the producer and owner of the franchise. And he chose an energetic Australian to direct. I'll never avoid an Australian. She was redheaded in the first one. I knew that she would not be here, but her sidekick Clair would. It matters with this woman definition business.I sorta liked it. There's not much imagination in anything: zombies are ordinary zombies. Sets are ordinary, more from the stagy than the realistic side. The technology is distractingly goofy ? does anyone take any of this seriously? We were supposed to have already two generations of tech-savvy kids. The story is the ordinary business about an evil corporation that controls the world and ruins it. Even the underground stuff is borrowed. But what does work. No I'll say it differently: what I think matters here is how her fight scenes are composed. Now, you should know that she is not human. She's part human, part machine and has some supernatural powers that are probably explained in a teen-daft way in some game material. So you get lots of triumphal shooting and especially slicing with some scimitars, usually associated with pirates (coming from north African Arabs, so associated with them too). Lots of fight poses.I believe those poses are not derived from any martial tradition, or cinematic template, but are designed to showcase certain parts of her body, and how she moves. Its not about boobs here, but thighs. Everything in this movie revolves around her thighs. What you would normally think of as key shots associated with anchoring the narrative serve a different purpose. They shown her pelvis and always the same movements. I suppose they did some audience testing on this since the first one. The story is targeted toward the what happens at the end: she kills her creator and nemesis, and discovers hundreds of copies of herself, all nude of course. Its pretty clear what they intend here.Maybe it won't stick. But I bet it does. If it doesn't, it will be because her previously boyish face has been so surgically smoothed and puffed it seems inhumanly repellent.

All of us waited four years for this next installment and it was awful. There are so many things in the movie they could have done better. The one thing that bugged me was that Dr. Isaac mutates after being bitten by one of the zombies he fed the "special" serum too, but none of those zombies mutated after being injected with Alice's blood/special cure. Why would be change and be the "ultimate" being but nothing happens to the other zombies. The whole movie wasn't put together as well as the other two.

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, I consider myself to be a somewhat shrewd critic of zombie movies in general. I found the third installment of Resident Evil: Extinction, to be a very overproduced rehashing of what we saw in the first two films, with a few borrowed extras from the horror movie genre. My first critique is the makeup effects. I understand surrealism and suspension of disbelief, but the heroines of this film looked like painted up geishas from start to finish. It should've been a music video. The cinematography was brown and orange, in fact, when i close my eyes and think of this film, i just think of how shiny everyone was. Second, the acting left something to be desired, but then again, that may have just been a product of the dysfunctional style of the director, or poor scripting. Personally, i think its a bit of both. Either way, i don't consider this a spoiler, but we get the naked chick in the bathroom, the slice-n-dice laser room, killer zombie dogs, the typical "survivor bit by a zombie but trying to conceal it" routine (yawn), and the newest addition to the already over-exhausted agenda...killer zombie birds and telekinesis. Anyway, I've provided all of the elements of this film, nothing new here. The bottom line, if it comes down to a choice at the theatre, see Rob Zombie's Halloween. But hey, if super loud surprises are your idea of a great horror film, then by all means, you will enjoy this new, slightly boring version of Resident Evil.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not truly a Resident Evil, anyone who considers themselves a Resident Evil fan because they saw this movie is a only deceiving their selves. This movie cannot have the title of Resident Evil on it so fans of the Resident Evil games don't get disappointed. The cameos of the game in the movies are unnecessary, unimportant, and cheesy. This movie violated the first zombie movie rule NO HEROS especially with psychic powers only normal people in certain situations. Also another rule THERE IS NOT EVEN A SPECK OF HOPE OF A CURE. That lessens the degree of the suspensefulness of no future of the movie which is a must in zombie infection. The only "scary" parts of the movie were the cheap scares in which something just jumps out at you from nowhere which in most scenes is very predictable in that regard. Resident Evil movie in itself was crying to be cool. The movie's action scenes were spiced up adding music, explosions, and guns to try and make them cool when the bare bones are very corny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That's pretty much what it felt like as the movie commenced. I didn't have high hopes for it and was well aware that the camera would be mainly centered around Alice.The rest of the characters did as much as they could, as well as they were able to. Ali Larter did an OK job as Claire, definitely better than Jill in the second movie.There are a few scenes that are quite interesting, like how do all those people survive, the problems they face (lack of food, fuel and whatnot) but when it gets a bit exciting BOOM back to mad scientists who try to domesticate zombies (seriously though they even managed to make that zombie have that 'cute' - in an awfully twisted, humorless way - look in his eyes. It takes away the atmosphere! Another minus for the film. Wesker. This hurt the most. The actor in no way was similar to Wesker, not in his looks but neither in his actions. From the genius he is in the games they turned him into a dumb guy who has no control about Umbrella whatsoever.I would have very much liked to see whether the Claire and Co made it to Alaska in the end. A short scene would have sufficed, but instead we are presented with hundreds of Alices. If a fourth part will be made I wonder how they will deal with this, because I don't think Alice will like hundreds of her clones running around after she has eventually destroyed the Umbrella Corp.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ms. Jovovich is sensational in this part and really shows her chops as an action/adventure actress. Mr. Fehr and Ms. Larter are also very good in their roles, most of the other actors are scenery except Mr. Glen who is over the top at times, perhaps through no fault of his own.The movie starts out fine with Alice moving through the waste lands of what was the U.S.. We meet the main characters and learn more about Project Alice and what has become of the world due to the Umbrella corps efforts. The film misses out with its lack of tension, the set up feels all wrong here. Sure there are many Zombies and battles, bad guys at Umbrella Corp. out to get our dear Alice, which propels her into action.Good guy Olivera (Fehr) sacrifices himself for the better good and Claire(Larter) flies off with the other escapees, in an Umbrella Corps. helicopter from one of their secret bases, thanks to Alice. After Dr. Issacs (Glen) is bitten by a Zombie, of his own creation, while trying to escape Alices wrath, he takes too much anti-Virus and mutates. Alice vs. the Mutant II doesn't end like in the last film.That's pretty much the whole film. Not too much important dialogue here and though there are other characters, including children, they are not developed at all.Oh yes, Alice now seems to have links to her clones (from Project Alice), can levitate objects and create force fields (I wish I had gone further in the games).I like the fact that the director brings us into the film at a certain point of the story and removes us at another point regardless of continuation of plot. Some may think that this is a way to hype us for part IV, but open ended film is a great way to stimulate the audience minds.I went to the early show today to avoid the children, but too bad for me the theater was crowded with the little darlings. I guess this will be a hit and I hope so, I like to know what happens next. I do wonder how all these children got into the theater on a school day here in NYC.</fullReview>

And using the chick from the other zombie movies was a lame move there are other actresses that have not done films in the zombie genre. Every time she was in scene I had to remind myself of which movie I was watching since this movie also reminded me of the other movie she was in.I really expected a lot more imagination from the movie.

		<fullReview>I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who loves tough women in action! It is nice to see Milla as the tough girl once again. basically non-stop action must be one of your favorite genres, because it will constantly keep you on the edge of your seat, or trying to disappear underneath the popcorn bucket out of pure fright.As I watched the movie, at every moment, I felt what the characters felt, which definitely indicates good writing and directing. There were many times where I felt kinda powerful watching the movie because I imagined myself as Alice (because I am a woman). She really does put some strength into her moves. Being a model, it is a wonder how much training she had to go through to master the moves.Carlos Olivera also makes an appearance and there is some unexpected romance that is very surprising and uplifting, totally bringing you to higher levels in understanding what the characters must have been going through.It was also very high tech, and a couple of steps up from the first movie. it makes you wonder if there really are conspiracies like that in the world...So, this movie is a must-see--only if you saw the first and second movies first!! That's enough of my yammering now, thanks for reading my comment!</fullReview>

Good Ole Alice shows up to help and they tried to feed her to a pack of freaking zombie dogs! Wtf why just try to feed her to zombie dogs. Why even keep them! Kill the things so they don't get lose and kill you. At one point at the end they get to a helicopter and some how the chickadee knows how to fly it.

Despite the fact that I (personally) really liked "Pirates of the Caribbean 3"...and to a lesser degree "Spider-Man 3"...those films were not on top of their predecessors, and bordered on disappointment (and let's not even mention "Shrek 3"). Same goes for "Resident Evil: Extinction," the third part in the series. After the slam-bang sequel that was "Resident Evil: Apocalypse," you'd think that the third installment would surpass or at least equal the previous film. It doesn't! "Extinction" takes place a few years after "Apocalypse" where the world has pretty much ended and is in a state of global ruin due to the zombie outbreak. Alice is now a lone gunman, traveling stateside helping those in need and fighting the zombies. Alice's accomplices from "RE:2": Carlos Olivera (Oded Fuhr) and L.J. (Mike Epps) have now joined a small band of survivors led by an ambitious survivor named Claire (Ali Larter), in hopes to find some sort of sanctuary.Meanwhile, the Umbrella Corporation stills functions from a far underground facility, in which head researcher Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) hopes to somehow control the zombies using whatever memory is left in their rotted brain ("Day of the Dead" anyone?). However, his plans change when he finds out that his prized experiment, "Alice," is still alive and active (you might recall she was genetically altered by Dr. Isaacs at the end of the last film).Alice then regroups with her lost friends, and tells Claire that there's a strong possibility of sanctuary in Alaska, where there has been reports of no infection. So, the team heads to Nevada to gear up enough gasoline to make the long trek to Alaska, but Vegas is Zombie Central and Dr. Isaacs is hot on their trail. I'll stop here."Resident Evil: Extinction" is not a bad addition to the series, but it's a disappointing one. I wanted that feeling I got when I watched the second film, a balls to the wall action/horror flick, with solid suspense and an even more solid storyline and NEW SURPRISES. "Extinction" is basically the same formula of the first two but less exciting. Sure it could be labeled a "Mad Max" with zombies but that's were the coolness ends. No surprises, nothing different, just the same formula gore and the same formula Alice kicking ass. The cast basically does their part well enough: Milla is always cool and sexy as Alice, Ali Larter is her normal sexy self. It was great to see character actor Linden Ashby in this one (you might remember him as Johnny Cage in "Mortal Kombat") and Iain Glen is excellent as the evil Dr. Isaacs. But they kill off characters you've grown to care for like as if they were fourth or fifth rate characters...and you're left with a predictable final fight sequence and then the movie is over.Now I like that stuff, which is why I actually enjoyed it, but I wanted more. I sat in that theater expecting something, and I didn't get it. So I was forced to put myself in another mindset and there I saw "RE:3" for the actual decent flick it is.I'm prepared to give "RE:3" a recommendation but with a warning...it's the weakest of the series, and do not expect a slam-bang flick. There's zombies, there's gore and a few cool action sequences, but it's nothing spectacular.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than the last two, but that's not saying much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it comes to movie monsters, zombies never really appealed to me. They seem to exist more as moving targets in a shooting gallery than actual villains. And let's face it, just about everything you can do in a zombie movie has already been done. Resident Evil: Extinction seems to realize this, and so it doesn't really concentrate on them very much. They're always there, but they don't seem to have much to do with the movie itself. Rather than horror, the film's main source of inspiration seems to be the Road Warrior films, with everyone driving around in souped up vehicles in the desert. Those who have not seen the original Resident Evil or its sequel, Resident Evil: Apocalypse, will likely be lost, as the film jumps right into its story and doesn't look back. Series heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich) is still on the run from the evil scientists of the Umbrella Corporation, who experimented on her and turned her into some kind of super powered fighting machine. While wandering the deserts, searching for other survivors, she happens to find a battered old journal that talks about how there's an area in Alaska that is unaffected by the deadly T-Virus that has wiped out half the human race, and turned the other half into flesh-eating zombies. She joins up with a band of survivors, which include a couple people who accompanied her on her last adventure, and some newcomers such as a teenage girl named K-Mart (Spencer Locke from Monster House), who was given the name because the people she travels with found her outside of a K-Mart store. When I heard this, I couldn't help but think the poor girl is lucky she wasn't found outside of a Hooters restaurant. As Alice and her friends search for enough fuel and supplies for the long journey to Alaska, an evil scientist at Umbrella named Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) is secretly tracking Alice, because he believes she has something in her blood that can stop the effects of the virus, and wants to use her for his own evil ends.Now that the film franchise is on its third installment, I think it's pretty safe to say you already know where you stand on Resident Evil: Extinction. Those who liked the last two are certain to find something to like here. The Resident Evil films have always differed from the games that inspired them, in that they are much more action-heavy in tone than genuine horror. The zombies themselves are not really the villains, it is the human scientists of the Umbrella Corporation. The head of Umbrella is a guy named Albert Wesker (Jason O'Mara), who even though he sits in a dark underground room behind a desk all day, he constantly wears sunglasses. This is the kind of movie where we know everything about the person just by looking at them. If they are beautiful, rugged, or with a perfectly toned body, they're the good guys. If they're dressed in lab coats or wear black, they're evil. And if they're dirty and unshaven, they're an extra and most likely expendable during one of the film's many action sequences. The movie is in far too much of a rush to get to where it's going. It gives us just enough exposition and plot to get the story out of the way, then dives head first into a series of action sequences that seem to come one after another.To be fair, some of the sequences are handled quite well, and with a surprising amount of expertise. A lengthy sequence where the human survivors are attacked by hundreds of zombie crows is the closest the movie ever comes to generating suspense. But far too often, Extinction is a laundry list of missed opportunities. There is a scene where the heroes are forced to drive through the ruins of Las Vegas, which is now submerged under sand. The initial glimpse of the submerged city is intriguing, and made me excited about what the filmmakers could be planning with such a unique setting. Unfortunately, all they do is give us more of everything we've already seen. I hate it when a movie teases me with a fascinating image, then does absolutely nothing with it. Aside from a character climbing up a replica of the Eifel Tower from the remains of the Paris-themed hotel/casino, the movie does not use any of its unique setting to its advantage. The battle may as well have taken place in a factory or a parking garage for all this movie cares. The human characters are treated with the same level of indifference. No one gets to say any dialogue that doesn't advance the plot in some way, and relationships between them are hinted at but never really built on.At its best, Resident Evil: Extinction is total in one ear and out the other entertainment. It has a couple action scenes that I sort of admired, but nothing really stood out about it. It doesn't offer any thoughts, it doesn't offend, it's just there. People who go to the movies just to get out of the house are sure to have their needs fulfilled. It manages to kill an hour and a half, and that's about it. Anyone looking for something more should probably look elsewhere. Now that I think about it, people looking for something more probably don't go to movies based on video games in the first place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I normally don't write negative reviews, but having watched the two first Resident Evil movies this must have been one of the biggest disappointments in a long time. To be honest, the franchise is pretty embarrassing overall, but this just about sums up what a crap movie should contain; lack of story, ridiculous "zombies" and a worn-out hero that merely plays on her admittedly physical appearance. The acting is awful, the "professor-turned-super villain/mutated monster" is laughable and the whole fight in the dessert feels terribly worn out.If RE:Extinction is an indicator of what "science fiction" film investors are willing to depart with their capital for, we have a bleak future ahead of us! This is no science fiction, just cheap horror for the masses. I sincerely hope that they discontinue the franchise and turn the ship around quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the fact that this movie is based on a video game, in truth nothing works in this film, or whatever you may call "it". Why make a movie based on a video game when the storyline and plot works just fine on the small screen? Face it; RE1 and 2 sucked, BIG TIME. The special effects and the setting is great(bombed-out deserted Las Vegas, great idea) but what's the point if there's no solid foundation to work from? The script is filled with so much cheese and plain flat "acting" that I cared very little about the characters or the story for that matter. And since when did the main character ever lept up in the air to kick a zombie in the face? I've never played the Resident Evil games(though I plan on doing so since I'm new to the franchise) but for those who did this is a direct contradiction of the games where the focus is on gunplay and puzzle solving. Never once do the characters display any sense of brainpower that the characters in the games did. In the end, they just blow the zombies away in typical B-movie fashion.I'm tired of Hollywood. No really I AM!!! Someone PLEASE end these soulless heaps of garbage before the movie industry as a whole becomes a lost art.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got dragged to this stinker by 5 friends. I can tell you right now that at least 6 people walked out in the middle because Resident Evil: Extinction was so bad.If you enjoy hicks attempting to rape a fully clothed Milla (there's no nudity), you may enjoy this film, but I'll warn you, this is the only plot point that makes any sense.To sum up, scientists decide to make zombies more intelligent. According to their reasoning, smart zombies won't crave flesh anymore and can then be used as a slave workforce.My boyfriend and I were the first to leave. I just wanted to go to our car and get out of there, but my boyfriend insisted that we deserved a refund for this atrocity. We found the manager and said we wanted our money back. The manager didn't even ask for a reason and seemed unsurprised. He quickly accommodated us. If you find yourself in a bad film, keep your ticket stub. You have the right to not have to waste your money or time on lousy films.About a half hour later I got a call from my boyfriend's brother. Our other friend's had walked out too and got a refund. He said the movie just kept getting worse with Milla putting out fires with her mind.Ultraviolet was better and made more sense (don't mistake that for an endorsement, Ultraviolet was very hard to sit through)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much good going on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films adapted from video games generally have received flak mainly for their inability to cater to a larger audience than a specified niche among the audience - mainly teenage boys who spend their free time in front of, eh, video games. It's always a case of you either you like it or you don't.Having said that, I enjoyed the first "Resident Evil" (I was 17 then) and marginally liked "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" (I was 19): partly because I was someone who has had an on-off affair with role-playing games (RPGs), specifically with the PS2 console; but mostly because I understood that these kind of movies required no life-affirming morales, no intricate plot, no credible science to provide mental calisthenics. Just pure popcorn entertainment and an unabashed sense of escapism for them to work. Considering these aspects, it's not much to ask.But then comes "Resident Evil: Extinction", a third-tier installment (apparently the year of thirds hasn't ended yet) that's so painfully unexciting, it's not just comparable to having to watch someone else play the game; it's like having to watch someone play the game using a walkthrough downloaded from some gaming forum. Everything's too perfunctory and the scare factor is conspicuously several notches lower.Here, Milla Jovovich returns as zombie butt-whooping Alice, five years after the first film, when the Umbrella Corporation's T-Virus has escaped Racoon City and has set humankind into the brink of extinction. Together with a band of survivors that includes a sleepwalking cast of Ali Larter, Ashanti, Oded Fehr and, pity, Spencer Locke, they cross the desert to get to Alaska, which may be their final frontier.Writer Paul W.S. Anderson and director Russell Mulcahy doesn't provide the story with any interesting characters and their treatment of the material is so half-hearted you barely feel the plot as it advances from one point to another. Jovovich still provides a solid central figure but her ho-hum action scenes can't make up for an overall lackluster film.But really, when you're a 20-something male and the best thing you can find about a zombie movie is teen actress Spencer Locke, then there's really not much good going on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>entertaining but very average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is it good or bad things that always come in threes? It seems that in Hollywood these days, it doesn't really matter. So, after a decent zombie action movie and a terrible zombie/video game movie, we find ourselves with Resident Evil: Extinction.It picks up where 2 left off. The virus has spread, lots of people are mostly dead, and the remains of humanity find themselves travelling the open roads or holed up underground. Think Day of the Dead crossed with Mad Max, and you'll have an idea of the tone the movie's trying to set. The downfall of 2 was that it tried to be too much like the game, and 3 appears to have learnt from these mistakes. While there are lots of cute little nods to the source material, in the form of character names, little piano pieces, and claustrophobic corridors, the movie moves toward the standard zombie formula pretty quickly rather than going with the single character setup, although it does take a while for Milla to find another little gang of survivors and form our ragtag crew of zombie fodder; I guess the writers knew there really wasn't much material to work over in that respect.Meanwhile, there is the same sort of clichéd corporate menace from Umbrella, with their serums and their cloning (yes, cloning, in a zombie movie, obviously a great idea) and their plans to turn the zombies into a free workforce (another stellar plan). It's a subplot quite obviously lifted from Day of the Dead, but it just feels a bit redundant, although I suppose it does give you someone to boo and hiss at when they appear on screen. You know, as if the zombie hordes weren't menace enough. Having said that, some of the zombies look a bit...weak. I understand that there are fewer and fewer people milling about waiting to be eaten, but a lot of them just look thin and plastic, which isn't *really* all that menacing.Otherwise, Extinction features the same general ass-kickery from Milla, big action scenes, and mostly inept support from random stock characters. While Milla knows how to play this role, as do the other returning characters, but pretty much everybody else is just...bad. Check out the hospital scene near the start or the bit where that scientist guy "domesticates" a zombie for a host of examples of bad acting; these are definitely not thespians at the top of their game. Oh, and for more amateur points, don't forget that generic nu-metal soundtrack!While it isn't great, or even good, it's okay, providing a reasonable amount of silly cliché-ridden entertainment thanks to its unashamed lifting of material from every zombie movie ever and attempts to come up with new and exciting ideas (clones! zombie birds!), but really it adds nothing new, and will hopefully mark the end of a relatively unsuccessful franchise, despite its somewhat open ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RE3 Extensive Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, RE3 finally redeemed the series from RE2 Apocalypse. So can you go into this movie feeling not disappointed? Yes &amp; No.Why No? (Start with the bad first) Resident Evil Extinction is a very simple/thin script by writer Paul W.S. Anderson, going into some very interesting places with a lot of cool elements from the games, mainly focusing on the games that have come after anything to do with Raccoon City (Code Veronica, RE4). The script is definitely fun, giving Milla and a few others some classic, surprisingly, "not over the top" one liners. There aren't that many so it doesn't over run it's course. The script however, makes me mad at the executive producers for not putting that much faith in 1. fleshing it out, giving it actual subsidence other then a fast paced action/horror flick 2. hiring someone to revise it, like Paul Haggis did for Casino Royale. It's understandable and obvious that this movie is a mid sized budget, but feels like it's proving itself worthy of recognition series to receive the time and attention it deserves for a possible 4th movie. However, I think Anderson needs to be removed from the actual script writing process, maybe just concept ideas. One scene in this movie is definitely incredibly bad:WARNING WARNING WARNING SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER *******Domesticating Zombies.... seeing a zombie pick up a cell phone and be a child with fisher price toys.... no..... DID THAT EVER HAPPEN IN THE GAMES? no. NO IT DIDN'T. ::Slaps Anderson:: END OF SPOILER****************the GOOD ^_^ Beautifully shot, amazing production design from recent Oscar winner for Art Direction for Pan's Labyrinth, and great creature design from the team behind Silent Hill. Like Silent Hill, it's visually beautiful, in this case using sun to its advantage. Russel M. makes a good come back and some great choices, however it's obvious a lot got cut on the cutting room floor, aka THE DVD PROBABLY HAS A LOT OF DELETED SCENES. Once again studios getting in the way of true potential of a movie. Acting, ACTUALLY GOOD. Milla Jovovich has already proved herself in many genres, only stuck in a rut right now of being a action star (soon to change with her period piece shooting sometime next year). Her, Ali Larter, and Oded Fehr are made up to look awesome and deliver their "meh" lines but with dignity. They do pull it off. Everyone else in the movie... are decent, but given the script predicament, you can't blame them for having trouble on a line or two, luckily their all at least natural.... minus Ashanti &amp; Mike Epps at times. But everyone for the most part, has very short parts because as soon as this movie starts, it's over. Overall? The Script doesn't do the games justice, especially after RE4 took home game of the year, however, the Direction, Production Design, Action Scenes, and Actors/Character redeem the movie and make it a very fun, fast paced, futuristic eye candy, with a fun score behind it. And one GREAT GREAT CHOICE in song to introduce Claire Redfield's Convoy. This movie has so many great elements for potential, you are left satisfied, but hoping the DVD will have a lot more to make your 10$ at the box office worth it because you're actually disappointed it's over so fast.8 out 10 (1 star removed for the script flaws, 1 star removed for that spoiler scene above).</fullReview>

When a movie trailer comes out and focuses on ONE small aspect of the movie (ie the vegas/sin city teaser) then you have no plot or direction to speak of. The writer seemed to have forgotten the plot of the previous movie. This becomes appa. with the lack of explanations of the missing Jill and Angie and Alice not being able to sense the T-Virus in Epps. Also while watching the movie you begin to think that the characters have never encountered a zombie before. Everyone was just using bullets like they had millions of rounds handy (None of these folks have read The Zombie Survival Guide- they couldn't find a bat to crush skulls with?). And by the way, how do fit 20 people in a helicopter and then get said copter to Alaska? Anyway, this whole movie should be forgotten and they need to continue</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the third installment of the "Resident Evil" franchise and is easily the best entry so far. We are told at the beginning that the T-Virus has wiped out humanity almost completely, devastated the ecosystem, and reduced the Earth to a desolate wasteland. Milla Jovavich returns as Alice, whose blood contains the antivirus that can save what is left of mankind. She convinces a group of fellow refugees, who are aimlessly wandering in the Nevada desert, that they should all travel to a rumored disease-free refuge in Alaska. However, the evil Umbrella Corporation has been searching for her and has plans of it's own..This is a genuinely scary, gut-wrenching horror film from beginning to end. The central characters are placed in one terrifying situation after another and at times the tension is almost unbearable. Likewise, the action sequences are incredibly intense, particularly an early encounter between Alice and a pack of undead attack dogs (a series trademark).The film generates an atmosphere of fearful anticipation of the sort that is only found in the best horror movies. There is a decent amount of gore and Alice's skill with knives anchors some fantastic set-piece battle scenes between the survivors and the undead. A special mention ought to also be given to the strikingly imaginative set designs, a case in point being the depiction of a ruined Las Vegas.Where the film shows weakness is in it's liberal, perhaps far too liberal, referencing of earlier classics especially George Romero's "Day of the Dead", the "Road Warrior", and even Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds". The film stays true to the mythology about the "Resident Evil" universe that was established in the preceding films and does not add too much that is really new.That having been said, in terms of generating pure exhilaration and intense fear "Extinction" takes the franchise to new levels and is easily one of the very best zombie movies in years. The next chapter in the series has a lot to live up to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say i wasn't expecting i would rate it a 7. Not after the mindless Apocalypse. Well, RE Extinction does not offer a brilliant storyline or great acting. But presents us with some good twists.REE doesn't look like a movie per se. Actually, after you watch it, you get he sensation it is just a halfway to the fourth RE. It makes you want to watch its sequel right when you finish this one.Lets start with its issues: Too many beautiful people. Thats one of the reasons i liked Walking Dead. Why does all the characters must be pretty? what sense does it make? Is it really gonna attract more viewers? Nop. Pure bullshit. Pretty faces and organized hairs are the last matter in a post apocalyptic world. Its stupid to put it as a priority when choosing actors. So what happens is now we have half of the cast formed by poor actors, at least they're pretty and dress fashionably.Now, the Pros: AMAAAAAAAANZING SOUNDTRACK. I can compare this soundtrack with Transformers. Amazing and really well made sound effects pulls you inside the movie. And this is the best part of the whole thing. I'm really impressed, because its even better than first and second RE.Action scenes were better produced, along with zombies make up, what is probably because of technologies improvement. They have made a highly entertaining zombie action movie, even if it is not a brilliant film, has some power to catch our attention.Good to watch eating something caloric if ur looking for a mind relaxation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Resident Evil 3 - Extintction" Alice (Milla Jovovich) returns for more action trying to lead a group of survivors to find a safe place without the infection that almost destroyed mankind on Earth, now a desertic and apocalyptical place to live among zombies. The third part of the Resident Evil series is more light than the other films, less scary, more funny, with great action sequences and the trademark is present all the time, the famous headshots where you can say out loud headshot after a zombie got killed just like in the video games. The movie is very short, everything goes for an hour and a half, the plot is pretty much what I said and there's not only the zombie danger but also a creepy doctor (Iain Glen) that can control Alice in his new experiment supported by some form of government. Meanwhile Alice teams again with Carlos (Oded Fehr) and his friends on their way to Alaska where it is said that the virus haven't reached. Once again what makes the film interesting in the scenes between Alice and Carlos along with the group led by Ali Larter; the fights and shootouts against the zombies, some moments by the annoying doctor. The best part is definitely Carlos last moment, one of the most honorable moments for a character ever, sad but truth.Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and produced this third film and I really wish I could direct it because I didn't find the tension, the scary things that made the first episode more interesting than this one. I'm not saying that Russell Mulcahy is bad director but I felt that this film is meant to be more like an action work than a horror film and we're talking about zombies, frightening creatures supposed to scare. On the other hand the humor was vital to the film, some quotes and moments were really funny which made of "Resident Evil 3" a enjoyable film. The movie goes well but not enough to be the greatest of the series. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My expectations for this film were rather high as I stepped into the theater, simply due to one comment in which Milla Jovovich stated that she hated the second film in the series ('which is horrible. Alright, she has my sympathy here....') but promised that this third installment would be "rad." 'Alright...she's probably high, but that didn't make the first movie (8/10) that bad....' Let's start with the positives, eh? The action, that comsumes nearly the entire movie, is quite awesome. With wire work that puts the sh*tfest of a movie that the Matrix to shame, and zombie blood galore, it's a joy to watch mindless beasts act as the dummies on which these characters exact their ass-kicking pleasure. The CG, I have to admit, isn't as good once you see it a second time, but still notable. It's certainly beautiful visually, with the Mexican landscape scoping about, the the torn buildings peeking from beneath the sand, though why Vegas is the only city (when I said Mexican landscape, I meant that it was filmed in Mexico, not taking place there.) still remaining is...well, I can't say anything other than it's stupid.The camera-work is interesting. Russel Mulcahy's use constant use of a moving camera makes for something I haven't seen too many times, and it is certainly fun to watch, though I would have preferred Paul Anderson's stillness, which would have made the film generally creepier and more Resident Evil-eque, speaking from a gamer's perspective.Now to the negative: the whole damn story. The zombie infection spread past the...city that was nuked...and sterilized...and (because, y'know, the governmont wouldn't do anything.) spread to the entire U.S....and then it spread oversea, 'cause viruses can do that, and anybody who came to another country from the zombie-ridden US wouldn't be checked for the virus. And now, 5 years later, the world is turned into a desert because of it. Not as a result of neglect, the film states the virus...made the world wither, and die. Right.And the rest of the story, following this, is equally as ridiculous. It has too many inconsistencies to count--the crows haven't thought to feed on infected flesh for HOW long?--and is almost nonextistant.The acting is alright, though far from perfect. The stereotypical characters really don't provide any means of displaying talent, nor does Mulcahy's insistent approach on making everyone seem "tough." Ali Larter, in particular, seems off.So, in conclusion, this is an entertaining, extremely fun to watch, and generally cool-looking...extravaganza of stupidity.I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very basic genre film that puts the absolute minimum of effort put into character, story, atmosphere and impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The survivors of Racoon City have fled but the T-virus has moved quicker than anyone could have predicted and soon the entire world has fallen. Humans are not the only ones infected as all the creatures fall as well, destroying ecosystems and leaving little in their place. A small group of survivors travel across the Nevada desert, surviving one day at a time. This group is rescued by Alice, herself working on a plan to get to Alaska where isolation has supposedly protected an area form the T-virus ? if only they can evade the infected to get there. This is not their only problem though, as the Umbrella Corporation is working on a treatment for the virus involving Alice's blood and, having located her, are setting out to capture her dead or alive.Approaching the Resident Evil series of films is a bit like living with an unreformed junkie, which is to say that, when you come home one day and all your stuff has gone then you are probably being naive if you're surprised. So with this third film I already had set my expectations pretty low because it is unfair to expect it to have changed since the other two films. Film three opens up the action into a world destroyed by the T-virus, with small groups of survivors fleeing Racoon City into the desert to live out a Mad Max style existence. It is also unfair to complain about this being "unrealistic" but I'm going to do it anyway but I'm going to do it within the context of the film. You see most films are not "real" situations but the important thing is to create a world that is convincing within the context of the story that you are telling ? when you can't do that you leave the viewer on the outside from the very start.That is what happens here because the development of this world has gone no further than the pitch of "the world is infected and small groups are surviving" and it never really rings true. OK, so this is the first problem but if the rest of it works then maybe this won't matter. The next thing is the actual plot which, as before, has the potential in the shadowy masters of the world (a corporation with their own interests at heart) and the dangers of the infected. Sadly the plot again does little with these other than create a simple little event-driven story that allows for lots of gore and running. Again though, playing devil's advocate, that will be what the majority of people have come to the film for ? gore and running. But guess what? Yup, I got another problem here.You see for me this film should achieve a lot with very little because I am a really easy target. I get easily scared and gripped by the zombie genre due to my fear of their base desire and unrelenting drive to satisfy that desire ? even the Nazi Zombie sub-game in COD5 makes my skin crawl. However with Resident Evil 3 I found myself sitting there totally apathetic throughout. The effects were nice and some of the scenes were well conceived even if they were a bit derivative (the crows has a clear inspiration but is still a good sequence). What is missing though is a sense of real danger, a reason to care about the characters and a genuine sense of horror and fear ? not gore, but fear. Without these what we have are bloody action sequences that concentrate on just delivering gore to satisfy those who have come for that and that alone. As such the film does do OK and might work as a Friday night DVD for young men staying in with friends and beer.The cast fit into this because the majority of them know that their roles are just part of genre cliché. Please form an orderly cue: the ethnic tick-boxes, the sexy young women, the one who gets secretly infected, the power-crazed scientist, the sacrificial hero, the non-threatening teen and so on. Jovovich does her usual stuff and prevents herself looking bored even though she has little to work with. Fehr is a rugged and good looking "hero". Ashanti is stunning. Larter is feisty. Glen is thoughtfully nuts. Epps is "comedy" relief and so on. It is not really an actor's film and it shows in their performances, which tick the genre boxes but nothing more.Resident Evil 3 is not much cop but it does rather depend on your point of view. If you are target audience and happy with the gore being the be all and end all of the film then it will probably do enough to satisfy. For the rest of us though the film is little more than a very basic genre film that ticks the boxes with the absolute minimum of effort put into character, story, atmosphere and impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Sticking to the games" idea... has gone extinct.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>now i know that the title of this comment and the rating i gave this film doesn't really go together. as a film based on the popular games (which I'm a fan of) it HARDLY sticks to the games. thats where the title of this comment comes in, but as for the movie itself, looking at it as a stand alone film (looking passed its based on a game) it is a good movie, which is where the 8/10 comes in. despite it being a very good film, it seems as if the creators (of the films) wanted to make a third film so bad, that they didn't want to wait for another RE game (despite RE4) so they just made up their own story (sticking to umbrella and t-virus). T-virus whipes out entire world, convoy traveling across Nevada desert, etc.good-lots of action. crows are finally used. different take on zombies (fast "crimson heads" zombies) bad-literally not based on any of the games, no Nevada desert in any of the games. Ali larter was good, but she isn't a Claire redfield. actor who played Wesker-good, but his character of just sitting behind a desk-bad. i wanted to see him in action.Summary: if you are a true RE gamer and are WANTING/EXPECTING this film to cover one of the games, don't expect too much. if you are a fan but is willing to accept they (only) kept the main principles (t-virus, umbrella, zombies) then you will enjoy. in my personal opinion, i think they could have covered RE: Code Veronica instead of, t-virus whipes out entire world plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I borrowed the first two off my mate and now I was desperate to see the third one. WHen I brought it I was expecting it to be the best of the bunch. But instead I was slightly bored and confused. Jill Valentine vanished, Claire Redfield wasn't even in it for long and the classic zombies weren't in the film much but instead these weird bald, melted crazy people in jumpsuits start jumping out of a very small crate. And this has to be set at least over 10 months from the last so why is every one clean and tidy. If you were a survivor from the end of the world you wouldn't care! In RE extinction they have clean hair, white teeth and seem to have clean clothes and I think Alcie still has foundation on.OK film but not very well thought out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before i go any further I actually enjoyed the film as treated it as it was probably intended, A Film that didn't make much sense as appossed to the game. so now thats out of the way Review time!!!! film opens Milla ( Alice) Lying in Shower cubicle??? from then on i agree with everyone else's reviews that there was to many errors made and two many instances where you go " that cannot happen, why didn't they do this, should have done that, why did they do this? how come? Example:: Zombies, thousands of them surround Science facility have superhuman strenght but cannot break a fence? yet a crow ooooooooooh scary crows, can more or less demolish a school bus! Alice aka Milla, now has the abilities that only X-men previously had! psychic ability has come from where? At the beginning of the film the umberalla company and the wacky Dr are recreating and training new Alice's to go through certain tests, all are failing being killed, sliced, shot etc etc. here lies a big problem for me as later on in the film its seems that Alice can be controlled by satellite, ( Fans of the game out there, do you remember that part in game play?? no? me neither!) so if she can be controlled by satellite? then just program her to do the tests and not fail! get it? Duhhhh! how stupid do these directors and writers think we are sometimes?? one more thing, i also think a world record attempt was made during the film. " how many Zombie can fit into one container? later in Vegas when the commrades are looking for gas/petrol they come across a container unbeknown to the folks looking for petrol this container contains zombie's! hundreds of them which begs the question.."how many Zombies can fit into a container"???? just to add if Alice has psychic powers why did she not jut shut the comtainer?? lol though the film is flawed in more or less every department it is however very enjoyable to watch, especially loud! a good attempt all round and well worth losing yourself for an 1&amp;1/2 hours. if you can dispel the flaws and the silliness of the story its well worth your time. in a word?

		<fullReview>I didn't like the first movie, but the second movie won me over with its campy charm and attempts at referencing the series. I was kind of hoping they'd continue on with the third but instead we get a pretty weak premise, a bunch of characters that seemingly serve no purpose (what was the point of K-mart having any spoken lines, or even a name?) and just overall a dumb story.The eventual nod to the Birkin monster was pretty cool, but you have to trudge through so much lameness before it to make it worth the whole movie. Crows? Really, that's the first big fight scene? And what could've been the saving grace - a superhuman Alice fighting a bunch of zombies, which was pretty satisfying in the second movie, is grossly underused.There's far too few redeeming parts to warrant watching this one (though Carlos' death scene was pretty creative). Avoid it whether you like the games or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching Resident evil Extinction, I was quite satisfied at all of the action scenes that were included in this movie. The actors in the movie did a reasonable job, however, knowing what the resident evil movies compared to the game didn't exactly match at all, I was still thrilled to see the guns blasting, neck chopping, and crow burning action.I was so glad it wasn't a let down like Apocalypse was, but it still had some flaws like any other movie. I did not like how they made Alice at all. This is suppose to be survival horror! Giving someone special abilities lowers the chance of tension. Example, if you were in a zombie outbreak but had the ability of quick reflexes, mind powers to blow up brains, telepathic, and so on. You wouldn't be as scared as a lone survivor with nothing but his own wits to survive. I'd give it 6.7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAY HAVE SOME SPOILERS......The First Resident Evil film was very good, the music was perfectly matched in some scenes to give it the scary touch. The Second Movie was not as good, it was OK as the zombies are outside, but it just was not affective as i had hoped. The Third film, now that was a total let down, very few zombie scenes, some stuppid intelligent creature in the end which the fight scene didn't last long. it just was out of place and did not scare me at all, Alice was like a fighting machine with a few special powers. The human race could just send her off to kill the zombies with no problem. Some of the cast were there, Jil Valantine left with out a trace, no explantaion to where she went, same with the little girl whos dad died in the end of the second. The film was open desert, sand, sand and more sand. the odd few petrol stations down the road. The film needs a lot of improvement, OK you cant have the film in one location where your in corridors all the time, but in the third film you had like a 360 degree angle to choose where you want to go. First move, you head straight, walk slowly to the other side of the corridor and pray there's nothing there. The next movie i can totally see it will be a let down, an army of Alices and i bet they have great powers to. its just sad, but the films OK to watch now and then, just don't by it on Blue ray and wait till the cost is down to ?5, its really not scary at all unlike the First movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic Stuff - but a little short on story ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is nothing that I didn't like about this movie except that it didn't feel like a complete story - more like a small part of a larger story. Outside of that, the visuals were great, the characters were interesting and the action was non-stop.Here's the setup of the Resident Evil movies: Resident Evil: A virus that transforms people into zombies is released in an underground research facility and infects the workers.Resident Evil: Apocalypse: The virus has now escaped and infected the inhabitants of the city above the research facility.Resident Evil: Extinction: The virus has now escaped the city and infected the world.Furthermore, the somewhat amoral corporation (the same one responsible for the virus in the first place) is working on a cure. The key lies in getting the original blood of Milla Jovovich's character ... and the story progresses from there.While the setup sounds interesting, the actual story told is too short. Too much time is spent on human vs. zombie fights. While they are well done, the plot doesn't get time to advance much ... and doesn't.It's too bad, because the visuals effects, characters and pacing are really well done. In fact, the visuals of the decaying desert-like surface juxtaposed with the few high-tech underground facilities left in the world are particularly interesting to watch. All of these aspects deserve a much more significant story.But it is what it is ... and it's still worth watching for anyone who really likes the previous Resident Evil movies. Just know that not much happens.</fullReview>

A movie may be based on a book or movie, but it stands alone.I watch some movies for intellectual stimulation, some for physical stimulation, some just to have a good laugh, and some just to be entertained without a lot of effort on my part. This movie fits that last motive perfectly.It's sole purpose is to entertain and it did that well. There really wasn't a lot of story here; just enough to frame the battles with the zombies and those freaking birds! The mutant doctor was really good and Milla Jovovich is always a pleasure to watch. The addition of Ashanti got my pulse racing, too.

		<shortDescription>Still good for a third sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite impressed with this movie since it was the third sequel. It is still actually entertaining and good and the plot moves forward. One negative for me was the ending. It's set up for the next film with several hundred Alice's ready to kick Umbrella's arse. In this movie, it has been years since the T virus infected Raccoon City and it has spread wiping out the population and turning the land into a desert. Alice is traveling by herself avoiding Umbrella's spies. We also find out that Alice has mental powers now. Due to no transportation, she must join up with a caravan and convinces them that they should try to go to Alaska, where infection may not have spread yet. Only problem is they must look for fuel in Vegas.During this time Umbrella has tracked Alice and has a surprise waiting in Vegas. But the evil scientist gets bit in Vegas and injects lots of antivirus and the effects turn out pretty devastating. Alice decides they must get Umbrella's helicopter to get to Alaska and comes up with a plan. The remaining survivors get on the copter while Alice goes underground to take care of Umbrella.One problem I had was how could the zombies climb Eifel Tower yet thousands of them couldn't climb or knock down a wire fence. Also, when alice busts the fence down, she takes her sweet time in going down below. How come the zombies aren't running after her since the fence has a hole in it.The special effects were pretty good and the plot was interesting. It just wasn't a repeat of the previous films. And I liked the opening when I'm like isn't this the first film? And the way the mutant scientist dies after bragging I can't be killed was good.FINAL VERDICT: If you liked the first two, you will want to see this one. And with the ending, they have to make a fourth film.</fullReview>

But to have the ability to manipulate objects, even the very distant ones using mind alone?! Its an overkill. Even if all those zombies mutate into an X-men Wolverine kinda creature, they wouldn't stand a chance against an Alice with supernatural powers like that of X-men's Jean Grey.

		<fullReview>as a fan of the 1st Resident Evil i was seriously disappointed by Resident Evil: Extinction.The acting was cheesy and pretty bad. Milla Jovovich reminded me of her character in the Fifth Element and Joan of Arc - which i really liked. This movie was borderline dumb and stupid. it was dull and boring. whoever did the make up on the zombies did a very poor job as they looked like they wore cheesy 70s masks on their faces. the cinematography was OK as it reminded of old western movies. Ashanti's acting was awful, even Oded Fehr who is usually a good actor was dull and cheesy. i couldn't understand the glossy look on Milla's face also. it seems like they filtered out her wrinkles or imperfections. it seemed they blurred out under eyes, around her mouth, cheeks, and forehead - and in other shots you can see that her face looks a little different with bags under her eyes. had it not been so obvious i wouldn't keep wondering about it.it seemed like the movie was rushed into production because someone felt they had something good, but instead it looked like a movie made by a bunch of amateurs movie makers.the story was flat and boring as was the ending. this movie is for anyone that has absolutely nothing else to watch or is completely enamored with the actors.</fullReview>

Did they want to use all the old sets again or something? Or maybe they just wanted to have this movie begin and end where the first one began so that you would remember how you thought the first one was going to be cool before you saw the rest of it...The musical score is pathetic. Mark Snow called, he wants his lame stock sounds and unimaginative x-files music back.Maybe the real problem is that zombies really aren't that interesting. They certainly can't carry a whole movie, especially when you put them all in daylight, dress them in matching jumpsuits, and make them all look and act exactly the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction, like the previous two, is more of an action movie than a zombie movie. Really, the way they pick off zombies is a lot like the way Rambo kills commies. That being said, the action scenes are decent.This movie also gets points for an attempt at originality. I'm talking about the "zombie birds" - I've never seen that before. However, it ended up seeming silly, and, more than anything, they just swiped the entire scene's execution from the Hitchcock movie "The Birds." The plot was poor and lacking, and they wasted a bunch of time on characters who went nowhere. Out the 90 minutes of this film, you could probably cut an hour and the plot would be completely unaffected.The only reason to see this film is if you've already seen the first two and are curious to see where the story is going. Although, don't expect any fulfilling conclusions because they leave the ending open for another sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When i watched the first Resident Evil movie i really loved it. It set the atmosphere perfectly and had a decent story on the origins and how the system had tried to contain it with cold hearted logic. When the second movie came out i was disappointed at the whole game of "Simon Says" which turned out to be the main theme of the movie. I am still horrified over how badly inserted the cemetery scene was and how the zombies knew the exact moment to pop out.Now we have Resident Evil 3 which is not something i enjoyed watching. There were one or two decent zombie scenes but during most of the movie they just stood there like big old scarecrows. I did not feel any horror theme from this movie so i wonder why it was not classified as an action movie. While browsing through some forums i noticed how many people there were that loved the whole psychic thing but having played through the Resident evil games the whole thing struck down like a lightning from clear Skye's. This movie cut off all ties to the actual games and i am hoping that the computer animated movie will be much better.What amazes me is that in the first movie the writer was also the director. During the second one the director was changed but it was the same writer. The third one has the same thing so i dearly hope there will not be a fourth resident evil movie made by this writer.</fullReview>

The characters finally have a little more depth to them, they have their doubts, fears and passions; civilians finally stop being automatically saint and it turns out that some are afraid, some are liars and some are wicked.True, automatic guns still have 100+ rounds per clip and ladies still have perfect makeup and flawless skin even when driving through desert and smoking 30 cigarettes a day; but this is an action zombie movie just like Doom-the-Movie or Land-of-the-Dead, and it works well as such.100 minutes well spent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Problems I had with this movie. Mila's face looked weird throughout most of the movie. Too much makeup? Yeah I would say so. The previews showed us this movie that would be placed in Las Vegas and all we get is a lousy small rendition of the strip covered in sand. The first thing I thought was how are they driving these vehicles in sand dunes? If everybody is dead and you have the choice of any vehicle why would you choose those? The whole Vegas scene is lousy. They never go inside a casino, and they spend all of there time fighting a bunch of extras, all dressed in the same overalls and having the same makeup to save money. And exactly how many people/zombies fit in a container of that size? It seemed like there were way too many. Has anybody done a bod count? I felt ripped off by the cheesy Vegas set. The only reason they used Vegas was to save themselves some money by using a bunch of sand dunes as backdrops. Now, the zombies....They sucked, due mainly to the fact that they looked like they all died perfectly. Yeah they had sunken cheeks and gray complexions, but they didn't look like they had been killed by other zombies.They all walked perfectly,there were no zombies that were half bodies, or mutilated in any way. They had no character. As far as the characters in the rest of the movie go, they are lousy. Nobody seems like they have really gone through the trials that would make them survivors in a dead world. If everyone is dead, wouldn't you get as technological as you could? If they have a computer that can send and receive messages wouldn't they also have the ability to get information that would teach them basic survival skills? Like first off visit an army base, a National guard, a gun store a damn wal mart and stock up on everything. Guns, food, batteries, vests, generators, alcohol. Grow hydroponic food? There's no way you couldn't find enough to live on if everyone was wiped out in a month.Everything that was related to the survival of the human race was treated like most movies do these days. Lame. There was no imagination. The clothes looked too perfectly rock star cool. Exactly what a yuppie would wear to go on a "desert excursion" Khaki and olive green. No shirts with bright colors and ads, nothing you see in real desperate situations. Bottom line, it's not a b movie and it's not totally horrible, I enjoyed watching it at first, but I wont be eager to ever see it again and I'll probably wait to see the next one at home.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Virtually no plot, some good action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I sat down to watch RE: Extinction last night hoping that it was better, if not just as good, as the first two installments. Not being a fan of the games I can't judge the franchise as a whole, but the movies were pretty mediocre, making me wonder why they managed to make enough to merit sequels. Guess the fans are dedicated.Positives: The special effects were up to par, and the fight scenes were pretty good with a few kills that got me hoping the movies plot would show signs of live. Another positive was that I got to riff on the movie MST3K style throughout...Negatives: The worst part of this whole film is that a good 80-90% of the dialog is whispered, for what reason I couldn't figure out, but it annoyed the heck out of me. The plot is non-existent. There are a few subplots here and there which seem grafted from other movies and games... Most notably is an unintentionally hilarious seen of some sinister scientists trying to domesticate a zombie (by letting it play with a toddler toy) which seems right out of Day of the Dead. There is also an overabundance of mysterious men in suits plotting around board-meeting tables...All in all the film was a couple hours of fluffy action, gore, and hot young actresses, not unbearable, but not any good either...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A big improvement over Apocalypse. Another Resident Evil movie has hit the world and just like the first two it is average. It is more of the same with little changes. Maybe it is time for the Resident Evil movies to have a big makeover or become extinct.This time we are in the desert and like last time we are following some survivors. Same story basically. They have just added a new zombie, gave Alice new powers and put us in the desert. This doesn't get past much people. I am talking to you Resident evil writers. It feels like someone sat there and said " It would look cool if we done that".Some things that really annoy me is the zombies. We see them ripping cars apart but they can't push down an everyday fence. Another thing they pay way to much attention to Alice. Whether your watching her spinning swords around or watching her jump slow motion through the air. It is a waste of time and this movie only goes for an hour and half already.There are some good things. There are some eye catching environments and 1 or 2 jump scares but thats it. It seems the series can't catch up with the good zombie movies. An average movie.Only see this if you have seen the first two.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Milla is back, and thanks to tight wife-beaters and airbrushing, is cuter than ever. Fans of the game hate these movies along with everyone else who has good taste but I don't have good taste and I'm not a fan of the video games so I could care less and I loved the first Resident Evil. The second was vile with a poor plot and terrible direction, jumping from action scene to action scene with little thought given to plot or character development. The third I'm happy to say is a significant improvement and nearly as entertaining as the first. I do wish that Alice had died just so we could stop the Alice is super weapon silliness that started in Apocalypse. What I would really like to see is a RE zombie movie about surviving the zombies and not about ten kinds of other foolishness like clones, satellites, and mutating bad guys. I mean what was the point of introducing the plot line of trekking to Alaska when everyone dies two minutes later and the idea is moot, unless they were planting the idea for a sequel.Ali Larter is also cute in the movie and does a good job as Claire Redfield. She played a good balance of leader and bad ass without coming off as bitchy like Sienna Guillory did playing Jill Valentine. Of course I haven't played the game so maybe Jill V is a bitch, I don't know. I won't go into the 'controversy' about whether Ali looks like the video game character because I think that's silly. What I will go into is that Ali seemed like a random addition to the movie, almost tacked on as an after thought. Her character certainly wasn't needed and didn't play any significant part in the plot. Again, I can only guess that maybe she was introduced with the hope she might play in a sequel.If you are a hardcore Milla fan or liked the first or second Resident Evil then give this one a go, you might enjoy it. If you hated the first two then I don't see anything here for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I confess..I am drawn to B movies like moths to a flame! Despite having missed out on the earlier 2 films of the trilogy, I rented this on a lazy evening and got pretty much what I expected - bonus being some sheer eye candy in the form of the gorgeous Ali Larter and the equally lovely Milla Jovovich! The movie is a pretty straight forward zombies vs humans clash and not many surprises are in store. The familiar boo moments and obligatory gory killings compliment the action set-pieces, at least 2 of which (a vicious crow-attack &amp; an expansive shootout set in a desolate, devastated Las Vegas of the future) are quite impressive. The plot, if you can find one, is a mere excuse to deflect any criticism that might come one's way for having the gall in listing a director/screenwriter for the film and not just an action choreographer! Watch it if you're in the mood to satiate a craving for blood, gore &amp; guts - not if you seek food for thought...</fullReview>

Too bad the writers refuse to give you anything or anybody to truly like in these movies. And of course they left it open ended. You don't know whether the others got out of Vegas to their final destination and of course Alice swears she'll be bad to finish off the board of bad guys who started the whole thing.

		<fullReview>Just saw this on Blu-ray and generally speaking, it was OK. Obviously with a film like this, you kinda need to let your brain take a 90 minute break, but the one thing that had me yelling at the TV screen was the seemingly unlimited supply of super-aggressive zombies coming out of the cargo container in the Vegas scene. It was kinda like the horror movie version of the dozen or two clowns coming out of the VW Beatle gag. I was also looking for some answers at the end as to whether the remaining survivors made it to Alaska or not. I'm a big fan of the RE video game series and was hoping for a little better than this film ultimately delivered. Oh well, it looks like there will be another film in the series.</fullReview>

Unbelievable, completely unbelievable.The plot is completely disconnected with the "mysterious" council of suits and... just - this movie just plain sucks - I should have known better and I want my money back - and for the love of God, can we just ban Paul Anderson from the biz????

		<fullReview>I waited for the DVD... I liked the first two, regardless of the deviation from the games. I didn't get deep into the games so I didn't really care. But once I read the synopsis for RE:E I wasn't drawn in at all. Regardless of what I just said about not caring over the deviation, this is so far off from the game franchise... but spends plenty of time borrowing elements and themes from other films (Road Warrior, Mad Max, The Birds, the original George A Romero films and many more). It has a complete lack of originality.Frankly, Alice is the only "developed" character in this film. And by developed I mean, she basically is just shown with incredibly ridiculous new powers since we last saw her in RE:A. The telekinesis was kind of cool, but ummm the whole zapping the computer chip in the satellite? I don't think there is words to describe my thoughts of that. And (to borrow from another post's observation) she goes from super human to android... I mean wow, now they can suddenly shut her down? So yea there is character development... that just happened without us seeing. The other characters are pretty much plain and unimportant... I wasn't disappointed with any deaths. Given this lack of development, a lot of time was wasted focusing the film on these people.I understand the need to get a cure, though it was for purposes of greed so umbrella employees can return to the surface. But seriously, I just didn't care about all those Alice clones.I just watched it about 20 minutes ago... so I could easily go on, but I really need to restrain myself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my god!! I can't believe that Resident Evil: Extinction (RE:E) was a waste of time! It said that RE:E is actually based on Resident Evil Code: Veronica X (Video Game).I played that game before and I don't think that the movie is actually based by it (i don't know if any of you guys notice the similarity between RE:E and RE Code: Veronica X). But there is some moments of the movie that I don't quite understand. Why is Alice left alone? Where is Jill and Angie (From RE: Apocalypse)? How did they ended up in Nevada Dessert? How did Carlos and L.J ended up with Claire? And why Claire never mentioned her brother, Chris, in the movie? Isn't Chris is a main character in the game? I was really disappointed with this one..i waited 3 years for it! And i wasted RM11 (11 Ringgit Malaysia) to watched it on the cinema..but what I know is that, they are going to do the 4th one in Tokyo..and I don't have a clue who the main character (besides Alice) for the 4th one is..but I'm sure hoping it was Jill Valentine ( to continue her journey)..or even Chris Redfield..or even, the one that I love the most, Leon S. Kennedy.I think, with all the installments, it would be easier if they just make a TV Series for it..because if they want to make the movie version as real as the game version, it would take like around 8 or 10 installments..they haven't introduce Chris Redfield, Leon S. Kennedy, Ada Wong, Barry Burton, Ark Thompson, Bruce McGivern, Kevin Ryman, Mark Wilkins, Cindy Lenox, etc, in the movie yet..What I'm trying to say is, that the 3rd installment was a disaster. The 1st one it was really good, the 2nd is okay..but the 3rd..the worst installment ever..but, what I was really hoping that, the FINAL installment for the movie, all the main characters/survivors joining forces together and stop Umbrella Corporation once and for all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay. What the hell was this? The film trailer/advert revolved around "Las Vegas" and they were there for all of 10 minutes fighting zombies that could climb, rip, run and all that jazz. Yes they had Alice's blood but still, an over-reaction I thought.Now I felt, the storyline for this could be amazing. Instead of being an hour and twenty minutes it could have been at least 2 and a half hours long without boring senseless parts. I felt that they were going to Alaska since the infection hadn't reached there (how, it doesn't even explain it but I guess that's for the fourth one that WE KNOW is coming) and then just fly off in a 'copter with about 5-6 People. Where the hell did the 10 Kids go? And while they were in there, they smashed through a gate so why didn't the zombies try to get them? Alice just seemed unbothered as she stood there waving.Now to the characters, how many die? LJ is maybe the coolest character and gets munched in the beginning (we knew it was coming, horror cliché) and it took him a while to turn. I know why it took him a while though, only a cut really not a full on bite. Ashanti is supposed to be a main person since she's in the synopsis and she dies in 20-30 minutes. Wow, what a main character.I don't know, the story opportunities with this were astronomically big and still it was boring as hell. With that Professor person turning in to some invincible self healing person (looked like Nemesis in a way) and then killing everyone randomly. Why do the lights go out? Why does that always happen? There is no reason for the flickering lights and darkness for god sake! I don't know this film just annoyed me. I gave it a 5/10, rent it. Don't buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh dear. First they did RE1 a low production value attempt at turning a genius game into an action movie. When compared with the games there was very similarity, but as a movie it was decent, nothing special but watchable, and Jovovich was a good casting choice.Then RE2, which seemed like more of an attempt to be like the game bringing in Nemesis and making better game-plot references, but again low production value, and still not that rich in plot, but the way it ended definitely was intriguing.Then RE3, geez... Why did they decide to do a Mad Max meets Dawn of the dead? Their only moments that even referenced to the older movies (forget the games) were training scenarios, and flashbacks. There is very little dialogue, and less of it that has any importance, there is little plot, only build up plot for things that never happen, and I am sure are build up for the next sequel which will continue from where this leaves off.Instead of going further into plot and atmosphere, and realising what made the games so amazing, they went further into Hollywood action and gave up on plot and atmosphere entirely. I think it's safe to say, you won't be missing much not seeing this or the next movie.</fullReview>

This should tell us what happened between the first and the third movie. The training and the gathering scenes of the third part had been stolen from the movie "Day Of The Dead" by George A. Romero, but if you ignore this, the film is very good. I didn't notice any advertisement, because I watched the movie: the actions are well done, and I liked the zombie crows very much. But the ending is even better: it promises there will be a fourth movie with thousands of Alice who will showdown the zombies and the Co. The creature the doctor became is better then the "Nemesis" in part two and its death is witty as well. This movie is a real sequel to part one not like the second that wasn't a sequel and wasn't a prequel either. That was nothing. I hope part four will be at least as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lives Up To the Standards of its Predecessors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction, the latest offering in the movie trilogy based on the popular horror video game, lives up to the standards of its predecessors and will not likely disappoint fans of apocalyptic zombie films (of whom this reviewer is one).Omnipresent action star Milla Jovovich reprises her role in Extinction as little-red-dress-and-jackboot-wearing monster hunter Alice, and is ultimately joined by former compatriots Oded Fehr as soldier Carlos Olivera and Mike Epps as L.J. Other returning players include Iain Glenn as the gloatingly evil Dr. Isaacs (and the equally malevolent Manfred Powell in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider).In Extinction, the effects of the zombie-generating T-virus have spread far beyond Raccoon City and decimated not just the human population of the planet but also the environment, creating widespread desertification. Survivors in this undead-haunted world include hidden enclaves of Umbrella Corporation minions, pockets of cannibalistic scavengers, an armored convoy of nomads led by Olivera, L.J. and Claire (Ali Larter), and, naturally, Alice, attired for the post-apocalyptic world in renegade biker garb and armed, among other things, with a pair of Nepalese kukris.Survival in the harsh, zombie-ridden wasteland of the future would likely be difficult enough without anyone trying to make it worse, but that is, of course, what Dr. Isaacs endeavors to do, in the course of his interminable experiments.One element in Extinction has got to be either a tribute to classic Mel Gibson action film The Road Warrior, or a rip-off from it, is the armored tanker truck, complete with fighting platforms and flamethrower. Hell, it might actually be the same truck for all I know (although it would not likely have made its way from Australia to the various Mexican venues where Extinction was filmed).There are a few potentially minor weak points in the film that might chafe even fans of the genre a little. One of these is the use of fragmentary flashbacks that are not likely to mean much to people who haven't seen the previous films (if there are any that have seen this one and not the others). Another is a super-monster that, while more than adequate, is not quite as interesting or impressive as those that appeared in the previous Resident Evil movies. And, with no cobbler being apparent in Isaacs' Nevada facility, one might wonder why the profligate Umbrella Corporation does not bother to reuse boots no longer needed by their wearers (you'll see what I mean).Those points aside, however, there are a number of fun twists and revelations in Extinction that help to fill in the blanks in the Resident Evil story and plenty of zombie-killing action ? and the necropolis-like remnants of the Las Vegas strip alone make this film well worth watching.Michael J.

It's a very entertaining movie, but not very deep.If you enjoyed this movie you will also like movies like: No Escape (1994), Fortress (1993) and even Deep Rising (1998), though Deep Rising isn't postapocolyptic, but has a nice setting though.Enjoy!

		<fullReview>To turn someone who hates the Resident Evil franchise to suddenly like it, is a big thing, and RE3 did this for me.I hated the first movie, i thought it was awful and disgusting. Therefore I did not see the second one, however due to the spare time I've had lately I decided to see the third. And man was it good.:)In short, because I don't really have much to say, the film was excellent EXCEPT for the bad guy.A. They turned a perfectly good movie that had a slight hint of realism (except for telekinetic power) and made it ruined it with the inhuman flesh-hulk with super-scream powers and expendable fingers. B. The flesh-hulk thing died like 10 minutes after we see him and he didn't die in a cool way (being chopped to bits by lasers was a one-time wonder and to do it again was just pointless). C. Although the character was meant to come off as strong and scary, because he died 10 minutes later that effect failed completely.HOWEVER. That's only about 10 minutes of the film so I did not bother including it into my rating. Go see it. It is actually good. Unlike the first one. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I should've waited for DVD - and Romero needs a good lawyer to sue for royalties</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extinction was leaving British cinemas from this weekend so I thought, catch at least one of the Resident Evil films on the big screen for once. Wrong choice, I only watched Apocalypse on DVD the day before I caught this film and the small screen's the best place for them.On the big screen my problem with RE Extinction was the fact that despite being based on a novel where some scenes could have been brought to life, standard scary movie clichés abound - Oded Fehr's recurring character is an ex-SWAT type, but after battling these creatures twice before these idiots *still* split up to search empty buildings instead of covering each other? If they've been driving through the desert, wouldn't they have needed to weather-proof the vehicles as best they can for a quick getaway, if they've "lost people before"? Guess what happens next... then there are other scenes where people die for no good reason because it's a horror film and common sense has to be discarded to move the film on and hit the 95-minute mark (eg the Day of the Dead "Bub training" scene).The script is a travelogue, moving Alice on her own and this Land of the Dead-style convoy from A to B to C and actually, moves from ripping off early Romero like the first two films did, to Dawn of the Dead 2004, Day of the Dead and 28 Days/Weeks Later. There are visual steals from Planet of The Apes and Hitchcock's The Birds, the former being a cruelly wasted visual homage rather than amping up the scale of the action like it could have done - though it's stylishly done, it's hard to care about some characters that die if you were only introduced to them just under an hour earlier. Parts of Extinction deliberately take you back to the very first film, but once the slam-bang finale is over with, it sets you up for a big finish in part 4.One problem that carries on from Apocalypse to Extinction is that the characters fight like they're in a video game which just doesn't work on film. Once again, Oded Fehr's character should know best but no, everybody stands around waiting for their ammo to run out before they start retreating, when they're up against the "28 Days Later" Zombies including trying to shoot them anywhere else but in the head without using big knives instead. That leads to the other millennial gender politics of film occurring since the convoy is decimated by the time they get to the life-saving transport - but in another magic edit, we don't get to see the zombies flood the outer compound. (It would have been more believable that they couldn't break down the fences had they been electrified as in Land of the Dead, probably a budgetary issue).Ultimately the natural home for these flicks, while Paul Anderson's writing the script anyway, is on DVD. Direction is as well executed as you'd expect from the director of Highlander but he's only got the script he's been given. Hopefully no.4, if it's the last one, will be allowed maybe 10-15 minutes more if we're talking about a Terminator-styled bringing it back to the start in order to finish the film franchise. It's divided critics and fans alike but I will give it another viewing on DVD next year where I'll probably enjoy it a lot more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like "Highlander" and I like Zombies, so I went to see this movie, even though I didn't saw the previous ones and ain't too aware of the video game (I've played once or twice to one of them, but I'm not fanatic about video-games). In my mind, the movie was a crossover between sword duels with living dead and cheap visual kitch effects. Well, I wasn't disappointed. I'm sure that the desperate high-tech visual touch of the movie will become kitch in no time (let's wait ten years and see how old this movie gets). But what I particularly enjoyed are the absurd fights robbed in a referential package, that pleased the B-movie lover in me."Extinction" is surely not an intellectual movie, not even a Tarantino-like post modern film, but the way the movie deals with cinephilic references is quite intriguing. Two examples (but the movie is full of scenes like that) : there's an obvious Hitchcock'homage when infected crows began to attack people as in "The Bird". And of course, I especially like the "Day of the dead" parody, that you can see through the all movie that confronts a mad scientist with stupid soldiers. Romero's parody culminates in a hilarious scene, where the crazy scientist believed he archived to domesticate one of the dead, but the finally doesn't seem so ready to be a human slave.The visual aspect of the movie is most intriguing part of the film. I don't know about the first ones, but "Resident Evil" manage to be a gore movie (with blood and rotten living dead), but also tries to be clean, just like a numeric video game. I think I never saw blood looks so clean on a movie before, and for that, "Extinction" is quite unique. It's like a gore movie made for the all family to watch. To sum up, there's funny references, well done action and fight scenes, and a rather unusual visual style that makes "Resident Evil : Extenction" a rather funny and pleasant moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting film with an interesting idea but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I'll start straight away by commenting on the positives, the most obvious of which being that this film is miles better than it's predecessor- Resident Evil: Apocalypse- and does well to keep in line with the games- to a certain extent (obviouisly I'm not including plot in this but the general atmosphere and mood works relatively well.) However, here comes the moan and boy is it a moan? The major problem with this film is that it does absolutely nothing to advance on the plot established in the first two films and acts more as a "filler" of more to come. The plot itself is weak and some of the ideas come across as highly optimistic- i.e. The producers expected a lot more when they wrote them down than when they were actually filmed and put into practise- but, at the same time, it doesn't go off on too many confusing tangents and keeps itself simple which leads to a fun film that is a nice break from some of the mentally taxing jargon that the film industry spouts out these days. As ever, Milla Jovovich plays the character of Alice (or should that be the characters of Alice?) pretty well and keeps the viewers entertained just enough to allow the film some sustainability. The action scenes are graphically very attractive and there are numerous chills and thrills to keep the film alive just enough. Of course, the open ending- which would have been far better had they added another 20 minutes and then let it end properly- is there to allow room for "Resident Evil: Not so extinction after all" and it's sequel "Resident Evil: Oh look, the dead are walking once again" but it is fun and worth seeing, particularly for fans of the game (even though the film has very little to do with any of the games).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil 3: Extinction. OK, don't read further if you don't want any spoilers. For you who are fans of the game you will be disappointed (like, a lot) from this makeover, as it goes way too far beyond the game itself. But if you're just come for the actions, it rocks. Its the kind of movies to watch with pop-corns and cappuccinos in hands.The story is based on the 4th game Resident Evil: Code Veronica with so much plot developments. One thing that doesn't go with the game, now Alice has telekinesis power. And she uses that mercilessly. Zombies for the worst. Wish we have that in the game, lol. A lot of settings and buildings are taken from the game for us gamer fans to go 'I remember this place..' So, at the beginning of the movie, the world has ended and the zombies won. Normal humans are forced to live underground and only small groups of people are living above, pillaging every town they can find. One of the groups are led by Claire Redfield (the game:RE2) and Carlos Oliveira (RE3).One thing led to another and finally the heroes are united to fights the Umbrella led by Wesker (RE1, RE4). Yes, Wesker is back with the cool glasses. Unfortunately they have to face Dr. Isaac first, who is super mutated (like Nemesis from RE3) in Las Vegas. The rest is usual heroes movies, lots of actions and bloods, and in the end the good guys wins. It's that simple.If you're not into bloods and gore, this movie is not recommended of course. Duh, come on. It has R rating for for non-stop violence. But the actions are good. The endings are still hanging so it opens a chance for the next RE movie installments, if this movie makes good profit.Overall I enjoy the movie, got up from my seat smiling. The only thing lacking is the adventure like in the game when you have to do or get something to solve a mystery. Yeah.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the resident evil movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first two resident evil movies weren't the most faithful of game based movies .Resident evil: extinction is no different , but what it lacks in staying true to its source material, it makes up for in being fast and entertaining, if a little superficial. Its by no means perfect- there's more po faced exposition than actual dialogue and despite there being a lot of characters fighting for survival, there's no real character development or any of the sort of drama you'd expect from the scenario this film offers. But then again, maybe asking that of resident evil: extinction is asking for too much. This is this the kind of film where a sexy babe with two blades fights zombies , evil crows and mutant dogs-which is an indication of what you'll get with this.And speaking of sexy babes with blades, millia does her action hero thing brilliantly . As usual she isn't given a huge stretch for her acting muscles, but she kicks ass with conviction - which is a good thing since this film is full of action.And that action is frequent, entertaining and well directed (if a little shaky with the camera work).It doesn't come close to any zombie movie classic i could name, but resident evil: extinction is a competently handled, entertaining and action packed film . Best of the resident evil movies.</fullReview>

And in my other reviews .. I always put it on top of the best movies in that genre .. but this seriously and dramatically changed .. resident evil 2 .. was still nice with very good acting and nice characters .. suspense ending .. nice effects .. and it kept me on edge ? zombies taking over the city .. a some balanced gore .. and tense action .. but wasn't still as good as part 1 .., but now with resident Evil Extension ?I feel like the movie series got out of control .. out of focus and specially not as exciting as before .. , it is going to the direction of heroes or the 4400 in some way ..not a zombie movie anymore !!! I go to see resident evil I except a thriller horror movie With a lot of zombie action ? in the traditional way ! , if zombies can think .. well they are not zombies any more .. no ? the movie is not well done .. I guess it got almost 1/2 the budget of resident evil 2 or maybe even less ! , you are not attached to any of the movie characters ? you basically don't care who dies and who lives , so where is the gold old zombie suspense .. ? the action parts was not as exciting as we used from resident evil ? I basically don't think that will make a resident evil 4 ..not worth it anymore !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seriously, as a person who very rarely watches horror movies, especially ones from the Sultan of Shlock, Paul WS Anderson, and a occasional player of the Resident Evil games, I must say.... what? What the living hell (see the pun?) is this suppose to be. Thanks to my better judgement I waited 3 months to rent the film rather than waste a fiver to see it at the cinema. Again, I'm not a big Paul WS Anderson fan (shock horror) but I must say he has never made such a terrible movie, this film makes Alien Vs Predator look like Alien: Resurrection, it's not good but hell of a lot better. Also why steal possibly my favourite George A. Romero scene where they try to humanise the zombies, by helping them remember how they use to live, but Mister Anderson (could he be the ever boring Neo ?) has chosen to ruin this scene by hiring the most retarded looking zombie there is, and some how clones him repeatedly (which is never explained, like how he keeps getting work.) Also, Oded Fehr who I believe had the only DECENT role in the film, has barely anything to do in this, he kills about 5 zombies and constantly craves for a cigarette until he blows up....um...wow...an explosion. Also what happened to Claire and the aptly named K-mart, (cheap prices comes with cheap acting.) Finally, and foremost to summarise this movie in a few words... It plainly just sucks.F.Nich</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first installment of Resident Evil was true enough to the video game to make it a great movie. The second movie was like resident evil video game4 enough. Resident Evil: Extinction (#3) seemed like the 'extinction' of the franchise in movies because it is now Science fiction not Horror. Just look at it,... Alice is now a computer controlled zombie, but not a zombie?.., controlled by a satellite in orbit and she has telekinetic powers. This is not "Resident Evil". Resident Evil is about a presence of the undead that is a resident of the mansion in the video game. Resident Evil Extinction is a desperate attempt to make a movie with writers that don't know what to do for a major motion picture, unless the writers never played the video game or talked to the original writers. This movie sucks bad!... compared to the first two movies. Actually this movie makes Resident Evil Apocalypse seem like a masterpiece..... and Apocalypse was not really that good. Extinction makes Apocalypse look like Genesis. I would wait until Extinction comes out on video and use a free rental for this piece of crap!!!!!!!!!! If you don't think this movie sucks just wait until the end when you see that the completion of the story is ten's of hundreds of cloned Alice's and that is the basis for the next movie. If that is the basis for the next movie,...... This franchise is Bullsh*t. This is Horror becomes poor Sci-fi, because the writers are so stupid they can't think of anything else.</fullReview>

This third one had to go with the typical taking over the world, and how people are reduced back to basics and look really scruffy etc.. It's just too boring and same old and there really wasn't that many fight scenes with the main women in.Some bits were quite tacky and cheesy which got right on my nerves. So i sat and watched the film for an hour or so...and then the ending is really quick and short and you will disappointed there barely is a huge fight at the end, and the CGI really isn't up to scratch compared to some of the films out today.Don't watch it its disappointing</fullReview>

It is getting more ridiculous still when the action takes place in a post-apocalyptic desert. They don't have food, water or any future, but they always have plenty of gas and bullets.This part of the series takes bad writing to extinction. Alice has psychic powers and she uses them about three times in the whole movie, four if you count sleepwalking (sleeppsyching? :) ) with only one significant result. Everybody else dies, either stupidly, heroically or semantically (they leave for Alaska which is remote, but still in the States. There is no reason to destroy the world if you can't be patriotic :). Also, the good psychotic doctor also becomes some mutated monster, then dies.Also, being a front girl for a cosmetic company has its downfalls as well: poor Milla looks like she has smooth plastic skin.Bottom line: the first movie was fun, based on the game; the second was a bit stretched, but still entertaining enough; the third is a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil: Extinction - JoeMDesign Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My personal memories of the games to films experience began back when the first Mortal Kombat movie came out. I still stand by my opinion that the fighting game film was excellent entertainment and well worthy of the franchise license. Tomb Raider had the one and only Angelina Jolie in it... Enough said... And even the much lamented Doom movie had some nice moments which made it a fun popcorn-movie blast.In between all of the movies in this category the Resident Evil series, now the first Hollywood game-to-movie trilogy, has been the most controversial in the eyes of fans and movie-goers everywhere. Fans either love it or hate it. It's that simple.Now some of the film versions of game story lines are very close to their source material while others take huge liberties to make it a more cinematic experience. No-one wants to watch Master Chief running into a room and shooting people over and over and over... but that's what seems to be on my TV these days... anyway... This relationship with the source material is an essential element with any game to film project but it's one that the Resident Evil series has flirted with on a very casual basis.The first Resident Evil movie was a very liberal use of the license to say the least. It featured none of the characters of the games nor the memorable environments or situations. It was however a nice little zombie movie with a style all of it's own. It was not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination but it did well enough to warrant a sequel...While the first movie had only a passing resemblance to the games, the second was based very heavily on Resident Evil 2 and 3 with characters and environments taken straight from those titles. One scene (and you know which one I'm talking about) was lifted directly from the Code: Veronica game which was the cause of celebration for longtime Resident Evil fans (or at least this one). As much as fans may have enjoyed these elements, most people would agree that sometimes you can go too far. I don't care what anyone says, Jill's Resident Evil 3 outfit shouldn't have made the film. It just looks... silly! I think that's enough background info so now on to the third film, Resident Evil Extinction. Finally the movie series has reached it's stride and decided on what it's relationship with the game series actually is. The movies all revolve around Alice played by Milla Jovovich and her very rough life as the secret test subject for the Umbrella corporation's evil T-Virus project. While events in the film have a relationship to the games the film has it's own story to tell and for the first time in the series history, is actually quite good.The main difference between this movie and it's predecessors is all to do with the pacing of it's scenes. The film links together a number of imaginative action set pieces, bloody zombie battles and story-progressing dialogue with a lot more subtlety than before. Now, some of the people who have seen the first two films will be thinking something along the lines of "Well that's not that hard" and I agree with you but this particular Resident Evil film has the best pacing and story of the three movies.Instead of over complicating the series further with more conspiracy theories or the secrets upon secrets nonsense the movie concentrates on the livelihood of a small band of survivors. The situation is pretty dire as humanity faces a global zombie epidemic and it's up to Alice to help Sarah Connor wannabe Claire Redfield's refugee convoy reach a place where they'll be safe from people trying to eat their brains. Stranded in the Nevada desert with basic resources such as food and petrol becoming more scarce by the day they decide to make one last journey to reach a distant destination in Alaska where they hope salvation awaits them.Not to spoil the movie but it has a great variety of action scenes involving killer crows, smarter zombies and an old Resident Evil monster variant for Alice to contend with. Additional threats come from the first, and long-overdue, appearance of one Albert Wesker. Fans of zombie films will certainly get their fill of gore and other hacking violence while characters drop like flies during the more action-filled sequences.The acting is typically cheesy but you aren't going to see this film expecting Shakespeare so it would be unfair to list that as a serious criticism.Perhaps we've finally seen the maturity of the Resident Evil series. The game and film complement each other very well now. Extinction actually goes some way to explain why the zombie enemies of Resident Evil 4 appear to be smarter and less blood thirsty than other games. Conversely the fifth Resident Evil game looks set to take place in a scorchingly hot desert location which seems to be inspired by the setting of the film.Films that are based on games should appeal to fans of both formats. Resident Evil: Extinction actually succeeds in doing this. Finally another example of good use of a license that manages to please all sections of the Resident Evil fan base......unless you see the ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice in Zombieland 3: Uncharacteristically average.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third outing was disappointing because after two successful outings (above average releases) Resident Evil had become for me a sort of "brand name" you could trust. My problem with this third installment is that no real care was given to quality of story, characters, and special effects. I wish, for instance, that it had a more suspense and some more surprises; more interesting supporting characters (none of them had any personality folks); and was more visually imaginative.Basically our heroine is now aimlessly wandering the dusty plains on a dusty motorcycle in a dusty coat (reminding me of some heroic western tough guy if you substitute the motorcycle for a horse). The story begins with her waking up naked reminiscent of the previous Resident Evil but she's covered by a white sheet and we don't get to see anything (Damn it to hell!!). Somehow managing to score some rugged, bad-ass girl duds, a motorcycle, and various weaponry, she eventually hooks up with a bus load and truck load of survivors (unzombified) who are looking for other survivors and the promised land, or something. In the mean time some mad scientist who has been trying to find a way to control the zombies discovers that our heroine, the original Alice, is still out there somewhere with the precious T-virus antidote in her blood. So he sets out to snare her so he can bring her back to his lab and have his way with her (Can you blame him?).Finally: This -in my opinion- is an "average" flick unlike it's 2 predecessors. I recommend it if you have nothing better to do right now and in need of some mild (standard) zombie entertainment. Before I went to see this movie, I didn't read or listen to any reviews; I just grabbed my wallet and crammed as many nieces and nephews in my car as I could and sped off like a jack rabbit on crack (I do so love kick-ass women, folks). Well I won't be doing that again. I must have blown 80 bucks on that mad, impetuous day (I'm like a 5 yr old when I get excited). -Don't get me wrong, I'm not sorry I saw it. I'm just sorry I rushed when I could have leisurely waited for an invite from someone who was going (and paying) or who rented it or bought the DVD later on. Listen, you might think better of this 3rd Resident Evil than I do. I saw, for instance, that another IMDb reviewer gave it a whopping "9 stars". What the F**K!!! -My eyes almost flew out of my head. But he or she saw what they saw and I have to respect that. I'm just one opinion in a sea of them. Love, Boloxxxi.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction follows on from the previous 2 RE films, although set some years after the events of RE. Apocalypse. The setting is a post-apocalyptic earth inhabited predominately by zombie mutations, with a few human survivors fighting their way through life.The difference with this film from the 2 before it is that it suffers from little plot, being more than slightly rushed towards the end to fit what plot there is into it and stretches far too much of what isn't needed. Each of the films have there own flaws but this one is weighed down by a hefty chunk of exposition and 'story' which is mainly not required i.e. most of the first 45 minutes of the film, which sets the tone to slow and laborious rather than atmospheric or action packed.What action there is though, is good. The monsters are OK (certainly better looking than 'Nemesis' from the last film, who was essentially just a giant cartoon) and the acting is... there. What suffers though, is the plot. More so, the lack of it. Without revealing anything, some parts rely too heavily on the first film for ideas and most of it seems to be giving George A. Romero's "Day of the Dead" more than just a nod and wink.All this said, it isn't a bad film. It has a violent charm and some good effects and action and a couple of, albeit predicable, jumpy moments. However, so much could have been done that wasn't, so I see this as a somewhat missed opportunity for what will probably be the last in this series of films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Have you ever come out of the cinema and wondered what had happened to time? Well, you've probably watched Resident Evil: Extinction. The movie opens to Alice telling you that the virus has escaped Raccoon City and has taken over the world. This movie does nothing to complete the trilogy. In fact, it is a nonsense story that doesn't even follow on from the second movie. We're in an apocalypse (rip off from Mad Max) as a band of people keep moving to prevent the zombies attack. Soon they run out of petrol and Alice appears with news that there is an area in Alaska that has been unaffected. So as she guides them, the Umbrella corp. is trying to reverse the affects of the virus by a mad scientist (cliche) and they need Alice's blood. Oh, Alice now has supernatural powers. Where did this come from? The story goes no where as they don't get to Alaska, everyone dies except Alice who has more fights with zombies, super zombies and a mad scientist who meets with his peers using a hologram (rip off from Star Wars). Milla's makeup is awful as they've tried to give her a tan. Sadly we're left with a story that goes nowhere and is deliberately that way for a fourth movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same Old</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had already ceased to hope that this movie franchise would have a lot to do with the Resident Evil games - of whom they conveniently "borrowed" the name to get some easy cash from innocent fans. If you've seen the first two films, then really, there would be no reason for you to believe you'd go into the cinema and relive anything similar to the emotions the games can put you through. But ultimately, it's something else entirely that kills off this film and you can spot it with ease: it's recycled stuff.From Mad Max to Day of the Dead, The Birds, Land of the Dead and several other feature films, Resident Evil: Extinction "borrows" extensively. I guess that's bad in itself, but if you consider that originality was the last thing which defined the film series, then it's actually got little to say.This third time around, Alice roams through the US with her nice super-powers in her attempt to ... (this is where you find out for yourselves what her purpose is, for the most I could figure out was "seek revenge on Umbrella") in a world which has become completely barren and devoid of life. As a matter of fact, this little bit of info which is delivered to us in a short narration by Milla Jovovich at the beginning of the film - how the virus has somehow sucked the life out of our planet physically - is perhaps one of the most interesting concepts RE 3 has to offer, but unfortunately it's treated as such an insignificant matter that you are bound to ignore it all together. The actual storyline involves a bunch of people traveling through the desert without any real aim except for survival and the "crazy doctor" who tries to find a cure and in the process is corrupted by power. There's a lot of fighting, kicking, slashing and shooting going on and it's all reasonably enjoyable, but the lack of purpose to the whole story makes you feel too detached to actually care for anything, even if Milla works quite hard to achieve the contrary. Some effects are cool, some scenes are a bit creepy, some elements actually look like those from the games. But seeing a central character like Albert Wesker introduced into the series as such a moronic persona, that was just appalling. I swear I'd have thought the guy playing Wesker was somehow related to someone related to the producers, because his acting is sooo poor, I just can't bring it into words. Not to mention the fact that the guy in the film bears no resemblance to the guy in the games, but for the name and the sunglasses - I guess in a way that actually makes him symbolic to the film franchise.I guess that if you can ignore him (or don't know the original to begin with) you'll be able to cope with the rest of the film better. It's ultimately a decent slash and dash flick, but the fact that in the end it leaves you with nothing whatsoever is just not enough as far as I'm concerned. To me, this stuff will never be Resident Evil.</fullReview>

The director uses the following movie tricks which have been used in just about every horror movie I have seen:a) Slow motion movie trick b) The open the door trick c) Mistaking the mirror for a real person trick d) The out of no-where zombie trickThe movie plot seems to have been used time and time again.The human race have been destroyed and only a few survivors remain. They have an bunch of flesh-eating zombies on their tale and it's up to the survivors to kill them.On the bright side, if angry, half dead zombies and sexy looking heroes are your thing then you'll enjoy Resident Evil Extinction!Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil Extinction is better than Apocalypse, but it still makes me think that why they do that? I mean bad movies? And it is very annoying that in IMDb, there are a lot of good movies whose ratings are less than Extinction, but deserve much more. The opening scene of the movie aims to surprise the audience, but it can't. There are only two good things in this film, the panoramic views and the cinematography, this is a post apocalyptic film, a movie in dust and dirt! The abominable family at the beginnings recall Judge Dredd (or Chronicles of Riddick) and it was exciting. The second and third Resident Evil movies don't focus on the zombie action and zombie horror, there are awful sub stories and characters instead. However, when I saw that the director of Extinction is Russell Mulcahy, I cheered up, because he is a cult director from 80s and 90s, he made some cult B movies like Highlander. However, he disappointed me. However, as said, the movie has a better, solid direction. As said, in terms of direction, this is much better than the second one, but still this is not a well executed and well delivered movie. Returning to the story, the people who hunt zombies for fun from a convoy was cliché (already used by Romero in Land of the Dead) The best part of the movie begins when they arrive at New York. However, zombies's make up effects are awful, there are time-lapse shots which good news for 28 Days Later fans, but bad news for Resident Evil fans! Extinction is an entertaining movie, if all you want is just entertainment. The monster of Extinction is not as ridiculous as Nemesis, but still very uninspiring, terrible looking... Why we cannot see a well done monster in R.E. movies since the first film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about Milla...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like I already said: It's all about Milla. If you like her, you'll like all three parts of Resident Evil trilogy.First of all, I'm not Resident Evil games fan. I never played any of these games, but I really like the whole Resident Evil movie trilogy. I admit, it's more or less because of good looking and in every scene sexy Milla. The same thing was with Underworld and Kate Beckinsale.Bunch of people say Milla isn't any good as an actress. Well I don't agree with that. She was great in the movies No Good Deed, Dazed and Confused, Dummy (and of course Res. Evil) and is the main reason why so many people watched these movies. I believe that the true reason why so many people don't like her is because she isn't ambitious like, let's say, Brad Pitt, Leonardo di Caprio, Keira Knightley etc. She is, in one hand, synonym for B-movies, but Jason Statham and lot's of other good actors are too. So does that makes them a bad actors? No, it doesn't. They just act in the movies where they know they can be good and that is the main reason why I respect them so much. They don't aim too high, so they never end up short like some other "great" actors.So, if you are looking for some movie with good - looking actress, very good action and lot's of fun, I believe you should watch the whole trilogy. Just take the movies for what they really are, relax and enjoy it. Like someone already said, it's a perfect popcorn trilogy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil: Cinematic Decimation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like zombie films. In fact, I love zombie films. So, naturally , when Resident Evil: Extinction came out, I immediately went to the local cinema and watched it. I wasn't expecting anything great -- I had anticipated the unwelcome development of the 'Alice' storyline since watching Resident Evil: Apocalypse -- but I wasn't expecting anything this bad. Here's why this film sucks: 1) The zombies are not at all scary; the make-up and choreography is appalling. 2) The 'Alice' storyline is f*cking ridiculous -- Milla Jovovich has become some sort of superhero (and has had some weird airbrushing effects done to her). 3) The plot has become boring. Not terrible, not some huge abomination... just boring. There's no development or anything. For those of you considering watching this: don't. Go watch a proper zombie flick, like Dawn of the Dead (either version) or 28 Days/Weeks Later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone was excited to see how well the third installment of Paul W.S. Anderson's (writer) Resident Evil will flaunt in theater's. I was as well anticipating seeing the movie in theater's as usual but decided to wait for it at original copies or clear, legal ripped movie on the net. Finally watching the film, I wasn't at all intensified with the flicks and twists it presented me for the first thirty minutes. Disappointing, to partially express a view for this, the third installment of Resident Evil wasn't that eye-catching, I guess the plot and acting didn't fit in, the story was quite lame to convince real scenery of an almost extinct post-apocalyptic world. The action scenes were also not that creative, but least to say so Milla Jovovich manage to preserve her character as is?the only gruesome I could acceptably identify were four: zombies ,dead K9s, infected crows and oh the sudden mutation of Dr. Isaac whom he consider himself the future he was always seeking rather than Alice herself. I also felt pity for those untimely sacrifices some characters gone, except for Carlos Olivera?and I knew that he and Alice had "something", I was glad but unsatisfied.Least to say so, it was still a considerable Resident Evil film sequel to follow what happened thereafter and apocalyptic disaster. But for me I appreciate the first two installments as more compelling. In this movie, I didn't felt the chills I usually had with the first two ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, the first movie was good enough. After watching the second, I had a general idea what to expect from this movie. I was right.**SPOILERS** It's still all about Alice.. and how awesome she is. (she either looks like the merchant or Leon from RE4, while her clones wears the Ada outfit, and Chris and Jill are still not the main characters. She also has Weskers superpowers, along with a few extras) Everything we see has turned into a desert. The last survivors struggle daily (as expected) against hordes of zombies that wants to eat them all. They make sure to keep a defensive perimeter with motion sensors to warn them of intruders. Meanwhile, Alice sleeps under an open sky, without any protection at all.They make Claire Redfield into a fool. "Well, she's lost half the caravan already, and she obviously need to ask everyone if they should stay on the spot and die, or give Alaska a chance." Lucky for them, Alice saves them all over and over again.Then we have a brief meeting with a Tyrant-look-a-like. Seriously, even Nemesissy lasted longer. And now Alice is going to take all her clones with her to destroy Umbrella and then cure the world.This was another Almighty Alice movie. The only redeeming things for me was Isaacs scheming and Wesker.. even if he wasn't the empowered, cold hearted being we know from the RE games.I hope they does another set of movies, that actually follows the plot somewhat. Yes, they don't have to include the herbs and riddles of the mansion.. but at least the plot.. and more of the mutants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This can not even be called a zombie movie.The only zombies you get to see are huddling round a small fence that they somehow can not get through, but I guess the directors thought we wouldn't pick up on that, sorry guys.At least we get to see some killer birds. Okay, no. The killer birds sucked and as soon as I seen them I knew this movie was not getting any better.So to stay as un-original as possible one of the survivors gets bitten, dosen't tell anyone and inevitably turns on his friends.And again, to make it even more mind numbing Jill gets some physcic powers that again make this movie even more incredibly STUPID.This film in a whole is an insult to Resident evil. How ANYONE actually thought this movie was good is beyond me. All that I can hope for now is that they never bring out a 4th.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** A lot like the 1981 Mel Gibson apocalyptic auctioneer "Road Warrior" the movie "Resident Evil: Extinction" has to do with an experiment gone wrong; terribly wrong. Having mistakenly released the deadly T-Virus out of their main laboratory in Racoon City the Umbrella Cooperation is now trying to find an antidote to it in order to save the last few uninfected human survivors still left. One of the head honcho's of the UC Dr. Isaacs, Lain Glenn, is secretly experimenting with those infected by the T-Virus in order the make them obedient slaves to their masters, the cooperations, when and if a cure is found to keep, if not eradicate, the T-Virus in check.The key to finding a cure for the T-Virus is the now escaped head of security of the UC Alice, Milla Jouovich. Cloning scores of Alices' by Dr. Isaacs have all failed with them being killed, running through a deadly obstacle course, in trying to find out that their a perfect replication of Alice. It's the real Alice that Dr. Isaacs wants and to find her he'll use every means at his disposal to track her down even if it means going against the orders of his superiors at Umbrella Corps.Alice after a close and deadly encounter with a number of flesh-eating virus infected zombies and mutant wild dogs makes her way to this caravan of human survivors in the Nevada Desert. It was while Alice was out on her own she came across a booklet with transcribe radio transmissions from Alaska. The radio transmissions say that Alaska is the only place on earth that the T-Virus hasn't been able to penetrate. Giving this very vital information to the leader of the desert caravan Clair Redfield, Ali Larter, Alice has her decide to travel up north to finally get away from then tens of thousands of flesh eating zombies that roam the now almost totally deserted, of human beings, United States.Exciting run to daylight by the trucks cars and oil-tanker of the, what seems like, last human survivors of the continental US with tens of thousands of zombies either hot on their tail or in their face. Alice &amp; Clair gets the convoy as far as Las Vegas where it ends up being stuck in five to ten feet of loose and shifting desert sands. Forced to make a stand the caravan survivors are almost wiped out by the rampaging and almost unstoppable zombies thirsting for their flesh since, from the looks of them, they haven't eaten in days. Alice saves the day by getting the few survivors out and then together with Carlos, Oden Fehr, runs the gantlet in smashing into the UC main headquarters and experiment center just outside of Vegas.With the remaining survivors safely put on one of the UC helicopters and out of harms way Alice makes her way into the heart of the experiment center. It's there that she finds out what Dr. Isaacs, who had morphed himself into an outer space alien-like monster, had planned to do to both her as well as himself to, in his own unique and insane way, single-handedly take over the world!The films confusing story is saved by its very effective and heart-stopping action scenes. Alice with her both super 9mm automatics and ferocious looking Gurkha bolo's, machetes, is more then a match for the hundreds of wild and screaming zombies that she has no trouble at all putting away. It's only later when Alice confronts the what seemed to be indestructible Dr. Isaacs, looking like the intergalactic stowaway monster in the movie "Alien", that she finds she has her hands full in trying to take him out. ***SPOILERS**** It turns out that Alice has a friend that the megalomaniac Dr. Issac had completely overlooked in his attempt to both capture and, after he got what he wanted out of Alice, do her in. That friend not only rescues Alice but together with her help will not only put a stop to the rampaging T-Virus but the, what's left of them, top men of the UC; who's mad and self-serving experiments had created it in the first place.</fullReview>

No problem there Hollywood is full of them! so I'm sure the kid has a bright and drooling carrier ahead of it.This movie was worth what I invested into it, 35 cent's and the time I took downloading it. The only thing I enjoyed was throwing it in the trash poured 10 pounds of black powder in with it, setting it on fire and blowing it up then pissing on its ashes.Spoiler Alert!! everyone dies except the HO-HO-HO! go figure right.Just an added bonus for you bone heads if it wasn't for the video game Biohazard back in 1989 for the Nintendo Famicom your bull crap movies would have never been made.

		<fullReview>There are statements people can make that instantly tell you everything you need to know about them. When Albert Einstein stated that the simple version of relativity was akin to how quickly time moved in different situations, for example, it told the world they were dealing with an intelligence too great to be easily understood. So when a person tells you that Resident Evil: Extinction is a good film, you instantly know that they are a grade A moron who is best swiftly removed from the gene pool. And it is not like the filmmakers failed to try this time. After the exercise in failure to deliver that the previous sequel turned into, this installment simply had to get better by comparison. The unfortunate downside to this being that a lot of mouth-breathers who have obviously never seen a Romero or Fulci film have the unfortunate habit of confusing "better" with "good". Websites dedicated to the savoring of bad films will tell you that a film is in trouble when it starts to remind you of better ones. RE:E takes less than four minutes to remind viewers of the substantially better original.By now, we know better than to go to a Resident Evil film expecting anything like good acting or a well-told story. But what separates the first film from its sequels is a little quality called atmosphere. Simply put, the look, the feel, the music, and even some of the performances, were "right". Resident Evil took the time to suspend the viewer's disbelief and draw them into its world. The sequels absolutely fail at this deceptively simple step because they take it for granted that the viewer has been drawn in. This becomes painfully obvious when voiceovers describe how the T-virus has somehow dried up the oceans or other such rot. No matter how lethal and easily transmissible a virus can be, one that destroys the environment that it is meant to thrive in is not well-equipped for long-term survival. But since we are meant to accept this virus as being able to instantly adapt to whatever needs the plot requires, we also accept that making sense is not high on the list of priorities the filmmakers have.If only the film having a voice of its own was a higher priority to these filmmakers. As said previously, RE:E wastes no time in reminding the viewers of better films. Aside from the original in the series, RE:E also attempts to steal from not one, not two, but three George Romero films, all from the same series. Say what you will about Day Of The Dead especially, but Day Of The Dead's subplot about attempts to domesticate the zombies made an interesting metaphor for the intolerance human society was and is developing for natural behaviour that does not meet the expected norm. In RE:E, this subplot is handled with such clumsy focus on attempting to move the plot forward by any means necessary that any social commentary is lost in the disbelief at how inept the storytellers seem. The concept of parties raiding old towns for supplies is also about as original as a third-generation fax, but it is done so badly here that it truly makes one appreciate how Land Of The Dead negated questions about what the heroes are going to do when the leftovers run out.And even if RE:E fails to remind one of much better films, the philosophy that less is more completely and utterly backfires. One reason the Resident Evil sequels remind this viewer a lot of Romero's Dead series is because Romero's Dead series allocated sufficient time to explore enough of the characters that their plight and struggles seemed real and compelling. The manner in which the shopping mall environment slowly evolves from a safe paradise to a prison is very palpable due to the acting in Dawn Of The Dead. The real Dawn Of The Dead, I mean. When you see Omar Epps return for another performance in RE:E, all the toning down of the bling bling act in the world cannot help but bring back memories of his performance in the previous film. Which in turn leaves audiences who can read and speak at an adult level wishing to see his character die a gruesome and horrid death. While RE:E is not quite as softcore as its immediate predecessor, its seemingly unending ability to leave the viewer wanting more is a stark contrast to how Dead films can make even the most hardcore viewer wonder if they are perhaps going too far.All this leaves one wondering exactly what Capcom think of how these second-tier studio gatherings have used their property. The first film in the series at least had a freaky sense of atmosphere and some replications of game conventions to tie it to its source material. If you changed the titles of the two sequels and removed all references to the Umbrella corporation, they would be unrecognisable as connected to Capcom's games. Simply put, the Resident Evil title is nothing more than a transparent ploy to fanboys and video game addicts to pay for films that are increasingly poorly-written. If truth in advertising laws were more stringent, they would be required to be titled something along the lines of We Have No Respect For You At All, Videogamers: Just Give Us Your Money. The saddest part of it is that this kind of corporate shill film designed to whip consumers into a money-shedding frenzy is exactly what previous, far superior works such as (the real) Dawn Of The Dead were trying to warn us about.Resident Evil: Extinction is a film so bad that it makes misfires like Day Of The Dead seem like Zwartboek by comparison. It is a two out of ten film in every sense: too bad to be worthwhile, not bad enough to be entertaining. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not very good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So the "Resident Evil"-movies have reached the trilogy-mark. Apparently the first movie trilogy based on a video game. I have to question if this is something admirable or not. The first two movies were mediocre at best, and this third installment is no exception.First of all the story (if it matters). The world has been completely destroyed by the virus, almost all humans are zombies and the whole ecosystem has failed because of the virus. Basically the world has been turned into one giant desert. In this wasteland a few human survivors roam, among them Alice (Jovovich). Meanwhile The Umbrella Corporation has continued their research.First of all i can say that this is probably the best-looking of the three movies. The sets are very nice and the world does feel desolate. But mostly the positive comments end there. Like in previous movies, the action scenes are the major problem i have with the movie. I don't understand what's so hard about making decent action scenes. Here we have crappy choreography, boring fights and firefights that look like people are just running around shooting randomly. There is a lot of blood and gore (obviously), but not even that manages to spice things up. I wouldn't go as far as calling the movie boring, but the more quiet moments in the movie are actually the ones that work best. And for an action movie, that's not a very positive remark.What surprises me most about this movie is that they let Russell Mulcahy direct. There are a few directors in the industry that i wonder why people hire, Mulcahy is definitely one of those. Incidentally, so is the even-worse Paul W.S. Anderson. If you look at Mulcahy's track record, there is very little (if anything) to be impressed of. He has churned out almost exclusively crappy movies. And you can also see that in the last few years he's mostly had to settle for directing TV. Why they would hire him for this movie is impossible to understand. But i guess that it's yet another sign that the bar is not raised very high when making a Resident Evil-movie...In the end i found this to be about as enjoyable as the first two movies. That is: not very. It's not utter crap, but it's still light years away from better action movies. The problem nowadays is that there are other zombie-movies being made that are so much better than these. "28 Days Later", "Dawn of the Dead" and "28 Weeks Later" for that matter, have raised the bar for the genre. Resident Evil doesn't even try to catch up. Which is kind of sad. I rate this 3/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a big fan of Milla Jovovich and Resident Evil, I can only thank Ms. Jovovich for making something out of an otherwise boring movie by adding some class to what amounts to a badly written, poorly plotted, and otherwise wasted 95 minutes of yawn-yawn. Oded Fehr, Ali Larter, Iain Glen, Ashanti and others add a semblance of professionalism which is unfortunately overcome by stale lines, silly mid-plots, and missing links. Try hard as they did, their efforts were buried by B-style directing and production but did bring my vote up from a 2 to a 3.Director Russell Mulcahy and Writer Paul W.S. Anderson would do well to remember just what it was that made 1 and 2 stand out amongst all the other Action / Horror / Sci-Fi / Thrillers of the day. If they colude for RE4, I hope they don't ever again depend on cast and crew to rescue their poor work. If there is an Oscar for actors who survive against all odds, it should go to this cast who each deserve a 10 - but the movie gets a 3/10.Resident Evil 4 - bring it on and do it right - in the tradition of 1 and 2.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Evil Blunder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another movie in the Resident Evil series which is plagued by bad acting, a terrible script and a lackluster cast who are devoid of showing any credible emotion throughout the film.The premise of this movie is somewhat based on a compromise between Mad Max, Star Wars and Land of the Dead.Unfortunately this is neither.Being a well-read and big fan of the Resident Evil video games I felt like what I was watching could be comparable to what it feels like to have needles stuck in your eye. The story is completely contradictory to the games and seems like Anderson just made it up as he went along without having one ounce of credibility to knowing what the hell Resident Evil is.For starters I don't recall ever having to play or read about Claire Redfield as a leader to a tacky convoy to Alaska. Was this after or before she crashed on Rockfort Island? Who knows other than the fact that for some reason after humans are going extinct the planet turns into a barren wasteland so I guess it's safe to say after despite the absence of Chris who at this point would be in a lush Haitian Island...Still with me? No? Good, we're on the same level then.The actors who portrait the characters also seem selected as if there was a contest to see who could act as much like a robot as possible and have continuity from anything in the past. I think I am correct to assume that Carlos was from South America and he rode off into the sunset with Jill and Berry at the end of Resident Evil 3. Oops! From now on I will just call the one in the movie Carl.To add to this, Wesker looks like he just came off the set of a really cheesy 80s style porn set. Although with the quality of writing found throughout the movie(s), one would have to wonder if scripts got mixed up minus some decent girl on girl....I was pretty much in tears when I watched in agony as Luke, er, I mean Alice lifted up all those rocks and her bike and shielded Carl from the fire. Apparently, she is also a Jedi. It's the only thing which is explainable without making it sound that bad. And here I thought a chain-linked fence suppressing hordes of undead was going to be the high point in laughter. Surprises surprises! If you want to enjoy Resident Evil, just watch someone play the video games and pretend it's a movie. Even though it does have the same level of dialog, it would be far more enjoyable than having to watch this confusing mess. Just like my review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, just finished this third RE and unfortunately(like the second one) it doesn't come close to the heights of the first. It totally lacks the suspense, eeriness and claustrophobia that made the first one stand out. Yes sure, we get a few jump scenes but that doesn't redeem this movie. What we get is a kind of blend between "Dawn of the dead(the remake)", Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds" and a little "Mad Max" thrown in for good measure.If we for one moment forget that the first RE exists this stands on it's own as an OK action movie. Not great, not bad but OK. The production value, effects and the little acting there is are good so thankfully it doesn't come across as a b-movie.For me Milla is the main reason it survives from being really bad. She goes about her business as before with new powers á la invisible girl from Fantastic Four. Apparently she had that in the second installment too but it was a while since i saw that one so i don't remember exactly what she did with her powers in that one. The rest of the characters actually don't make any impact more than support as a vehicle to support a second storyline filling out film time. We get a few extra explosions, neck bitings and shootouts thanks to them.To the film moguls : Please stop with more RE sequels, i think you have made enough damage as it is to this franchise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all id like to say i enjoyed the first Resident Evil film but then was extremely disappointed by the second. Seeing as how its producers forgot to add in any plot whatsoever and made the Nemesis a complete joke. This is mind i wasn't expecting anything from this movie and predictably it was much more of the same. The movie stole so many ideas from other films i was laughing out loud in the cinema. Trying to 'domesticate' zombies wasn't that in Day of the Dead? Thousands of crazy crows - The Birds by Hitchcock? I understand that most ideas have been done in some form or the other but this seriously was a joke.One of my 'favourite' parts of the movie was where Unbrella decides to drop a container full of 'super zombies' in an attempt to kill the members of the convoy, and when it opens about 300 run out. Despite the fact that it clearly was only big enough for maybe 3 dozen or so.Don't waste your money on this film, if your really desperate watch it online or rent it but don't waste your time at the pictures.</fullReview>

My opinion is, unlike the movies before, this movie was more game believable. The turning into a monster by doctor Issacs is definitely something i would expect from a gaming character. I have to admit, this was not my favourite movie in the series, ( especially with the deaths of such lovable characters like L.j, Carlos, Betty and Mikey) my favourite would definitely be the original, but i also say that it was a fantastic film, It was, in my opinion, loyal to the fans, i really hope there is a forth, and i would watch extinction in cinemas again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I went into this film in a little bit of a funk. Lunar cycles and all that.. I'll explain it to yas when you're all older... Anywho, the movie Alice! I gotta tell ya, I was honestly expecting all the classic hallmarks of a franchise in decline. So why did I even go? Guess I'm a masochist at heart. Don't get me wrong.. Thought the first one was okay, and I really liked the sequel, as Milla really got into her stride. But with '07 touted as the year of the sequel... the results have been, Luke warm. So it is a rare, and pleasant occurrence, when your lowered expectations are hit completely out of the ballpark. Thoroughly enjoyed the movie.. as it is un-pretentious fun. Simplicity in formula, and execution... hot model-type with a coupla bent machete-thingies.. and scores of Zombie fodder lining up at the meat isle... You do the math.So the film treads a predictable path along the Zombie theme. The T-Virus has made happy with most of the globe... and no, people aren't donning the bling, and pitying fools! They're just eating 'em. Few survivors band together, and form a motley vehicular convoy, through what can only be described as a Miller-esquire desert dystopia. The odds are against them, they're running out of fuel.. sound familiar? Enter the hero... except instead of Mel, it's Milla. It's hard to not sound patronising when saying this, but it's absolutely refreshing to see strong female figures on the silver screen. So easily could this have been a Vin Diesel, or some Thingy Blah-Blah vehicle. Anyway, rounding it up, Resident Evil: Extinction, is 95 minutes of fuss-free zombie fun. If you like your heroines with a little extra ability, and the body-count moderately high.. you can do much, much worse than to catch Russell Mulcahy's zombie homage to Mad Max.One Milla enters......about a thousand leaves.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This actually is an average zombie/horror movie but what makes it more interesting is that it has action-packed scenes which are great. I am not saying that this movie is not good but it is just the old trick, the same usual zombie movie. Zombie movies always feature hot women running and gore plus the usual type of story line. Resident Evil is based on the game which I never play. It is one of the few good game adapted although I did not play the game but the story line seems pretty interesting. Let's recount some of the previous movies that are adapted from the games. DOA is one of them and it is fairly okay. Bloodrayne is another and the two movies are trash. This is what I can recall. Let's head back to Resident Evil 3. Some of the pointers:Hot women: Check! It has number of hot women. Milla Jovovich did a pretty good job in carrying out Alice's role. Ali Larter (from the TV show, Heroes) also did a good job in portraying her character Claire. You get to see them fighting or shooting. Brave women.Gore: Check! That is the main target of almost all horror and zombie movies.It has quite a lot of gore and blood considering. It is more bloodier than Resident Evil 2. You get to see the usual gore like zombie biting people and others. It did a good job just not only for gore but the action stunts. That makes it not like most of the zombie movies. It has both the gore and the intense action.Storyline: It is better than Resident Evil 2. It has the simple story line to keep up. The story is Alice resurfaces to protect convoy of the uninfected towards refuge in Alaska. Simple and short. Along the way, you get to see Alice cutting zombies, doing high kicks and others.Overall, it does make a good harmless movie to watch during the weekends. It may not be the best game adapted but it certainly got the guts. You like both action and horror movies, this is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A review of "Resident Evil: Extinction"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Resident Evil: Extinction," the latest (and certainly not the last) in a series of video game-to-movie adaptations based on the popular Capcom video game series about an out-of-control virus that transforms its victims into zombies and other ghastly mutations, may very well be the most explosive, trigger-happy film this series has seen yet, though it is by no means the best.This latest comes to us from "Highlander" Russell Mulcahy, the music video director-turned "B"-movie filmmaker who's been on the underground "B"-movie circuit since that 1986 film and has never quite been able to repeat its cult success. "Resident Evil: Extinction" was written by none other than first "Resident Evil" director Paul W.S. Anderson, and he takes his cues from the material to build yet another apocalyptic bang-bang, shoot-'em-up zombie-horror flick.One could possibly deduce that this movie's success lies on one principal factor: the rise in the popularity of zombie movies within the last five years or so. If you remember back in 2004, this film's predecessor "Resident Evil: Apocalypse" was a reigning box office champ, and other zombie flicks of that year (the "Dawn of the Dead" remake, "Shaun of the Dead") were also packing them in. So this film's success seems assured, or so it would appear.This time out, in "Extinction," six months after "Apocalypse," the only way to stay alive is to be out on the open road, and a few remaining survivors of the Raccoon City outbreak are part of a heavily armored convoy in the American Southwest, searching for any sort of a safe haven as the out-of-control experimental "T" Virus has decimated the world's population, and turned much of the planet's surface into a barren wasteland. With plot devices a la "The Road Warrior" and "Day of the Dead," Alice (soon-to-be Mrs. Paul W.S. Anderson Milla Jovovich, returning for a third time out), joins this convoy with Raccoon City S.T.A.R.S. officer Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), L.J. (Mike Epps) and newcomers medic Betty (Ashanti), radio operator Mikey (Christopher Egan), and convoy leader Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). Somehow or another, Alice gets wind of a possible safe haven up north in Alaska, presumably isolated from "T" Virus infection.Meanwhile, at an outpost in the middle of the desert, the last remaining American branch Umbrella Corporation scientists are hard at work "domesticating" test-subject zombies, under the leadership of the mad scientist Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen). It's cute that even he has a "Day of the Dead"-like zombie, though his name isn't Bub and he's not saluting to any Captain Rhoads look-a-likes here. Isaacs has also been conducting experiments in trying to replicate Alice because her blood possibly holds a cure that will reverse the "T" Virus's effects. (In another plot device, a la "Alien: Resurrection," it's taken him 86 Alice clones so far to try to get things right.)To get this out of the way, "Resident Evil: Extinction" is not a very intelligent film, though the one thing it manages to truly get by on is atmosphere. There are plenty of moments when you feel there's no hope and you're with some of the characters in their desperation, and that's one element of the film that Mulcahy gets right. Another thing done correctly are the film's special effects, since gore and Tom Savini-wannabe zombie effects have been a no-show or poorly done in both previous "Resident Evil" movies. And the sweeping cinematography captures the barren desert landscape perfectly, giving it an eerie life of its own.What "Resident Evil: Extinction" suffers from are a lack of well-developed characters. (For the record, I've never seen so many of the main characters die off so quickly within say, a 20-minute time-span. Even the "Alien" movies weren't that cold-hearted.) But then, since so many of those characters are underdeveloped anyway, there's no real connection to them in the first place. In terms of story, you can tell the film series seems to be running on empty, since, after all, the "T" Virus has almost completely decimated the world's population, so it can only go so much further. Perhaps Anderson jumped the gun a little bit here but then again, he's never been much of a screenwriter to begin with."Resident Evil: Extinction" is, if nothing else, a worthy closer to a series that's had its run. At least if another movie is made, you can tell it's going to be pretty short. And if another movie is made, what's it going to be called? "Extinction" is out; "Doomsday," maybe?6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil 3 is the best of the trilogy. Taking place a few years after it's predecessor, it still tells the struggle of the T virus epidemic. With the continuation of the T virus outbreak. The survivors flee raccoon city and are headed to Alaska. However things start to get rough when they reach the Navada desert. The entire nation is nearly consumed by the deadly virus. Umbrella has a secret underground laboratory and zombies are everywhere. This movie has a good combination of action, as well as some good scares here and there. It makes a good action and horror movie, that fans of the first two movies will certainly enjoy watching. There was a great plot, great action, great acting, great scares, this movie had it all, and did a good job at delivering it all in one movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film starts a lot like the original movie and for about 5 minutes it had me thinking I was watching that, until the nice twist and 2nd twist. Clearly someone had been watching a lot of zombie and End Of The World films as just about every cliché in the book from the 2 genres was used.From trying to domesticate zombies (Romero already did it more than 20 years ago), living in a radio station and traveling in convoy (Mad Max all over again, eh?) your not going to see much in this film you haven't seen elsewhere in the horror or sci-fi genre. Clones are nothing new, a hidden research center underground was best done in "The Andromeda Strain".Mila looks good in the film as she has in the previous 2, they kept a few of the cast back from part 2 but some are very obviously absent. the twist at the end of Resident Evil: Apocalypse doesn't seem to have been used much. There are a few nods back to it now and then and Alice seems to have developed telekinetic abilities as well from no-where (no idea if that was ever used in any of the games having only played 1 of them).There is a lovely old school nod in homage back to the Hitchcock classic "The Birds" at one point during the movie.One scene doesn't quite ring true. Where their attacked by the zombies in the container in Las Vegas. Now this is a well co-ordinated group who have clearly survived and held their own for a good long time against the zombies. But here they are panicking, firing randomly, firing on automatic when ammunition is clearly in short supply. They would have been firing single shots, 1 shot = 1 kill with every round fired being a kill.The chap with the SA-80 (up on the Eiffel Tower) was happily firing away on automatic with no indication of having changed his magazine. And I can tell you for a fact they only hold 30 rounds having used one.The black guy who was infected days back when they cleared the motel took FAR too long to turn. Also the soldier had seen him get bitten in the hotel but didn't kill him then? Killing off the soldier (the only other character to have made it into this film) leaves Alice alone to fight against Umbrella and whatever is inside this hive.The ending of this is left very open for part 4 to be made, no doubt this will happen. Generally the film is a little too long to get going and would benefit from a cut of about 20 minutes (where the survivor caravan is established). The action in places is cut a bit too fast to be watchable but the film brings some new ideas to the Resident Evil franchise.</fullReview>

Does umbrella come after her again?...may contain spoiler...Is there a chance that carlos does not really die? when the truck blows up I was left wondering.earlier in the film Alice shows that she can manipulate and shield blasts. is it possible for him to survive and for Alice to save him in time?

		<fullReview>Resident Evil has never failed to surprise. It's a charm that Anderson has the ability, not to control skillfully, but inanely and luckily write into each of his screenplays. The funny thing about Extinction though, is that out of all the bad rap that it got before coming out, first reviews, and release of tons of footage from the hour and a half plus film, it really wasn't bad.Granted the acting in this one wasn't as dramatic and gripping as the first two, not that it was Oscar worthy, but it always gets the job done. Though I must note that Mike Epps does awful in his first few scenes. Especially when screaming out in remorse for his other not so lucky co-star Ashanti as she perks up against the bus door, dying vigilantly. Milla, while still believable as an action heroine, was a bit disappointing with her usual opening dialog (in this case a narrative which seemed very amateur). Fortunately enough, this can all be blamed upon the script and the directing. Surprisingly enough though, Ali Larter in the second and third act filled her role nicely and Oded Fehr actually, as annoying as he was in Apocalypse, stole the show in this one as the straight guy who has the hots for Alice (but) not really cause the world is ending.The story is simple as usual, Alice has super powers because of Umbrella, she finds her old buddies and makes new friends and gets to protect them with some high kicks and nice knives. This time though, she can jump higher, move faster, and throw people around with her mind. She's finds a journal that says Alaska = freedom, and hey, why not take the convoy with her. So off they go. Little does she know, Umbrella is tracking her now, and they are out for blood, quite literally. So some stuff goes down in Vegas and Alice ends up going up against the man who programmed her to make her eyes flash pretty logos and well, things don't get anymore interesting.The funny thing about this installment is it isn't a character piece, and it isn't a very complex story either, yet people gripe about these aspects not fulfilling any kind of sophistication. My question is, do you really need all of this? The world is coming to an end people, all you need to know is my name and whether or not I can help you. Said rules apply to Extinction, and well to the entire series. But mostly to Extinction. That being said, you can go get your character development when Oscar season comes around. For now, enjoy this film, for in twenty years, the series will be a cult classic. Why? Because it's successful. How is it successful? 100Mil around he world for each one, and this installment is on the same track. When a bad film like this sells, it's one of those movies that you look back on in about thirteen years and get all nostalgic about, "Gawd, I really liked that movie. You remember when (insert scene)." And so on.I really liked the fact that they played down the fact that they made Alice superhuman. "Like, hey guys, I have something to tell you *kills LJ with flying rock* I totally have superpowers, but shh, don't tell anyone cause i don't really care." The crow scene where Ashanti sacrifices herself and her giant afro that comes out of nowhere (you'll see) and Alice comes to save the day, sent chills down my spine. It was the first movie in years that's been able to do that. I sat in the theater every time she did something, well, cool, going, "YES! KILL EM'! SHANK THE HO!" No doubt, people will talk about the rip offs and whatever about her being Jean Grey and Day of the Dead being the classic, and blah blah blah, but it doesn't really matter. Because RE: Extinction is entertaining. It delivers eye candy and enough substance to at least keep people paying money for their dues.My favorite scene was the showdown between the convoy and the super zombies in Vegas. There was bloodshed and emotion raving throughout the battlefield. It was actually an all out war, and the execution of this scene is critical to the movie's success. The special effects were good enough, and the death scenes were the dramatic kind of things you like to do if you're an actor having fun with acting. The heroes in this scene are no doubt at their peak of interest and showing off their skills. I loved the fact that one second you can be making head shots, and the next you slip up once and can't seem to get back into the groove of things.The best part about this movie was the end at which point Alice meets the white Queen, a sister system of the Red Queen (if you're familiar with the first film) and as she exchanged dialog with her you seem to absorb this confidence that she has now. At this point, she is sent to the lower levels of the lab to defeat said spoken foe and it's here where I felt like the 'video game adaptation' finally kicked in because it felt as if she were going in to face off with the final boss. And it was nothing short of a cinematic boss battle. At the end, the final showdown, although it lacks a bit of punch that you would think a third and supposedly final installment would want and have, it doesn't fall flat entirely, instead, it picks itself up and is actually a believable battle between good and evil. it's a nice way to see Jovovich go before she enters motherhood, and though it isn't the Oscar material everyone needs, it's the next best thing.

		<shortDescription>boe_dye's review... NOT SYNOPSIS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>See, i have taken to making sure people know that my reviews are what i thought of the film... to many people read these things not understanding that there is a little synopsis link somewhere on the main page and by me telling you what you already know isn't much of a review...Well, the movie wasn't all that bad. if you go into it thinking that it's going to be anything more then what the previous two have already been then you are quite deluded. there really isn't much more to this film then it's predecessors.Zombies, guns, blood and Milla Jovavich looking good a kicking arse.Something that has been somewhat pandemic in these types films as of late are the action sequences. they are a bit overwhelmingly to much 'in your face'. yeah it looks quicker, and can be more intense, but after a while it just gets kinda annoying.The story line however is dwindling. sure sure, you don't really go into a film like this expecting gross amounts of character development. and story and plot tend to be backseat to lottsa action. but you still need something of a story. without that you are basically watching a porno, and who really wants to do that anyway? Now, while the storyline is dwindling what was there really didn't have any closure. yea, the people flew away, but so what? at least in the first and the second you had a general idea of what happened with the cast.And of course, they left it open for yet another sequel. if they do get around to making it, i will certainly be hesitant to see it if they base it on the absurdity of the ending of this one...However now that i think of it, if they do make a fourth one this could simply be a segue-way between 2 and 4 which would, at the very least be an explanation to the thin storyline....You know, make something on the cheap just to keep people interested in the franchise...Other then that there isn't much left to tell. essentially in the end it was more of the same. if you enjoyed the first two, you will probably enjoy this one as well. if you feel that you suffered through either of the first two then you will probably suffer even more, and unless you are sadomasochistic i wouldn't advise it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They just get better...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This third entry in the Resident Evil series is great. Although it's been said that it doesn't really touch on the previous films, it does indeed. The start of the movie throws you for a moment as it appears to be Alice's entire introduction from the first film. There is a difference, which I won't spoil here.Some characters return from the second film, like Carlos (Oded Fehr) and L.J.(Mike Epps). Others, like Jill Valentine and the little girl they fought to save from the school are gone, and no explanation is given, unless I missed a bit of expository dialogue, which I don't think I did.Alice is first seen on her own, with her voice-over explaining that it's better that way, because large groups of people attract the undead. Plus, she explains later that people (good or bad) tend to end up dead around her, which is certainly true. Eventually though, she connects with a nomadic group of survivors, led by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), who are making their way cross-country in a well-armed caravan. It's Alice who brings them their sense of direction, as well as much-needed extra-human protection (as hinted in Alice's eyes in final scene of the last film).Of course, the Umbrella Corperation is up to its usual dirty tricks. The evil doctor seen at the end of the last film is back also.Now down to the goodies: there are zombies by the thousands (most of them surrounding an outpost for Umbrella Corporation), gunplay aplenty, heroics, scares (with a fair amount of tension taking place at a deserted motel near the beginning), and some unexpected talents from Alice. And to be honest, the reason I love these movies is to see Alice kick zombie butt, which she does in spades. The movie is cram-packed with exciting stuff and really flies by, leaving you wanting more. Although these films are not platforms for acting theatrics, Mila Jovovich does her best job as Alice, who is a killing machine, but shows fear and some...some, vulnerability. I may see this one again before it leaves the theaters. Cannot wait for the DVD release to complete the trilogy.</fullReview>

What I think Claire wants to do (move the container full of elite zombies) nobody would have done. Why not just go around it. There was a bridge behind it anyways! Would have been nice if they all died, or they reach their destination. They had to kill off so many people to fit into a helicopter? There was no solid ending.

		<fullReview>I've now watched Resident Evil and Resident Evil: Apocalypse which were both good movies in their own way. Resident Evil: Extinction, however, is the odd one out in the series as this isn't even remotely good. Resident Evil heroine Alice, along with a group of survivors from Raccoon City, attempt to travel across the desert wilderness to Alaska to escape a zombie apocalypse.The story lacks a lot of everything, I could even go so far to say that there is no story at all as it is yet again pretty much the same as its last two movies. It has nothing to do with the games whatsoever so Resident Evil gamers will definitely find this movie disappointing. There were one or two great action sequences which kept you awake such as the fight in Las Vegas and the crows but otherwise it is yet again to impress the younger audience. The last two had something to do with the games but this one didn't, it just threw references at you just to remind you that the movie is Resident Evil such as Claire Redfield, Albert Wesker and the Tyrant from the first Resident Evil game.The acting was above average except for Milla Jovovich who managed to brighten up this dull and boring movie a little. Ali Larter who played Claire Redfield was average as was the rest of the cast. There are so many problems with this movie but one of the main problems is that you couldn't care for the characters at all, not even for Alice. Resident Evil: Extinction has made a silly twist to the story of the movie series and has an even sillier ending. The start of the movie was surprisingly promising but in the end, disappointed. Everything about the movie could have been improved, even the make-up and design for the zombies but the worst case for this is the Tyrant near the end of the movie, it wasn't anywhere near scary or believable.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com</fullReview>

My favorite scene was probably when they were fighting the super zombies. The main character, Alice was an awesome heroine. She totally kicked butt.

		<shortDescription>First film I saw on Blu Ray. Hi-def doesn't make it any better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else, this movie will be a landmark in my film viewing life: it was the first movie I ever saw on Blu Ray (a buddy bought a Playstation 3). If not for that, I'm sure it'd be one for the dustbin of my memory. Granted, it's hard to judge fairly when I never saw the first two installments of this based-on-a-video game trilogy, but Resident Evil: Extinction can only barely count as a movie. It's a post-apocalyptic zombie movie where a genetically engineered woman with excellent fighting abilities (model/musician Milla Jovovich ? I refuse to acknowledge her as an actress) helps a ragtag band of survivors escape to Alaska, while she herself infiltrates the underground layer of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus that zombified the rest of the world. The plot is mostly nonexistent. I kind of like the set and costume designs (sci-fi being every set and costumer designer's favorite gene), and the movie's watchable when it focuses on the scenery. But it's an action movie, and, for God's sake, the action sequences are dull. CGI looks even more fake in high definition. The director and/or editor cut madly during these sequences, inducing headaches and making it impossible for you to tell what's going on. It's a pretty worthless film, and let's leave it at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A complete and utter joke!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK let me first start by saying that I only watched the first half of this movie and what I saw turned me off enough that I really didn't care one bit how it was all going to pan out.What? How you can you slate it if you haven't even seen it all the way through I hear you ask? Well quite easily actually since what I saw was the most ineptly handled mess I've had the displeasure of subjecting myself to for quite some time and I doubt very much that anything could have redeemed it, a sentiment echoed by a lot of the people who've commented on this movie (feel free to jump in and correct me anytime) from what I've seen.So what's wrong with it then? Well for a start the acting is beyond poxy, there are very few decent actors here and even they are wasted due to really bad cheesefest and cliché style dialogue. Most of the characters are too stupid to live, I mean if you open a door and get bombarded by millions of flies who were chowing down on a hanging rotting corpse you close the freaking door you don't stand there for 5 minutes trying to swat a billion flies. You also don't sleep in the open when there's zombies swarming everywhere either.The scene with all the birds was embarrassingly laughable. I mean here's a thousand infected crows swarming everywhere yet despite people being outside and obviously in the firing line the birds remain in their crappy CGI swarm high up in the sky until the script calls for someone to cop it in which case a few suddenly appear on cue and attack someone while completely ignoring everyone else including people trying to help the victim, it's pathetic.The direction is really bad and the action is handled so awkwardly that boring and disjointed doesn't even begin to sum it up.I enjoyed the first Resident Evil for the guilty pleasure it was despite the fact that it really short changed us on the monster front. The second one as well although not as good as the first due to it's descent into C movie cliché was OK for what it was but this one is just totally pointless and could have been one of a million other generic zombie movies if it weren't for the R.E. branding. And unless I missed some huge money shot at the end, the FX were pretty naff as well although some of the Zombie make-up was good.I have to say as well that 90% of what I saw had me thinking that I was watching a fan-made remake of Day of the Dead since half the plot elements seem to have been lifted from that (far superior) movie including an underground complex in the middle of the desert where the science team are at odds with the suits (DotD it was the military) while trying to domesticate zombies since they've apparently given up on a cure. The excruciatingly painful scene where they present a supposedly domesticated zombie with relics from his life (cellphone, childs toy etc) featured some guy as a zombie that didn't seem to know what one actually was. Even if he'd watched Sean of the Dead he would have got some idea how to portray one. The scene really left me pining for "Bubb", the trained zombie of DotD.Unless this film pulled some ballbustingly amazing sh*t out of the bag in it's final act then I thank the Lord that I had the good grace to see what was coming and not waste another minute on this poorly conceived piece of tripe.....Once again it's "Thank You Drive Through!"</fullReview>

From the beginning it was predictable what will happen and even scenes that should frightened you were horrible. I didn't like graphics as well, in some scenes you could clearly see that it was made by computer. Zombies didn't frighten me at all, they were a little bit funny. The only thing that was good was Milla Jovovich, she is really great actor. There was nothing special about this movie. It is always the same. Music and special effects were simple.

I guess I'll get my vehicle reinforced and horde gasoline when the Mad Max/Zombie Apocalyspe occurs.From watching it, I guess Anderson just put all of his ideas together and stuck it in a shotgun then blasting them all over a wall.So many bad things about this movie. Sad part: it was better than RE: Apocalypse (insert laugh). Of course, I think it's funny how the star monster is from the 1st game and for some reason he moved much faster than Nemesis did in Apocalyspe. Us gamers remember that Nemesis was the one with agility, not this guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good sequel than improves greatly over "Resident Evil:Apocalyspe".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several years has passed... When the virus spread in Raccoon City, which the city was overrun with Zombies and all sorts of Monsters. It was an huge disaster in the city. But the virus went all over the world and the world changed into one big desert. Which several city in the world like Las Vegas, Nevada is nearly cover in sand. Like Food, Gas and Water is very limited. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is still hiding from the evil Umbrella Corporation and she travels alone to find an safe place. She tries to stay away from her contacts to not endanger her friends or herself. But the last time that Alice was with Umbrella Corporation, they did some experimenting on her. Now Alice has certain power in her that she doesn't quite understand how to use it or embrace it. Alice's friends like Carlos (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps), along with a group of survivors are trying to find an place. Where they could live in peace and without fear. The leader of the group is Claire (Ali Larter), who tries her best to find an haven for the group. While the corrupted scientist Dr. Issacs (Iain Glen), who works for the Umbrella Corporation tries to make the perfect Alice clone and trying to make certain Zombies have a mind of their mind. But Dr. Issacs has other plans for Alice, The Umbrella Corporation and himself.Directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander, Resurrection, The Shadow) made an enjoyable Action/Horror/Sci-Fi/Adventure that improves over "Resident Evil:Apocalyspe". Which the 2004 sequel was an watchable movie but in the end results... it was an mess, despite an good cast. Now the third film is closer to Paul W.S. Anderson's original picture but Mulcahy does have his own visual style as well. Anderson's screenplay certainly gives visual homages to George Miller's Mad Max Trilogy, Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds, George A. Romero's Day of the Dead, the original Resident Evil movie and more. Although his screenplay is quite flawed but it is clever and exciting at times. DVD has an clean anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an enjoyable commentary track by the director and the producers, four featurettes and deleted scenes. The last and third feature was an major international success. Critics did certainly hated this film but it is fun to watch. But the best thing in the picture is Jovovich, which she's in great shape in the film and there's a few genuine surprises in store for the fans of the "Resident Evil" movies. Despite some plot holes in the story, overall "Resident Evil:Extinction" is entertaining and it should keep the fans happy. Super 35. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best one in the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Resident Evil films were good but were Luke warm adaptations for a great computer game franchise by Capcom. However I was glad to say that Resident Evil : Extinction on the other hand offered was a nice way to cap off the saga. Set after the events of the second movie, we find out band of survivors trying to get out of the barren wasteland earth as the T-virus inflection goes global. The film wastes no time just diving into the action and moving along at a quick pace with very little gags and wise cracks as the tempo was upped. There were excellent use of SFX, landscapes (kind of mad max style), and action with gore. One thing that I loved about this movie was that it did not waste time on trying to offer scientific explanations for everything trying to make it sound intelligent as the last 2 movies did not really do a great job of it, this one just stuck to the action. Both Milla Jovoich and Oded Fehr were excellent in this as well as the alter-ego crazy woman from Heroes - although she was Claire Redfield...but to me she will forever be know as the homicidal woman alter-ego woman from heroes and Manfred Powl from Tomb Raider was very cool as umbrella research leader all keeping in touch with the spirit of the computer game. My only complaints were that I wished it had ended a little better and not on what felt like a cliffhanger. I would of also like to have seen a bit on the expansion of Alice whilst she was in the Umberealla facility rather than just an abrupt start I think that just felt a little stupid! To conclude Resident Evil : Extinction stood out on its own as a film as well as ending a saga of a very Luke warm trilogy , worth a check if you have seen both films and are fan of the games but also if your a fan of zombie movies like Dawn or Land of the Dead! Either way this lived past its expectations of being crap and you can check this out feeling entertained and satisfied unlike with Rob Zombie's Halloween.RESIDENT EVIL:EXTINCTION - 8.8 OUT OF 10EXPERIMENTATION...EVOULUTION...EXTINCITION!</fullReview>

I've watched it twice and still can't understand anything. In this new RE, the new director somehow managed to get every single crap from the previous parts and put them together here. I'm really shocked. All my little but still breathing hopes die in vain after the first few minutes. And...till the end. I've never seen so much stupidness in one place, honestly.

		<shortDescription>One of the most underrated action classics returns and continues to kick some ass!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a huge fan of the games for years I might have expected to nit pick about the details of the original Resident Evil film. They really did kind of move away from the story while still keeping key elements and characters in tact and in doing so they created this absolutely brilliant action series that I think is completely and utterly underrated and under appreciated. Resident Evil: Extinction is yet another third in a summer of overwhelming trilogies and this one stands out on it's own. I keep thinking about seeing previous installments that as badly as I want a sequel it won't fly, it won't do as well and they keep surprising the heck out of me. Each time they just seem to do something really clever that keeps this story on the cutting edge and avoids the pit falls of worn out, tired film series'. Extinction focuses firmly on the story, the outbreak of the virus and the completely obliteration of the world as we know it. This is the ultimate post apocalyptic film and the best of it's type I've seen in years...maybe since the Mad Max trilogy. Best of all Resident Evil, the entire series, should be heralded as one of the truly unique action films by creating an absolutely brilliant female hero that girls can really say...see she kicks ass. Milla Jovovich's Alice should be in the history books as one of the greatest female heroines in history. Not only that but they usually add in a secondary female hero and in this case they added the familiar game character of Claire Redfield. I think they pulled back a little on the obscene amount of action that the predecessors had in order to roll out some really good story and characters but then they had their share of incredible action moments to keep things rolling at break neck speed. Best of all they didn't go light on the key elements of Resident Evil...ZOMBIES. Zombie birds, zombie dogs and a new breed of Nemesis to contend with.Milla Jovovich returns as the only reoccurring character since the first film, Alice. Now genetically enhanced by Umbrella she is learning to utilize her mind powers to save and help others. Her powers are never cheap or campy and they really do work in the environment given. Jovovich completely embodies Alice and she is just riveting to watch in her action scenes. Her intense look and small frame make her just awesome and she still looks beautiful, without being sleazy. Oded Fehr also returns from Apocalypse as Carlos, a character I have always really liked. He still does a good job and really does look the Resident Evil part while still being a very viable character. His part is not huge but it's very important and he does well at it. Ali Larter is good as the secondary female hero (and possible future main hero) Claire Redfield who is the leader of the convoy. Larter is pretty good and does command certain respect on screen but she is heavily overshadowed by Jovovich's performance and character. Iain Glen is the evil Dr. Isaacs who is determined to use Alice to domesticate the zombies. He also eventually becomes the second nemesis which is really something to see and is just plain awesome.I think perhaps more than most movie franchises Resident Evil has incredible longevity and potential and having seen what they've been able to do with the first three installments they can do an incredible job. Just when I think it couldn't be as good they surprise me with something really fun to watch, full of action, horror, gore and a terrific story and really great characters. They have also had the fortunate experience of having some great directors and Extinction director Russell Mulcahy is no exception. He is a talented and well experienced director having worked on such films as Rambo III, Highlander and Tales of the Crypt (I mention those because you sense a little of each in Extinction.) Also writer (and director of the first installment) Paul Anderson knows the characters and seems to have a passion for the story. Truly this is one of the fall greats and a must see for action/horror fans. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm glad there are a lot of people who liked the film. I thought it was a great addition to the trilogy. The action was constant and they continued the story from the last movie well. There were a few plot twists and great action. Isn't that all you expect from these movies. I keep watching people bash this movie and wonder what the expectation was. Did you want a romantic comedy or a huge box office smash. I figured when I walked in to see an action movie with a lot of violence and gore. Guess what I got. The story line was o.k. and the character development was zero but it still was enjoyable.If you want action and violence and an enjoyable movie go see this. If you want a masterpiece go to a film festival and whine about everything there in your non-paid critic environment. Take my word on this, none of these will be the greatest movie you have ever seen, but they can sure entertain you for an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil: Extinction: They are finally doing the games part of the movie and it makes more since now.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would just have to say that I am a harsh movie rater cause I know what I like and I think that people might like the samething's that I do when it comes to movies. There is just TOO many reason why I gave this a 10 out of 10. I am not going to be like a lot of people that are doing reviews on this movie and spoil it for you. I can't stand people that do that. But the Bio-Hazards (zombies) look even more real than the first to movies. They look like something that Stephen King or Rob Zombie would have came up with. The way that the 2nd movie ends will make since to you when it gets 15 to 20 minutes in the movie. The only bad part in the movie is the beginning (flashbacks of the first to movies). Milla Jovovich, Oded Fehr, and Mike Epps does a killer (no pun attended) killer job on their roles. They finally put Claire Redfield (Ali Larter)in the movie and she kicked a** also. For the people that played the game Albert Wesker (STARS) is in the movie and they have the right guy to play the role and that is cause the guy is kinda like a a**hole. The main guy (monster) at the end kinda makes Nemises look like a little school girl at church. The only thing that I really don't agree with is the way that it ends. It makes you want more and that is the only downfall to the movie. But pose to the questions on here there will be a 4th movie and it picks up with Clarie, Chris, and Jill (chick from the 2nd movie). In closing I would just like to state..... WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR, FOR IT TO COME OUT ON DVD!!!!!!!!!! GET YOUR BUTT OFF YOUR COMPUTER AND SEE THIS DANG MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! ITS TO DIE FOR</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice and the fight scenes are fantastic. The rest? Not so much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I should make clear the fact that I have yet to see the first and second Resident Evils. The movie trilogy is based off the popular and critically-acclaimed video game series, of which I am a foreigner to also. So, this review is written by someone who has zero knowledge of any previous story lines in the series. Everything I now know about Resident Evil -it's characters, story lines, and everything else- is based off of what I learned watching Extinction.With that being said, I thought Extinction was a very entertaining movie. The story follows Alice (Jovovich), a genetically-enhanced woman as she and a band of other remaining humans try to survive through attacks from millions of zombies. Where did all the zombies come from? In the first Resident Evil, the Umbrella Corporation let loose a deadly virus that infects all people and, once the people are infected, turns them into flesh-craving zombies. The infected aren't just humans though- animals (including crows and dogs) are susceptible to the virus and can thus be infected and changed into dangerous creatures. All this begs the question: who on the decaying Earth can stop the paranoia? Enter Alice, the woman who was genetically altered by the mad scientists of the Umbrella Corp. Alice is essentially a super-human; she can generate force fields and has ridiculous strength. After avoiding all human contact, Alice eventually runs into the group of people who are doing their best to survive but could obviously use some help. With most of their attempts failing and time running out, the group (somehow) learns that Alaska is the only safe zone left on the planet. They can only get there once they pass through Las Vegas (I don't get it either). However, they get sidetracked and end up in some pretty intense fights with the living dead.These fights are sporadic but pick up towards the end of the movie. They are really intense, and the zombies on the receiving ends of the attacks are absolutely destroyed. Blood spurts and flies as bullets pierce heads, arms, limbs, etc. While her crew doesn't add much to the fights, you best believe Alice does her part: she is a complete bad ass slashing through zombies with that piercing stare from her ice-cold blue eyes. Classic lead females Ellen Ripley and The Bride came to mind as I watched Alice. In a recent IMDb.com poll with 21,683 votes, users were asked to vote on which female (Ripley, Alice, or Sarah Conner) they would most want to protect them. Ripley won with 39% of the vote, but second place went to Alice, with 22%. As you can see, I'm not her only fan.You'll notice I'm not talking about the supporting cast. Well, to be honest, there isn't much to say about them: they add little to the story and have very generic roles. They come off more as enhancer talent for Alice.I plan on renting the first two in the series now so I can more thoroughly understand the series. I liked the ideas and the action, and especially the lead heroine. Extinction was rough around the edges, but at it's core was a solid movie which was loads of fun to watch.Good) Jovovich owns the movie as Alice, very intense action sequences Bad) story is all over the map, supporting cast offers little to nothing</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have to say that i was expecting this movie to come out since February 2007 when i fount out it was in production. Let me just say that the first two were rather entertaining. i went only with my closest friend to watch it because i wanted to concentrate really on the movie so i could comment later on. I LOVED the make up, locations, storyline and pretty much everything about it and how the director managed to shoot both Alice's in the same scene. Some of the people who died i didn't want that to happen but it was with he theme of the movie. Alice's power are remarkable and that kiss blew me away. Now i don't want to give anything away for those who haven't seen it yet. But just so you know: GO AND WATCH IT. I know that this movie might get some critics reviews but for the was the best $7.50 i spent all summer. Hopefully I'm expecting the next part (if there's one) and i cant wait for the DVD to come out with the special effects and the making of. in the meanwhile I'm taking my brother to see it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apprehensive Then Delighted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had the redoubtable pleasure of seeing the premiere with several good friends who were also Resident Evil fans (the films, not necessarily the games). When I first saw Resident Evil and Apocalypse on Sci-Fi, I found myself thinking "I shouldn't be enjoying this as much as I am." Nevertheless, something about these movies got to me and I became rather fond of them, even to the point of getting the deluxe DVDs with behind-the-scenes documentaries, etc. For the first 20 minutes, I was nervous about RE3: it was looking a lot like the first two Mad Max movies (not in and of itself a bad thing) and I sincerely believe old Russell has been watching too many Michael Bay films (and Michael should not be allowed to direct again; his MTV- frantic cutting screams "insecurity" to me). As the story developed, I remembered what I had such respect for in the first two films: CASTING GOOD (IF NOT WELL-KNOWN) ACTORS. We all learned from the original Alien that a top-notch cast can elevate a genre film into a classic. The script was a deliciously logical extension of the previous plots and the shift to outdoors in bright sunlight worked remarkably well. The writing was never purple and there was just enough character work to rise above a more "typical" film of this sort. Truly, the BALANCE achieved in this film was unusual: not too much of anything, not too little, and wonderful surprises for even, I suspect, the most jaded RE fans. It's a clean, gritty-looking (I mean cinematography) piece, spare of superfluous moments; 95 minutes long and precisely to the point in each scene. The battles are truly magnificent, in my opinion: well-choreographed, edited and thought-out. NOTHING ARBITRARY HERE, FOLKS. As William Hurt said all those years ago in The Big Chill, "Sometimes you just have to let art. . . flow over you." That, I think, is the key to enjoyment of this movie. Don't bring in baggage or expectations: just let it happen. You will not be disappointed. The only "flaw" here is, as with the previous RE adventures, a remarkably mediocre musical score; it's certainly serviceable, but ANYONE could have composed it. I long for a David Arnold wannabe to score films like this. The richness a GREAT score would add is almost incalculable.Excellent cast, excellent writing, excellent fight choreography, just the right amount of the grotesque, just the right amount of beautiful women with large weapons. And one cast member has the single greatest death scene I can remember in a long while; I envy the actor and director for playing it so well, with such subtlety and such theatricality. But go in cold. Just let this piece "hit" you. Bring nothing to the party but your active mind. If you can manage that, I venture you'll love it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RE: Extinction - Mainly for the fans.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fan of the Resident Evil series and avid movie watcher I have been privy to many different films based on video games. As scragglier had put it before, movies of this sort will eventually take on a form of their own, and the results can vary depending on the watcher.Fans of the series will find themselves catching up rather quickly as RE vets Alice (Jovovitch), Carlos (Fehr) and L.J. (Epps) return along with newcomers Claire Redfield (Larter) and company in their attempt to survive in a world gone undead. The Umbrella Corporation is still alive, taking up refuge in subterranean establishments continuing their research and development of bio-organic weapons (BOWs). Dr. Isaacs, while developing new serums is also trying to track down Alice to further his research.Like all kinds of video game movies, there is not much to really grip: Obvious and formulaic good and bad guys provide for a quick setup into the film, pitch-forking you into the story providing only enough information so as to get you acquainted with the environment. Not much in terms of back story or character development is provided ("What happened to Jill (Sienna Guillory)? How did Carlos and L.J. meet up with Claire and her convoy?) The bottom line is that you will have to already have watched the previous two films in order to understand the characters motives and how they got to where they are. Characters are given no time to be developed or cared for by new movie watchers, and it seems that they are gone almost as fast as they come in (30 people on a convoy and about 6 of them are given names, and even less are given more than 5 minutes of screen time). Plot is simple - survive against the bad people. Visual effects are pretty nice, as they are effectively displayed at key moments to heighten suspense and give rise to the moment. Action and fight scenes are very well choreographed, bloodletting like there is no tomorrow and especially more gruesome than the previous two films. Although these make for a pretty good action flick, the movie itself is just too short to give the audience what it really needs - SUBSTANCE, along with the already present STYLE.Like I mentioned before, this movie is made mainly with the fans in mind. Newcomers to the series will be better off watching the previous two films before they know whether or not they want to watch this one, but either way it makes for a decent Friday night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Less Action, More Survival Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That was what i didn't like most about the first two terrible but fun adaptations but the third film Extinction shows a lot of survival horror and combines it with pulse pounding action and the supreme hotness of Milla Jovovich. The best thing about Extinction is that it is as close to the games as Paul WS Anderson is going to get but most of the kudos goes to director Russel Mulachy who clearly has a better understanding of the games and uses a lot of similar game elements to create scary and suspenseful scenes. Of course this is a Paul WS Anderson movie and you can tell by the writing because of the few but noticeable cheesy lines and the complicated and confusing plot but Mulachy makes it seem OK with his vision of Andersons movie. Visually the sets are awesome very desert like very apocalyptic i was totally impressed. The special effects light up the screen and Milla Jovovich steals the show and although she was never in the games she's as bad@$$ as Claire, Jill, or Leon are. As a stand alone movie it's every bit as great a popcorn movie as Spider-Man or Pirates Of The Carribbean cool story lots of action, some funny humor, it's fantastic high budget nonsense at it's most entertaining state. If you didn't like the first two still chance it with this one because it's a much different interpretation more horror, more jump scares, and more gory action packed thrills. Extinction is by far the best out of all three and has the most amazing looking zombies that are pretty hard to one up the only movie i can think of may be 28 Weeks Later but even still the make up gives the zombies a very Hills Have Eyes look which i find very cool. The crows are neat and i'm glad they added them because the whole scene worked well creating intensity and just that kick@$$ environment you want in this kind of movie. In closing i think Resident Evil: Extinction is the best of the series, the best choice for this weekend, and the most entertaining and fulfilling ride of the year of the threequels.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since I'm not really one to play video games, you'd think this movie wouldn't appeal to me. It did. If you don't think too deeply about the writing, it's possible to enjoy the movie.In this third Resident Evil installment, we get more but it's not just more of the same. Visually it's brighter movie because a lot of it takes place outdoors in the sun. It does flow like a video game, but the story evolves and should keep anyone interested. It's a good balance between action, story, and special effects.In this installment, Alice (Milla Jovovich) joins up with some old friends and survivors of the infection. While together, they agree that Alaska may provide hope for them, but not before they make one more stop for supplies. As in the other movies they must confront the infected zombies as well as the corporation which is to blame for their existence. The movie is packed with action and conflict. It's worth seeing in theaters. It's even worth buying if you like action &amp; adventure. It's a movie to sit back and enjoy without asking yourself a lot of questions as to why or how. Just take it at face value and it plays out well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. Resident Evil is a great franchise and definitely has some kick ass games. The first movie was phenomenal, the second movie wasn't too bad either. This one just flat out sucked and I'll tell you why. From beginning to end I couldn't help but feel confused and had soo many different questions. Where's Jill Valentine?? Why was everybody split up at the beginning when it clearly shows in the end of the second movie that everyone left together?? and why is Ashanti in this movie?? It was nice to have the character of Claire make a long awaited debut in the film and it was definitely nice to see Carlos make a return. But there was just such a lack of character development and they tried doing way too much with the film. Story wise they just kept digging themselves into a deep hole and it just wasn't very convincing to me. I was extremely disappointed to see Carlos die in the end cuz he was the one character who defined the second film. The army of Alices was probably the worst idea they could have come up with for the movie (the matrix revolutions tried the same thing with Smith and it didn't really work). It would have been nice to see a more clear resolution and make this the final film. The story still does have potential and they could come back with a kick ass 4th film. If they do make it, they should just bring back Anderson to direct it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Woeful third instalment in the movie-based-on-the-game series. Plotwise (what little there is) steals shamefully from Romero, especially Day of the Dead. My jaw actually dropped during the training and pacification of the zombie scene - straight from Day! Aside from flimsy plot, average direction (oh how Russell has sunk since his Highlander days) and uninspired acting, the film is actually a 90 minute advert for Sony. To actually try and count the amount of Sony products clearly plugged in the film will not be possible until the DVD release but let's just say, Screen Gems had more than a movie in mind when parent company Sony approved this mess. As if this was not blatant enough, watch for how even in the darkest scenes you can clearly see the names Sony and Viao due to extra lighting on the brand items in shot. Shocking that cinema has come to this. AJ</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extinction of the series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>POSSIBLE SPOILERSI usually write about films that really stand out to me, good or bad. I wouldn't usually write about big releases as hundreds do that but I had to throw my pennies worth in on this.I like the RE games, not an avid fan but do enjoy them. I've seen the other 2 RE films and whilst disappointed that they turned into just action flicks, take them for what they are. After all, it's Paul WS Anderson who got his mitts on them. Mortal Kombat was fun, RE1 &amp; 2 were fun and kept nice elements from the game. AVP....urgh.All those people saying 'Wow, this was great' or 'Such a roller coaster of action' or 'Best RE film' are missing the point. If this was a stand alone film then maybe, yeah, bit of mindless action to keep you going....but it's not. It's part of a series and it's not stayed within the same vein as the first 2 films. This is why I for one was rather bored as I watched this.Gone are the elements from the first 2 that relate to the games. Gone is any form of character development (I know there wasn't lots in the first 2 but there was some). Gone (and I felt the most important) is the dark element from the first 2. Yes, I do mean as in lighting but more so that sense of hopeless foreboding. After all, these films are zombie films and any good zombie film has that underlying hopelessness as let's face it, a zombie outbreak begins....you're pretty screwed once it's out no matter what you do.Bravo to Mr Anderson for actually wanting to have more daytime settings this time around but it just didn't work.....and what's with the virus making everything baron wasteland? It's dull to look at. there is one city shot near the end and this is what I wanted more of. Where was the harm in continuing the story from where number 2 left off? What we end up with is the makers of the film saying 'you know the premise, we're just going to try and dazzle you with action set pieces and hope you're all in your teens in order not to notice that all we've done is make a poor film but robbed you of the entrance fee'I'm not in my teens and therefore not fooled. They still managed to fail in the action areas for so many reasons.Paul WS Andreson said after the first film he would like to make a trilogy. He should have stuck to that and used this as the opportunity to find a fine balance between the first 2 films to have the series go out on a bang....but he didn't and now we are faced with the prospect of a 4th film.PS To the guy who did the mock up conversation of Paul and the studio...excellent. You covered so many films that are ripped in this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Milla's airbrushed face was a real distraction. There were so many closeups on her face and they were all obviously air brushed like the pimply girl's yearbook photo.Glad to see Mike Eppes's character get killed off - impressed he still had the gold-plated guns from RE2.RE3 was definitely an improvement over RE2 and about on par with the original. Considering this movie comes from a video game franchise, you could almost call it "really good."The zombies in this one all looked the same and that wasn't cool. In the biggest fight scene, they even had matching jumpsuits! In zombie movies, they should all look different - The horror in these monsters is that they reflect all of us. Instead, we get this generic monster in RE3 that isn't as scary or relatable as it could have been.Kudos for having Umbrella attempting to "train" zombies. That was a nice morbid twist to the storyline. I also liked how they training didn't work out so well, especially for 2 out of 3 evil scientists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My friend and I have been playing this game forever, and the game has brought us close and friends actually, so we are always stocked for a Resident Evil movie, even after "Apocalypse" twisted and messed up the game storyline, but this one ruined the game story at the end, which I'm not ruining.First off, Alice (Milla Jovovich) seems like dang Superwoman now, and that's crap. Her fight sequences are always awesome, but when she's shutdown, no undead attack her, which is odd and that's not all the minor errors in her character which made me mad.Big disappointment for a Resident Evil in ways I must say. Las Vegas isn't an option until halfway in the movie, when the trailer made it seem that's where the whole movie is. Many plot holes in some ways like what happened to characters like Jill, and when did they get gas (don't ask).The movie's not horrible, but certainly not the best. The action sequences are awesome, story quite weak, and minus Milla Jovovich's character, they were good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been expecting this movie for so long and I couldn't believe how excited I was that it was finally the 21st. I was on my quest to purchase the tickets online (to avoid lines at the cinema) when I saw that the rating of this movie on some websites wasn't even 3. I wondered what the hell was happening. I decided to still get the tickets and watch it. The story is pretty much advanced now since the state of the characters and the scenario has changed dramatically. The plot has a strong base and continues to bring pretty good action scenes. There are some scenes that were a little boring and sent my mind somewhere else (which is something I'm absolutely against of) but to the writer's defense are justified because they were moving the story forward, which is every scene's mission. A lot of people has been disappointed, and I guess it relays on the fact that, because this one is the third one, we expect something better than the first two, but basically there's no much of the story than the writer delivered and I'm thankful for it. I enjoyed the movie very much, and although it's not an Oscar-winning, I'll give it an 8. Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talk about pathetic movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any true fan of resident evil will have to admit that the directors of these pathetic movies didn't take much consideration of the games. All they had to do was simply go by the games and they could have endless greatness. However like Hollywood does it screws up a good thing. This film was pathetic in my opinion. This story has no substance at all to me. The dialogue is horrific and the actors are horrible. There are so many jacked up parts in this movie. There ends up being some hybrid zombies that are a lot like the ones on 28 days later. They're super quick and very aggressive. If this movie would've been made in the 80's with a pitiful budget then they might be able to get away with it but the fact is the budgets there so why pick up crappy actors. I mean come on they got the dude that played johnny cage in mortal combat. Then you have ashanti with her masterpiece of a dialogue......she was pathetic. All in all this movie is cheesy and down right retarded. The ending.....oh boy the ending. It was so stupid and will make you say...give me a break. This film is not even a renter in my opinion. Don't waste your time on this one trust me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She's Back and she packs a punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As far as this genre goes, Resident Evil: Extinction (2007) earns a straight 10 in my book. Milla Jovavich is back, and her on-screen heroism personified as Alice was turning corners, thwarting sadistic adversaries, and packed a punch like you couldn't believe. She plays the part brilliantly, and I am glad I watched it. If you enjoyed the previous two movies, just let me say, this one won't let you down. I found myself actually trying to keep myself from jumping a few times, as the suspense continued. Yes, in my opinion, this franchise stayed true to excellence, the story continues to progress, and quite interestingly it left me hoping yet for the next part of the story. Great job, cast and crew.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Do Zombies Make the Lights Flicker?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this with little expectations. It is, after all, Resident Evil. From the trailer, they make it look like there will be some crazy Zombie action in Vegas. No. Don't believe it. Little use is made of Vegas at all. No, that might have made an interesting setting. And since the Resident Evil makers want to stick to their "We Shall Make Sucky Films" policy, the majority of the film is set in a sprawling desert, sometimes flowing with sand and sometimes composed entirely of CG.The special effects are decent, but the incredible lack of story. It was like they were holding back every time the script started to get exciting. An hour into the movie I was crushing popcorn on the littered floor to amuse myself.The ending was extremely anti-climactic. You spend the entire movie watching your heroine kick zombies to high heaven and then the final battle was ridiculously lame. Not to mention that somehow, a single zombie managed to paint all the walls with dripping blood. Gallons and gallons of blood were all over every wall. It looked like the scene of a Dick Cheney hunting excursion.I will probably never see this movie again. It definitely wasn't any good, and it wasn't horrible enough to amuse me. So this is a lose-lose situation. It definitely won't garner any academy awards, unless they come up with the new category of "Best Nudity While Floating in a Womb-Like Bubble".Don't waste your money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The quality of this movie is inversely proportional to your level of education. If you like to go to the popcorn stadium to be inundated by mediocre quality eye-candy with low expectations concerning plot, continuity, scene quality, etc., then the movie rates 8 to 10. If you have a discriminating view of what a movie ought to be, i.e. you can tell the difference between good and bad acting, story-telling, direction, costuming, etc., then this movie might rate a 3. If you see this movie, prepare to suspend all disbelief, to accept the severely flawed premise, and to ignore the impractical - even unappealing - costumes. It helps to be unconditionally in love with Milla. Just remember, Hollywood keeps producing garbage because people keep paying big money to see garbage.</fullReview>

I came on here expecting to see it have at least an 8, but for some reason everybody is giving it terrible ratings..This is my first comment/review I have given on this website, and it's only because I am standing up for Resident Evil Extinction and that it's actually good. I think a lot of people will be missing out on a great movie if they choose to listen to the bad reviews given by the geeks on this site who hate all three of the movies.. Anyways, go watch it, it's really good, you'll like it, it's fun and full of action, plus gets pretty freaky at some parts!</fullReview>

Really RE needed a complete redesign scratch Milla, Ashanti, keep the girl from heroes and the bus driver. Really it would have been better to see just those two survive the movie. But I can't say that I thought this movie was going to be good. I think I'm just really tired of hearing Milla Jovich talk like Liam Neeson all the time. Its really annoying.Anyway if you're looking to kill some time on a Friday night and you gotta decide between RE: EXTINCTION and HALLOWEEN make the right choice. I know you can do it. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST of the trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would have to stay that Resident Evil: Extinction is officially the best out of the entire trilogy. Many factors contributed to this one of them being the storyline.Although the storyline could use some improvement I thought it was a major progress compared to Apocalypse and the first RE film. The movie added more elements such as romance, the loss of a loved one, as well as friendship.The movie takes itself much more seriously than the previous installment and definitely meets your expectations.The visual effects are great and one of the high lights of the movie was the Crow Scene. I would really recommend people seeing this movie in theaters.The actors were well chosen and all acted their parts perfectly. All even down to the minor actors and actresses who did a very good job of acting their part. Milla Jovovich really put a tremendous performance as Alice this time around outdoing her two performances in the last two movies.I really recommend everyone to catch this movie in theatres. You WONT be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Must we have a fourth?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was obvious to everyone that we were going to see this movie based on the end of the second one, Im not going to spill any spoilers on the plot or there lack of it but we are left wide open for a fourth instalment of this series. In all honesty if you have and respect for the series I would leave it at the second chapter, this movie really doesn't have any proper plot line and I was left feeling rather baffled at what Id just spent the last hour and twenty five minutes doing, my time would have just as well been spent at the toilet through this movie.Other than the key fact of Alice, Umbrella and Zombies this is as much as your going to get in way of a tie to the other movies, you find nothing more out in this than you knew from the second. Granted the action and special effects are sweet, there's a few good scenes that I enjoyed watching but that doesn't make for a good movie.Advice: See what else is running and only see it if your a die hard fan, but even then I think some may leave feeling no value for money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>predictable and dull with one redeeming factor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Third entry in the series is a dreary, painfully derivative horror-thriller set in the midst of a cataclysmic T-virus epidemic that has plagued most of the known world. With no place to turn and no good options, a motley group of survivors must elude flesh-eating zombies as they make their way across the desolate west hoping to make a new start. Leaden script with a nonexistent plot is redeemed only partially by Jovovich who's in good form as a scrappy, take-no-prisoners survivor, but beyond that it's just a senseless exercise in violence, special effects, and noise. A perfect addition to the undiscriminating/no-brainer genre. *?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Road Warrior plus Dawn of the Dead = Bad but Entertaining Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I was watching this film, I was initially excited by the Resident Evil 1 sort-of flashback, but as the film progressed, I realized that there was very little to be excited about. When the writers sat down to pen this tale, they must have just finished watching Road Warrior (need for gas as people wander through a wasteland with a heroic helper who leaves them at the end) and Dawn of the Dead (Helicopter ride to safety, character mix, dead congregating, etc.), which are two excellent films. Of course, in those films, you get to know the characters and recognize social satire. This film is but a gore fest with MTV piecemeal action set to a sound track and predictable setups and outcomes. The film earns (and I do mean earns) two stars simply because of the quality of the audio and special effects elements. It gets another star because I'm a guy and the women are beautiful. But that is all it gets. As little as 10 minutes of added screen time could have made this a good film all around by giving us a little character depth. Instead, we have CGI birds that miraculously only attack you if you fall off a small runner between two vehicles and a never-ending supply of living dead out of a semi trailer that must in some way be related to a clown car as the undead seem to come out of it in numbers far exceeding the available space. If you love special effects, violence, and have little to no attention to detail, you will love this film. Otherwise, wait for it on video and then only see it if you have seen the first two films. You need the first film to understand the context and the second film to understand the few characters that are in the film. If you haven't seen the first two films, good luck understanding anything. But then, there isn't much to understand. Put your brain on the seat next to you and enjoy this film on testosterone alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie doesn't deserve a summary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I wanted to watch 95 minutes of loud noises, I would've went on youtube and watched one of those shock videos over and over again every 10 minutes. At least in the previous movie there was things going on. In this one, they were either sitting on their asses or slowly walking down a hallway, pausing, and getting attacked by a zombie. Seriously, there could've been less of this. Would it've killed them to actually show the zombie sneaking up before them? Or growling a bit before they screeched at the top of their lungs? I sat by a damn speaker, for crying out loud.I mean yeah, it's nice to have a loud, shocking noise every once in a while but this movie relied on it. I couldn't count the amount of these. Someone could die of a heart attack watching this. I'm fifteen and my heart is still beating fast. What happens when a 60 year old has a heart attack? Then they have a lawsuit on their hands. This movie was horrible, and it just goes to show that loud noises don't make a zombie movie good- the actions of the characters and zombies do. By the way, here's a heads up: Don't get excited about seeing huge crowds of zombies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of the video game series; I've played &amp; completed almost every Resident Evil game there is. The first one is one of my most favourite films and the second was also good but not better than the first. After watching the ending of the second I knew that there will be a third instalment but I had no idea how they will continue.To be honest I didn't really like Resident Evil: Extinction when the first time I seen it. My friend wanted to watch it and I watched it again to give him company and then I liked it. Every scene made better sense and was much more entertaining. The movie was set in the Nevada desert and filled with intense special effects and more zombie terror!The story was continued very well from the second one and was very different, intelligent and original. Albert Weskar &amp; Claire Redfield were introduced and they didn't have much to do in the film maybe they will in the fourth part, which will be called Resident Evil: Afterlife and Leon will probably be in it.The zombies look like sand zombies and they are odd but it was a good idea because the whole world is covered with sand. There were a few jumpy moments and you have no idea whenever they can appear. The best scene is when Alice was fighting Isaacs near the end and my friend said that "He is similar to Tyrant in the first Resident Evil game" but I don't think so because Tyrant has a claw hand. He was very similar to a monster in Resident Evil: Code Veronica X that has a small head and is able to stretch its arm out and grab you.Overall it is the kind of film that gets better the more times you watch it and is well made for a post-apocalyptic thriller. It was made with a budget of $45 million &amp; grossed the most money out of all three about $147 million worldwide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil: Beyond Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And once again I will start by saying I&#x2019;m the big fan of the Resident Evil franchise both game and the movie, that is until what I saw in this movie. This is far beyond the most pointless sequel ever and has almost had nothing to do with anything.Synopsis: Even after the nuclear bomb the city in the previous movie, the Umbrella Corp still couldn&#x2019;t maintain quarantine, this leads to the spread of virus throughout the world. Alice and her friends must now try to survive and help the other in need.The story, the plot, the holes is indescribably bad. There is no plot just people running around in the desert tried to fight zombie, and birds. There is no character development or hardly any situation development from the previous movie except they changed the location. The story also probably riffs off from many different movies that left you absolutely no way of finding it out. The story was just plan bad and there is absolutely nothing to it. Even after they have turned it into the action movie, the action part itself is rather boring, and out of the blue the zombie is much more aggressive this time.The new cast member in this movie doesn&#x2019;t add anything in this movie even one bit. Only Ali Larter character seem to be walking around organizing this and that (food, petrol, weapon) which most of it nothing to do with anything but added more screen time to the movie.Lastly: I&#x2019;m tired to writing. This movie is nowhere close to the first two and probably the most distance from the video game. Everything about it sucks.Recommendation: Let Just Pretend It Stop With The Second One.Reason To Watch: The name Resident Evil.Reason Not To: Everything about it.Rating: 3/10 (Grade: F).Please Rate Y/N After Read.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gotta say, I was pleasantly surprised, even though I read the book months prior to the movie release. It was significantly better than its prequel. The characters who died were actually likable, so you actually felt sorry when they died. The scenes where people got eaten were also a lot more gritty. Enough to make me cringe, and I was watching Nightmare on Elm Street when I was 2 years old. The action scenes were visually impressive as well. I will never look at a crow the same way again.I loved this movie, but I gotta say, the best part was Iain Glenn. I'm not a fan of him, but he did an absolutely terrific job in this movie.

		<shortDescription>Another good kick-ass zombie movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(My Synopsis) The plague has traveled around the world infecting most of the world's population, turning everyone into the walking undead. The deadly virus also has destroyed the world as we knew it, rendering the planet a desert. Alice (Milla Jovovich) joins forces once again with Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and L. J. (Mike Epps) and other survivors who have not been infected. They travel from place to place in an armored convoy killing any undead who get in their way. Their goal is to find a place that has not been infected by the virus. Alice has been trying to stay off the radar of the Umbrella Corporation whose biogenetic experiments started the whole chain of events. Unfortunately for the convoy, Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) finds Alice and tries to capture her in Las Vegas so he can continue his experiments.(My Comment) It is always amazing to me that all the undead or zombies have one mind and are controlled by the thought of infecting other humans and not attacking each other. I guess that the virus puts the message onto their DNA and all they can do is act. This is the third movie in the Resident Evil sequel. Milla Jovovich was captivating and skillful in playing her part. We experience most of the fighting through her super-human strengths. The fight scene in Las Vegas was outstanding. Alice is the only one who can get justice and revenge for the world against the Umbrella Corporation. To me, all the survivors need to do is to find a place to hide from the undead zombies and wait for the flesh rotting virus to burn itself out. Everyone knows that with the virus consuming its own host, the virus is doomed to die. If you like zombie movies, you will like this one, because I jumped out of my seat a few times, sorry for the person next to me. There will be another Resident Evil, because Alice is going after the head of the Umbrella Corporation. (Screen Gems, Run time 1:35, Rated R)(8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Complain about my score, I don't care. This movie was AWESOME!! It didn't exactly scare me, but it gave me the same feeling I got when I played RE1 for the first time. It was fast and the action barely stopped. It actually felt like survival horror.I thoroughly enjoyed Wesker's role in the movie. I was a little worried about how he would fit in. I know, I know, he did nothing but sit in a chair and talk. He did that in RE4, too. From the games I've played, I thought the producers had his character's attitude perfect. It seems to me they are making him the one who is responsible for everything that has been happening. Umbrella Chronicles for the Wii should cover that, though. As soon as I left the theater, I had the urge to go home play RE4. Which, in my opinion, is what a movie should do. Well, maybe not inspire you to play a game, but at least make you want to play the game that the movie is based on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Resident Evil franchise has been limping to the bank for the past decade shelling out increasingly turgid fare to an audience sure to lap it up because...what other video game movies are there The first one (2002) was okay. It was slightly enjoyable but you could tell it was adapted from a video game in that everything that moved was to be shot at. The second Apocalypse (2004) was absolutely dreadful trying hopelessly to add a complex mythology that makes little sense when you think about it.But lets suppose a killer zombie virus concocted by a seemingly omnipresent corporation is released into the populous. Mind you this corporation has a huge personal army, unlimited funds to build massive underground laboratories with complex security grids, track people with satellites and has access to nuclear weapons. And let's suppose our hero, Alice is an ultra-hot cyborg/clone/whatever-the- hell (Milla Jovovich) who wants to take this corporation down. Finally let's suppose the virus was not only released but thrived and quickly took over the globe. Thus we get Resident Evil: Extinction.The film starts with a prologue about how because the T-Virus has infected everyone and everything, most of the terrain in North America has been replaced with arid desert. Now why do we need to know that? All of the action in this installment takes place on the outskirts of Las Vegas, an area already surrounded by desert. With that in mind, that nugget of information seems unnecessary. Speaking of unnecessary; there are a disappointing amount of meatsacks in this film. I say meatsacks because, let's face it, other than Alice, all other characters are zombie food.Now there are a lot of problems with this movie but the one that threw me for a loop the most was the inclusion of Mike Epps who provided "comic relief" in Apocalypse and now provides stupidity in Extinction. As with all zombie movies, once you're bitten you're pretty much dead and early on Mike Epps is a dead man. So instead of telling the small band of survivors "hey I'm chopped liver, pull over, I'll walk from here," he keeps his wound secret until he turns at the most dramatically convenient time. Oh and another thing, our heroine has telekinetic abilities? What...when...explain movie! Repeating the word "T-Virus" doesn't tell me anything.The movie ends with our heroine finding multiple clones of herself and telling the main villain Wesker (Shawn Roberts) she's gunning for him next, which delightfully sets up the next movie with fans of the series able to access the mythology with finger-banging glee. As for those on the outside; you best just quit while you're ahead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction (2007): Dir: Russell Mulcahy / Cast: Milla Jovovich, Ali Larter, Mike Epps, Oded Fehr, Iain Glen: As with most zombie films these days the norm here seems to be an ongoing parade of violence and disgust. It regards the end of mankind and a band of survivors seeking escape from these flesh eating terrors. Forget the zombies and track down a decent screenwriter. Director Russell Mulcahy can film action but can his writers actually write a decent script? I've seen more creativity written on washroom stalls. Milla Jovovich plays the cloned Alice who slaughters the zombie population like a lawn mower. She has starred in every one of these films and despite her dominant and graceful presence she is still giving a by- the-numbers performance. Ali Larter, Oded Fehr and Mike Epps kill a lot of valuable time. These are people whom Jovovich must stick her neck out for because they are all about as useless as sh*t. They either get attacked and eaten by zombies or they survive because Jovovich is the only one who can kick zombie ass, and she does so with such flare and great bolts of energy that the screenplay never applies. These films exist more or less for violence, action and gross special effects and makeup. It is a pointless and disgustingly gross film that should be torn to shreds by zombies until it meets extinction. Score: 3 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basic stuff from the same writer as always</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never thought Resident Evil would get better after the first two disappointments, never have I felt that Paul W.S Anderson would write anything actually good and also never have I ever felt that this franchise is worth the money ploughed into it. My point is I still believe in all those things now after seeing the third instalment in the zombie themed horror series that is based on the video game series of the same name (take note this movie feels like a video game through and through). Our story this time takes us to the deserts of Nevada and the roaming zombies have really got quite far across the US of A and they are in their droves, hungry for some of that good old human flesh. Alice of course is back and is still kicking the hell out of everything and Milla Jovovich who plays her is not all that bad, just lost in a wilderness of crap.The plot whisks you down under the ground and then back into barren wasteland, it's the kind of movie that can really annoy you sometimes because it just goes way too fast. One of the interesting things of this movie is the underground facility also in the desert run by Iain Glen's character Dr Sam Isaacs who actually can feel like a good guy at times until nope, he is definitely the villain. The cast is then buffered up with the likes of Ali Larter who seems to have done roles like this before but cannot escape the generic character she is handling and also the drab lines. Oded Fehr is back to reprise his role as Carlos and he again is in the same sticky situation Larter is in, a character completely and utterly generic. Now the style of Resident Evil is easy to see when watching, fast, lot's of zombies (I mean like loads) and also a load of disposable characters to throw away. We now get to see that style not changed by Russell Mulcahy the guy who made "Highlander" and he is known for his fast edits, oh what a perfect choice! The thing is though it isn't Mulcahy who I have a problem with, I mean he is not good but it is Anderson who ruins this. Paul Anderson has kept on making these and they have been consistently poor, he directed the first one and with the second I thought "Oh good that guys gone now" but I was wrong, because the man writes the movies. The script is so run of the mill it is just silly, I mean you just know what will happen next and it feels like he just didn't want to have any new perspective on an already well trodden zombie movie path.Listen there will be people who can fully enjoy this for what it is, I mean I admit for some I can see them having great fun, look past some more technical points and you could have a blast. For me personally though I am rather more sad than angry because this is a movie series that has had it's chances and could quite easily make a barely OK movie (which in my eyes is totally fine), but they keep on producing the same old and I fear for the future of this series because if it doesn't step up, then it's destined for the bottom of a movie bin in your local store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BIG plot-holes and it's pretty rubbish too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(23%) The first movie was a half-decent throwaway zombie action horror that somehow managed to be less cinematic than the video game it was based on (particularly the vastly improved remake on Gamecube), the second felt like an R rated Power rangers movie and the third (this is the third isn't it?) looks on the outset like the makers are trying something new in a location far removed from the games, and it fails just as much as the very loosely based predecessors did. The story has almost the biggest plot-hole in film history. If the virus has turned most people and animals into zombies and killed almost all the plant life, then how can the bad guys at Umbrella survive? In-fact they not only survive without any problems at all despite Armageddon throughout the planet, but they actually have the resources to clone Milla Jovovich over and over again. Who's funding all this now that Umbrella like almost every business on the planet is now officially defunct because everyone is dead? Do zombies invest in stock markets? Where does all the power/water/food come from for these guys to be so cocksure about everything? It is a B movie so it doesn't matter that much, and it can be enjoyed as a B movie but everything feels like I've seen it all before only done better and the idea of giving Alice superpowers was a real stupid one from the very start. Stick with the games (Resident evil remake, Zero, Code Veronica and 4 are all fantastic, especially 4)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil jumps the shark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Resident Evil will always be remembered as helping to reignite the 'zombie genre.' Its sequel wasn't as well received (but I liked it, as it was the first zombie film that dealt with the 'middle stage' of an undead outbreak, i.e. not the start of it and not the desolation it eventually causes, but the panic as it slowly takes over).There's no arguing that writer/director Paul W S Anderson had direct a stylish movie, filled with classy action scenes and blazing guns. However, just because something is stylish, doesn't mean it's that good. By the third outing, I was hoping for something a little more than Milla Jovovich just shooting and kicking hordes of zombies (and dogs... always dogs). Unfortunately, that's all this is - one shooting/kicking/knifing zombie scene after the next.What makes it worst is the baddies - they're almost too comically bad to be believable. They all seem to come from the 'Monty Burns School of Villains.' They're so evil, they wear sunglasses indoors and wilfully sacrifice scores of their henchmen without batting an eyelid. They should be in an Austin Powers movie, or something a little more tongue-in-cheek. However, the Resident Evil films are dead serious and the baddies just make me laugh (almost as much as the truckload of zombies which can fit a thousand of them in a simply trailer - watch the Las Vegas scene to see what I'm talking about).Sadly, even with all its flaws, the third Resident Evil film is actually better than its successors - films 4 and 5 are even worse (or as completely identical, making them all just blur into one).Unless you're a die hard fan of the franchise, I'd just stick to films 1 and 2 - either that or you can never have enough of seeing Milla perform one flying roundhouse kick after the next in slow motion.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Resident Evil Story In The Desert.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You might want to hunt me down, but I do enjoy this one because it does try new things. This is the first time a "Resident Evil" story is set in the desert, which is something I have been waiting to see. For the most part they do very well, but there's not really that much screen time in Vegas which disappointed me when it was the focus of marketing.Milla Jovovich gives the final performance of Alice I enjoyed as everything beyond this became awful. I really did not care for these new telekinetic abilities she's gained, and the character is now running on nothing more than fumes. Oded Fehr and Mike Epps pleasantly return. Ali Larter is introduced offering good supporting cast material and, I was really happy with Jason O'Mara's brief appearance as Albert Wesker. But a little peeved that this was his only shot at the role (Shawn Roberts is hysterically awful with what he has to work with later).For as horrible as this film really is. I do enjoy how it tries to take advantage of its setting, and how it's finally willing to take chances by showing things not seen in a zombie movie yet. But still that's not saying much, and if they had shown just a little more of it this would be the best in the series (This is still before those horrendous 3-D outings).Final Verdict: Fairly decent when reminiscing, but still could've and should've been way better. 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Easily the best entry in the series. This should be called: "Resident Evil: Extinction OR How to fix a franchise after the awful second film!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow. I mean... WOW.How did they do it? How could they make such a comeback after the franchise-killing disaster of a film that was the second movie- "Resident Evil: Apocalypse."I'll admit, I'm only a casual fan of the "Resident Evil" film franchise. Mainly because it still bothers me how completely it disregards the excellent source material, and instead completely re-writes the story and characters. But I liked the first film fine enough to give the rest of the franchise a shot.I didn't think there was any way to salvage the series after the last film, though. Back in 2007, I was dreading this movie, because "Apocalypse" was... well, an apocalyptic mess. So you can imagine my surprise when I walked out of this film saying to myself "Wow... this was actually better than the last one. In fact, this is probably the best of the three!"And yes, I still firmly believe now in January, 2014 (with five entries released with a sixth on the way) that this is the best of the "Resident Evil" film franchise. It's the film that has the most fun action beats, the best use of horror elements, the most interesting directorial choices and probably the most coherent and developed script of the bunch.Sometime after the last film, the T-virus has spread the world over. Affecting not only humans, but plant and animal life, the world has slowly been degenerating, leaving much of it a worn-out, dystopian desert. Alice (Milla Jovovich) has become a wanderer, seeking to survive in the harsh remnants of society. However, after connecting with a convoy lead by Clair Redfield (Ali Larter) that also homes her former allies Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and L.J. (Mike Epps), Alice and the group are pulled into a new struggle against not only the zombies who roam the earth, but the remnants of the Umbrella corporation, including the dark plans of Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glenn), one of the scientists who had experimented on Alice in the past.The cast is much stronger in this film than it had been before. Jovovich is once again a pure blast of fun, and a great hero to follow. (Although I will admit, her dark, brooding nature started to wear thin on me at times, after realizing she hasn't changed much during the series) Returning cast members Oded Fehr and Mike Epps are also more grounded and real this time around, and they come off as far more fleshed out than they were in the cartoonish previous film. And new cast members like Ali Larter, Iain Glenn and even Linden Ashby are generally fun and give decent performances.This time, directorial duties are handed over the talented visual artist Russel Mulcahy, best-known as the stylish director behind the original "Highlander" (which I consider to be a great film) and the well-directed Alec Baldwin vehicle "The Shadow." (A film I admire very much in terms of visuals, though I will admit the script is very standard and underwhelming.) And Mulcahy is able to make himself very much at home, giving us well thought-out action set-pieces that are actually exciting to watch, as well as giving a bit more time to the character development for quiet moments that the first two films lacked. Out of the five films, this was the one I found the most professionally put together.The script by Paul W.S. Anderson (whom directed the first, fourth and fifth films and has written every entry in the series) is surprisingly deliberate and thought-out for Anderson. Not to speak poorly of Anderson (I quite liked his films "Event Horizon" and "Mortal Kombat"), but he is generally a director and writer who seems more interested in visual spectacle and entertainment than storytelling. And there's nothing wrong with that necessarily. But I did find it surprising that he seemed to put much more thought into this entry than any other. And I think it helped a lot. It's a tight, concise script, and it makes for a decent film.The rest of the production is going above and beyond as well. The set design is top-notch. The costumes feel more grounded and realistic, while still maintaining a stylized look. And the effects are great. Particularly the zombie makeup effects, which are an absolute blast. The music is also a step-up from the last film.I was really surprised by how well-made this film is, especially compared with the other entries. It's not a perfect film by far. This is still a dopey series that is about pretty pictures and visuals first and foremost... but by those standards, this is easily the best of the series. It has the best action, the best horror, the best direction, the best effects... it's just... the best of what it is.I give this film a good 7 out of 10. I loved it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, But Necessary Viewing For Fans Of The Franchise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie on DVD. I am a fan of the Resident Evil franchise and had been delighted with it's quirky take on the horror niche zombie genre. I won't bore the reader with a recap of the plot line. If your reading the comments here, you have an idea of what the franchise is about and where this film is probably going. So, I'll just cut to the chase. Resident Evil: Extinction is a disappointing third film in the Resident Evil franchise. I won't say trilogy, because there is an opening for another installment. So I would say watch this film so that you are up to speed in the inevitable fourth film. Just don't expect the fun of the first Resident Evil.I have to say watching the increasing regression in quality of this franchise has been a disappointment.I remember seeing Mila Jovovich and Paul W.S. Anderson at a Fangoria convention plugging the first Resident Evil to a very bored and jaded audience who had long ago gotten tired of every filmmaker insisting their project was a totally new type of horror film. When I finally got to see the movie in the theater I was pleasantly surprised to see that Resident Evil was indeed a breath of fresh air in the horror genre.What I think went wrong with the franchise is that once the studio executives discovered they had lightening in a bottle with the first Resident Evil, everyone now put their grubby fingers in the creative process and mucked the whole works up. Resident Evil: Extinction probably is the victim of too many film executives trying to put their stamp on this film and here is the result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love the Resident Evil games (especially 4 and 5) but I did not love the 1st Resident Evil movie. (gave it a 5) Passable but that's it. The 2nd movie was edited in such a way that it was ultimately headache inducing. (gave it a 4) Could have been so much more.I went into watching Resident Evil: Extinction with a feeling of slight dread. How did this end up being beyond decent and the best so far in the series? (not counting Degeneration).The first thing that comes to mind is the Editing. Way better than the first 2. Better Director and effects and a better movie comes our way.I would have rated this even higher but alas the ending "showdown" was to normal and average for me. (The VERY last sequence was right back on track though).Overall I was shocked how much better this was than the previous ones were.</fullReview>

I believe you all saw the matrix, trinity was the epitome of women kicking ass (hollywood tried this before with Gena Davis which ended up as an abomination) OK so i watched no good deed which show cased his Excellencies Stellan skasgard and Samuel L. Jackson; Mila was invisible in this movie with her coarse voice and dead pan delivery, so i assumed Mila would crawl back to GAP or L'oreal to beg to be taken back, next thing you know.....she just signed up for more resident evil.....god.....the travesty. OK fine, Extinction was a bit better than the other two but for the love of god who in god's name is "Alice" and what is with the psychic powers (using her mind to torch the birds......typical) i have played every single resident evil VG released to date, there is no character by that name, please, please help save resident evil before it goes into extinction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little bit above the line of mediocrity.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident evil 3 starts out mediocre, and from that standpoint I was expecting a good an hour and a half. Sure there was more action and more credible plot than the first two.....but not enough of the actionA fairly interesting storyline.....At least interesting enough to keep my attention. But frankly I was expecting way more violence. Don't misconstrue me here. I did not hate this movie. it's just that I was expecting more and what I got was average.Although this film is not an impressive action film, it had some interesting aspects. To start with it was filled with a brilliant cast. The acting was vital and it has serious actors suitable for their roles. Also the special effects were amazing. Whoever did the makeup for the zombies should be proud.The other thing I liked was the linkage of all the scenes to one another, nowadays movies are made(such as "The Grudge" franchise) in such a way where you need to rewind and fast forward in order to grasp the purpose of the scenes. in the contrary in "Resident Evil:Extinction" the sequences were highly comprehensible from the very beginning to the end. The scenes weren't filled with junk dialogues.I have said these positive things about this movie. Yet as overrated as it was I was expecting a mind blowing action and a remarkable film that leaves me with nothing to say but "WOW". For a third movie in the franchise, extinction is not bad at all. However it doesn't surpass the hype.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first want to say that the entertainment value of this film was very high. Lots of great action, and scary parts that made me jump. But I gotta ask, does the writer, Paul W.S. Anderson really think that he was being original? As I watched the film, I was constantly pulled out of the movie by all of the blatant rip offs! I think the writer sat down with a notebook and watched Mad Max, and Day of the Dead. The underground Umbrella lab was exactly like the underground compound in Day of the Dead, as was the mad scientist trying to tame the zombies. The scene where the zombie used a cell phone and a camera was IDENTICAL to the zombie called "Bub" in George Romero's film.Then of course you have the band of Highway Nomads who are on a constant quest for gasoline in the desert. Seems heavily inspired by the Mad Max series to me. I guess there are really no new ideas in Hollywood, but I would appreciate an effort to tell an original story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chief GoreMongral's Movie Review: Resident Evil Extinction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following up on the heels of the craptacular Resident Evil: Apocalypse, RE:E takes us several years after the events of the second movie. Apparently Umbrella's little screw up isn't such a little screw up anymore as the entire world has become decimated by the T-Virus. Now only a small group of people remain to set things right...or at least have some kind of resemblance of a normal life.Right off the bat I will say that this is the best movie of the series so far. Im not a fan of the first two movies as I really feel the RE license was wasted on these films and with Paul Anderson in tow that definitely sealed the deal. However since the movies have taken the direction they have viewing these movies as action horror and not as more traditional horror films (as this series should have been) this one is actually decent.The character of Anne has been on the run since the last movie and has decided to be a loner as she realizes that the people that stay close to her always have a way of dying. She does however end up running into Carlos from the last movie and a band of people who are trying to do their best to survive. Unfortunately Umbrella has been trying to track her since her last escape as they realize only her blood can end the T-Virus once and for all.One of the big problems with the other films was some of the action was way over the top, with this film though there is a few scenes of this there was not nearly as many which is a good thing. Also the humor is kept to a minimum compared to the other films in the series which also helps. Not to say that there isn't but it is not overbearing. Also again CGI is used which has been a bane as well for this series. Although it seems this time they didn't use it as much its the final fight with the Tyrant that it is very apparent. At times parts of this is OK and then others not so OK.Really this movie seems a lot more fine tuned and most of the elements do work, something that cannot be said about the previous installment. The gore level is OK but not great, though it does have its moments. The zombies looked decent and the story though minimal kept the movie moving along at a brisk pace. In the end of you want a cross-breed Day of the Dead meets The Road Warriors style movie then you should have a good enough time with this one...just don't expect it to be as good as either said film.Score 6/10: Above Average...for the Resident Evil series this is a step in a "better" direction. Though not perfect it does entertain for the most part. However if you are a jaded RE video game fan who hates the way the series has been handled on the big screen look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well...Better than the first two installments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This starts off almost exactly like RE 1 and makes the audience that has seen the first installment think they are having a deja vu which adds a nice touch to the movie since it starts out with a bang. Although repetitious and dull at times, the director did a decent job with this installment well at least slightly better than the first installment and most definitely way better than the second one. Now it clearly shows that they don't give a crap if it relates with the RE video games or not and just want to cash in though, well at least it was somewhat entertaining.The plot this time is mainly about survival as well, a group a survivors including Alice is trying to survive the zombie mayhem while the head researcher in Umbrella Corporation is trying to find the real Alice for his projects. What I didn't like is how it added psychic powers in the game, which it showed in the second movie in the series. It just did not fit in with this type of movie, even if it's mostly sci fi, I didn't like it, this isn't freaking X-Men. I also didn't like the character L.J., he was annoying in the first movie and is more annoying this time around. Basically a pointless character and a pointless character in the second one as well. When it comes to animal zombies, first it was dogs and now they also have crows in this one which is one of the coolest scenes in the movie when a mass amount of zombie crows start attacking the survivors. Watching the zombie crows was much more entertaining than zombie dogs, I mean kung fu and dogs just looks plain stupid. And sometimes it seems like a war movie with zombies, so yeah although the story is really weak it does have some cool scenes and wasn't annoying to watch. All in all, this is a pretty good popcorn flick.7.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know whose's decision it was to change a lot about these films. But in my opinion. I know they should have stopped throwing in characters in the movie. That were not in the original games! I mean. The title of the films are "Resident Evil". They ARE supposed to be based on the game series "Resident Evil". And when people go to the cinemas to see "Resident Evil" they expect to see the game, transformed to a motion picture. I mean the first was a great film. But for the hardcore RES fans. There was no original RES characters! why call the RESIDENT EVIL if your only going to have the MANSION, UMBRELLA, A FEW ZOMBIES, A LICKER AND THE T VIRUS. That have anything to do with the game. I'm an amateur Movie Director. And since I was young, I planned on re-making the RES games to movies. Changing only minuscule details, and staying true to the games. People who watch the RES movies, who have never played the games will know no different. But I can guarantee if they had stayed true to the games. It would have been more entertaining, more action, better characters, and grossed more money. With more followers.</fullReview>

This was the most disappointing of the lot, because of it's further departure from the game and the lame pace, pointless plot, undeveloped characters that made it unbearable. I was bored by the pace and only stayed for the end to see if they were saving all their money for some grand finale or battle or monster but the film was just getting worse every minute and I am dead serious about that. The characters were not developed which added to the boredom and the battle scenes didn't impress me, same old fast paced-cut-to-slow motion-head lobbing action with boring gore. This tedious film also has so many rip offs it's unsettling for a film fan; like ripping off great movies such as the Mad Max Series and Hitchcock's Birds to name a few. So I thought it was a big disappointment and can't understand anyone who enjoyed it, they must be on drugs, getting paid or laid by someone or possibly just the producer's aunt and uncle writing positive reviews because this film is not scary or entertaining, it's Horrible!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely fun movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction is a fantastic follow up of Resident Evil and Resident evil: Apocalypse. Now, I have been quite a fan of the games since I played Resident Evil on the playstation. I watched the movies, think they are fantastic, then I come onto the internet to only find people complaining about how the movies are not like the games. I would only like to point out something: Why would CAPCOM allow the producer's of the movies to make the movies the same as the games? That would just hurt the marketing of their games, and bore the living hell out of the viewers because we've 'been there, done that'. I don't want to see a movie that I already know what is going to happen. Let's face it, if they took that route, then the movie would probably have big plot holes due to cutting down 15 hours of gameplay into a One and a half hour movie, and would not get rated high. The film makers have taken different elements of the Resident Evil games, and combined it with their own, to make a interesting, unique zombie Trilogy.Resident Evil: Extinction is set five years later after the destruction of Racoon City. Unfortunately, the horrid 'T-Virus' did not get contained, and the whole earth has now been overrun by the virus, turning everyone into the living dead. Even most of the world's water has dried up. Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), L.J (Mike Epps), K-Mart (Spencer Locke) and Nurse Betty (Ashanti) are traveling through the Nevada in a Convoy with other survivor's. Alice (Milla Jovovich) has separated herself from the group to carry out her own personal Vendetta against the evil Dr. Isaac's (Ian Glen) and the Umbrella Corporation. Alice finds the Convoy, and tells Claire about how there is possible survivor's in Alaska, making a new goal for the Convoy.Now the acting for the movie is pretty good. Not great, but good. It is what you would expect from a horror action movie. Some character's give a weak, yet passable job, such as Ashanti, and Spencer Locke. With Milla, its hard to tell. I don't know if her character is just a stiff character, or if Milla is just playing Milla, because all her character's seem to be the same. Either way, Milla work's for me, and does a good job.The action in this movie is great. It is a bit of a combination of the first Resident Evil, and Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Resident Evil one based more on horror, and less action. Resident Evil: Apocalypse got rid of some of the horror, and replaced it with cheesy, yet fun, over the top action. In Extinction, it is a combination of the first and second movie, and work's very well.With the way this movie ends, I pray to god we get a sequel, and it better be as good as this one, if not, better. If there doesn't end up being a sequel, I take my 10 star's down to a 1.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat better than #2, but my favorite is still the first</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>None of the Resident Evil films have been great. Part 1 was interesting and caught my attention, part 2 was boring with some nice scenes, but nothing good enough to recommend. Now we have part 3. I would say the third is somewhat better than the second movie, but not as good as the first film.In the finale in the series, mankind is mostly extinct except for a few survivors. Some of the survivors are living in the world and continue to exist by not staying in one area for too long. Other survivors include the last of the Umbrella Corporation which caused the T-virus to escape in the first place. They live underground and continue to plot how to continue living in a world over run by the undead. The Umbrella group's plan is to control the undead and train them in ways that will domesticate them and make them easily controlled, but to hell with the human survivors. This is something I don't understand. Why try to domesticate flesh craving zombies? Why not help the human survivors to extinguish the zombies once and for all and try to start a new world? That's one problem with this movie.Alice (Milla Jovovich in the role for the third time in the series)is the wild card. She wants to wipe out the zombies and help the human survivors, and now she has psionic powers to go with her fighting skills. She can suddenly create forcefields as well, but never seems to use these powers as she should. With her powers, she should be able to rid the world of the zombies, but she instead uses her battling skills with nasty blades and guns to kill them when using her powers would be more effective. I know, she doesn't seem to have good control over the new abilities, but you would think she would be willing to learn. After all, these psionic powers would make it much easier and more effective to deal with the zombie plaque, but then we wouldn't be able to see blood spray as she chops off heads and other limbs. Sigh.The story is not real strong either, and the secondary characters are never really given any depth whatsoever. The action is nice and there are several shocks and surprises along the way, but it is never enough to keep the flow of the almost nonexistent story moving along in an interesting way. The story has something to do with heading to Alaska which may still be free of the zombie plaque. However, it is never given much thought.Overall, Resident Evil Extinction is slightly better than the second film, but it still fails to match the first film. The story is weak and the characters, with the exception of Alice whom we've gotten to know in the two films previously, are also flawed. Of course Ali Larter as Claire, the leader of the band of survivors outside of Alice, offers something interesting to the story, but it is never enough. We wonder how she became this leader, but her story, like so much else in this movie, is never explored. I recommended the first film just barely, but I still cannot recommend this film even though it is slightly better than the second film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay as a Road Warrior style post-apocalyptic film... But a great zombie franchise sequel? Not so much.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the not too distant future, viral weaponry research and development goes all wrong. What follows is an entertaining vision for any fan of zombie pandemic stories or just plain world/human survival style films. The first film in this franchise is decidedly the best with as-believable-as-can-be ideas, nifty effects, a decent (not over-the-top) story. The second and third films, however, move pretty far away from the basic zombie survival story and much further into character-based stories with a focus on splinter/spin-off concepts like wildly comic book/cartoonish science fiction elements. So if you enjoy movies that are based on comic books or video games that will require you to accept a lot of really over-the-top ideas (like superpowers, supernatural powers, CHUD-style mutation, magic, etc.), then you will still enjoy the latter two films since they are not bad on that merit. They're also okay as general apocalyptic survival stories. However, as a fan of the zombie genre, if you were expecting a solid continuation of the basic story of zombie infection from the first film, these sequels will let you down. The Romero-style zombies in these films are really just extras that apparently just needed to be in the background making room for more intense and faster (though much less believable) antagonists. Maybe this is because films like 28 Days/Weeks and Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead have done much to turn the volume down on lumbering old-style zombies and Paul W.S. Anderson felt that he needed to crank up the action factor.In RE3, our heroes finally figure out that moving to near the arctic circle would be a good move (you know, COLD + ZOMBIE = IMMOBILE ZOMBIE), and decide to hoof it to Alaska after learning of a possible isolated colony of survivors there. There are a number of new twists on the infection (you will be thinking of Bud The Zombie and/or Bud The CHUD at a few points), and there will be more Boyle/Snyder style zombie goodness to contend with mixed in with the normal zombie hoards.There were, however, some hold-out thematic elements from the first two films. There are zombie Doberman pinchers, creepy hologram girls with British accents, plenty of zombie-around-the-corner jump-in-your-seat moments, and of course Alice either naked or in hot Road Warrior-style tactical gear. There is the terrible T-Virus infection, and the perfect anti-virus strait out of the X-Files. There are new hints at the answers to old questions, and some new things to think about that still relate to the basic T-Virus. And without a doubt, there's the recurring theme of the evil big corporation (The Umbrella Corp. A.K.A. Halliburton + Merck + United Healthcare) which caused the mess but has managed to out-survive governments and massive population decimation. The moral here? What happens when a capitalistic society allows a private entity to become too powerful? The evil private scientists always plot to rule the world at the expense of the common population.Anyway, I don't go to the theater to see films often, but I try to make it to the big-budget zombie flicks... However, on the merit of being a zombie film, I could have waited for this one to roll to DVD...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We just saw it Friday too ...LOVED...LOVED...LOVED IT....well at least I did lol...I love a movie to start out with kick ass scenes right at the beginning plus I am a huge Zombie Movie fan and Resident Evil is my first on my list...so as you can imagine I couldn't wait. The second movie was a bit of a let down but still OK but this third one kicked ass right from the get go.*Possible Spoiler*Now my only problem with it but not a real issue for me, however was for hubby, is that you have so many scene ideas from other movies....The birds scene, so reminiscent of The Birds and 28 days later, Reign of Fire with the whole perimeter, Dawn of the Dead with the explosion, flashback to Jeepers Creepers with the whole bus scene, not to mention the whole, female jedi knight thing lol..just to mention a couple! Again not a real problem for me because if your going to do intentionally or non intentionally a homage to movies, at least they picked great ones! However this was an issue for the hubby and what he didn't like about it although agreed this movie was so much better than the second. I told him that for me, a good zombie movie constist of the following:1. Loud hellish screaming zombies...this had that! 2. Fast ass running zombies on a mission...this had that! 3. Lots of blood and gore...definitely had that lol! 4. Cool characters in cool clothes with kick ass weapons or defenses and she definitely fits the bill lol!Can't wait to see it again without my hand or fingers in front of my eyes lol.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was entertaining for the most part, very predictable, very cliché. The first two resident evil movies had better pace, and believe it or not was more inventive then this one. Every plot point has been done in other movies and books. Anyone who has read World War Z will recognize several of the coincidences, the survivors might has well been carrying a copy of the zombie survival guide written by max brooks going..OK what next. In fact, I think there's once scene taken word for word from it. (about their need to feed, and survival rate) Also, theirs a scene that rips of Romero's Day Of The Dead so badly, I was waiting for a zombie to say "Hello Aunt Alicia." and salute people.Anyways, it was mildly entertaining, I wasn't hoping for much more....I just didn't expect such blatant rip offs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing original here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Firstly, I was pretty sure what I was walking into with this film. At the worst, I expected a sub par action/zombie flick, and that's exactly what you get. Well, almost that good, but not quite.Spoilers ahead?This was a text book example of just how unoriginal the Hollywood horror genre has become. Not only that, this film actually flaunts that fact. It basically plunders most of George Romer's "Day of the Dead" (1985) for ideas, sets and story lines, and even finds time to rip an action sequence directly from the "Dawn of the Dead" (2004) remake. Fusing all that with the blatant "Max Max" approach does not make it original, fellas. Not content with those two obvious rips, the "filmmakers" do their worst to nip a bit from "The Birds" for a laughable sequence, nick their final monster design from "From Beyond" and "The Swamp Thing" and kill him off with a method right out of "The Cube." Have I missed anything? I'm sure the filmmakers would use the word "homage" to no end, but those who don't buy into the Hollywood copy machine would use the word "insult" instead.I only have two questions. A) Who green lights this crap? B) How much of the effects budget went to digitally smooth Milla's skin on all her close-ups (it looked ridiculous).Milla did a decent job and the costume design was nice, so a generous 3 out of 10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The world is ravaged by the T-virus destroying nature itself. The world is drying up and the world is a desolate wasteland. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is roaming the world on her own keeping on the move. She battles zombies, bandits, and even crows. On the way, she joins a group of survivors (Ali Larter, Spencer Locke) reuniting with Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr). Meanwhile underground, Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) of Umbrella is doing research on clones of Alice.This is the third installment of the Resident Evil franchise. It is a vast improvement over the 2nd movie. The desolate look is superior. I love the post apocalyptic vibe. I wish they concentrated on only Alice on the road instead trying to keep track of the Umbrella storyline. There could be a great zombie road movie only if they allowed it to happen. Instead they keep interrupting it with Umbrella, and ruins any possibility of a fun zombie road trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident evil: Extinction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Extinction moves away from the amateurish and dull action of the first two films and instead aims for a more polished, eye-pleasing experience. The one area which has been greatly improved is the make-up: the zombies actually look somewhat frightful compared to the shoe-polish-under-the-eye type in previous entries.The script and storyline is no different though, with it being standard enough to keep your attention. The story was never real resident evil's problem though, but instead the dreadful action scenes which conjured no sense of suspense; that what let down the previous film.The same old characters are back with new arrivals and the story continues to follow Alice as she tries to keep out of umbrella's line of sight. Many fans will be peeved with the switch to action/horror from horror/(dull)action but i think letting the characters do there business while we watch them shoot zombies in a professional style works. The character's themselves are dreary and only tepid enough for us to imagine only spending an hour and half with them, but they do there jobs in making sure the film is at least enjoyable.Overall, an step up from the previous films.</fullReview>

In this movie none of the characters actions or the story line makes any sense ..this can be seen within 3 minutes of the movie..when a lead character puts her live at risk completely unnecessary..as is revealed only a minute later.. future actions just get more stupid and the story only gets worse from there..Even the bad guys are awful to watch..Take all irritating 1 dimensional evil characters/ monsters of all the worst movies you have ever seen..and you will find them all again in here..The heros are no better.The only reason I give it 2 stars is as a result of the cinemtogrophy . However the characters and the details of the story are so bad that even in 4D this movie would only get 3 stars.. since it is "only in 3D" I will give it 2 ..I need to quote somebody else: "The movie is a disgrace even for resident evil."

		<shortDescription>Best of both previous films...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction is all that I hoped and feared it would be. Like "At World's End" and Terminator 3 it is an improvement over its immediate predecessor but doesn't challenge the original in it's design. One thing I was happy to see is that the film seems to combine the best elements of its two predecessors.The film has a real feel of expansion. It feels like a natural continuation of the plot and it also manages to stand out in ways that its predecessor quite didn't. The amount of memorable scenes is admirable, the surprising opening, the zombie crows, the truck-explosion and the showdown between Isaacs and Alice. I'm also happy to see more characters from the games making the jump to the silver-screen, though admittedly Claire comes off as being more of a short-hand replacement for Jill from the last film. Lots of tragic stuff happens and emotionally the movie remains satisfyingly between dark and a slight shade of hope.The way the film seems to land itself between the last two is in a few noticeable elements. Like Apocalypse, the film has a strong and a varied cast of characters and plenty of exciting action-sequences. Like the first movie, it's pleasing to the eyes and the soundtrack has also changed to the electro-rock similar to the first film. These all make the movie at least an enjoyable audio-visual experience.One major point of criticism I can think of is the redneck scene which seemed to simply be an excuse to reintroduce the dogs and didn't really move the plot along. However, what bothers me most about this movie is the ending. I had been hoping for some closure for the franchise, but not only does the plot branch out further, it does so by splitting in two halves, Alice and Claire's. This on one hand makes me want to hope that they fill in the gaps so that we will see what becomes of Claire and yet at the same time I'm worried the Alice-story is gonna be taken too far.Also, I like trilogies much better than tetralogies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three out of ten, and it's the best Resident Evil so far...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The RESIDENT EVIL franchise has rose to become Milla Jovovich's main staple, this is her third round as Alice as she goes for another roundabout with the flesh-eating undead. Like to the others, it creates some fine set-pieces and some good frights and Jovovich quite a looker, but that's about it, the rest is pretty much garbage. EXTINCTION is just as cold and cruel as the two first, and although the R.E. movies don't pay too much attention on blood-spilling and gore, they have a underpinned evilness to them that creates a sort of atmosphere, but any hint of creepy atmosphere is easily crushed by a sad storyline.The Earth is all dried up and going down-under after the horrendous T-virus, now I don't know how a virus can dry up the rivers but that's another question. The few remaining survivors is always on the run, most of their time is spent by filling gasoline, eating, hiding and then filling gasoline again. Jovovich's Alice super-powered skills makes her a wanted refugee, now she's in search for a safe hideaway...EXTINCTION features some good set-pieces, and it's enjoyable watching a zombie-movie in full daylight and the empty-world-setting works pretty good. But nonetheless; even though it is the best so far, Resident Evil is a pour and lacking franchise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's entertaining, and it definitely delivers what we expect from this series, and Anderson... for better or for worse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a man continually writes scenes in which his fiancée appears naked(if not seen fully nude, save for glimpses which many a teen boy have undoubtedly paused and gone frame by frame to... admire; ah, the wonders of the DVD format), is he "sharing the wealth", or is he being a pompous jerk, rubbing her looks in our faces? Mind you, even if that particular fact does not make Anderson a jerk, there can easily be found other reasons to thrust that title of dubious honor upon him... in fact, I'm quite sure there are plenty who use far more explicit and visually descriptive phrases to describe the man. I don't know that I dislike him; it's actually almost funny, what he does. He writes horror that takes place in tight spaces, claustrophobic areas, he has gratuitous gore, he fills his work with loud, noisy rock music, he does action and horror with little respect for proper pacing or character development, his scripts are thin as, ironically, paper, and holed like Swiss cheese that's been attacked with a machine-gun, and last but not least, he insists on surprising his audience, pulling the rug out from underneath them, even though these surprises are at the expense of sense and logic. In spite of all of this, he manages to keep getting work. It's impressive, in an odd kind of way. And people do keep watching his stuff, in spite of how he treats the source material(before this franchise, there was Mortal Kombat, and he's also done Alien Versus Predator, managing to mess up *two* franchises that had good movies between them, well-done games made about them, and, so I hear, comics of, yet again, notably high quality). But I digress. Fear not, patient reader(as I'm sure you must be, for still reading this review), the introduction is over, and I will comment on the title itself, now. First off, Jill and Angie are gone, without even a mention of them. It's not even stated if they're dead or not. However, the very ending of the second film, for any who have watched it, *is* followed up on. The plot starts some time(every time I hear how long, it's a different amount of years) after Apocalypse. There's a different feel to some of it, with the characters much more mobile than in the first two. The script is about as bad as that of the usual Anderson film, but this still manages to be more entertaining and effective(if still not powerful, involving or engaging) because of one thing... the direction. With Witt of the second not in charge, and Anderson only writing, having not directed one of these since the first, it actually manages to rise... above the material? Possibly. It comes off as less obviously flawed than the second, though that may be more a matter of presentation than of content. With Valentine gone, another female known from the games is brought in... namely Claire Redfield. She's portrayed by Ali Larter, who does fine. Jovovich does fine again, albeit being less of a bad-ass than she was when we last saw Alice. She does still kick ass, and she's not the only one. The action varies, but some of it is definitely cool. The camera and editing, with the few exceptions where it confuses the viewer as to what's going on(which really doesn't extend beyond an early and utterly useless scene), really does a good job. Some of the action is really, really cool. In addition to Claire, other characters are brought in, though few do anything. Spencer Locke spends most of her on-screen time screaming or crying, with one of her only lines regaling the tale of how she gained her silly name. Epps stopped being funny at some point in-between the second movie and this one. The violence and gore is surprisingly tame(and there's less nudity and such), both for an R, and for an entry in this series. The make-up, however, is back, helping us viewers put behind us the pitiful excuse for not doing such, that was the presentation of the zombies in Apocalypse. The effects, in general, are quite good. The story borrows a bunch... from the first, in fact. Some bits are almost too close. The film is in a rush, as the others, and wouldn't have been bad off were it longer. The pace is intense. Near the ending, the movie gets too busy setting up a sequel(what comes after extinction? Although, one could have posed the same question just years ago, with "apocalypse" being the word), when it should be trying to properly finish of this one. The new monster, for my money, is great. The frights vary, some are jump-scares. All in all, the film isn't bad, and definitely delivers, if you liked the first two. The score has some hints to the main theme of the first, which I personally thought was excellent. I recommend this to any fan of the first two and of Anderson in general, as well as the actors. If you liked either of the first two, I'd say give this one a chance. 7/10</fullReview>

Also there are quiet A few predictable deaths, that didn't bother me because they weren't on screen long enough to care if they lived or not. The movie has some tie-ins to the game series (duh), which as a fan of the game series myself, could have done without. The action parts are definitely the best in the series. If you're new to the movie franchise and want to see a twist on some zombie action this you'll want to check out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bring on No. 4.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I go through the 3rd film in the franchise 3 things have become extremely clear to me.1)The movies have improved after outing specially on the technical aspects like acting, direction special effects etc.2)The sequels always promise more and deliver less.3)The potential is increasingly underutilized.Which means that although technical aspects have improved after every movie, the net rating of every movie has been roughly the same thanks to the last 2 points.I find it hard to believe that even though this is no.3 after I see the end im actually looking forward to the sequel a trend which I've observed in all the 3 films.All this being said lets not forget that this is out and out mod-high budget Action/Horror flick which is obviously more suited to the guys, the element of horror is also increasingly decreasing through each sequel, again a case of not living upto its potential (a post apocalyptic zombie infected planet was perfect for genuine horror moments).If any one expects more than a few great action scenes, good special effects and a few hot chicks from such movies than hes a fool.This movie starts with promise and remains within a band throughout the movie except for the climax where it lets down, for the first time in the franchise. However the absolute end has me even more excited the previous ones for the sequel.Milla looks good in a role she has made her own, like everyone else many of whom a reprising their roles from the earlier films.The acting was good all around, nothing special here and none was expected.Most of the scenes were good, ones that really stood out was the failed rescue attempt and the fight in Vegas.Other than that this movie moved along at a leisurely pace which is really why it should have excelled in the horror department and maybe with some better dialogues, even some scientific mumbo jumbo/delving a bit into the "pseudo universes" history would have actually made it more interesting.The soundtrack was good once again and well used.I wonder how much the tobacco lobby (if there is indeed one) contributed to the budget of this film??Despite the fact that i always expect something from this franchise, given its simple no-nonsense approach to entertainment, this is the 3rd film and I always expect at best what i got in the earlier movie (which more than what i expect from most sequels).There is perverse pleasure in seeing things being killed/killing things when there are no strings attached (your doing the people a favour by killing them you see) and zombie movies/video-games have cashed on this for decades.Fans will continue to enjoy this film, while there is something for the first time watchers.People who love to find goofs, plot holes and continuity errors will have field day in this movie. It is advised to stay away from these activities, or only indulge in them in the slightly less interesting parts of the film.If you are a fan you can pay premium rates, otherwise a DVD rental or cheaper rates are recommended.-s OK dialogue almost no horror, delivers much less than it promises, lackluster end, wasted potential, lacks the frantic pace of the earlier movies.+/-s WHAT ELSE DO YOU EXPECT??!!!.+s some really good scenes, once again promises a great sequel, everyone does a good job, technically sound, well used soundtrack.total 6/10 ( i mean you cant really expect more, I would have given it more for meeting expectations but it would have been detrimental. This is by no means a fans only film but non-admirers would do much better if they watched on DVD,TV or at cheaper matinée rates).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slight improvement on the awful APOCALYPSE</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I'm a fan of the games who liked the first movie. However, the horrible first sequel killed this franchise for me. After the pain that was sitting through that mess, I thought I could never enjoy any further RE installments. And yet, I found EXTINCTION more or less entertaining.Be warned that this movie is far from great: The plot is highly derivative. In fact, it's MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR with zombies (and with Alice using the Force from time to time). Once again, gone is the horror and the oppressive atmosphere of the games; there's just some MATRIX-style action. Mila Jovovich's acting is as bad as her ridiculous costume. Of the other returning characters from APOCALYPSE, one is the annoying L.J. (who at least gets what he deserves, he he), Carlos is given little to do and only the evil Dr. Isaacs has something of an (over the top) storyline. All the other supporting characters are just thrown in without a proper introduction, so we can hardly care when they are killed. And as much as I hated the truckload of flashbacks from the original movie that plagued APOCALYPSE, I missed some sort of explanation on how the virus was spread over the entire world and what happened to Jill Valentine and Angie Ashford after the first sequel.I guess my expectations were so low that I was impressed by the plus side: Russell Mulcahy's direction is way above the crimes against cinema that Alexander Witt committed in APOCALYPSE. The action scenes are well staged and shot this time (except for that idiotic THE BIRDS homage/rip-off). I specially liked the tie-ins with the original movie, like the opening scene, the new Umbrella facility (shown again through computer graphics) and the White Queen. Bringing two more characters from the games (Claire Redfield and Albert Wesker) was also a nice touch. I had a little problem with Ali Larter, though. I've always liked her, and during the first season of HEROES she has proved to be not only a believable action heroine, but also a better actress than I thought. The problem is that she is NOT Claire Redfield. In spite of that, I wouldn't mind if, as some rumors say, she takes over Mila Jovovich's Alice in a future RESIDENT EVIL 4. Maybe then, this franchise will become something closer to the games, instead of the Mila Jovovich show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>That's right? beautiful! As always the fighting for Alice is well choreographed and her character continues to have more depth. It isn't one of those movies where you sit there and think, "Okay only 20 minutes left." By the time it got to the point I had been waiting for I was surprised at how much time I had left. I expected to have an additional hour and a half, instead just 20 minutes. I love that in a¬¬¬ movie. Here's my spoiler though. I cried when Carlos died. From the trailers I expected there to be more romance between Carlos and Alice. I cried! That is a darn good horror movie, if it can make you cry too. To think... she could have saved him. I also liked the ending. It leaves it open for another movie, but can also be a closer. You want to see the battle, and see Alice end it but at the same time you already know how it is going to go. Either way I will be satisfied. So I hope y'all enjoy it, I certainly did. In truth there is no full synopsis and list of all the reasons that I love it that will give you a reason to see it or even do it justice. It speaks for itself, and in so you either like it or you don't. Just depends on if you prefer to actually think at a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Resident Evil: Extinction delivers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction opens with what, at first, appears to be a scene from the first movie. The same events that happened at the beginning of the first Resident Evil are happening again. However, the first noticeable difference is when Alice opens the door to what should be the outside of the mansion.Instead, it leads to the laser tunnel where so many people were killed in the first Resident Evil. Alice steps inside, only to see that the door closes behind her. She barely avoids the first laser, and narrowly misses death by laser grid when she jumps into the ventilation system.She doesn't go very far, opening the next vent she sees. She jumps down and lands right in the middle of a hallway in the Raccoon City Hospital, where she was experimented on. She walks slowly and cautiously, taking a gurney along with her, in case there are traps set.Pushing the gurney in front of her, she begins to run, faster and faster, when suddenly, BAM! The gurney is cut in half right before her eyes.Alice carefully steps over the trap, and right onto another. A circular, spinning gun flies out of the Umbrella symbol on the floor and shoots Alice several times in the stomach. She dies.Dr. Isaacs, the sinister man from the first two movies, steps forward, instructing two men to take the body and throw it into a pit.When they reach the pit, we realize that this is not the Alice we know. It is a clone.This is the premise for the movie. Umbrella is now creating clones of Alice, to try and create a cure. I think this movie was a very big improvement from Apocalypse.The direction is great, the acting is good-it's just a great movie. I'd recommend it to anyone! If you are a fan of the first two films, this is a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was Man That Done That</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been awhile since I've seen a horror movie in the theater. I saw the first 2 RE titles on DVD, and liked both of them to differing extents and for different reasons. I decided to check this one out in the theater, and I'm thrilled that I did. This movie was an amazing roller coaster ride, a perfect mix of Mad Max and the original Day of the Dead.The character back stories, while not extensive by any means, in a lot of cases gave you a reason to care for those people. You knew L.J. wasn't a bad guy, just caught in a crappy situation and not wanting to give up on his humanity for as long as possible. I doubt most people would act any differently in his situation. Clair was a great, solid character, as much as I don't like the Ali Larter role on Heroes, I couldn't help but sympathize and appreciate her here, trying to keep people alive and safe, moving from town to town, looking for a place to call home. Few of these people were hardcore soldiers trained to survive in extreme conditions, they were all doing what they had to do to make it, and she was no exception.There were inconsistencies to be sure, and things that I just laughed about after wards when I was picking through the movies big scenes, like who dressed the zombies in those light blue jumpers (intern job from Hell to be sure).A lot of people I talked to who have seen it seem to think that the end leaves the door open for a forth movie. While I guess it's possible, I also think it's also a worthy conclusion, Alice gets what she needs to bring down Umbrella, and there's every indication that she's going to go forward and do that. She also has the capability to create a cure for the t-virus mutations, which you feel like at the end she will probably do.The world at the end of Extinction isn't back to normal, and there's no indication that it will be any times soon, but there's every indication that there is light at the end of the tunnel, and I am good leaving it at that.I've only played the first Resident Evil game, and while it's a great game, I'm glad they didn't decide to adapt it for the movie. The RE movies give us a broader perspective of the world of the Umbrella Corporation and Raccoon City, a different perspective. They do make me want to go back and play the games I missed, but I don't see any reason why they should have just been a remaking of them.Not a flawless movie by any means, but good enough to ignore the flaws and enjoy the ride to be sure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Zombies Keep Staggering On...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't deny that the 'Resident Evil' franchise is a well-made package. The first one was quite intense with some seriously creepy moments, to say nothing of horrific beasties. But - my goodness - it's been milked for every dollar.In this latest and limpest episode, the techno-beasties are absent. Now it's just 'Dawn Of The Dead' meets 'Matrix'. And if that sounds like a very favourable comparison - it isn't. 'Extinction' doesn't come close to Romero's classic old sequel in terms of tension, plot or simple black humour. And Jovovich's pasty-faced plain-as-a-plank heroine could never be a 'Trinity'. The Zombies versus superwoman plot just wanders into set-piece snarl, leap, kick, snarl, leap, shoot hokum. She's even immune to their 'vampire' bite so it's no contest for the rotting ones. Otherwise there's a big bunch of survivors speeding around in trucks with needless abandon who get progressively wasted by recurrent zombie attacks.The next old idea to be recycled is Hitchcock's 'The Birds'. Crows have been feasting on the double-dead stiffs and getting infected. Suddenly, they are gathering around the survivors by the hundred, just like Hitch's classic. Zombie crows? big deal. What about the zombie rats, and the zombie flies? Maybe they'll arrive in the next instalment.This is the fourth course in the dead-flesh menu, and if you ain't replete by now; you'll never be. For me, the hors d'oeuvre was feast enough, and whilst it gave plenty to chew on, even that seemed a bit over-done.I've given it 6 stars because what I saw (about 90%) was well made in most technical aspects. I just couldn't be bothered to watch the end because I've already seen it in the first three instalments.First is best, otherwise the franchise is strictly for the game-fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I killed something! ... An hour of my time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone will probably be expecting this review... to be another nerd-filled rant about how this movie series has deviated strongly from the source material to make it easier and 'fun' for people who have no idea what a Playing Station or Nintendumb is. In a way, you're right. I only enjoyed the first movie of the series, and the second was decent, but the addition of a super model with bare bones for boobies who has one of the craziest last names I can't pronounce was something I thought was lame. Taking her out of the mix, I can say without a doubt that I found these movies to be of the C-grade material: they're not as moving as Dawn of the Dead, and they're not as sugar-high as 28 Days Later and it's sequel. This is a generic 'scientist corporation makes an Oopsy' zombie movie that we've seen in the bargain bin many, many times before.However, today I'll be reviewing the third movie. Am I the only one who found this movie to be a little... short? I like the concept of a major city to be completely rundown thanks to a zombie horde, and I especially dig the fact that the entire world has been dried up and drained of all it's vital resources. However, I find it a bit disappointing that Las Vegas was completely drenched in sand. I don't know exactly how this was possible, and I wish time could have been taken to explain this in fuller detail, or perhaps at least - use Vegas as it was. I know it's been done before, but... it's Vegas, man! Second to New York, the city that never sleeps! I would have loved to have seen showgirls, strippers, Elvises, and celebrities all going out for some zombie action. This is made up for in ZombieTown.My second biggest gripe has to be... the final 'boss'. Alice goes in to fight a Tyrant monster reminiscent of the one from the second game, but the fight doesn't last too long. After battling her out in maybe two rooms, they enter an exact rehash of the mansion from the first movie. Following this, the same laser-laden room which chopped most of the security team into itty bitty bits. Needless to say, this same attack defeats the Tyrant (Doctor British Stereotype) and we have a happy ending.Somehow I kinda expected a more thorough hunt-or-be-hunted, cat and mouse, sort of thing here. I imagined boss battles to be a bit more tougher than this.Overall, while I can't say the movie is godawful... this felt, as have the others, more like someone's off-shoot fan-fiction continuation. And those who support this movie, well... fit in the same group as the dimwits who like this sort of thing.Anderson, Mika whatever the hell your name is - I AM DISAPPOINT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>all i have to say is ... of course resident evil doesn't follow the games. just as Paul w.s. Anderson stated in the special features in the first movie, why make the movie like the game you can just go play the game again if you want that. obviously i am a resident evil fan boy. blah blah blah. the truth is its either to much gore or running zombies or something stupid like that that people base there goofy low ratings on.grow up we all have seen gore before. here is an idea instead of looking for wats wrong with the movie look for wats different and better. even i myself thought 3 would stink but i thought to myself wow do i ever feel like one of those people that give low ratings and heightened my expectations. but enough about how great i am. jk big time =). the movie rocked. everything was done in perfect amounts instead of things coming back again and again like herpies everything was done in controlled amounts. like the crows for instance. just when you thought dear god how can they keep going with this it was all over in an amazing flash. and when you c tyrant at the end you think oh its all over then blammo. trust me if you like zombie flicks this is the best of the best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie is amazing! I saw it about 8 times! Alice continues her journey of wiping out zombies...then stumbles onto two familiar faces...Carlos and L.J.! Alice finds a journal from a dead person containing notes on Alaska and how it's very isolated. She shows it to the rest of the crew (survivors) and the ruling vote is to make a go for it to Alaska. In the midst of fighting zombies...L.J. gets bitten, then when he dies (and gets back up) he bites Carlos...I CRIED SOOO HARD! Anywhoo...Carlos sacrifices himself for the rest of the survivors!!! I WUZ CRIYING WITH THE REST OF MY FRIENDS!!! He gets n his armored truck and runs a lot of zombies over...then the truck tips over and he waits there as the dynamite fuse is coming to its end...and as he waits he's being eaten alive by zombies...*criez* Alice made a promise to Carlos to find the Evil Dr. and get rid of him...but she finds that he died and turned into this very odd looking demon! They get into the laser hallway and they're fighting while jumping over lasers...then the demon doctor says, "Don't you see? I'm the future." And then Alice just laughs at his face and says, "NO! UR NOT THE FUTURE! YOU'RE JUST ANOTHER ASSHOLE! And we're both going to die down here..." As the last laser closes in...it dices the demon doctor into little cubes and Alice is awaiting her death. When it gets a foot away from her face...it stops...and shuts down. It turns out she has about 1,000 clones with the same powers she has and they're all going after the people who tried to kill her...The next movie will probably come out in like 2010 or something like that...and when that movie continue...it'll be about Alice and her clones and the survivors in Alaska and how they'll meet up and conquer the world again...or something similar to that!!! HOPE U GUYZ LIKE THE MOVIE!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Project Alice is online?Resident Evil Trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul WS Anderson has given us the newest trilogy of diminishing returns. I have never played the video game before and therefore went into the 2002 original Resident Evil containing little knowledge of the mythology. With that novice mentality, I found myself really enjoying the film. It gave me the background needed, the action and suspense expected, and a cliffhanger leaving me anticipating more. That continuation came but two years later with the subtitle Apocalypse. Here was a film that showed how the series' origin story was a huge part to the main plot of the first. This entry featured a bare-bones story, namely the extraction of a scientist's child from the infected Raccoon City, yet that was okay. The action was amped up, the characters more accessible, the acting vastly superior, and the ingenuity evolved. While lacking in plot, it excelled in action and effects, making it an equal, in my mind, to its predecessor. Its final twenty minutes was even devoted entirely to setting up the third piece to the puzzle. Here, though, is where the train derails hard. Extinction had a fantastic setup, yet instead of continuing right where we left off, we meet a caravan of survivors seeking gas and motoring cross-country. Nothing is progressed story-wise that we already did not know. Where the sparse plot didn't matter in the second, it stuck out like a sore thumb with the latest installment.It is Milla Jovovich's total blank slate in the first film, which makes it so endearing. We learn what the Umbrella Corporation is all about as she slowly remembers her role with them. It was a successful zombie movie, utilizing the jump scares and the hyperkinetic pace needed to keep you on the edge of your seat. All the characters were enjoyable to spend time with, we got zombified dogs, and a story that kept a bit of intrigue as to what everyone's motives were, while also being intelligent enough to keep my full, undivided attention throughout. The demise of all the people involved was interesting and to have a film end badly for all was a nice breath of fresh air. Alice does wakes up at the end, alone in a ravaged city, but she is definitely not in a position to rest up or smile at her good fortune.The transition into the second film is then seamless. We find that she didn't just wake up, but in fact is an experiment let loose on a city that cannot be saved. Our two survivors from the original are now pitted against each other to see which is the better soldier, and therefore the more effective military weapon. This fight is the entire story, though, as far as the main mythology goes. Otherwise, we have Alice and her new band of warriors on the lookout for the virus' creator's daughter. In effect, then, the whole story could have been told in about twenty minutes?they go in and get the child, Alice and Nemesis fight, boom, the film is over. However, the tale is padded with huge action sequences and gory zombie carnage. With the addition of Mike Epps to the cast, we are also treated with some nice comic relief, missing somewhat from the first besides Michelle Rodriguez's sarcastic quips. I never minded the simplicity of it all because it never tried to be more than what it was. I stuck with it until the conclusion and found myself even more excited for the third part. The setup had so much potential. Alice was fully formed, all her memory intact, and a new ability in telekinesis. With Nemesis gone and the zombies no match for her, we could finally get to see the showdown between her and the Corporation itself.And with that, we are treated to Extinction. It starts off pretty good with a cloned Alice being put through tests in a mock-up version of the mansion from the first film. It gets intriguing to hear what the scientists have been up to and to learn that Alice is outside trying to find survivors and keep herself off the grid. Then we get the first sign of trouble, an action scene that has nothing to do with the plot. Let's kill some hicks in the desert. If that wasn't enough, we also get a twenty-minute fight between our survivors and crows?yes those pesky black birds, newly infected. Sure the payoff is great, but really we are now halfway through the film and all that has happened is Alice found her old friends. We already knew she had powers and that her blood was special and could mean everything to the project. At the end of the film, that is the exact same knowledge we are left with. Besides many deaths and what could be the beginnings of a complete trainwreck of a sequel, starring no one else but Jovovich, (you'll understand when you see it), we learn absolutely nothing as far as mythology goes. I felt cheated and let down greatly because this film could have done so much more.In conclusion, the trilogy starts strong and ends with a disappointing whimper. The first had everything you could have wanted in a sci-fi/zombie/action flick. Scares, plot twists, and loads of violence and gore rounded out the successful entry. In came the second, lacking substance, but making up for it with flare. More characters, which never hurt the proceedings, more blood, more action, and more monsters can only mean non-stop enjoyment. And if the film doesn't deserve an extra point or two for Sienna Guillory's Jill Valentine, then you must have watched a different film from me. Next came the unfortunate failure of a third. What is less even than a bridge to the inevitable fourth, (will the box-office be enough to warrant it?), this last entry is a wasted opportunity to add to a nice little franchise.Resident Evil 7/10 RE: Apocalypse 7/10 RE: Extinction 3/10</fullReview>

Scrap the franchise as it is, and in a few years make more movies, without Anderson, without Milla and her Phoenix powers... just follow the games.

I'm honest - it's hard to watch this movie! I was waking up on few scenes with half naked Mila, and that's all! So, either you're 26 or 12, you'll better see "28 Days Later", "Mad Max", "Convoy" and "The Birds" - from those movies "Residnet Evil: Extinction" have taken A LOT and ruined it!

They get attacked by zombies and they move on. I thought the backdrop for the movie was to be in Vegas and you'd see them in the casinos and around the hotels. Nope, none of that. In fact, there was really no need to locate it in Vegas at all.Other than that, the movie is OK as far as zombie films go. However the genre has just been done to death in the past five years. How many ways can a virus/gas/substance turn people into flesh eating zombies or vampires or werewolves. The genre itself has become like a zombie that keeps rising again and again. Give it a rest for about 10 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never cared much about zombie-movies, because virtually every single one of them is utterly boring and as such a total waste of money. These mindless pictures always feature a world of undead creatures, one even uglier than the next, feasting on human flesh and leaving a small army of one-dimensional characters to fight for their lives and the survival of the human race. Mostly: these pitiful movies don't have a happy end and they never contain anything more than a lot of shooting and even more people dying in the most horrifying way. But every now and then: there is a zombie-movie worth watching. Usually director George A. Romero knows how to make a pretty good zombie-movie, but then again: he did in fact invent this subgenre. My favorite zombie-movie to date remains the 2004-remake "Dawn of the dead". This film does indeed have great actors in a pretty plausible plot.Whilst the first "Resident evil" was a pretty good movie and the second one weak but not terrible, this third instalment manages to ruin it all. It is not good at all! The acting is feeble and its characters are as dull as the stupid script in which they appear. Even the main character Alice became astonishingly dreary and ends up looking like a cheap version of Tomb Raider cyberbabe Lara Croft (whom is far more interesting; by the way).The only spectacular scene is a shameful copy of the classic Hitchcock-film "The Birds" and even though they use a lot more birds here, there is still a serious lack of intensity that the 1963-thriller continuously possessed. The big monster at the end is fake and ridiculous-looking and thus nowhere near as frightening as the ones of the first and second movie. It confirms the fact that nearly everything about this horror-movie is one complete failure.In short: Making movies out of videogames is always a bit of a risk, unless you know exactly what you're doing. The people behind this movie never had a clue and that results in an inevitably brainless picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The least bad among the three, don't get your hopes up too much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>-may contain spoilers on all three films- Resident evil extinction is that kind of movie where you know what's going to happen but it's still has its moments and satisfactory plot twists. However, it gets tiresome after a while because when you've seen three movies featuring zombies, mutant dogs, and a freak of nature you've seen it all. Milla Jovovich and Oded Fehr do a fine job reprising their roles as Alice and Carlos. With plenty of new faces to be disposed by the zombies. In addition, a change of scenery, and plot line helps to make this watchable. Another plus for the film is a good balance of character moments and sequences of violence. That way the audience can find time to relax and catch their breath after feeling the adrenaline rush of a zombie attack.I didn't like the first film because the pacing was slow, there were no solid characters to root for, and the plot twist made very little sense to me. The second movie was all non-stop violence with major plot holes at the beginning and end. I scratched my head as to the exposition of Alice. This third entry is entertaining with great horror special effects, but it's ultimately just another teaser for yet another sequel. In the meantime watch out for the killer crow sequence. It's a nail biter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me just say that this movie is NOT Resident Evil. This is a different movie that uses the title "Resident Evil" in order to attract attention.I am a huge fan of the game. Being so, I went through the "pain" of going through the first two movies with the belief that I can finally get to see a REAL Resident Evil Character from the game coming into life. The first Resident Evil was forgivable. It was scary in almost all aspects and it didn't really rely much on those "half-a-second" screams where a zombie (or something else) suddenly pops out into the darkness and the music quickly gushes in high volume (this was really exploited poorly in Extinction. Cheap scare practice. Tsk tsk tsk). The second Resident Evil showed promise. It was "almost" good but the idea of a horror/thriller movie suddenly shifting into a butt-kicking, zombie-slashing action film is really disappointing and annoying - especially the part where "Alice" and "The Nemesis" end up doing a fist fight and The Nemesis technically showing emotion (Poor Nemesis. His reputation will forever be tarnished).Eventually, there came a third (and hopefully final) installment - Resident Evil: Extinction. Believe me when I say that the trailer looks better than the movie. The trailer ignited a "hype". But the movie really didn't deliver much.Besides the traditional "half-a-second" scares, the movie heavily moves in an eccentric manner: First, the characters say their poor lines. Second, they then enter a deserted place - a deserted DARK place. Third, everything seems quiet. Too quiet. Fourth, a "half-a-second" scare takes place (usually a zombie appearing suddenly, a rat making some noise, or the wind blowing). Fifth, ACTION! I think this sequence happened at least three times or more within the movie's 90-minute lifespan.As usual, it was Milla Jovovich who saved the movie. Her wide array of action moves was truly a lot of fun (and knowing for a fact that she does her own stunts makes it even more fun). Even though the character Alice never really existed in the games, Milla's portrayal of the character made it seem worth it. And I am not talking about the nude scenes.Poor writing, mediocre script, badly portrayed characters (except Alice), typical horror/action elements and ultra-obvious (okay, not that obvious) CGI effects makes this movie a VERY POOR adaptation. I wonder how the creators of Resident Evil feels.Oh wait. Adaptation? I forgot. This isn't Resident Evil. This is a different movie. The last minutes of the film made it clear that it is different. Being that it is different, I'd recommend to the entire crew that they should have named it "PROJECT ALICE" instead. Or "DESERT WORLD". Or "I am a man who got bitten by a zombie and I won't tell anyone so that I can attack the person next to me a few hours later when I become a zombie".Watch it or not? You're choice. If you're not a fan and have never played the games (or even read or researched about it), then you won't feel a hint of anger and disappointment over the film's writer and director. You'll probably enjoy this - one way or another. BUT if you're a fan of the games and are aware of all game's elements, then do not even bother with this film. My God. Let's all just wish that in the next decade, a TRUE fan of the game will make a movie that will blow the previous installments into oblivion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Day Of The Dead + Alien Resurrection = Rubbish. (plot detail and spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul WS Anderson made the pretty good Event Horizon. He made Alien v Predator movie, which despite it's flaws I enjoyed. However, he's written all 3 Resident Evil movies and sadly none of them are written that well, and sadly none are any good.The plot, involving Alice joining up with a group of survivors after the virus has wiped out almost the entire planet, leaving a planet full of undead. Meanwhile, scientists from the Umberlla Coporation are trying to find a way of wiping out the virus, or even control the undead to use as a workforce. Or something... I kind of lost the threads at some point.The thing that strikes you while watching this movie is that you find a mental checklist of other movies running through your head:A military base surrounded by zombies? Day Of The Dead. A series of clones based on Alice? Alien Resurrection. A post-apocalyptic setting? Mad Max series.And the list goes on....The actors do their best but frankly the script doesn't help and with a story so disjointed it's almost like a bunch of movies thrown together to see what sits!!Russell Mulcahy, who directed Highlander (a personal fav), does his best to keep proceedings going along at a fast pace. He stages the action when it happens very well, especially during the Las Vegas battle, but even here he's let down by inconsistencies, when the zombies, which up till this point have been of the slow moving variety suddenly develop a burst of speed a-la the Dawn Of The Dead remake! If this was explained somewhere in the movie, I certainly missed it.The climax, which takes place in the military lab doesn't really excite, and worst of all, even though it suggests that Alice might be able to create a cure for the virus and possibly save the world the ending suggests she's going for revenge on the virus creators, with an ARMY OF CLONES!!!!! I'll let you guess which movie that idea comes from.....Course this means they'll probably be a Resident Evil 4 movie. I really hope not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie = No Plot At All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK So im a big resident evil fan, love the games, the first movie was sooooo amazing and the 2nd one was OK. So I was super excited for this film, bought a shirt with it on there and everything, I go to the movie, and the beginning Is super good, but then there was no plot through the whole movie, seriously i was laughing throughout the movie. I was so disappointed. You know a movie will bomb when Ashanti gets involved, thats just like busta rhymes in a halloween part 50 comes out to try and make the movie good. It just doesn't happen. The graphics were sooooo bad. When alice cuts straight up through a zombie then waits a second, he moves but the slit stays in the same place, its like a crappy sci-fi original film movie. I was so disappointed. This movie had such a high potential to be amazing, but definitely was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, worse movie in the whole genre. and *SPOILER* when you see the tyrant which is dr.issac's that was just ridiculous, the tyrant cant talk, and he was using the cheesiest dialogue ever. Ill admit that their was one really good part when she talks to the program queen thing in the new hive, when shes like "your sisters a bitch" cuz that made it great, but other then that the movie was dull. Sorry if this ruins you wanting to see the movie, but i just don't want people to be disappointed, just stick with the first 2, you'll be happy and just think it ends there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Resident Evil: Extinction is now the third installation in the series and so far it's the best! I saw this in the theater last night and I can't tell you when the last time was that I was genuinely excited to see scene after scene. I think Resident Evil: Extinction is my favorite in the series so far, it had great action, horrifying scares, and an actual story that could send chills down your spine. Milla is still kicking butt and she is so awesome in this film, not to mention that her telekinetic powers are growing stronger, so she's becoming a much more advanced fighter against the living dead. Resident Evil: Extinction is everything you could hope for: action, horror, a little romance, science fiction, and drama. The story was terrific because who knows how far we are from screwing up and possibly destroying the world? Scary to think about it.Basically the entire world is now a desert, most of the world's population is dead from the virus that is making them into the living dead. Most of the survivors are using the roads for survival and trying to kill as many of these zombies as they can while looking for food, water, and a safe place to live. Alice comes across a group and stays with them to help them out and she's back with Carlos once again. While it seems they are in the clear and safe, it turns out that Alice is being watched by Umbrella and they want her blood to create super zombies with incredible strength. They've been cloning her to see if they can get some close enough to her capability, but when Alice finds out about this, they may wanna rethink their plan.The only thing I regret about getting into the Resident Evil films is now I have to wait for the next sequel! LOL, it's just like a TV series, you can't wait until the next episode because the previous one had such a great ending. Oh, well, I knew what I was getting into. Resident Evil: Extinction is one heck of an awesome film and I highly recommend that you go see it, especially if you've seen the previous two films. The cast looked like they had the ultimate blast making this film and it's a cool looking film that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>any more disgusting and the movie wouldn't even be worth mentioning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't seen the two previous installments of this trilogy, nor have I played the video game; it appears that I don't need to. While I usually like gross movies, this one nearly stank. Gross movies have to understand what kind of movies they are to be worth seeing ("Grindhouse"). But movies like "Resident Evil: Extinction" pretend to be important. Milla Jovovich is not making any kind of name for herself if she stars in stuff like this.So, you'll do best to just avoid this one. There are far better movies out there. Aside from Jovovich, Oded Fehr and Ashanti (to name a few) probably wish to forget their participation in this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Look guys i don't know ....what u saw in the movie ....but it ain't nothing good...for what i can say. i mean first of all the movie was a roller-coaster ride...yeah but when it starts its you feel to throw up.the geography,the links,the storyline is all bogus.. i mean ...Earth is Dead , continental drifts occurred Eiffel tower,Liberty statue,Pyramids and sphinxes all in a single place...but hell yeah Vegas(location) is where it was supposed to be..In movie 1,the first part, Alice is in the Mansion when the troops crash in and take her deep into the Hive and there they enter the laser room and are killed...But here Isaacs kicks Alice in the mansion and she crashes into the next room and there "Presto" the room has emerged.about the story .... I seriously think that the storyline editor has some major issues i mean Alice has telekinesis or something which are not even considered in RE1 and RE2.i mean it seems that the storyline editor was creating the story and he/she saw some flaws and hence added some features to seemingly put the movie in flow.apart from that the movie action scenes were good . but the wardrobe...i mean cmon it was like watching Van Damms Cyborg....I don't know but ALi larter made a bad choice by joining the movie a speck...on her career i fair.the movie literally wanted me to poke a finger in my mouth and throw up5/10 (for the camera work and action)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are many things that went through my mind after Resident Evil 3: Extinction ended that made me sad. One was, that even though I knew the trailer looked horrible, maybe the movie might be a bit okay... and I was wrong.You know, I had thought I had seen it all... and then I saw the 20 minute fight scene involving "uniformed karate action zombies" (I AM NOT LIEING).The CG looks like it came from the deleted scenes from a batch of Dragon Wars meets Dusk till Dawn meets a Sci-fi channel original TV series CG movie.So finally, RE3 really is more of a Land of the Dead meets Day of the Dead spin off, and thus when you combine 2 crappy zombie movies.... you get quite possibly, the worst movie ever.... I give this movie a 3 because of those very few OK moments, but also because I realize that the movie was suppost to be that bad because I fell for it and still handed over my 7 dollars to go and see this monstrosity. Please do not go see this movie... you will only be paying for the sequel to this sequel sequel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK is it really called for to use material from 5 different movies?? X-Men 3, Birds, Star Wars, Carrey, and Day of the Dead. For the reviews for this movie so far, how much is the company that made it paying you to say it was good? I have never once walked out of a movie, and I was about to tonight. It was not worth the free ticket I used to see it. The only good thing about this "movie" was the action scenes. Personally, I don't know why a woman with the body of a 12 year old boy is trying to be sexy either. It doesn't work. As far as the acting, I've seen better acting in soft core porn movies late at night on the premium channels. Whether you are a Resident Evil fan, or just a fan of the zombie movie genre, don't waste your money. For the love of God, if people keep going to see these awful movies, they will just keep making them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than part two but thats faint praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world really didn't need another Resident Evil movie, the previous outings where in no way great, indeed the second installment was for the most part god damn awful. This the third (and please studio execs final) in the series feels dull and very repetitive, the feeling of deja vu is prominent and seeing as the initial parts were pretty poor thats in no way a good thing. Milla Jovovich is the kind of actress who looks great but simply should quit and become a full time model. It's shocking how dodgy her performance is here, all wooden stares and wrist flicking knife action. The character was never sympathetic but Jovovich hasn't managed to inject any 3-D aspects into the character, which considering it's over three pictures is a bad show. I enjoyed some of the action, indeed one particular sequence which a the viewer will revel in, but altogether the director of Highlander brings the same bland tricks and turns we see in every video game movie, however the picture is pretty short ensuring it's game over pretty quick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You have got to see this movie it is way better than the first one and second one. This movie is action packed and Alice kicks ass in this movie, so please see it. You should take your family and kids and see this movie you will enjoy this movie. I must say the first Resident Evil I saw was on DVD and the second one I saw was in the theaters. When I saw the second one there were not a lot of people seeing RE 2, but when it came to Resident Evil Extinction it was packed there with lots of people saying this movie kicked ass and I agree with them this is by far the best movie I have ever seen. So if your ever into horror films Resident Evil Extinction is a must see movie and trust me you are going to like this movie.</fullReview>
