		<fullReview>You know that feeling when you walk out of a movie and think "God, that was just such a great film"? It takes a lot for me to think that... especially when it's a movie about two men who have cancer... but this movie really did it for me, as well as everyone else in the theater. I saw the movie at its first ever screening in Pasadena and it was just wonderful... even with temp music and unfinished visual effects! Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were truly amazing together - it's a film about cancer, and yet the two were able to balance the comedy and the drama of the script in such the perfect way that the audience loved every moment of the movie. The script was quite original, which was such a breath of fresh air, and the acting couldn't have been any better. I would recommend this film to anyone and everyone - as it was such a feel-good movie that made you both laugh and cry at the same time - something you don't come across too often. Not only did the audience applaud the movie at the end, but EVERY single viewer who stayed to give comments agreed that the movie was "Excellent"... I can't imagine how often that happens. I'd be surprised if this movie isn't up for some Oscar or another come next year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Put two Brilliant Actors together and what can you expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A simple premise done magically is all I can say about this movie.Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are by far and away two of my favourite actors. Jack Nicholson is just funny, no matter what he says or does, ever since Terms of Endearment he has made me laugh so hard that I cry and Morgan Freeman is just the best actor going around. I find it hard to remember a bad movie that he has done.Probably not everyone will like this movie but it is definitely up there with the best feel good/sad movies that I have seen....and it has a moral that most of us miss in our hectic, live for the now short lives.This is going to be up there with the best at the Oscars in 2008.It will make you laugh and cry all at once...it did me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much silly as serious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young." Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian GrayNow and then I should rethink what I've been learning all these years as a critic because I predicted The Bucket List would have all kinds of holes in it. It did, but they were tiny blemishes in an otherwise solid frame. This is a good movie, as much silly as serious. And therein lies the skill of director Rob Reiner, who makes sure Jack doesn't kill the lines with bluster and Morgan doesn't drown them in vocal sweetness.Edward (Nicholson) and Carter (Freeman) meet in hospital where they have been given less than a year to live because of cancer. They bond, create the "kick-the-bucket" list of ten things to do before dying, and then do them. The hokey process shots at several of the world's wonders indicate the surety of Reiner's direction where he evokes the old Hope and Crosby road pictures and emphasizes that the journey is the important thing, not the destination.Both men laugh and cry and change in subtle ways that make this not a maudlin exercise in death denial but rather a celebration of love through friendship, regardless of the grim future. Although Justin Zachman's script is overall weak given the actors' worth, there are lines that save it all from mediocrity: As Edward the cynic says, "We live, we die, and the wheels on the bus go round and round." As Carter the humanist says, "You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you." The two philosophies, fate and love, caress in a slow dance to recognition of life's true value.The Bucket List is not half as sappy as I sound so far; it is a sober rendering of life's lessons at the end by two different men who find their common humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bucket List Movie Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most fun and uplifting films of the year, Rob Reiner's The Bucket List is also a likely contender for Academy Award nominations. Wonderfully sarcastic dialogue, poignant exchanges between excellently crafted characters, and an overall beautiful tale of mortality and morality, The Bucket List is an excellent opportunity for two of the greatest actors of our time to show off their inimitable techniques. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman have a chemistry that will have you laughing until you cry and crying at the sight of something truly majestic.Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is an incredibly wealthy hospital owner who firmly believes that he's running infirmaries instead of health spas, and therefore demands that each room contain two beds and two patients. When a twist of fate lands him in his own hospital, he's stuck sharing a room with Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman). Both men are dying of cancer, and the doctors give each of them only a few months left to live. The two slowly but surely realize how much they enjoy each other's company, so when Carter begins writing a "bucket list", Jack prompts him to see it through. The "bucket list" is a list of all the things both Edward and Carter would like to accomplish in their remaining months (before they kick the bucket) and with Cole's wealth, the two end up touring the world, skydiving and racecar driving. As their list of goals begins to come to an end, they realize how much they've truly lived just in the last few months alone, and how much their short friendship has impacted their lives.Jack Nicholson's performance is excellent as the curmudgeonly Ebenezer character that receives a change of heart and a change of view with Carter's friendship. Little character development is necessary as we have come to recognize Jack's style over the years. We're already familiar with his character and relate to him in much the same way we feel about all of his recent projects. He's attained a level of recognition that allows us to acknowledge him simply as Jack. Regardless of his role, he's still Jack, and he doesn't disappoint.The same can be said for Morgan Freeman who continues to play roles that accentuate his knack for worldly, wise and good-natured characters that can make us laugh and cry from moment to moment. Rarely do we see two actors work so well together ? this odd couple appears to have been destined for these roles. The chemistry between these veterans is pleasantly refreshing, and because of it, The Bucket List is one of the most entertaining films of the year.Another aspect, which is a great credit to screenwriter Justin Zackham, is the dialogue, which is continually hilarious even while it borders on heartbreaking. Sarcasm and cynicism are proudly worn by Jack, and the conversations conducted between the two are never dull. Meaningful, affecting and downright funny, the script is amazingly well paced and flows more naturally than anything in recent memory.Nearly everything is likable about The Bucket List, except the tone of the film, which many awards voters and critics may feel is too repetitious of late. The film is uplifting and heartwarming, and while the conclusion strives for unpredictability, comparisons may be drawn to similarly crafted works. "Driving Miss Daisy" and "As Good as it Gets" are immediately brought to mind, especially because these include the same actors, although the morals of "A Christmas Carol" and "It's A Wonderful Life" are clearly beneath the surface of this feel-good comedy. Despite these comparisons, The Bucket List is wholesome entertainment that will certainly bring director Rob Reiner back into the spotlight, especially after his unpropitious previous project, "Rumor Has It?".- Mike Massie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've cried during many films....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, like you probably, love the movies. I want to laugh, cry , be scared, be informed. I love every genre. But only three films have made me sob. Maybe it is where I am in life right now. I am no spring chicken, but this film moved me like no other. Is it the best film ever? No. Neither were the other two that made me sob. For the record they were "Men Don't Leave", and "My Life". This is a better film than both of those fine films.The operative word is sob.I have certainly shed a tear or two at countless films. You get a dedicated teacher and a bunch of misfit students, you'll get a tear out of me. You throw some adversity at an athlete or a team that overcomes it you'll probably see a tear as well, but this film just struck a chord. Not everyone who sees it will feel this way. I know that, but Nicholson is so damned brilliant as is Freeman. It is a joy to watch their characters for a little over 90 minutes, and the message, well, I hope it hits you as it did me. I wanted to go hug everyone that means anything to me. Sure the film has some flaws, but Reiner and company are to be commended. Thanks for opening up some feelings that I have spent years learning to hide. For the record I laughed a fair amount as well. Go see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magnificent Story About Friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually I'm not into these kinds of movies, but with the casting of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman I had to see it. I'm really glad that I decided to give this a try.The story is quite predictable, but I still enjoyed it. Never mind how impossible the storyline is because it is a great movie about friendship - how two men become great friends in a short time and help each other out throughout the time they are together. It moves along at a smooth pace and I never got bored, so the writer gets credit for that. The acting was top notch as Nicholson and Freeman draw forth the right emotion in the audience at the right time. The emotional parts are done just right, but the funny scenes are the best. I laughed throughout the movie but not as much as I would in a true comedy movie, but the comic scenes in this one really work and Nicholson is the "main man" in them. It does have a message at the end about how you should live your life to the fullest, how your family is important, and how you should be happy in life and the movie delivers that message perfectly.Other than the predictable storyline and the sometimes cheesy dialog, the movie is great. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a feel-good movie.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and decent tag team effort from two legendary veterans(Nicholson and Freeman) that teaches us about life friendships and touches our emotions and feelings.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bucket List" is certainly a sentimental favorite that as a viewer touches your emotions and has you hoping for finding a friendship in the end, even though the film is funny and somewhat unrealistic. The performances from Jack and Morgan as expected are top notch, and I personally like Rob Reiner's direction of showing how an unlikely and odd friendship develops between two guys on their way out of life by doing the things they've always wanted. The "Bucket List" in many respects is a good happy fairy tale that most ordinary folks would dream about before they die, yet the character types played by Nicholson and Freeman make it so believable.Jack Nicholson is billionaire hospital CEO administrator Edward Cole who as a grumpy and aging four time divorced playboy finds he has terminal cancer. With Freeman a character that's much different a blue collar working class auto mechanic named Carter Chambers who's a loving family man with a wife and kids and on the side a beloved history buff and trivia enthusiast yet he discovers his fate of having terminal cancer. Upon meeting in the same hospital room they share at first it's a cold and tough bonding only later to grow into a friendship by journey and discovery. The concept is thought up by Chambers by making a list called "The Bucket List" of things to do before we die. Oddly opposites agree the journey starts. The adventures include the heart pumping sky diving, auto drag racing, and trips to exotic locations and foreign countries. Many scenes like the mountain tops and pyramids seem unreal, yet are carried on by the witty and funny lines from Jack's character.Most important aside from the journey and discovery of friendship and caring by travel and adventure a special bond is formed. Each has learned before they meet the end they have made each a better person that cares they both found what's important in life thru one another. "The Bucket List" isn't really a tear jerker, yet it's story of two terminal cancer patients provides the need for compassion as the viewer feels pain during the early scenes and you are certainly touched by the way the characters emotions grow by friendship you as the viewer feel your emotions have taken a good friendship journey. Finally this film is made even better by the performances of the two veteran legends Nicholson and Freeman. I highly recommend anyone view "The Bucket List".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant piece of art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was glad to catch this movie before it's release date here in Canada, so I know to tell all my friends and family, and anyone I can possibly reach to go see this movie.Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman put on a terrific performance, playing two cancer patients who only have a year to live. They both decide to make a "Bucket List", a list of events they never accomplished in their lives. This list ranged from kissing the prettiest lady in the world to patching up the problems with their family.The performances of this movie was phenomenal, but what really made this movie unique was the writing. We have all seen movies with a similar plot like in The Holiday when Queen Latifa spends all her money living like a Queen because she only has a few months to live. But instead the Bucket List is unique because it wasn't that completing this list made their last year worth living, it was the fact that the writers focused on the chemistry of these two men and how their friendship increased while completing this list.The witty dialog, the brilliant writing and the great performance really made this movie a post-Christmas treat.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Yes, this can be viewed as Hollywood formula with mass appeal and loads of stereotypes and clichés. On the other hand, it can be taken as a very accessible commentary on friendship, companionship and finding the joy in life. I prefer the latter. Either way, it does require a certain suspension of reality. Just ask Roger Ebert, who has made it his personal mission to bash the film.Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are both in prime form, and after a string of weak films, director Rob Reiner does a masterful job of keeping Nicholson from going over the top and from having Freeman kill us with sweetness. Even more impressive is the pacing of the early hospital scenes ... nothing is forced, no line of dialogue or shot seems hurried. This is two patients coming to grips with their situation. While the worldly travels are impressive, my favorite parts of the film are the scenes between the two beds in the same room.On the downside, will someone please tell Hollywood that Morgan Freeman in the cast does not mandate a blasted voice-over from the man? We know he has a great voice, but if the narration adds nothing to the story, please just let the film do its thing.There are some laugh out loud moments and one-liners, but there are also some strong moments of drama ... death has a way of creating those. This is a combination of road trip, buddy film and coming-of-age ... very unusual for two senior citizens! So while the story line surprises are few, sit back and enjoy excellent acting (including Sean Hayes), wonderful direction and a few life lessons. Good stuff for a movie that all ages can enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>heart warming story of friendship-strong male performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On new years day, 2008, I saw the film "The Bucket List." It was not my first choice of a film that I wanted to see. To be honest, however, I probably would not have enjoyed any of the films that I would have chosen more. This film is very well done. I liked the screenplay, by Justin Zackham. I liked the direction, by the real talented Rob Reiner. And I was very impressed by the acting. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman did a superb job, playing two dying old guys who befriend each other, and together have the adventure of their lives. The film is very good. The plot involves this hospital owner-Edward Cole-who is dying from cancer, and another cancer victim-Carter Chambers-who meets Cole while getting treatment at the same hospital. After they both find out that they each have only a few months to live, they agree to travel together all over the globe, and follow this list of tasks. They call it the bucket list.Nicholson gives a real touching performance as Ed Cole. He plays Cole funny, sad, stubborn, angry, strong, fearless, and loud. Morgan gives an equally touching performance as C. Chambers. He plays Chambers smart, cool, romantic, funny, fearless, and emotional. Both men are very moving in this film. They are great sharing the screen. I really enjoyed watching them play scenes together. It was for me a real treat. These guys, Nicholson and Freeman, are two of our finest actors. And this film is no exception.Even though "The Bucket List" is a small film about friendship, and the meaning of truly living, I do not recommend it for the preteens. There are some very adult scenes. However, families with teenagers will enjoy seeing it together.Josh Weinman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director's Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner was somebody we were rooting for. Like Richie Cunningham, he was a character we were taught to like through weekly contact in a culturally suggestive context. Then he went out and made films, and at first they were spectacularly good. Not good in a dramatic or cinematic sense so much as the way in which they got the balance right with humor and storytelling. They don't have the same power now, but a couple of those films from the 80s were ripe, perfect gems.And then society folded itself into more complex ledges from which to look at itself, and Carl's son remained frozen where he was. In retrospect, he was frozen where his dad was. I can think of nothing more damning to say of a success.Well, he isn't a success any more. His notions about what's between real truth and ideal perspective are so far off, the effect is to remind us that society is crumbling. There really are people who cling to the thin notions this film builds on. Except there isn't much building; its straight out of the bottle.Its all tired. One good director too tired to learn the new world. One great actor who gave up long ago and now merely borrows from his past. Another actor who never had it, and admits that he is too lazy to do anything but be the same nice guy ? and narrate himself through a role. The story is a thin one: redemption.Freeman's character was almost written interestingly, his estrangement from his family a matter of unappreciated sacrifice. But its only written into the side. There's no real redemption here, because there are no real characters, only tired actors. Since we know they are not redeemed, cannot be, the project dies.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember those old soft drink commercials that would show elderly people drinking the product and acting young by listening to rap music, doing the latest street dances, and talking about "catching waves"? If you hated those commercials as much as I did, you will hate The Bucket List, which is basically a 100 minute variation on the same idea. It features two great actors running around acting young, but it adds a couple disturbing twists. The first is that they are both terminally ill with only months to live. The second is that they don't seem to care about anything but themselves, not worrying about friends or loved ones who may be concerned about them.The two men at the center of the story are played by a pair of great actors, namely Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately, these are not great characters that they are playing. They are merely playing rifts on the same roles they've occupied for the past 10 years or so. Freeman is once again the sagely type who gives advice to anyone who will listen, and also acts as the film's Narrator. It's a role he perfected in Million Dollar Baby, and this seems like nothing more than a mere rehash. Nicholson is once again the seemingly-grumpy "I don't give a damn" type, who is eventually revealed to have a heart of gold after spending time with a person who changes his life. It's a role he perfected in As Good as it Gets, and once again we are stuck with a rehash here. They both find out early on that they are dying of Cancer, and that they only have a few months to live. Freeman's character introduces an idea to the other about a "bucket list" - a list of things you want to achieve before you die. Nicholson's character just happens to be a devil-may-care millionaire who figures they should act upon this list, since they only have a short time left. The two men supposedly pack their bags (I say supposedly, as no luggage is ever used or seen), and go on a whirlwind around the world journey.The Bucket List obviously wants to be a big, heartfelt movie that leaves us walking out of the theater with a tear in our eyes and a spring in our steps. The heart at the center of the movie, however, is completely artificial and calculated. Okay, I can sort of buy the fact that two men near the end of their lives could just suddenly up and leave at a moment's notice on a trip around the world. But, you'd think they would require medication and constant monitoring given their current states. Not only do these men not need any luggage to travel around the world, but they also don't need any medicine or professional medical evaluation the moment they leave the doctor's care. As soon as they decide to take their journey, they're skydiving out of a plane. Well, actually, a pair of stunt doubles are skydiving out of a plane. The movie uses special effects to paste the faces of the two actors onto the heads of the stunt doubles diving through the clouds in an effect that does not look the least bit convincing. Their globe-trotting adventure that leads them to such places as China, the Himalayas, and the Pyramids of Egypt is mostly accomplished through special effects. We're usually not watching these two actors visiting these places, we're watching them sitting in front of a blue screen while an image of their current location is projected behind them. I'd like to think that director Rob Reiner is making a statement on how phony and unrealistic the screenplay he's been stuck with is, but I'm afraid that's not the case here.You'd think the movie would handle the most obvious question. What about the people these two guys leave behind? Wouldn't they be worried sick that these guys who are terminally ill and will be dead in a year or less are jumping out of planes and flying souped-up race cars off of ramps? The script by Justin Zackham dodges this issue by basically ignoring it. Nicholson's character is a grump who doesn't really have any friends, so he's covered. But Freeman's character has a concerned wife and family. We get a scene before they go on their adventure where his wife tries to talk him out of it, but the guy doesn't back down, basically saying he has to be his own man. Not once during his trip does he make any attempt to contact his wife, friends, or loved ones to let them know that he's doing okay or even if he's still alive. He does eventually return home to his family, but he doesn't get to share any real scenes with them. His entire family is treated like a prop, used only to sit at his bedside when he's not jaunting about with his friend. There is a subplot about Nicholson having a daughter that he doesn't talk to, but the movie is not interested, and merely tosses it out as a vague attempt to give his character something resembling humanity. In movies where someone is dying, there's always some unresolved family crisis. The script knows this, and includes it, but doesn't care. The inevitable reunion with his daughter is treated as a throw away scene that gives us what we expect, but no reason to care.The Bucket List knows what emotional buttons to push, but it doesn't push hard enough. This is a shameless movie that wastes the wonderful talents of two great actors, and puts them through a dopey screenplay that's far beneath their talents. They deserved better, and so do their fans, who will no doubt flock to this movie expecting something great. Despite the best intentions of everyone involved, this movie falls far short of even being good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A friend took me to watch "The Bucket List" tonight (it's usually the other way around, I take him to the movies I want to watch). As much as I love Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, I wasn't very excited about this... it looked really cheesy, and the reviews were not good at all (not saying I believe in most critics, but when I don't feel particularly curious about a movie AND the reviews are mostly negative, chances are that I'm gonna skip it). It turned out pretty good, actually... we've all seen movies about people who find out they only have some time left and make a list of things to do before dying (Isabel Coixet's "My Life Without Me", with Sarah Polley, is my favourite of them), and "The Bucket List" is not original or innovative at all, but Nicholson and Freeman alone make it worth seeing. It's not sappy as most movies about terminal patients, and it's entertaining enough. And even though it doesn't intend to be serious or thought-provoking, death is always a delicate issue, and this movie might make you reflect about how you spend your time: months ago, I was discussing with this same friend how, in movies, people only start living to the fullest when they get to know they're about to die. That's something we should all think about: to die, you only need to be alive, so we should all enjoy more the present instead of worrying so much about the future, because, unfortunately, there's no such thing as life guarantee. For its humor and tenderness, "The Bucket List" deserves a 7.5/10 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*MAJOR SPOILERS... in case you really can't guess how this film will end*So when someone comes up to you and tells you that there's this film, right? and it stars - get this - it stars none other than Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, and it's about two terminally ill old men who decide to spend their last days together going on adventures learning lessons about life and friendship and etc! wow, right? sounds like a really heartwarming tale, if a bit formulaic.So you sit down and you watch it and at the end everyone is standing up and saying stuff like "wow, that was really, like, profound and stuff?" while you realise that what you just watched was really really bad. It honestly feels like this film has been created by some sort of Oscar-hunting robot who has observed many much better films in a similar vein and created a flowchart for academy success and followed it to the letter. Unfortunately, it's cold unfeeling mechanical mind failed to grasp the subtlety or complexity or nature or anything whatsoever about our strange organic "emotions". A theme concerning the nature of X and how Party 1 deals with it? CHECK. The effect that Party 1's decisions regarding X effect those they care about, and a plot that ties into this? CHECK. Two or more individuals discussing and discovering things about this? CHECK. Morgan Freeman narrating wisely on the merits of some white guy? CHECK. The script-robot, in order to give the audience an interesting backdrop, gave one of it's main characters billions of dollars and came up with a conceited reason as to how he ends up in the same hospital room with a middle-class hard-working average Joe. Adventures ensue which involve large quantities of pseudo-deep dialogue. After confrontation with several stock characters, one of the main characters dies, resulting in a form of emotional conclusion for the audience. That is literally it. The two of them have some stock getting-past-appearances-banter involving wisecracking, then the man-putting-up-a-facade-to-hide-deep-wounds we're supposed to sympathise with and whose life is improved by Morgan Freeman (it shows how unoriginal the writers were when we receive narration from Freeman's character simply because it's Freeman, even when it would make far more sense for the purposes of plot for it to come from Nicholson's character) decides that they should GO OFF AROUND THE WORLD and all of a sudden, the fact that they are undergoing chemotherapy is tossed out the window and they RACE AND GO SKYDIVING! before we proceed to look at a slide-show of some terribly photo-shopped pictures of various predictable landmarks showing on a projector screen while Freeman and Nicholson stand around in front of it saying literally nothing profound or deep. Yadda Yadda Yadda contrived subplot estranged daughter solved without a fuss blah blah blah Then it seems all this excitement has reminded Freeman's character that he has cancer and whoops, he's back in hospital! cue the "touching" scene where aw look how they're both such good friends and how tragic yet life-affirming and now there's a funeral and OH SHUT UP. In short: contrived plot, two main characters with such boring generic backgrounds and personalities that their only recognisable merits are the actors who play them, a lack of the kind of depth necessary to make this sort of thing work, that old skewed Hollywood perception of everything that means it bears no resemblance to real life, a heap of lifeless, dull dialogue, not a single subverted or averted cliché of this genre, all of it combined to make a film that isn't forgettable, but is actually annoying due to it's frequent and misguided attempts to tug our heartstrings without understanding how and even why.Tell you what, go watch something like "million dollar baby" if you wanna see how to make this sort of thing. And then, go and watch "Last Holiday" it's got Queen Latifa in and is essentially a big dumb popcorn heartwarming family-film which still manages to be about twice as profound and deep than the Bucket List.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A List To Follow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friend and I had a choice between 'The Bucket List' and '12 Dresses'. We agreed on watching 'The Bucket List'. It wasn't a bad movie and it seemed a little unrealistic. There's also the clichéd theme of dying atheist meets dying religious guy and atheist guy eventually sees things differently. The two dying lead characters befriend each other, one of them writes a bucket list and then the friends decide to follow the list and fly around the world. Not a bad idea. However, there is a lack of good story development as it starts off too slow and then moves on too fast. We are presented with some nice locations but we don't really get to see how these two characters feel each time they completed a task of the list. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are pretty much an extension of the characters they played in so many other films. They don't act bad but both actors have the same nuances, vocal tone and diction and character (Nicholson as the whiny one and Freeman as the wise one) like in their previous films. Sean Hayes is very different from his famous 'Will and Grace' persona. Having said, so many negative things, there are some good points too. I liked how the film ended and the camaraderie between Carter and Edward is fun to watch. Overall 'The Bucket List' is a decent (tearjerker) film and it has a relevant message but it is nowhere near as great as people seem to make of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rob Reiner's best film since the turn of the millennium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lovely, thoroughly enjoyable movie with lots of nice words and thoughts exchanged, some to make you laugh, some pretty profound to make you ponder on. Who would've ever thought that a story about two dying men could be such fun. Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman), so far complete strangers, with rather different economic and social backgrounds (billionaire hospital magnate and body shop mechanic), both terminally ill, thus inevitably at closing stages of their earthly lives, meet and, in order to try to experience things from their "bucket list" (a list of things to do before one "kicks the bucket", i.e. dies) before the final curtain falls, embark on nothing less than an amazing journey. Although age-wise much too "developed" for many youthful activities they engage themselves in, and despite their individual differences, however sufficiently open-minded and open-hearted, two protagonists, through their earnest performances and their great interaction easily draw us into their well believable story (with single fantastic twist at the end... (spoiler)... realization that rather than through eyes of the still surviving one, the story was told from the mind of his ensuing spirit), whether (constantly) putting smile on our face or tears to our eyes, ergo covering (well, for us viewers) one of listed items, "laugh till I cry"....On a more personal note, eight years ago when I first saw this movie in a theatre, I was a solitary man, going fifty, thinking that I have already experienced things which could make my "bucket list" (climbed high mountains (Mont Blanc, Gross Glockner, Triglav, Durmitor, Fujiyama, Kilimanjaro... to name a few), visited Great Pyramids, well not Great Wall of China, but at least Great Wall of Ston, well not Taj Mahal, but instead many other magnificent temples (Angkor Wat in Cambodia, temple of Karnak in Egypt, temples of Nara, Japan... to mention a few), been on safaris in Tanzania and Rwanda...) to reference those matching items pursued in the movie. Now, after its second viewing, coincidentally on my wife's birthday, I'm almost sixty realizing that only by starting a family and having this cute little toddler of ours to chase and play with every day (and... quoting another listed item, in "kiss(ing) the most beautiful girl in the world", compete with her mother), I have pushed my life's wish list much closer to completion...Finally, after a decade of his successes in 80-ies and beginning of 90-ies with movies that I have enjoyed watching very much ("This is Spinal Tap" (1984), "Stand by Me" (1986), "The Princess Bride" (1987), "When Harry Met Sally..." (1989), "Misery" (1990), "A Few Good Men" (1992)), "The Bucket List" marks Rob Reiner's successful comeback and it stands as his easily the-best-of-the-new-millennium directorial effort thus far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable melodrama that it could have been a masterpiece...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise is simple. 2 old men are struck by the sudden news of their terminal illness. They have 6-12 months to live so they decide to write a list with the things that they want to experience in the short time they have left. Money is not a problem since the one of them is a multi-millionaire who owns a private jet and mansions across the globe. So anything can be in their bucket list.Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are playing the 2 men and it works well. There is chemistry between the 2 veteran actors.The movie tries to be emotional using as vehicles the themes of family, respect, loyalty and of course friendship, but I think the director (veteran Rob Reiner) overpassed the line and turn this to a melodrama.Overall the movie is fairly enjoyable and the only thing that someone can argue is the missed opportunity for something really great. A better script and a more refined structure could have made this well....even...a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The quiet mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a man with a great general culture; has been married for forty-five years with his beloved wife Virginia (Beverly Todd) and has two sons ? one lawyer the other engineer ? and a violinist daughter. The caustic and bitter billionaire Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) owns many hospitals, has many divorces and one missing daughter. Following the policy of Edward, his hospital makes no exception giving a private room to him and he shares the same room as Carter. Along the days, they become close to each other and when Edward finds in the garbage the bucket list that Carter had prepared, listing all he wanted to do before dying, he includes his own items and invites Carter to a journey of friendship, discoveries and redemption."The Bucket List" has a wonderful screenplay, two fantastic actors and a predictable story about the journey of two terminal patients with cancer that find friendship, discoveries and redemption. The contrast between the two lead characters offers very beautiful moments with witty and spirituous dialogs alternating with funny and dramatic scenes. This is one of those movies that bring happiness to the viewer in spite of the unpleasant theme ? illness and death. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Antes de Partir" ("Before Leaving")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What else could we expect from Hollywood? Some funny moments. Some bad cinematography (apart from a great view of the Himalaya). General unconvincing mellow-drama.This is a tale of the selfish, unloved, unloving, hedonistic atheist contrasted with the thoughtful, loving and well loved theist. This is quite typical of Hollywood, who promote the notion that any belief in the ridiculous is superior to skepticism, no matter how insanely pernicious.If you like mindless theistic propaganda then this is for you. More opium for the US masses! It is disgraceful to see Hollywood putting forward this kind of shameless stereotyping thinly veiled as a comedy-drama for the gratification of simple minded Americans glibly grazing on superstition and American nationalism.I suppose I should be grateful that for once an englishman wasn't being used for the part of an evil stooge.I'm sure you will realise by now that I was appalled with this film. I was also shocked that Jack Nicholson would sign up to this, though not so of Morgan Freeman. Jack, you just went down in my estimation!I'll have to give it a star for the witty antagonism between Jack's character and his personal assistant, and a star for the TV glasses scene in the hospital.</fullReview>

And you must have a heart of stone if you are not swept up by the story. To summarize the story, then Edward (played by Jack Nicholson) and Carten (played by Morgan Freeman) meet in a hospital when they are both in there with terminal cancer. The two strangers start off a friendship that lead them around the world, and shows the strength a bond between people can share.The cast in "The Bucket List" is marvelous. Of course with names like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman you know you are in for top quality entertainment. Both these seasoned actors do a tremendously great job with their roles, and they have really good chemistry together. The movie also have Sean Hayes (playing Thomas) on the list, and he was a nice addition."The Bucket List" is the type of movie that will stick with you for a long, long time. And the storyline really leaves a lasting impression. If you haven't seen "The Bucket List" already, then I strongly suggest you get around to it, because this is truly one of the more moving pieces of cinema in a long, long time.Thumbs up for "The Bucket List", way, way up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was expecting a lot more from a great director and two excellent actors. I guess Nicholson and Freeman could only do their best with what they were given.The commercials looked pretty good and I was thinking it was going to be quite a comedy/adventure movie with the required drama about illness and death. I found it bland and flat with only one real moment of laughter when I thought, "Wow, that was a great line." I don't normally look for inconsistencies with continuity and such, but I knew this movie wasn't holding my attention enough when I realized I was noticing errors and poor work. A close up of a family photo shows THE WORST Photoshop job ever, and when a shot is taken of the view of an ocean, it's a still shot. The water isn't moving. How pathetic.Going in, I thought this was going to be *the* movie to see. I'd wait for the DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Under-appreciated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just thought I would write a review as this is the first time I have seen this movie being aired on TV. I did not watch again, but recommend to several friends, Having only watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time a month or two back. This movie is not being aired on a major channel, which is disappointing, although I hope people 'channel surfing' discover this film, as it is, at its best a beautiful film.Initially, I saw this film shortly after losing a close fried to cancer. Although I can agree with many reviews that the plot is quite predictable, and that both Nicholson and Freeman do not stretch themselves. However, the connection between the two men and their different perspectives on death are really fantastic. As an outsider (close friend) of someone with cancer, this movie depicts two otherwise completely different characters; who only share their terminal illness. I found the bond portrayed between both actors both believable and beautiful.There seems to be a little scepticism regarding this film ( I think the rating has improved since 2007) I myself saw it many months official cinema release - and with similar scepticism. I finished the movie with a tear in my eye, some of the thoughts of terminal cancer patients revealed. Beverley Todd highlights the distance of those who suffer and family members.At best this film has touching and heartfelt moments which can be understood by all. It only misses the mark by being an exclusively cancer based film ( although this is not the main subject of conversation); I feel some of the sensitive and most evocative scenes may lightly wash over those who have not witnessed or experienced cancer sufferers first hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are lots of things to say about this movie. First of all, two great actors are carrying the movie on their shoulders to a such point where you start questioning your own life. The happiness that we are looking for is not far as we think,on the contrary it is just next to us. The movie helps us to see our own bucket list.The story is both strong and emotional and it really touches the heart. The narration done by Morgan Freeman gives a special taste to the movie. The voice takes you right into the movie and lets you feel the same way as the two main characters do.If you are not content with your life, and if you keep asking yourself "what do I have to be happy with" this movie is just for you. The first rule of finding something is to know where to look for it otherwise you waste your life just looking for it. I have always had a bucket list but now I know where to start looking for. I hope you find your bucket list too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An exceptionally well-written and subtle script (why was this not Oscar-nominated?) and two finely honed performances from Nicholson and Freeman, plus excellent support especially from Freeman's wife, allow this film to transcend its rather depressing subject matter. This film was quite properly a success despite the sneering critics (why exactly?) Roger Ebert, himself suffering from cancer, wrote that the bucket list "thinks dying of cancer is a laugh riot" which extraordinarily misses the point. This film is certainly not a laugh riot but contains a defiant-in-the-face-of-death strain of humour intermingled with poignancy and wisdom. Whole chunks of the dialogue deserve to recited verbatim.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Freeman is one of my favourite actors and I am starting to watch Jack Nicholson's movies nowadays. I think I will start to like Jack after I watch some of his works when he was younger. Frankly, this film was too much to bear. Though the director, Rob Reiner treats the film very well with some funny moments and only sprinkles the emotion in some scenes, it was an incredibly sad film for me. I think I will truly appreciate the movie in another 40 or so years when I am as old as them. I haven't lost anyone to cancer in my family, but lost my elder brother 4 years back when he was only 20 (he had a condition known as musculodistrophy or something). This film brought back painful memories of my brother and I loved it.Edward (Jack Nicholson) is an incredibly wealthy man who is also the owner of a hospital and lots of firms. He suffers from blood cancer and Carter (Morgan Freeman) is his room mate in the hospital who also has cancer. Carter is a mechanic and has written a wish list of to-dos before he dies, but when he finds out he is going to die within a year, he discards the list. Edward sees the list and wants to do all the things on the list alog with his own wishes. The two of them who were unfriendly in the beginning, gel together wonderfully to do all the things which they didn't have time to do before.Edward is actually a prick when he first meets Carter and it is really hard to feel sorry for this guy. But after he and Carter become friends, he begins to show his good side and that is where I felt sorry for this man. They go on sky diving (which is hilarious), get tattoos, go on car races, enjoy the African safaris, they get on top of the pyramid, go the Taj Mahal, try to climb the Mt. Everest, etc. The emotional part is only at the beginning and ending, in between it is very fun and Carter giving his wisdom and knowledge to Edward is cool to watch. I don't know how Morgan Freeman does this amazing job of fitting into the characters perfectly. Jack Nicholson was also good, but you can see that he may have been born to play jerk characters with aplomb. The cinematography is excellent and the score is also good. I cried in the climax, it is that good. If you are over the age of 40, it is a perfect film for you. Others can also enjoy this.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was painfully corny yet the acting was at a very high level that the film didn't "deserve" and seeing Freeman and Nicholson in action made it tolerable. SPOILER - when Chambers ditches his wife to run off with Cole, putting myself in the wife's place, I would take this as a cruel blow that I could never recover from so how can I sympathize with Carter after that? Also, Chambers narrates from beyond the grave. That wouldn't be so bad if this were, say, the 6th Sense, but it creates a problem here in that if there really is an afterlife (and true to its corny script, "nice guy" Chambers asserts that there is to counter "secular" not nice guy by Cole) it's no great loss if people die, so why the fuss anyway? This utterly contrived, formulaic attempt at being philosophically insightful is a joke, but the acting - especially in the first half - is noteworthy.</fullReview>

The relative was wrong. The Bucket List captivated me early, and kept me spellbound.Never during the film did I think "This is unrealistic." The events could have happened, quite reasonably. The story is highly believable.I admit that the final scenes had me grabbing for a handkerchief.If ever there was a "message movie," this is it.I commend the cast, and I commend Rob Reiner for his directing.The Bucket List prompts every viewer to examine what to do with the remaining days of life, whether they be many or few.Years from now, I will treasure the power of this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bucket List (2007) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you go into this expecting a straight-out comedy farce, there'll be a lot of disappointment. While this movie certainly offers up its humorous scenarios, it's mainly a very heart-tugging buddy film featuring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman as two very different men who get diagnosed with cancer at the same time and are placed in the same hospital room together. As they spend weeks getting to know each other they become bonded and Nicholson comes up with an idea to spend what remaining time they have left going out with guns blazing. They write up a "bucket list", which basically consists of all those things they've always wanted to do but never got around to: sky diving, race car driving, traveling to France, ascending the pyramids, and other special things. We come to feel for both characters and are touched by the events. This is certainly a sad affair at times, and often emotional, but both actors are very good and up to the task. When it's all over the viewer may come away feeling he's seen something special, which is a rare way to exit a movie these days. Since I didn't bother to check beforehand and since more and more new films are leaving all the credits til the END of the show these days, I didn't realize Rob Reiner was the director until it was all done. This gave me even more satisfaction. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Prior to watching "The Bucket List", I had doubts as to whether or not I would like it: Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are both really good actors, while Rob Reiner has directed good and not so good movies. Well, I liked it. True, there's a predictable plot with the occasional treacly moment, but I liked how it portrayed these two men living their final months to the fullest by traveling around the world. Jack Nicholson always knows how to project just the right amount of sarcasm to make his role a cool one.OK, so maybe it is becoming a cliché to have Morgan Freeman narrate movies, but this one does a good job showing how both his character and Nicholson's use the trip to eventually make peace with their families. Among other things, I could relate to the scenes where Freeman watches "Jeopardy!"; I also like to shout out the answers as I watch it.Overall, I would say that this is not a great movie - far from the best film of Nicholson, Freeman or Reiner - but that it goes to show that all three still have what it takes to create a worthwhile piece of cinema. I recommend it. And I now have a hankering to go to some of those places...although I'm not so sure about skydiving.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the previews, I thought The Bucket List would be an OK movie at best - I mean how can ya go completely wrong what with Nicholson and Freeman as your stars, I figured. I also thought it would be slightly on the predictable side, what with the premise, and with Rob Reiner directing I was figuring it would be a bit of a sap-fest, with the manipulation factor running roughshod over the audience (making us care about these people and then making us watch them die). I hate that, but I decided to give the film a chance anyway.The actual film, I'm pleased to report, is much better than I had expected. Reiner pulled off the perfect tone throughout, giving us tons of excellent character-driven humor which never feels forced or desperate, and he had the good sense and instinct to allow these two brilliant actors to shine in their respective roles in a natural, humanistic way. Most importantly, he realized the material did come with a bit of the dreaded manipulation - we do wind up caring about these two guys and they do die - but it's written and portrayed in a gentle way, with wonderful good humor, up til the very end. In fact, the very last line of the movie, delivered by Freeman in a voice-over (let's face it, nobody does this more eloquently), is about Nicholson's character's ashes, and it's a very witty line.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie that makes you feel good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What if you get to know about the day you die? It's said that knowing the day of death makes one liberal from all those chains and bonds and probably it shows a clear path to go with what you really want in your life, you are bought to this world with no intentions but in the course of life you gradually ''try'' to find a way of happiness just like the calf finding for the hay.2007's 'The Bucket List' has that ''feel better'' stuff and the concept of Hope that always keep you alive and young, this movie is about a genius mechanic and the insane lonely business tycoon who are diagnosed with the cancer and decide to pursue in fulfilling their ''Bucket list'', they both get into some really crazy stuffs like skydiving, African Safari, racing cars, riding on the China wall and reaching the Himalayan summit with only intention to have their life fulfilled with joy and sense of content, both help each other to make feel better and lead their way in making their living meaningful, ''one day your life will flash before your eyes. Make sure it's worth watching'' this single quote from this movie summarizes the entire story.The movie takes you in its narrative pattern and helps in getting along with the character and their feelings all through the story, its Jack Nicholson an actual super star of his kind who truly grab your attention with his ''go free'' kind of role and Morgan Freeman as usual portray his typical classic way of performance, this work is something different from the traditional movie making style and try to convey the valuable message for the life, it's the journey of discovering oneself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The bucket list</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The « Bucket list » is a movie which make the people think about the sense of the life. That's the story of two old and illness men who have to face with the death. They are come from two different worlds but they have no choice and share their space in a small hospital room. Nobody thought that they will become friends because of this cancer. Indeed they decided to begin a list of all the things which they want to realize before dying and choose to make them together to don't think any more of the suffering and forget their problems. The two characters will travel all over the world to make challenges and finish this list. Even if at the beginning we don't really appreciate one of the two characters, we finally fasten for them because they had a complicate life and nevertheless they want to enjoy and have fun before to leave. This movie makes the people laugh with his dialogs which are very humorist because the actors speak with cynicism but sometimes you also want to cry. There are some serious conversations about their life and they ask themselves philosophic questions. The story is very gripping and moving because it is a mixture of three genres: comedy, drama and adventure. One of the reasons to watch this movie is that there are two great stars who play in it, Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson. Obviously they did not disappoint me in these roles. I really recommend you to look at it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Here's something to remember when you're older Thomas - never pass up a bathroom, never waste a hard-on, and never trust a fart" (Edward Cole). "The Bucket List" is not the most original movie in the world nor the greatest but has great heart which makes it such a good movie. Packed with scenes of moving emotion as well as great quotes, the story follows two terminal cancer patients as they cope with the physical, mental and most importantly the emotional pain experienced with cancer. The two characters couldn't be more different, Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a mechanic, whose dreams of being a history professor never materialised. He is an extremely grounded person who is extremely reflective straight away as expected from a Morgan Freeman character he is wise, virtuous and godly. The other is Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) the billionaire, owner of the hospital they both find themselves in. He is more of a free spirit and more decadent and less faithful but still deep down a nice character especially as they bring the best out in each other. What makes this movie so good is the way it presents an inevitable ending that we seem to log when watching, but it still is an emotive ending, with value. Packed with good humour and great sense of hope and optimism, whilst not being overly soppy (in my opinion) others will think differently. The two realise that both have not lived life to the full and embark upon doing things which will hopefully fulfil the lack in their lives, this is what adds entertainment, with hilarious sky diving, strange hunting and profound conversations, the movie touches on a difficult subject matter which hardly no one can consider comical but is kind of funny. As the story develops we realise just how valuable sharing pain with someone else can be. This is what adds to their relationship and despite their binary opposition they end up relying on each other. The movie is clichéd in many ways. Yet again Morgan Freeman is the wise, virtuoso character who spills out frank pearls of wisdom at random, but still is brilliant in this role. On the other hand Nicholson is a typical rich and powerful, argent figure also suited for this role. The way in which their friendship develops is also not as original as I would like. With various faults in plot and special effects it still is a massive success. How? The acting is the main success. Although many critics have been critical, I still think the laid back style of acting in this movie gives its sense of realism, which is what makes it believable, the humour is unique and adds to us liking these two different characters. It somehow makes us feel genuinely moved and appreciate that in life we can't do all the things that we like but yet we have to try and celebrate what we have. This may seem soft and whilst it may not be a completely accurate depiction of cancer this is a very good movie that appeals to anyone with a heart and should be watched.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bucket List" - a movie wherein two protagonists i.e Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, when meet in a hospital owned by one of them and other being a terminal patient become friends in their last lap of life. The basic postulate of this movie is the Realization of Importance of Life in the advent of its end. The movie shapes beautifully wherein a multi-millionaire and a working mechanic tries to relive their life and appreciate the beauty of things, people and world around themselves. They on their quest to live cherish-able moments in life start with making a list of unfulfilled dreams and things which get neglected in the course of their life and called this "The Bucket list".The credit must go to the director in coming up with two of the best in the Industry and pulling it off with a masterpiece. The movie reinstates the fact that there is much more than what we can actually do with our life by appreciating the world around us and realizing the beauty and significance of Human life. This movie is a light paced movie which leads ultimately to the death of protagonists but they have lived a whole different life for some time at least before they finally said adieu to the world.I would give the movie 9/10 Rating and a thumbs up to the movie which has presented us with an life changing experience and has given all of us a chance to stop worrying about life and start really living it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The critics have it all wrong.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The big thing about this is that this is the one film where you should not look at the critics' reviews before watching it. Rotten Tomatoes averaged up 40% of critics liking it, and Metacritic's averaged score is currently 42 out of 100. Both, all in all, are mixed or average scores. This is definitely not your average comedy/drama in any way, shape, or form. If anything, it deserves an Oscar. Maybe not Jack Nicholson--it's easy to admit that he does not give his best performance; plus he had an easy role to deal with--but Morgan Freeman definitely should have won the Oscar for Best Actor. He was smart, funny, witty, clever, and lovable. If the Academy didn't want that, what a pity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Im delighted to give this film the honor of my first IMDb review. This film portrays a philosophy wished by everyone with excellent performances from Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman.I always had an image in my mind that these two actors only suited the drama and thriller type films,seeing two of cinemas powerful actors making a comedy was a joy to watch. The plot was at times predictable but simple with Nicholson as Edward and Freeman as Carter who are both cancer patients sharing a ward,and decide to make a bucket list {a list of things they would like to do in their life} and aim to complete it before they die.What i liked about this film is how the cynical minded Nicholson in this movie works with an optimistic freeman to give this film more emotion and humor. I would have this film in my favorites and i would recommend others to see it and add it to their bucket list.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the bucket list is an amazing movie which talks abt d life story of 2 people who r gonna kick the bucket(die) as their body cells r bein killed by a terrible disease called CANCER.... the 2 people in d movie r no one else other than our very own Jack Nicholson &amp; Morgan Freeman.... Both these characters belong to 2 extremes of d society ie one belongs to a middle class family and d other belongs to a very high society..... How they meet each other, how d get prepared for d ultimate rest, how they hold hands together to complete their bucket list is d movie.... This movie basically tells us how a persons life changes if he/she comes to know the date of their death which is clearly reflected in movie..... This movie will certainly be an inspiration for those people who r in d same situation suffering from cancer... Most importantly this movie teaches us that doctors r not gods and there "IS" some force certainly more than d docs words... MIRACLES DO HAPPEN..... So this is what i understood from d movie and my kind request to d people who have not yet seen dis movie is "GO WATCH IT" "WHAT R U WAITING FOR" :)... Have fun watching ti.... hope it inspires u and makes u understand that miracles always happen... Have fun life....Live ur life to its maximum.....This is ur life and u cant get it back... :):):)</fullReview>

Morgan Freeman has always been one of my favorite actors, (if not my favorite) for obvious reasons which I feel certain (as box office receipts prove) are shared with many, many others...Nevertheless, I'm obviously somewhat prejudiced here, regardless...It would be easy to sit through two hours of something as mundane as a herd of penguins walking around in the white abyss, as long as Morgan Freeman was narrating...Oh wait a sec...been there, done that...But, to prove my point; it was a step-by-step (literally) look into the lives and reproduction processes of penguins that (I don't think) I would have sat through (without a short power-nap), otherwise...*In all seriousness, it was really fascinating and Morgan Freeman only made it even more so with his distinctive voice and concise manner...Edward: " You're shitting me." Carter Replies: " No, the cats beat me to it! "...and another bucket list item bites the dust...(Laugh until You Cry...)Of course I have no idea how much make-up or pre-filming character work Nicholson did to 'get ready to look sick', but I must say 'it was a little 'startling' to see him and all his 'few extra pounds'...Maybe its been longer than I realize since 'The Departed' was filmed???...but he sure has changed in look since playing the part of Harry Sanborn in 2003's Something's Gotta Give...really a dramatic difference in appearance."95% of the people are always wrong"...there's another (sorrowfully truthful, however) remark that'll make this a treasure trove of quotes that you can use for about any situation...Heck you'll look like the fastest car in the garage whipping out smartarse remarks like a I just hope those were POS 'junk cars' they were smashing-up on the track...there's some things you just shouldn't do...regardless of the budget!" Our lives are streams flowing into the same river towards whatever heaven lies in the mist beyond the falls...Find the joy in your life ________________."P.S...This is definitely one of the movies that may be even more enjoyable at home...versus the theater...So you can take your time and really enjoy the dialogue between these two, not to mention the scenery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eventually, we are all headed to "kick the bucket" doomsday so maybe it is not such a bad idea for government to mandate that everyone must create their own "Bucket List" and follow-up on the zaniness and adventure that is incorporated on what you want to do before you die. OK, so that submission will never come into realistic fruition, but at least I have developed my own "Bucket List" on things I want to write about veteran Director's Rob Reiner film "The Bucket List" before this review kicks the bucket. So here it is! Meeza's Bucket List on "The Bucket List":Get Jack Nicholson, who stars in "The Bucket List" as wealthy Hospital owner Edward Cole who is diagnosed with a fatal cancer, to co-star in a film with Christian Slater about a father-dad tandem that go on a national road trip and sleep with beautiful women in each of the 50 states. Of course, I am not in any way interested in the gratuitous nudity of Nicholson and even Slater, but instead to see their lovely sexual companions' breasts and bottoms in raw footage. Get Morgan Freeman, who co-stars in "The Bucket List" as Carter Chambers a history whiz mechanic who is also diagnosed with fatal cancer and befriends Cole, to narrate a biographical film about my sexual escapades called "The March of the Meeza Pingains". OK, I hit below the belt on that one. Get Director Rob Reiner a silver star for his solid direction of an entertaining and somewhat touching film about two dying men who make a pact to go on a global adventure on living their life to the apex before they depart to the heavens or the hells;. Even though I would be more enthusiastic about giving Rob a gold star for his still startling directorial achievement of the 80's classic mockumentary "Spinal Tap". Get Writer Justin Zackham an advance screenplay software program so he can touch up on excluding the over-exhaustiveness of dialogue clichés included in film scripts as he did in "The Bucket List"; even though I do give him some writing points on developing the "The Bucket List" premise. Get Sean Hayes, who contributes some admirable supporting acting work as Cole's assistant Thomas, his own "Will &amp; Grace" spin off show called "Jack-Off"; only "W&amp;G" fans will rise up to that one. These might be some entertaining and wild points, but I am still first a fan of the good old-fashioned general male bucket list of: having sex with two women at the same time, travel to Amsterdam, a night alone with Jenna Jameson, and a weekend stay at Hefner's crib. Nevertheless, Reiner's "The Bucket List" is one film that you should not kick the bucket to. **** Good</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I LOVED The Bucket List. The talent of its Oscar winning stars notwithstanding, this if a smart, funny, and occasionally irreverent film. I was endlessly entertained. The emotional growth of its two protagonists and their increasing ability to deal with their illnesses as they grow closer together is heartwarming. Indeed, I think that is why IMDb voters uniformly appreciated the film (7.6 average rating) and the usual naysayers among the critics simply didn't get it (only 41% positive reviews, according To Rotten Tomatoes). With their treatment of The Bucket List the critics reinforced my notion that there is some secret provision in the Critics Union's bylaws that approving of most movies that are overtly sentimental and any Rob Reiner film are dismissible offenses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reiner Back to his best? Not quite, but a vast improvement over recent films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a number of completely uninteresting films over the last decade or so, Rob Reiner came back with "The Bucket List" which I had the opportunity to watch last night. The idea of the film grabbed my attention immediately when I saw the trailers and I was interested to see how he would handle the subject, although I had a fairly good idea.As far as the basics of the film are concerned, the story and characters are solidly constructed, and possibly deserved a little more 'heart and soul' putting into it from the two leads, particularly Freeman who just felt a little like he was acting within himself.Having two powerhouse actors instantly recognisable from their earlier successes was always going to be difficult to retain any kind of realism, and in places Morgan Freeman's narrative did make me wonder why they weren't both in Shawshank prison. In a completely straight piece I fear the casting would have been a real problem. However, it was clear from the start that the issues in hand were always going to be dealt with with a deadpan joke or a tongue-in-cheek comment which Nicholson is a master at. Having said that, there were a couple of throw away comments which just seemed a little crass. I mean self deprecating humour is all well and good but in one or two spots I cringed a bit at the way it mocked an illness that 1/3 of the population die of in a pretty miserable way.When all is said and done it was an enjoyable film, and the humour was probably just about right and not too overbearing. I'm sure that it will be bashed from pillar to post by many for it's lack of gritty realism, but I'd congratulate Renier for not going down that path that has been well trodden of late. An uplifting film about death is what it is and in that I think it succeeds, with a light smattering of giggles along the way</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine story, and Nicholson and Freeman are superb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Update: I saw it again today, 18 months after my first viewing. The movie is almost as fresh, and I came away with an even better opinion of it. I went into this viewing a bit apprehensive, thinking that a movie about two men marking items off their "bucket list" wouldn't make much of a movie. I was very pleasantly surprised that it is much more than that, and a genuine look at "what is the meaning of life?" The two lead characters could hardly be more different. Jack Nicholson is super-rich but lonely Edward Cole. He buys hospitals and makes them run efficiently and for a profit. He was married 4 times. The problem was, he enjoyed being married, and he also enjoyed being single, and he could not enjoy both of them at the same time. Even in his advanced years he cannot turn down the opportunity for a quick romantic encounter.Morgan Freeman is mechanic Carter Chambers. But Carter is super intelligent and knows more things than just about anyone. He wanted to be a History Professor, but he put his ambitions on hold 45 years earlier when he found out that his wife was pregnant for their first son. They are still married, have a large extended family, and Carter kept working as a mechanic to support his family and allow his children to have a better life.When they both get sick about the same time, and are forced to share a hospital room, they become unlikely friends. Both are diagnosed with different, terminal illnesses, so Edward attempts to convince Carter that they need to achieve their "bucket list", things they wanted to do before they kick the bucket, a project Carter had initiated when he was a young man. As Edward says, "All I have is money, the cost doesn't mean anything to me, let's do it."Sean Hayes is good as Matthew, Edward's perfectly efficient personal assistant. But Edward always calls him "Thomas" because Matthew sounds too Biblical. Beverly Todd is good as Carter's wife Virginia. And, in a blast from the past, Rob Morrow (Dr. Joel in 'Northern Exposure') is Dr. Hollins, treating Edward.As the story unfolds and they travel the world in Edward's private Learjet, the two men begin to have an impact on the other, helping to realize important things about themselves and their lives. My personal "meaning of life" has always been "Be sure to give back more than you receive", and the message in this movie is consistent with that.In the end, Edward was able to cross off his list, "Kiss the most beautiful girl in the world." One of Carter's grown sons was played by Alfonso Freeman, who in fact is one of Morgan Freeman's grown sons. Aligned with the theme of this movie, Alfonso did not meet is father until he was in his 40s! SPOILERS: The "most beautiful girl" was his granddaughter whom he had never seen. Inspired by Carter, Edward looked up his estranged daughter and met his granddaughter in the process.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this a drama or a comedy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching the Bucket List is a thrill of emotional twists and turns. Like life itself, this movie effortlessly is able to display the full spectrum of human emotion through the brilliant acting of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. These two could easily move into the type of team acting that made Matthau and Lemmon a great duo. Jack and Morgan, both well respected dramatic actors show a side to themselves that they usually do not display, and demonstrate the depths of talent that they are able to get to to be funny and at the same time display the emotions of someone who has been told that they have a short time to live. They play off of one another so well it is completely believable regarding the adventures they get into on the screen. This movie combines comedy, drama and gets to a point that is downright emotional. Rob Reiner adds to his resume another great example why he is a top notch director. I am a guy who does have a tendency to shed a tear or two when watching certain movies, this movie had me openly crying at one point and it felt good. The movie is not a sad reminder of our own mortality, it provides an uplifting message celebrating life and the possibilities we still have while we are alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can relate to some people that have said this movie is Oscar worthy , but unfortunately it is too late. This movie was officially released Dec 25, 2007 to a very 'select' group of theaters. I digress. The movie had the best cinematography of any I have seen. It had the same effect on me as CLICK. I went in expecting slapstick comedy and got poignant lessons on life and that basically we are here for a short time. A message I can relate to. The movie was very good , not great and for the most part predictable. I gave it a nice rating because it was well done. Lets be real here folks. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are both excellent actors but the fact is they are monolithic. They always play the same guy with the same personality. Jack the good old slightly mischievous bad boy with a heart of gold deep down and Morgan the down to earth, intelligent, conservative rational, thoughtful guy. It was a good movie with a good message and it did entertain and that was the bottom line.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Headed by the dream pairing of Nicholson and Freeman, "The Bucket List" takes a pretty morbid subject (how would you spend the last months you have left of life?) and turns it into something hilarious, moving and life-affirming.The two leads are fantastic(you wouldn't expect any less), and the movie as a whole is full of so much heart and vim that you can't help but get carried along with it. The special effects required for some of the scenes are glaringly obvious, but that never detracts from the essence of the film, and while the more emotional core of the story can occasionally be pretty calculated in it's methods for attacking the heart strings, when it's playing those beats so well you'd need a stone heart to not let it affect you.

Another good film by Rob Reiner are "A few good men" with Tom Cruise, Demi Moore and the master Jack Nicholson. It's a really good one, and all of them give a exquisite performance. You realize that Jack it's not only a good actor, but it's a manual about how the acting becomes a reality.I don't want to talk about the same thing I'm surprised. Just I want to suggest something: Go to see "The Bucket List"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bucket List was an astonishing disappointment for me. Casual viewers may be pleased, but anyone searching for in-depth filmmaking or any kind of emotional response that goes beyond the guiltless emotional milking of the subject matter will be genuinely let down.That's what really made me mad about this movie. The filmmakers seemed to believe that as long as they promoted the idea behind this picture--two men living out their greatest dreams before they die--they didn't even have to try.Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson very rarely give bad performances, however, and this movie was no different. The best decision the filmmakers made was the casting decisions of Freeman and Nicholson, two actors guaranteed to give one hundred percent every time. They make the film worth watching, but they can't save the film from being completely forgettable for me.The director, as I said before, seemed like he wasn't even really trying. He gives us hardly any time to watch these two magnificent actors get to know each other before thrusting them into airplanes and racecars. The movie feels like a horrible cut and paste job as we are simply moved from one location to another with very little time to become acquainted with what's going on in each scene. It's like the the director said "Screw it; it's inspiring, and don't try to deny it." I felt no emotional connection to these characters. They were just haphazardly moving through the picture with little to no direction being put into the scenes they were in. I was told prior to going to this movie that it was suppose to be a comedy, but I never really laughed during this movie. There were a couple of jokes, but nothing out of the ordinary. And I couldn't help but wonder why I was suppose to find this subject matter funny to begin with. Two old men are dying. Yes, very funny.The screenplay is equally half-baked. I think that there was virtually no effort put into this picture. The actors showed effort, sure. But the director, screenwriter, and even editor all seemed to not really care how the scenes were put together. Again, they were just overly reliant on the subject matter to sell the film.The only part of the movie that really stuck out to me as being genuine was toward the end, concerning the joke about Nicholson's coffee and they are able to cross "Laugh until you cry" off their bucket list. Everything else just seemed to revolve around visiting places, which is nice, but it's not like they really did anything when they got there. There was just so little about this movie that seemed genuine. Everything had to be forced or fabricated. I am rarely so displeased with a motion picture. But my biggest problem with The Bucket List is how forgettable it was. I saw this in theatres when it came out. For a couple months after that, there was some talk about the picture. But all of that died down very quickly and it wasn't really brought up anymore after that, and I even completely forgot about it. I think that because there was so much Hollywood bullshit thrown at the audience from this picture that it ends up leaving no real lasting impact on them. It's nothing new, really. The message is just "live life to the fullest before you die," which can be found in pretty much every other movie made before this one, but was never quite as literal as here. Clichéd, half-a**ed, forgettable, and completely unmoving, this is not a movie I recommend for anyone looking for any kind deep meaning from a movie.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Funny, Sad and Something to Think about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie, had me laugh, be sad, but most of all something to think about, all rolled into one.Howard and Carter get the news that everyone dreads to hear; Their mortality. Carter starts writing up a bucket list of things to do before he "kicks the bucket". Howard convinces Carter to do it and they both try doing these things right now, before they die and leave the hospital to do it.I liked the ending because it was very touching and it gave you a laugh as well. The best part about is, when you laugh, it doesn't totally eclipse the feeling of the scene; You still feel sad, but you feel like it's okay to laugh as wellThe beauty thing about this movie is, it gives you something to think about. Even though you may receive that horrible news, you should try and live whatever time you have left, to the fullest, do the things you want to do before you die and find joy in your life.My thoughts after the movie is, why wait until we receive that news? Why not write up your "Bucket List" and do those things now while you have your health. There's always the possibility in life you may die tomorrow and not get the chance to do it.THIs is a great movie and to have in your DVD library is a must.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful film about two terminally ill men in the same hospital room. They decide to go out of this life in great fashion. Sky diving and other exciting things are on their agenda.The film succeeds due to the tremendous bonding of Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson. Though the latter has been alienated from his daughter, Freeman comes from a loving family with tremendous support. This shall eventually carry over to Nicholson.Rob Reiner has directed a beauty of a film. You laugh and you want to cry at the same time. It would take a catastrophic illness such as cancer to bond two men with totally different values and life styles together.Though illness is always depressing, it is licked in this film.</fullReview>

Sean Hayes as Nicholson's aide who accompanies the 2 of them on this trip.The cinematography is excellent, as well as all the other production elements.Due to so many different scenes &amp; locations, the 97 minute running time, seems a bit long,Why this film was shafted for any awards is beyond me.It deserved many nominations.Due to the adult nature of the story,this movie is not for youngsters.There are no action sequences,no nudity &amp; few instances of foul language. This is an entertaining film for adults, who can understand this is a movie &amp; not real life,.I for one was completely entertained &amp; that is why I go to see films.Ratings: **** (out of 4) 97 points (out of 100) IMDb 10 (out of 1)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before this movie, only one other movie has made me cry, and that was Big Fish. I think what made that happen was the idea that Albert Finney's character in Big Fish found fulfilment in his son's acceptance of his ways and in the embracing of the characters in whose lives Edward (I think that was the character's name?) had made such a profound impact. In the same way, here that these two men found fulfilment in each other touched me profoundly. The film is in its own way so very simple. Nothing spectacular happens, and in a way nothing needs to. As you can predict, it doesn't take a genius to gather from the plot that Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman (in not quite career-summing-up breakout performances, but more than adequate and moving turns here) die, and it's in the simple yet deep things that make their life worthy, and enables them to "find their joy" before they finally succumb to their inevitable deaths. In the quest to complete their Bucket List, they seek, in a way that's only fantasy for others, to wholly and completely tie up their loose end before they kick the bucket, and the sheer closeness they achieve through the sharing of their combined destinies and rejoicing in both their similarities and differences. I found Morgan Freeman's character was a little more fleshed out, in that he got given more nuances to work with, but Jack Nicholson was on form in the same vein of more mature movies he finds himself excelling in. In all, a good film, certainly worth a watch and Morgan Freeman, Jack Nicholson, and the scriptwriter have here a movie of which to be proud, and that will mean a lot to many people.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is essentially a romantic comedy, although with an unusual shift. The comedy is about coming to terms with death. The romantic relationship is between two men who just learned they will die within six months. There is nothing sexual between them, the relationship advances by the usual dynamic of friendship, but romance is created by the immediate realization that both of their lives will end very soon. Everything becomes relative, that is where the comedy comes in. The script requires strong suspension of disbelief, but it comes about effortlessly because the two leads act so well. This is a film where one can see the difference between outstanding and just good actors. Body talk, innuendo, precision timing of delivery, all create a bubble which simply does not burst. The supporting role of Sean Hayes as personal assistant is also done well, he manages a lot of one-liners without coming out ridiculous. The only two lapses which bothered me are the casting (or make-up) of Beverly Todd, who simply does not look old enough for the role she plays (although she is, in real life!), and a speech by Jack Nicholson near the end which is delivered in a little too high a pitch. Todd's role, by the way, is very difficult, being such an unrelenting cliché that it is almost a cruelty to the actress. But that is a comment on the script, she pulls it off as well as can be.</fullReview>

Everything is entertaining, also due to Morgan Freeman's and Jack Nicholson's class and capacity to display emotions. Overall it's convincing, despite not being that original and for not being a tear jerker story; of course many moments are moving and touching but never honeyed and trite.

		<shortDescription>The two performances make it worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"There was a survey once, a thousand people asked, 'If they could know in advance, would they want to know the exact day of their death?'?96% said no." This is the core base of this film as the two main characters find themselves pushed into the other 4%.These two characters are billionaire tycoon Edward Cole (played by Jack Nicholson) and car mechanic Carter Chambers (played by Morgan Freeman) that are both terminally ill with cancer, have both been given less than a year to live, and find themselves sharing the same hospital room. During the weeks they spend at the cancer ward, Carter makes a "bucket list" for fun, but Edward takes it more seriously and wants to start checking things off. So, after a fight with his wife Carter and Edward embark on a luxurious tour of all the finest locations in the world?the Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the Himalayas, the Mediterranean, a Safari, etc.?as well as crazy stunts like: sky diving, racing sports cars, and even getting a tattoo.This is one of those warm, cozy films that you can use for pure entertainment, and it works well. The script is horrible but you do not notice it as much since the performances from the two leads more than make up for it. There are plenty of "how could?" (especially the fact that a billionaire would share a common hospital room in the first place) but to enjoy this film you have to take everything as it is presented.The once thing that did upset me was the portrayal of Carter's wife as the nagging wife who only naturally would be devastated finding out your husband is leaving on a world tour just after hearing the news that he will only be around for about a year longer.Still, this is one of those films that despite the poor production quality (it is really poor when the pyramids look like fake back-drops in our CGI-obsessed world) the performances by two of Hollywood's most veteran actors (both Oscar winners) make The Bucket List something you might want to add to your list of movies seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reiner's The Bucket List is a treat for Nicholson and Freeman fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My best friend and I went to see The Bucket List on our day off from work (actually, this friend of mine is unemployed right now) and we both enjoyed it. What a joy seeing two veteran Oscar-winning pros, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, on screen together! Their characters, Ed Cole and Carter Chambers, are two middle-aged men who suffer cancer at approximately the same time and bond sharing a hospital room (at the building Cole owns). The movie picks up when they see the world together. Also loved Sean Hayes as Nicholson's assistant Thomas (actually Matthew but Jack's character thinks that's too biblical) and Beverly Todd as Freeman's wife, Virginia. Didn't recognize Rob Morrow as the doctor which is ironic since I watched him for years on "Northern Exposure"! Corny and maybe contrived in spots but for the most part this was a heartfelt and occasionally humorous movie. So on that note, I recommend Rob Reiner's The Bucket List. P.S. Alfonso Freeman, Morgan's son, plays his son here. And the grandson of legendary director Frank Capra, Frank Capra III, is a co-producer and first assistant director here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much for me to handle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My mom and sister saw The Bucket List a couple days ago and told me that it was wonderful. So tonite my boyfriend and I decided to go ahead and see it, and I'm still in tears. The Bucket List unfortunately hit home so hard for me and I'm surprised at my mom and sister, since we have had quite a few family members that lost their battles with cancer. The Bucket List while is semi-uplifting, it just was almost torture. We have these two characters who we know are probably going to die and they're so lovable, we're setting us up for a painful story. I think that's the reason why, besides that it brought back so many painful memories, that I didn't really like this story. These two characters got to do so much that many would do anything to do, and I'm not sure how to take that.Edward Cole has it all he could possibly want in life, he has tons and tons of money, lots of beautiful women, and the world at his feet. But all that changes when he is diagnosed with cancer, he is roomed with another cancer patient, Carter Chambers. They are both told that they are lucky if they have a year to live, so they make a "bucket list", things they would like to do before they die and Edward makes it so. They travel the world, skydive, race cars, you name it. But they end up with something more powerful, a loving friendship that will last eternally.The Bucket List is incredibly made, I mean it's Rob Reiner, I will always give Rob the true credit he deserves. Including these amazing A-list actors, Jack Nicolson and Morgan Freeman who were just beautiful together. The movie has these incredibly gorgeous scenes as Carter and Edward are traveling the world, just amazing. But the film just had hit such a hard spot for me I think. It was a bit much to handle, same with my boyfriend who hasn't lost anyone to cancer, so while this was a charming movie about death and living life to it's fullest, we loose the characters that we want to live so much. The Bucket List is more for the older crowd I think, because it's a bit to handle for the younger crowd, I don't mean that as insulting, it's just too much and too painful to think about.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humorous Performances Help Lazy Direction &amp; Script.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two men have cancer. One is a family man working as a mechanic, the other is a wealthy grouch divorced at least 3 times. While getting to know each other they develop a Bucket List, a list of things to do before you kick the bucket. They decide, instead of having people feel sorry for them, they will do all the exciting things they want to.On paper "The Bucket List" is a winning combination. It has two of today's most respected actors, a heart-warming story with some humour and a director with some decent films under his belt. In reality, the film is a ploy to try and tug on heart strings. Yet it works in a weird way because of the two leading men. Nicholson and Freeman, both fine actors seemed at ease with each other and made the ride a little bit more pleasant. If it weren't for these two actors the film would not have worked at all.The film is lazy. It needed a way to get these two characters in one room together and threw in some dialogue to make it happen. Reiner has had many projects, yet many productions values here were poor. Continuity errors take the viewer out of the film experience, obvious green screens distract the eye and a hyped up, but lackluster bucket list doesn't really make the film what it wanted to be. What you see them do in the trailer, is basically what they do in the film, so other then the performances from two Oscar winning actors, these film has very little going for it.I don't know if the screenplay was lazy, or if it were Reiner himself, but one scene that could have been emotionally charged and could have possibly helped Nicholson receive yet another nomination is dumbed down to nearly nothing. It's as if Reiner thought that Nicholson couldn't hold the scene together, so he had to shift his way around it. It doesn't work well at all and leads to bland editing. Nicholson is good enough to hold his own and just when you think your about to get something good, Reiner takes it away by showing us something else.With what Freeman and Nicholson do have, they do very well with. They play off each other very well, which is awkward at first considering the kind of character Nicholson is playing. Sure we get a bit of him not wanting to be in a room with someone else, but then it seems like the next day they're friends. No hostility between these two before they decide to embark on this list? Nicholson was meant to play this character, sometimes a bit over the top, yet with a restrained tone. He hits every mark he needs to and Freeman does as well. Freeman is the usual cool headed individual and nothing really changes here, but seeing them laugh till they cry is certainly a joy.Yes this film has narration and yes it is from the one and only Freeman. It seems like it is mandatory for him to narrate films now, as he is popping up everywhere. Was this a last minute thing to try and add some kind of level to the screenplay that wasn't there before? Actors can only do so much, the screenplay has to be strong in the first place and this is not really the case.Like many critics have been saying the performances are great but the film isn't. I liked the performances enough to give the film a decent rating and a scene here and there were heartfelt, but overall the film doesn't really deliver. Maybe expectations were too high because of the people involved, but there was definitely something missing from this film. A spark that would have the audience drawn to it, it never happens. We are meant to have fun with these characters, Nicholson and Freeman try to bring the audience on the trip with them, but we end up just watching them have all the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anticipating Mortality in a Pile of Clichés Driven by a Couple of Predictable Star Turns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film master Akira Kurosawa made one of his most quietly powerful films in 1952's "Ikiru" about a government paper-pusher who learns he has six months to live and takes stock of all the things he has not done with his life. By comparison, Rob Reiner's output as a director has been less than stellar for well over a decade (consider "Alex and Emma" and "Rumor Has It?"). This time, he appears to be going for a partial remake of "Ikiru" times two with this lugubrious, feel-good 2007 dramedy with components of "Terms of Endearment" and "Grumpy Old Men" thrown in for good measure. The chief problem is that Justin Zackham's debut big-screen screenplay is predicated on so many live-before-dying clichés that the entire venture doesn't feel honest despite the star presence of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Zackham's everything-but-the-kitchen-sink approach is much too manipulative to be affecting, and the roles he provides the two veteran actors don't allow them to leverage their talents to build believable characters. Can you tell I didn't like the movie much?The plot concerns itself with pompous health-care billionaire Edward Cole, who finds himself in his own hospital sharing a room with trivia-obsessed mechanic Carter Chambers. Ironically, Edward is the one who insists upon two patients to each room to cut overhead costs. Both are terminal cases there to receive cancer treatments with little if any chance of survival. Unsurprisingly, they enact their own version of "The Odd Couple" until they bond over a list Carter is compiling of little things he wants to do before he does. Edward naturally has more grandiose ideas of what his "bucket list" would be, and off they go on a series of predictably drawn adventures like skydiving, race-car driving and traveling to exotic places around the world. I find the travel sequences particularly amusing since it's obvious the actors were edited into travelogue footage. Deep-seeded regrets come to the surface on their journey - Edward's estrangement from his daughter and Carter's look back on an academic life unfulfilled and a marriage that has grown stale. There's no point in describing anything further since the whole point of the film is dealing with the inevitable.As Edward, Nicholson comes across as oddly schizophrenic. The actor's typically excessive moments are followed by surprisingly understated ones, and as a whole, his performance never connects the dots. Freeman fares marginally better as Carter, but his work here feels more like retread. Again, he provides the stoic voice-over and wizened wisdom he has been providing since "The Shawshank Redemption". And why cast an actor as exuberantly animated as Sean Hayes (the indefatigable Jack on "Will and Grace" for eight seasons) in such an impassive role as Edward's officious factotum Thomas? He is so uncharacteristically restrained and non-committal in the role that the coda has little emotional impact. Relegated even further to the sidelines are Beverly Todd as Carter's wife, Rob Morrow as Edward's doctor, and in a silly bit part, Rowena King as a chic woman drawn to Carter in a bar. I'm not surprised that the 2008 DVD is bereft of significant extras - no commentary track, no making-of featurette, just a five-minute short, "Writing a Bucket List" with Zackham explaining the genesis of the movie's concept, plus a disposable John Mayer video for the closing credits song, "Say", which is, by the way, a typical John Meyer song. I suggest renting "Ikiru" instead.</fullReview>

Or about 'good' black and 'enlightened' white American dream.Nothing profound about health care, illness, the 'human plight' or anything else for that matter. Also, annoyingly, the standard phrase from Freeman about the made up 95% percent believing in some god and the other 5% not knowing. And of course this discussion ends there. Nicholson loosing on points.A bucket full of cliché's. So it gets really boring, really fast.Don't need to see all of it, to conclude it's a couple of aging former top actors, cashing in without a script to speak of.You'll be hearing about how they had lots of laughs and how reality mimics life mimicking movies. And how they 'played off each other' and such platitudes. But don't get fooled.That's not what a good movie is about.So, no. It's not a good movie. No recommendations here.

		<fullReview>This film is about bucket list as the title. What you want to do before you die on the bucket list. Two cancer patients make a list together and start a journey to achieve the list.First of all, the casting is very wonderful. Two patients look completely different. One is white, rich and single and the other is black, poor and household. Something common is just they're both cancer patients. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman act fascinatingly.This film is a chance to think about death deeply. To make a bucket list, we should accept death. In the film, they can't accept it first, but after do that, they see themselves as they and they know what they want and what they want to do. They fill the list gradually and this means they will die soon. It sounds sad, but they seem happy because their dreams come true. I thought it's very nice. And my favorite scene is that Edward says it's not late to dreams come true. In fact, it is right in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even The Funnier Moments Couldn't Mask The Sentimentality Behind It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years ago as a youth, I was always eagerly enthusiastic about Rob Reiner's next movie project. But those expectations have faded out by the turn of the century. What was it that ingredient that made his movies so uplifting? What signifies Rob Reiner's trademark in direction was his uncanny way of taking a relatively sad or depressing story and they were very layered in detail and he took those stories to just progressively add humour or other distractions to cover up the hidden sadness behind the films he directed. Movies like "Stand By Me" and "The Princess Bride" were films of that magnitude that worked to great effect. Even "The Story of Us" had that same fondness as well. When it came to us procuring guilt-free tearful film, we can always count on Reiner to deliver. Manipulative, for sure, but effective for good storytelling.After watching the 2007 film "The Bucket List", I felt like I was being raided. Like the 2002 film "Alex and Emma", "The Bucket List" plods around the muddled plot scenarios we can think of and doctors it up on odious humour to get through the melancholy story. Once again we are treated for the umpteenth time to listen to another sappy narrative from Morgan Freeman who seems more in love with his voice than life itself and the elevator music in the background seems repetitive to the point of being grating. It's still a good watch and that it's still very fun to enjoy though very painfully uncomfortable in a lot of scenes. Maybe the feeling of watching two men who are on the brink of entering the Pearly Gates and the struggles they're facing can be a wake up call that humans may live a long life but we're not programmed to live forever. The story centers around to aging old men, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) who both have terminal cancer and realize that their days are numbered. Mr. Cole is a strict, but successful businessman who runs the hospital where was admitted to. One of his strict policies was "two beds to a room, no exceptions." When it's revealed he has brain cancer he is placed in the same room with another aging cancer-struck patient, Carter Chambers (Freeman), a mechanic which the smoke inhalation exposure from his job got to his lungs. Carter seems adept in trivia because in his youth he had aspirations of becoming a history professor, but setbacks held him back from achieving his goals. When the doctors tell them they only have months to live, the geriatrics decide to embark on an adventure of doing certain activities before they die when Carter starts scribbling a list on a paper (a "Bucket List") and Edward eagerly goes along with the idea of fulfilling the written activities before they're number comes up.I was almost expecting Reiner to take the route of Edward and Carter's hospital stays and their illnesses and to purify them by making them less heartbreaking than it really should. I mean it looks awfully painful to watch a man go through all kinds of tests and shaving his head bald as he goes through chemotherapy and having fluids stored in him to keep him alive. Edward gets better hospitality than Carter because he doesn't need to depend on HMO. At least Reiner doesn't go in the same direction like Terry Gilliam and turn the hospital into a fantasy world because Reiner doesn't like the idea of glorifying aging and dying by making it light in content and to make it the painful truth. The film starts to go off kilter once Reiner decides to let these gentlemen go globe-hopping. At first the script starts manifesting into dramatic speeches and then breaks into a series of confessions, revelations and inner-demons from the both of them. Though the script doesn't call for long-term speeches, the physical humour like auto racing and skydiving feels forced and not well structured. The real manipulative scene where we're forced to shed a tear happens outside of Cole's estranged daughter's house as he struggles to reconcile with her. And then our claustrophobic audience gets treated to an over- baked eulogy to which the voice is presumably heard posthumously from Carter's inner-thoughts. Over the years, Reiner has failed to balance light-humour that's essential to rather melancholy stories which was how he methodically directed his films over two decades. Sure the film may appease to the older adult community, like when a teenage boy wants to see their favourite superhero film or a teenage girl for a teen comedy. Different strokes for different folks. If Reiner wants to rejuvenate from his earlier works, he must equally try to mask the sentimental factors with humour much better. But until that time comes again, all I can say is when did he start to lose his style?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film Belongs On Everyone's Bucket List.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bucket List (2007): Dir: Rob Reiner / Cast: Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman, Sean Hayes, Beverly Todd, Rob Morrow: Endearing yet predictable film about making the most out of life. It stars Jack Nicholson as Edward Cole who owns a hospital yet ends up staying there in a room with Carter Chambers, played by Morgan Freeman. When they have only six months to live, they create a list of things they wish to accomplish before they kick the bucket. Structure is predictable but director Rob Reiner's films often dictate the growing relationship between people. He previously made This is Spinal Tap and Rumor Has It. Nicholson and Freeman are a tremendous pairing and the strongest element. It becomes apparent that Cole has distanced himself from his family, particularly his daughter. Freeman rejoices in a healthy marriage and boyishly embraces this journey. Supporting cast are underwritten. Sean Hayes plays Nicholson's right hand man who handles his demands. The role is fairly standard but surprisingly sincere once the ending hits. Beverly Todd plays Freeman's wife who objects to his travels with Cole. More of her might have served better and for the relationship aspect. Outside the leads, other roles tend to vary from standard to boring. Theme addresses our limited life span and the need to connect with others before we kick the bucket. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Greetings again from the darkness. Yes, this can be viewed as Hollywood formula with mass appeal and loads of stereotypes and clichés. On the other hand, it can be taken as a very accessible commentary on friendship, companionship and finding the joy in life. I prefer the latter. Either way, it does require a certain suspension of reality. Just ask Roger Ebert, who has made it his personal mission to bash the film.Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are both in prime form, and after a string of weak films, director Rob Reiner does a masterful job of keeping Nicholson from going over the top and from having Freeman kill us with sweetness. Even more impressive is the pacing of the early hospital scenes ... nothing is forced, no line of dialogue or shot seems hurried. This is two patients coming to grips with their situation. While the worldly travels are impressive, my favorite parts of the film are the scenes between the two beds in the same room.On the downside, will someone please tell Hollywood that Morgan Freeman in the cast does not mandate a blasted voice-over from the man? We know he has a great voice, but if the narration adds nothing to the story, please just let the film do its thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two men. One is a rich man. The other is not. They are in the room in the hospital. Both of them are told they don't have much time left. They made a list which shows about things they want to do before their death. They leave the hospital and they travel and do many things all over the world freely. They become essential for each other. But one day, they have a quarrel and they break up. But they meet again. The man dies before the rich man. At his funeral, the rich man makes a speech, which shows his love to the other man. In the last scene, the rich man's secretary goes to the top of the mountain to put two cans. The cans are two men's cans favorite foods. And he erases a sentence of the list, to see the best scenery together. I'm impressed to see this movie. It makes me feel that I should have a goal if I want to have a good time. In this movie, they do many things and they seem to be happy. At the last scene, the high snowing mountain appeared suddenly. There is not any conversation but I can see the last scene is meaningful and see what it means. This movie is a very impressing but interesting movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two screen icons doing what they do best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Smooth direction and the powerful on screen charisma generated by its two stars makes 2007's The Bucket List a better film than it deserves to be.The film stars Oscar winners Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman as Edward and Carter, respectively, two terminally ill men who meet in the hospital and actually leave the hospital in order to do all those things that are on Carter's bucket list, a list of everything that Carter wants to do before he dies.The story then follows these two polar opposites as they decide to, among other things, jump out of an airplane, visit the pyramids, and drive high-powered race cars, but the story is so not the thing here...the thing here is the 1000-megawatt performances by Nicholson and Freeman which electrify the screen, under the skillful direction of Rob Reiner, who offers detailed direction where it is needed and allows these actors to do what they do best when it is not...command the screen and carrying a rather pedestrian story to a more entertaining level than Justin Zackham's screenplay offers. There are moments throughout, mostly involving Nicholson, that I suspect were not scripted and Reiner and Freeman just got out of the master's way.Nicholson and Freeman are magical here, providing a perfect balance of laughter, tears, and pathos. There is one particularly moving scene near the film's climax where Edward and Carter share a big laugh and we see Carter cross "Laugh till I cry" off his list. I was deeply moved by the fact that this man had lived his entire life without laughing until he cried.Mention should be made of an extremely effective supporting performance from Beverly Todd as Carter's devoted wife, who accuses Edward of stealing her husband and wants her husband to face his illness in a more realistic manner. Todd's character has a lot of unsympathetic moments in the film, but Todd invests completely in the character and makes the viewer understand her.The film is beautifully photographed and Reiner's directorial hand is solid, but it is the spectacular teaming of these two acting legends that make this film solid entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film has a good premise of two cancer patients, one a billionaire, one a car mechanic who are both dying of cancer.This excellent foundation runs off in many unbelievable directions. First being billionaire Jack with no family, or girlfriends but one solitary PA man. The sight of Jack trying to eat a lonely TV dinner really stretches the credibility meter.But there's more shocks to come in the way of Jack and Morgan hooking up and skydiving and car racing etc., etc. These men have just survived chemo and are dying and look wonderful in their activity suits for old cancer-ridden geezers.And they travel without medical help (catheters, donchaknow) which Jack can certainly afford.Morgan, as always, is a perfect male of our species. Intelligent, lovely wife, perfect kids but hell, he takes off with new BFF nasty Jack without a backward glance at such blissful domesticity.This could have been a great movie with a script of any depth. But there's not an inch to be had.There's emotional manipulation a-plenty and our boys sitting on top of a pyramid (yeah, that's allowed) and an attempted solicitation by a hooker on Good Man Morgan.But it just doesn't gel on any level. Down to the last scene. The one note wife is pitiful - negotiating with Jack to get her husband back. Says a lot about the supposed "great marriage".I truly don't know why it was so popular as just none of it rings true.A sad 3 out of 10. But this stuff sells. Big.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson &amp; Freeman are gold together!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those special movies that needed a certain "seasoning" to push it over the "Good movie" hump and jettison it into the "Wow!" stratosphere. That seasoning came in the form of two fearless, older actors willing to show themselves in less-than-glamorous roles - Jack Nicholson &amp; Morgan Freeman. It takes a gifted director to keep these ultra-egos in check and move two screen legends along the path of certain death without being heavy-handed or melodramatic. Rob Reiner is that master. What a tour-de-force for this group. Buoyed by an amazingly insightful, original script by Justin Zackham, the laughs and tears flow freely and unashamedly. This is how quality movies should be made.Basic comedy/drama plot line: Two aging baby-boomers from completely opposite backgrounds are thrown together in a hospital room where they have no choice but to get to know one another. What starts as a series of polite (and not-so-polite in Nicholson's case) nods and acknowledgments of each roommates' quirks and faults, because of their dire circumstances, they slowly become friends. Soon they realize how very close they have become. MINOR SPOILER ALERT: When both are given the jarring news of impending death, they create a mythical "bucket list" of things they wished they could have accomplished before they kick the bucket. Using Nicholson's character's seemingly endless supply of resources, they create a reality by zooming off in search of life experiences we all could wish for before it is too late. What they don't expect is the emotional journey they are actually embarking upon until they are well into their adventure.This is one of those movies that should be watched at different stages of your life. You will get something out of it at every viewing. As one of the characters states in the story when he realizes his list has changed from when he was a college student: "Those were a young man's dreams. They are different now." Same can be said for viewings of this stellar piece of movie magic. Being young and carefree will create one list. Having a family will change that list dramatically. As you age and have more life experience, you will change your list yet again. It is all covered so beautifully in this story.The behind-the-scenes segment on the DVD where they interview the writer, Justin Zackham, about the genesis of this story, as well as the thoughts and process of expanding the storyline, only adds to this marvelous movie. It will open your eyes to creating your own "bucket list". You don't have to be dying to understand how precious life and it's full experience can be until you start experiencing new and exciting adventures you never knew were possible.I can't recommend this movie highly enough for every age. Youth may see this is an "old man's movie" which is a shame and completely wrong. This is a movie about achieving experiences (not THINGS) that create everlasting memories not only for this lifetime but for eternity. About friendships that start as nothing and can blossom into genuine brotherhood. And about how we can all strive for greatness no matter who you are or what your circumstances in life. There is always time - until there isn't.Please watch this movie every few years. It will change your outlook on life. 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two terminally ill men, Edward played by Jack Nicholson and Carter played by Morgan Freeman escape from a cancer ward and head off on a road trip with a wish list of to-dos before they die. The film received mixed reactions from critics with the majority agreeing that: "Not even the earnest performances of the two leads can rescue The Bucket List from its schmaltzy script" Roger Ebert said that The Bucket List "...thinks dying of cancer is a laugh riot followed by a dime-store epiphany." But I think it is a bitter sweet film of roller coaster emotions that affects the viewer in one way or another. I feel that it is a heart-warming film about friendship involving two strong performances from the lead characters.</fullReview>

One site gave it one star out of a possible four. If you're under "a certain age" you probably won't like this movie because it's difficult to understand how it feels to face your own mortality whether it be from illness or age. However, if you are of that "certain age" it will resonate in ways only more mature people can comprehend. The ways these two men check off their bucket list items go from funny to creative to sweet and tender. How Jack Nicholson's character fulfills his "kiss the most beautiful girl in the world" objective is surprising and endearing. Two great actors, a meaningful and well written script, a lovely movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A funny, heartwarming, and occasionally tear-jerking comedy-drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar-nominated director Rob Reiner (The Princess Bride, When Harry Met Sally, A Few Good Men, The American President), and Oscar winning actors Jack Nicholson (One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Terms of Endearment, As Good as it Gets) and Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy, The Shawshank Redemption, Million Dollar Baby) bring you a wonderful and heartwarming movie in 2007's "The Bucket List". It involves two men, Edward Cole (Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Freeman) crossing paths in the hospital after both learning that they have cancer. Not too long into the movie, Edward sees Carter working on a piece of paper, the titular "Bucket List", and he suggests that they break out of the hospital and do every great thing they can before they "kick the bucket". I can't really say much more about it without spoiling it, but I will tell you that after that it involves a lot of traveling all over the world. This is one film that the critics don't seem to understand. If you look at it by itself, it really is a nice little movie. The wonderful chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman alone is worth a look. Those two guys should really be in more movies together; this was their first. It was a considerable hit at the box office when it opened ($175 million worldwide against a $45 million budget), mainly due to the fact that paying audiences loved what they saw. I first saw the movie on HBO in December of 2009 and loved every minute of it; I've since watched it about 10 or 15 more times and recently bought it on DVD. BTW, most of the people who saw the movie in theaters were 35 years old or older, and a majority of them were women. I'm a 21-year-old man but I love the movie just the same. Do yourselves a favor and watch this movie sometime. I promise you if you look at it the right way, you'll be surprised at how great it is.My final grade: 90 out of 100 (A-)</fullReview>

Lo and behold he's forced to stay with working class mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) when he's diagnosed with cancer.Nicholson is playing to his strengths as the cavalier commanding boss. Freeman plays the sweet workingman with the brains of a professor. They bond over their difficult cancer treatments. When Cole is given 6 months, the pair escape to do their bucket lists.The veteran actors bring a history of living to these roles. Rob Reiner is able to wring out a couple of great performances from these geezers. They have great chemistry together. He's ying to his yang. The pontificating can get a little long winded, and the stories can be too sentimental. You got to go with it and accept the melodrama.</fullReview>

All in all, anyone who enjoys drama, a settling story, and a way to have a nice time. By all means, check it out.And one more item of note, is that it can be praised, for its own original ideas.

		<fullReview>Death is always an interesting theme. How everybody gets ready for it, how they do funerals, how they feel about it. This movie shows two people who just have few months left. What do you do when you hear this? Well, usually people stay with their family. But these guys decide differently.The theme of #yolo. Yes, yolo is more used by swaggy teenagers, but the true meaning of yolo is so much deeper. It's like "carpe diem" - seize the day, because it is not coming back. You only live once - so take most that you can with the thought that you want to reach old age and go into preparation for death with the knowledge that you did everyhing you wanted to do in life. And the main characters see that they cannot die peacefully - so much left undone.Another important topic - family. One of the characters has family visitors every day, the other just has an assistant. Family is support and that is what Edward is looking for. He even starts taking care of Carter himself. Having no one except his assistant he starts caring for a total stranger. Carter on the other hand is trying to see what is it like to live without the family for the first time.All in all, I really enjoyed watching this movie as the portrayal of how to do everything you ever wanted to do in your life because of looming death around the corner makes you think. Maybe it's high time to cross something out of our lists before it's to late and without rushing.</fullReview>

Each of them with their distinctive character.Morgan Freeman is known to be wise. The frequent times he has been narrating documentary films is one of the proofs. In the other hand, Jack Nicholson is known to be notorious, bad, evil, naughty. This film crosses them both. And that how the movie works.It blends these two both character in a plot and see how it comes out. It comes out perfect. And emotional. The perfect blend, just like the Coffee Luwak that this film has been bragging about.As they cross each things in this list, the movie gets better and better. Like I said earlier, you can't beet the wise-ness in this film because it is brought to you by that much seniority.An additional note to the film. As I lose control to my emotions to the end of the film, I get smacked down by John Mayer's song "Say What You Need to Say".

		<fullReview>The thing is, not every great film has to be groundbreaking or revolutionary. Sometimes it's perfectly okay to take a simple idea, a simple concept, and to just tell a good story. Nothing else needed. And that's this movie. On the paper it looks kind of bland, even silly. Two old guys are about to die from cancer that just happens to be symptomless and so they decide to journey the world and enjoy its sights. Kind of boring, isn't it, and you can pretty much tell how the movie will end just by watching its first fifteen minutes. But when you hire two of the best actors of our era, give them some really solid dialogues, add in very nice-looking scenery and focus on the relationship that these two develop between themselves... and you have an amazing film in your hands.Let's be clear here, though. This movie works because of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. The rest of the film is pretty good as well, but if this movie had had any other two actors, it would have failed so hard. This movie needed these two. It needed their charisma, their versatility, their ability to fill the conversation with subtle meanings, their sheer presence. And it got what it needed. The film is nothing more than these two filling the screen, having conversations and scenes with one another. And it doesn't need to be anything else. That's enough. This is exactly what the film makers try to do, and often fail, when they hire two powerhouse actors into a single film.That being said, I must admit that there's a certain aspect of guilty pleasure for me in this film. I love it, I absolutely love it, but I can also recognize that the plot is nothing special. I like to watch this film. The eulogy by Jack Nicholson is one of the most touching scenes I've ever witnessed in cinema, and it's that effective partly because the film has allowed us to form a connection to the character that they eulogy is for, but it's still the slightest bit corny - although in a good way.Still, I highly recommend this film. It's charming, thought-provoking, emotional, at times tear-jerkingly funny and, above all else, entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming, Inspiring Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bucket List is a very good, touching film filled with some emotional moments. This movie clearly has a message for the audience. Basically, the message says that we people should live our lives to the fullest and I wholeheartedly agree.This film is about two men whom are both terminally ill. They decide to head out and do things they have never done in their lives before they kicked the bucket.The acting is what made this movie so good. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson both had long careers where they each made outstanding movies. This film is definitely not their best, but it sure is watchable. They both have a certain charisma that the audience will enjoy.Overall, this is a heartwarming, inspirational film. Led by strong performances, this movie will not leave you in a lifetime. I rate this film 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sweet and Emotional, Character Driven Story,</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bucket List is a great movie with a well written storyline and a fantastic cast. It is a very character driven storyline that relies on good performances and chemistry from its two leads, and you couldn't have gotten any better than Morgan Freeeman and Jack Nicholson, you can tell that the two of them are real life friends and their on screen chemistry is outstanding. The movies main problem is that it simply isn't emotional enough, there are of course many sweet and heartwarming scenes, but I actually feel it needed more, it should have developed these characters more and given us more sympathy for them, so that the thought of them dying eventually becomes a dreadful thing, and once it happens we are driven to tears. With it's two leads and emotional story this easily could have been an Oscar contender, but the fact that the story was a bit too rushed (being only 90 minutes long) and also the fact that there is a lot of comic relief, took it away from any big awards. It's certainly not perfect, but the Bucket List is a sweet and well acted film that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good drama. Two men that only have a short time left to live head off on a trip to complete all the things they want to do before they pass away. Best Performance: Jack Nicholson Worst Performance: Sean Hayes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more Complex Than You would Expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I presumed the Bucket List would be about a couple of old buzzards doing some wild and crazy things before they croak.It is, but only for a small part of the movie.There are two characters played by Jack Nicholson (Edward) and Morgan Freeman (Carter), perfectly cast. Surely the movie was written for them. Both are unusually complex characters. Both show many sides to themselves and both profoundly change over the span of the movie.One way of looking at the movie is the Scrooge-like transformation of Edward, from the hard-bitten, materialistic, crass bastard into a caring human being, but that grossly overly simplifies what actually happens.There is the strange jealousy triangle of Edward and Carter's wife fighting for Carter's attention. Edward is lonely, and has finally found a friend he will not let go of. He woos him with extravagant spending.The ending is far too sugary. It ruined the effect of the delightfully frank, honest and unsentimental dialogue of most of the movie.There is also a scene where Edward (the atheist) debates Carter (the Christian). Edward does an utterly inept defence of his view. The scene was annoyingly patronising, as if Edward were some naive child being instructed by the wise mellow Carter. Carter's dialogue is blithering nonsense, but Edward, uncharacteristically, does not call him on any of it. I felt manipulated.The special effects in the skydiving scene did not work for me. They looked to me like paper cutout heads glued onto the falling bodies. However, the special effects and the acting to portray cancer, brain surgery and chemotherapy were spot on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bucket List</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before viewing any film, I always like to read a little about the basic plot of the film. When I read the plot of 'The Bucket List', I was not very impressed ? it seemed to be a boring unrealistic drama about the last moments of two people on earth. The plot seemed to be the epitome of sentimentality and glycerin in the eyes. However, trusting in the acting capabilities of Freeman and Nicholson, I sat down, albeit a little reluctantly, to watch.The Bucket List put all my fears to rest - it manages to produce a perfect blend of humour and emotion, of merriment and sorrow. Most of all, The Bucket List sends out a very important message, "that a sum of person's life is measured by the joy he brings in the lives of others." The plot of The Bucket List is as follows: Edward Perriman Cole and Carter Chambers are two terminally-ill patients of very different temperaments and financial backgrounds. Edward is a businessman who owns a chain of hospitals, while Carter is a car mechanic. They encounter each other for the first time in a cancer- ward in one of Edward's own hospitals. Both are diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and are given 6 months to a year to live. However, instead of being 'smothered with pity and grief' during their last days on earth, they instead decide to go out with 'all guns blazing'. They compose a 'bucket list' ? a list of things to be done before one 'kicks the bucket'. Edward Cole and Carter Chambers set out ... I won't spoil it. Apart from the thrill and adventure, it is a story of friendship between two complete strangers, and how they brought joy into each other's last moments on the earth. Written by Justin Zackham, the plot is very well constructed, and Human emotions and feelings are portrayed fabulously. The entire plot meshes together perfectly, and there are no unnecessary scenes.The greatest plus point in this film is the performance of the two lead actors, I believe. What we realize is that in Hollywood, a film can be extremely successful and enjoyable even when then lead actors are not very young. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, both seventy years old at the time of the film's release, single-handedly manage to keep the audience interested for the entire duration of the film. One of the highlights of the film was Jack Nicholson's facial expressions, which I believe augmented the various emotions in the film, and added a very realistic touch to it. Most of the humour in the film was as a result of the comic expressions on his face which accompanied the dialogues. Another humorous subplot in the film is the relationship between Edward and his assistant Matthew. Edward finds Matthew too biblical a name, and therefore calls him Thomas or Tommy. Matthew's character is that of a calm and dispassionate assistant who does not react to anything his boss may say. Edward frequently heaps insults on Matthew, and Matthew responds without showing emotion, which is a humorous aspect of the film.Morgan Freeman, just as in real life, is Mr. Calm and Composed throughout the film. He adds a sense of maturity to the film which complements the irascible Nicholson perfectly. One of his important contributions to the film was his role as narrator, and his deep bass voice suited the role perfectly. (This narration reminded me of his role as 'God' in Bruce Almighty.).The beginning of The Bucket List, in my opinion, is very eye-catching. The narrator (Freeman), mentions Edward Cole's name in the beginning and his manner of death. He also asks a philosophical question: "What is the sum of a person's life?" which he answers himself. It is only at the end of the movie that we can truly comprehend the significance of the beginning ? that Edward Cole, a cancer patient, lived on till the ripe old age of 80. At the end of the movie, Matthew is seen placing the ashes of Cole in a box of instant coffee, next to those of Freeman, which presumably had been placed much earlier. In the background, we can see the snow-capped Himalayas, in all their beauty and splendour. A major subplot in the film explores the relationships of the lead roles - Carter with his wife Virginia (Beverly Todd) and Edward with his estranged daughter - the development of these relationships is quite fabulous. Perhaps the biggest flaw of the film, however, is that the plot is not too realistic ? you can hardly expect two bed-ridden cancer patients to jump out of bed and start adventuring! On the whole, though, a must-see for people who enjoy quiet, meaningful drama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kicking the bucket like it was a football</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reiner has proved in his thirty year film career that he can make just about any film from any genre. He created vibrant and lovable characters in Stand By Me, a melody of beautiful, uncertain romance in Flipped, and now, he creates a film that gives hope and optimism to Cancer patients old and young. The Bucket List is a wonderfully wholesome exercise with two amazing actors playing their roles with gratitude and bravery.The story revolves around selfish billionaire Edward Cole (Nicholson) and blue collar mechanic Carter Chambers (Freeman). The men both have a very serious form of terminal lung cancer, and share a hospital room while they undergo their separate treatment. Edward owns the hospital they are staying in, and Carter has been working as a mechanic for years since he had to give up his dream of being a historian because of an unexpected child. He possesses a shocking amount of knowledge and loves his daily Jeopardy! where he manages to get almost all of the answers correct.Edward and Carter inevitably become friends and it isn't long before Carter concocts a bucket list after hearing they both only have months to live. The list is a lengthy checklist of things they both want to achieve before they "kick the bucket." Such things include "help someone for the good of it," "laugh until you cry," and travel to the Taj Mahal.Of course one couldn't do those things if really occupying a very rare form of Cancer. That's the part that makes The Bucket List a bit far-fetched. I'm sure and able-bodied person, with a perfect health record would second guess tasks that both of the men want to achieve. But the film's point is to provide loads of optimism to people in the same shoes as Edward and Carter. In that retrospect is succeeds, but not in mass amounts.While believability is stretched out to its limits, the script by Justin Zackham is the highlight. It gives the characters much to work with, and with gifted actors such as Nicholson and Freeman the possibilities and the payoff are worthy of recognition. However, no real emotion is conceived to the point of tears. A trait I was hoping the movie would occupy. I felt sad at the end, but not wholeheartedly upset. It seems the writing limits itself to cross emotional boundaries.And alas, it is not a perfect film. But a very hopeful one, occupying great leads and a memorable score. The script runs its course fluently, hitting very rare bumps in the road and the narrations are welcomed and endured. The Bucket List is yet another faithful film by Reiner, including his key elements; excellent characters, delightful scenic backdrops, and a story worth telling.Starring: Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Directed by: Rob Reiner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The things you want to do before you die</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Bucket List' is a great movie with great performances. I liked so many things about this movie. It has a philosophical tone because it questions you about your last moments; about death and separation from your relatives and friends. The name of the movie comes from the phrase "Kicked the Bucket"; which stands for 'Death'. If you say, "He kicked the bucket at an age of 58." You are suggesting that he died at an age of 58. The term 'The Bucket List', therefore refers to a list of things you want to do before you die.This movie has two of the most accomplished actors of all time: Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. They do justice with their reputations and with their roles in the film. This movie tunes you in because of its profound connection with the existential questions about 'death' and 'what is it that you want to do before death?' There are breath taking scenes in which two characters move through various landscapes around the globe and you are compelled to say 'Aha!' many times because of amazing cinematography.I never get tired of watching any movie with Jack Nicholson in it. Morgan Freeman always convinces with his 'know-all' attitude in most of the movies. Jack Nicholson has this extra madman-genius-quirky element in him which is not conferred by any training or practices and this is what made 'The Shining' look so great a movie. Two characters in the movie have a great chemistry between them and it's this freshness of the script that makes this movie unique. This is not a movie just about the death, but also about old age, friendship and relations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a world were every movie has to be about smart-arse, boring 20-somethings, here's one about old people that doesn't patronise or denigrate the passing of years.Hollywood greats Jack Nicholson &amp; Morgan Freeman get to play two seniors from opposite sides of the track. Nicholson is the wealthy magnate who owns the hospital he's staying in. Freeman is the blue-collar guy who was wise enough to keep up his health insurance payments and shares his room. But neither money nor providence can stave-off what's coming. Each has terminal illness.As they share roomspace and symptoms, a familiarity develops. They are fellows in common adversity and quickly become friends. Differing status dissolves. They draft a list of things-to-do before they kick the bucket. Hence the movie title. What follows is a journey of discovery.This idea, although a little contrived, had great potential. And with these two old pros sparring away with a very witty script there's a great deal to admire. It's a comedy, but a tragic-comedy for all that. The two characters &amp; their respective lives are well developed, though not quite as well as I would have wished. Events move along at a brisk pace as each new idea presents itself. But sometimes editing seems a wee bit heavy handed. Some encounters &amp; dialogue seem to be cut short or not given adequate development.It's a nice movie that tell it's story pretty well. Yet I came away feeling slightly disappointed. It was good, but some essential fluency seemed to be lacking. I enjoyed it, yet not quite as well as I thought I should. Though it's certainly an inspiration if your hair is turning grey, because we all have terminal illness in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate buddy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is an exceptionally well-written movie about making the most of friendship and life even when it seems that time is running out.Jack Nicholson is rather homely playing a rich man with cancer. But somehow he makes hobbling around with a shaven head in a hospital gown, through bouts of retching, look attractive. I didn't find the Morgan Freeman character nearly as interesting but I was totally drawn in by these unlikely bedfellows' bonding.Among the many things I enjoyed along the way was learning about the questions to enter Egyptian heaven: Have you found joy in life? Have you brought joy to others? Why don't we all try to learn from this film? Let's be open to the person we meet by happenstance...They could turn out to be the friend of a lifetime. And let's not let time and finances keep us from reaching out for an adventure. It may turn out to be our best."The Bucket List" is a beautiful experience from start to finish. I hope we'll see more movies about thoughtful people nearing the end of their lives. God knows we could all use some help in facing our mortality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Moving And Emotional Work Of Art.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the first time I watched "The Bucket List," I was swept away by the strong emotional value and the complete mixture of emotions this film causes you to feel. I smiled, I laughed, and most of all, I cried. From reading the back of the DVD when I picked this up I had mixed feelings ? I expected big things from this film due to the talented and experienced cast, however I wasn't sure just from reading it exactly what this film was going to try and achieve. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play two men who are at completely the opposite end of the career spectrum ? Edward Cole (Nicholson) is a corporate billionaire and Carter Chambers (Freeman) is a working class mechanic. The unusual pair are linked by only one thing ? the fact both of them are suffering from terminal cancer, and invariably end up sharing a hospital room. At first it seems like they won't possibly be able to get on with each other, but it's no surprise when they become fast friends just when they both need each other most. The title refers to the "bucket list" they draw out together, which in simple terms is a to-do list of things they both want to do before they die, and are determined to help each other complete these goals. Jack Nicholson, who has slowly wormed his way into being known for comedy, seems a strange choice for a film with such a depressing subject matter, especially when paired with Freeman's serious yet somehow comic personality. However, it soon becomes clear that the two were chosen deliberately to create a contrast in characters that's almost laughable, and gives the film a strangely light-hearted tone. Edward is extremely materialistic, and his focus is money and power, whereas Carter's values lie with family, friends and quality of life. "The Bucket List" has now become a well-used phrase for a list of things people want to do or achieve before they die. Since the film was released in 2007, it has prompted many people to create their own "bucket lists," or at least have some vague ideas in their head. Edward and Carter on their lists have such things that the majority of the audience will also have on theirs ? car racing, skydiving, hiking etc - and this means they can relate to the two men and become more involved with the plot. The idea also comes up that if these two men can both do it when they're two extreme examples of financial and family positions, why can't any audience member do it, who will presumably be somewhere in the middle? Both men also have more delicate and sensitive personal goals which are revealed throughout the film. Reiner creates an interesting contrast throughout the film with the comedy element, and causes the audience to giggle and be amused throughout the majority, but then there's also the fact that they will watch two characters which they will invariably start to like and care about, deteriorate before their eyes. Any audience member with any knowledge of terminal cancer will know that it only gets worse over time, and this is certainly the case with the two friends as the further they get down their list, the more they struggle to do it. This is why for me, this is one of the most emotional and heart wrenching films I have ever seen. Due to the nature and budget of this film, there is of course a fair share of stunts and special effects to keep the audience entertained. The cinematography is all well thought out and perfectly executed, and the soundtrack is a great balance of comical and more emotional pieces. This is an amazingly well done film that will keep you laughing but will also probably have you in tears at several points. As the film finishes with one of the saddest yet happy endings I've ever experienced in a film, it begs the all-important question ? "What's on your bucket list?" A must see for every age and definitely one of my personal favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bucket List is an example in which acting solely drives the film while direction and story takes a step back.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bucket List is directed by Rob Reiner - the person responsible for modern classics like The Princess Bride and Stand By Me. A few months before its release, there seemed to be a growing anticipation for The Bucket List. Starring two of American cinema's most recognizable faces - Jack Nicholson (The Shining, Chinatown) and Morgan Freeman (The Shawshank Redemption, Driving Miss Daisy) - in leading roles about two old guys getting terminal cancer and are hospitalized in the same ward. One of them starts to pen down a list of things to do before he kicks the bucket. His partner happens to chance upon the list and challenges the both of them to actually go out and do it.From then on, watching The Bucket List is like observing how two strangers try their best to find real joy in their lives before they depart the world. Reiner emphasizes more on the relationship between the two central characters than anything else. Yes, there's character development which is important. Unfortunately, the plot is thin and too predictable. Moreover, it leaves little room for the story to expand to greater depths; hence the film becomes another familiar ninety minutes of dispensable entertainment. Though it doesn't disappoint, The Bucket List is still a relatively weak effort by Reiner's standards.The casting is spot-on. As always, Nicholson and Freeman are scene-stealers, showing their acting prowess and their comfortability working with each other. In fact, the chemistry between them is excellent; naturally a fervent and zealous Jack Nicholson is much likely to complement a laidback Morgan Freeman. The Bucket List owes a great debt to the two Oscar-winners. Without them, the film is nothing. The Bucket List is an example in which acting solely drives the film while direction and story takes a step back. Despite the optimism and energy shown by the actors, the film is at times dull and slow to sit through. Critical reaction to The Bucket List is definitely far from enthusiastic.SCORE: 7/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!</fullReview>

I am amazed and astonished to see that this movie was only nominated for 3 awards, one being for the score. This film is wonderful. A word which we don't use or say often in a positive way is heartwarming. This word now seems synomymous with trite or sickening. I am delighted to be able to say that this film is heartwarming in the best of ways. The author wrote this in a short time but put so much into the story. Even with the caliber of actors it had I was hesitant that it may have been both trite and sickening but it was neither. Not only was it brilliantly written and acted but the cinematography was beautiful. Freeman and Nicholson bounced off each other as only they could. Their banter was both quick witted and charming. It dealt with the subject of impending death with both sensitivity and hilarity. It truly is a movie where you will laugh and cry unashamedly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very, very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering your mortality and how you would handle facing your immediate (within a few months) death is a highly morbid subject. Thanks to the skill of two old and mature masters of their craft, a skillfully crafted script, a versatile and thoughtful director, and several stellar supporting performances the "Bucket List" invites you to do exactly that while being entertained and avoiding the morbid and maudlin clichés."The Bucket List" could have been a hackneyed type-cast of roles Freeman and Nicholdson played often before. It could have been a maudlin wallow in effusive sentimentality by them and their supporting cast. The movie, director and actors do not allow the movie to descend to those clichés. Instead, you are drawn into a relationship between two dissimilar strong resilient men with opposing internal motives, lifestyles and characters facing the one thing they have in common . . . their oncoming appointment with the end of their existence.They face a situation that each of us will face. Most of us will face it without this type of foreknowledge or even an inkling of death's imminence. However, there are none of us who haven't contemplated the situation and how we will react to it. I appreciated the invitation from "The Bucket List" cast and crew to vicariously enjoy a version of this experience and the seven stages of grief without the personal pain and shock of hitting my finger with a hammer. Perhaps you will as well.Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman prove their many previous accolades as American masters of the craft of acting, Rob Reiner again deftly and thoughtfully allows the well written Just Zackham script to be portrayed. Sean Hayes, Beverly Todd, Rob Morrow, Alfonso Freeman and Rowena King support the leads and story with restraint and skill.If this is not one of the best films you see this year, you have been very fortunate in your selections of films to view. You will be entertained, if you watch it and I believe, educated about some of the possibilities of the situation. I expect we all will eventually need it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>strong performances rescue a predictable script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>United by a common fate, two terminally ill strangers share a room in a hospital and become the best of friends. Together, they draw up something called a "bucket list," a catalog of things they've always wanted to do in their lives but somehow never got around to doing. This includes jumping out of an airplane, getting a tattoo, driving a racecar and touring the planet (luckily, one of them is rich enough to own his own jet) - all before "kicking the bucket." Sort of a "feel-good" movie about death, Rob Reiner's "The Bucket List" pretty much plays out as one would expect it to, with a predictable and episodic script (by Justin Zackham) that wobbles uncomfortably between whistling-past-the-graveyard humor and courage-in-the-face-of-death sentimental uplift (the latter being particularly evident in Morgan Freeman's stentorian voice-over narration and Marc Shaiman's tinkling-piano score).Like the solid professionals they are, Freeman and Jack Nicholson both rise above the clichés of their respective stereotypes: Nicholson's of a gruff, billionaire playboy (true typecasting if ever there was any) who's been successful in all areas of his life except where it really counts, that is to say as a loving husband and father; and Freeman's of a stolid, conservative family man who's never learned to just cut loose and enjoy life to the full. Now, just as they are about to meet their maker, these two polar opposites get a chance to teach one another valuable lessons on how to make the most of what little time remains to them.All told, there's nothing particularly striking or memorable about "The Bucket List," but the actors make it worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) tries to finish of the list of all the things he wants to do before he kicks the bucket, he realises he's spent too many years working as a mechanic, keeping his marriage going, bringing up his children leaving him with a bittersweet feeling of lost opportunities. Meanwhile, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) never considered a list. He was always far too busy making money and building a billionaire empire to stop and consider what his deeper needs could be. Then life kicked them up the backside giving them an urgent and unexpected wake up call. Carter and Edward found themselves sharing a hospital cubicle giving them much time to think about what could happen next. Leaving them with a thought, how much of this is in our hands? Despite all their differences, they both had two major things in common. An ongoing denial of accepting their illnesses and a growing urge to live their remaining time to the full. For what was just a mental exercise to begin with for Carter, is now reality. Disobeying doctors orders, they tick themselves out of the hospital and hit the road for their greatest adventure. From the Tag Mahal to the Serengeti , the best restaurants to the worse tattoo parlours, behind the wheel of the most vintage race cars to the open door of a plane to sky dive. All this with just a piece of paper and their eccentric passion to live life to it's fullest. Rob Reiner (Director) pairs up two of Hollywood's best actors in this touching encounter with the motto 'It's never too late to live life to its fullest' My goodness, what a duo! Put two huge actors together and you get a funny, thrilling and heart-felt film with non-stop action! I mean this isn't Shawshank Redemption or an Unforgiven but you have to judge this in a completely different category. I have to be honest after watching this film I felt more compelled by Jack Nicholson's performance than Morgan Freeman's. Having said that, out of the two Freeman is the more consistent actor ? in my opinion.Usually when I watch films I find myself coming up with my own outcome as the film progresses however, The Bucket List did everything I wanted it to do. To begin with I was afraid it would glorify living life to the full with limited time - but it didn't. The Bucket List had a brilliant balance between comedy and hard hitting drama, playing on the audience's emotions. The cast performances stood out for me most, I mean you can't go wrong if you cast both Freeman and Nicholson but they really were tremendous. I hope Rob Reiner continues to write excellent films, starring these two more often! One thing that particularly struck me was they both played characters on the brink of death. It was somewhat, emotional to realise that these two legends won't last forever. Both with excellent careers and longevity with much more brilliance to come, one thing is for sure; these two legends will go down in history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Morgan Freeman narrates - as he does in this film - I hear a caramelized melody of smooth jazz played by cherubs on a base of scorched leather. You could say listening to him is my kind of meditation. When I hear Jack Nicholson's voice, I smell the lust of a thousand rogues stomping on the cotton-wool bed of women's dreams; his come-hither eyes arrest and alarm beneath their wicked hoods. A vulnerable place to be. You could say that this film celebrates their differences and conveniently casts them at two ends of the personality spectrum.In 'The Bucket List', Morgan Freeman plays Carter Chambers, a noble hard-working family man who is diagnosed with cancer. Jack Nicholson's character, Edward Cole is a brilliant yet lonely billionaire who is also diagnosed with cancer. Their unlikely paths cross when Edward is forced to share a hospital room with Carter to prove to the public that even the chief executive of the hospital believes in sharing rooms (yes, he owns the hospital).It's clearly resentment at first sight for Edward but he is persuaded by his PR puppy that he has to share for the sake of his public image. After a few frosty exchanges, Edward warms to Carter's patient, intelligent persona and Carter warms to Ed's money. He doesn't care much for his ego exclaiming at one point "I've had deeper baths than you" which sums Edward up quite well. Because of their uncertain futures, the pair bond quite quickly and go on a whirlwind trip around the globe fulfilling all their fantasies before the hand of time stops ticking: so far so unlikely.Although the plot is implausible, it is watchable as it is a touching tale about achieving your dreams and making amends before it's too late. It is also a tale of how the most unlikely people can influence you at important times of your life and a stubborn heart can change under unusual circumstances. The story moved a little bit too fast for me and assumes a deep bond between the two that frankly isn't there (they've only known each other a matter of months).Although a bit saccharine at times, especially between Carter and his wife, it is intriguing how the story unfolds and Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman work well together - their collective charm and chemistry making up for an, at times, over-sentimental story.Although this film falls into the genre of comedy, I would think twice if you want a belly laugh as this isn't one. It would be more accurately described as a black comedy and, although there are a lot of laughs, it's undeniably about loss. Twenty minutes into the film, a lump had appeared in my throat and half an hour in and I was sobbing like a baby, but then I'm a right old softie. To sum up, a morbid tale with a light touch. Keep the Kleenex handy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman star in The Buket List. A film that was a ton better than I expected. Freeman plays Carter, an engineer and Nicholson plays Edward, a miserable rich man. Both of them have cancer.Both of them had or has a family, of course. While in the hospital, Carter comes up with a list, he calls it The Bucket List. It's a list of all of the things you want to do before you die. For instance, witness something majestic, laugh until I cry, and kiss the most beautiful girl. Edward thinks those are lame, so he adds a few. When Edward and Carter get out of the hospital and do cooler things. They go skydiving, to France, to Africa and many other places .Sean Hayes from Will &amp; Grace stars as Tom, Edward's assistant. Though his name's not Tom, it's Matthew. Edward thinks it's too Biblical. THat's pretty funny. The Bucket List is a fun film to watch. I don't know why so many critics around the world bashed it. It's also very funny. I think the part that makes it funny is Jack Nicholson. The film is also a drama, Nicholson's character is having problems with his daughter. The Bucket List is truly a great film. Put it on your list to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good movie but nothing special!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just so we understand each other; I think this is a very decent movie! I was not bored, but neither was I surprised while watching "The Bucket List"! I only laughed a few times, and I didn't even cry at the end, so I have to say that it was only moderately entertaining! Most of us would agree that it's almost always a pleasure to watch these two masters (Freeman and Nicholson) do the magic that they do on screen, and they do it well in this movie, and highly compliment each other. The trouble is, that there's just not that much new under the sun! I like the slow and easy pace of the movie, the no-nonsense tone between the two main characters and I like Sean Hayes' part as well, for the small amount of comic relief it brings, but there's no way of escaping the fact that there is very little story to tell, and what little story there is has been told many times before, and in some cases have been told better or more convincingly.I must applaud the movie for not getting to sentimental and clichéd until the very end, and then it is only to be expected from this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bucket List was very good movie that did not really have a major box office sales. The movie was about 2 elderly men who are both diagnosed with cancer and have only a few months to live. They agree to make a list of all the things they want to do before they died. Both Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman both did good jobs in these roles and shared the screen for an enjoyable performance. This was a Comedy movie with a touch off drama because both of the characters had to deal with serious family issues. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson both brought a real life sense to two men really coming to grips with their end.The most impressive seen I believe from the whole film would be the last scene where both Nicholson and Freemen were alive together for. In the scene Freeman is on his deathbed and explains how Nicholson's favorite tea is really cat droppings. After freeman sees Nicholson's reaction he laughs till he cries and crosses it of the list. The movie ran very smoothly and tied all together at the end. Two great actors on the big screen really did not disappoint as they took on every scene as if it where their last (no pun indeed).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Touching Experience.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always been a fan of both Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson films, but I was quite surprised to learn that they would be starring side-by-side in a film. To be honest, it intrigued me, and not knowing what to expect, I decided to pick up 'The Bucket List' and see what all the hype was about. Let's just say that my expectations were met...... and exceeded. What I experienced when watching this movie was a truly touching story about two men about to 'kick the bucket' with dreams still unrealized. The movie follows the happenings of these two men as they journey throughout the world, living the experiences they've only dreamed about.Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson - both legends in the film industry. On-screen together, they have a certain chemistry that you can't help but love. I found myself being swept into their lives, living their experiences, feeling the pain that they felt. Freeman and Nicholson give two amazing performances. In the beginning, they were strangers, but in the end, they were friends. And that is perhaps the most touching part of the entire film: seeing their friendship build and prosper as the film goes on.To conclude, see this film. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman's performances are ones not to be missed. You will be moved by the incredible chemistry these two men exhibit on-screen, and discover the value of friendship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Makes the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stuck together by the same Scotch(r) tape that the resurrected bucket list may have been stuck together with at the end of the movie, the script is obviously heavily inspired by the TV show "My Name is Earl" where, like this movie, a list is involved to right what-should- have-beens.The movie is schmaltzy, not well done, implausible, corny and just a bad hack job which nobody could pull off...except the actors here. Nicholson makes the movie. Period. You could have gotten other people for the Freeman role, and the other roles in the film, but the Nicholson role was ideal for him and carries the entire movie so that, even though you know the ending at the give-away beginning, you also enjoy the ride anyway because of Nicholson's great acting, whether emotional or hysterical to the laugh-out-loud point at parts.So don't go into the movie expecting some great flash of insight or some great plot twists. It is what it is, probably one of the last opportunities (ironically) to see a really great actor, Jack Nicholson, who can portray pathos and humor with razor sharp turns as if it's all just a drop in the bucket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now, when seeing a trailer you cant help but to create your version of the movie you plan to watch. Mostly, you were right, here you ain't. Some might think that the movie is going to be about two old dying men becoming friends and than they make a list of crazy and stupid things they want to do and they go ahead and do that. This movie Ain't so. It begins slightly slow with introducing the characters and them getting to know each other as you get to know all of them. The chemistry between Jack N. and Morgan F. is very nice. They both seem to have that acting experience that makes them balance their dramatic moments and those backed with a bot of humor or sarcasm. Still, no matter what they say or what they think, you seem to like them both. Than there's the 'list' that might, in the arms of a young and unexperienced screenplay writer, become stupid and shallow for two old men but its good. The movie than, does not just follow the list but follows more the development of the characters relationship, their lives and the parts where they open up more and more towards each other and the viewer. As the movie slowly comes to an end you will be completely blown away by the characters. Its ans inspiring movie, as i read somewhere and it truly is. Now for some it might be about death, our last wishes, the humble thought of a man on the edge of his own grave. Anyhow, the movie isn't just plain entertainment. Is has the touch that makes it a bit faster than some slow-going dramas are but this time the drama is realistic. Go see this movie, no matter what genre you prefer mostly... Its gonna be good for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If IKEA made movies they'd be a lot like this.......................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know what I mean don't you.....you're looking for some cabinets,say,or a set of shelving and it looks really good in the catalogue so you go to the store and come home with some cardboard boxes so big you can hardly get them in your Volvo even with the back seats down and so heavy you worry about your hernia.You spend the weekend putting it together and you end up with something that doesn't look quite right.There's no bits left in the boxes so you've got everything you need to make a cabinet or a set of shelving,but when you step back and take a look at your handiwork - well it certainly resembles what you set out to make,but,somewhere along the line,all those neat components have failed to come together into a cohesive whole.A bit like "The Bucket List" then. Two dead - cert box - office draws like Mr Nicholson and Mr Freeman,a story about noble manlove,a comforting sub text assuring us that multi - millionaire white Jack Nicholson is hated by everybody while blue collar black Morgan Freeman has a loving and supportive family therefore money can't buy happiness..............one of them dies(guess which one)and the other,having got back in touch with his emotions,finds redemption with his estranged family.Dust off that place on the mantlepiece where your Oscar would fit rather neatly. Unfortunately,however handy Mr Reiner is with his directorial Allen Keys,"The Bucket List" only vaguely resembles a good movie. Jack Nicholson gives a performance with a capital "P".He snarls,he grins manically,his eyebrows regularly go into some sort of gymnastic routine,even his hair over - acts.Mr Freeman on the other hand decides to stick with his saintly persona.This man is too good to live.The idea that Nicholson's character would willingly spend ten minutes in his company is frankly ludicrous. And then there's that damned list they're always on about.Here's a major sticking point for me - nearly everything on the list is so bloody expensive you need to be a millionaire to do it.So maybe money can buy you happiness after all.Hell,what do I know,I don't have any and I'm about as happy as a bloke staring down the barrel of 70 can get. But - and this is only a guess so don't quote me on it - it's possible that if I did have a lot,I be a damned sight happier. And Mr Freeman's voice - over is very annoying.He's supposed to be dead and there he is commenting on Jack Nicholson's death which apparently occurred years later.Shurely shome mishtake? Mr Reiner might have been better off casting his old pal Steve Martin in harness with Samuel L.Jackson and make Jackson the millionaire.As it is in "The Bucket List" he gets absolutely nil points for thinking outside the Box - Office.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The pleasure of good acting...but nothing else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If someone had created a contest in which the best script written for Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman to star a film together would end up in a movie starring Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, Justin Zackham would have probably won it. "The Bucket List", written by Zackham and directed by Rob Reiner, stars the two pros as two old men with less than a year left to live. The role choosing couldn't be more perfect. Nicholson plays Edward Cole, a multimillionaire who loves being single and partying; and Freeman plays Carter Chambers, a quiet man who works as a mechanic but reads a lot and knows every "Jeopardy!" question existent, and loves his wife and children. To say that both of them are changed when the film is over is fair enough, but it's not fair to say that I believed that change.However, I think "The Bucket List" isn't about a life-changing experience (even if many people saw it that way, and whether the viewer is convinced of the change); all of its dramatic moments are weak, predictable and seem to be buying time. In fact, I don't think the film is about the 'list' of the title either (a list of all the things the two men would like to do before they die); the few things we see them do, without mattering how many the list contains, don't seem very significant and also seem to be buying time. Maybe it's because I'm feeling gentle or whatever other reason, but today I'll say this movie is about watching two great actors doing what they do best; and in that aspect it succeeds. I've been thinking about calling "The Bucket List" a vehicle?Can I call a film with two very old and recognized actors a 'vehicle'? Why not? Everyone likes to watch Freeman and Nicholson, and this is the first film they've done together. I could also take a risk by saying that the film contains and admittedly typecasting that the viewer instantly finds pleasing. For instance, there's nothing more pleasing than listening to Morgan Freeman's voice narrating something (we've seen him doing it in tons of films, most notably in "Million Dollar Baby" and the great "The Shawshank Redemption"), and that's exactly how this movie opens. And Nicholson?Well, every role he's done this decade involves a character that's almost at the end of the road (his Dr. Schmihdt, his mob master Costello, his Harry in "Something's Gotta Give"), and it's fine; I have no complaints with that as I would have with some of the roles Al Pacino's been playing, for example. Sometimes all we want to watch is good acting. "The Bucket List" provides that, as these two giants laugh together and make us laugh in some of the film's little good moments (Sean Hayes provides some of these too, in an unexpected supporting role), or as they try to make us cry, fighting with the corniness of the script. They do their best (Freeman most notably; what a genius), and as viewers we have to be grateful for that. Should I give a little credit to Rob Reiner, whose career's been on a downhill for some time now? Maybe I should, but I could also recommend him to do his own 'bucket list', starting with something like: "Do at least one more good movie before I die".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure movie magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always regretted not watching this film when it came out in the theaters, I just now rented it and its pure magic. Its why people should go to the movies. There were times watching this that I didn't know what I felt more, the lump in my throat or the hurting in my gut from laughing so hard. This is one of those films that entertains but also makes you think about life and what it really is about. There is an excellent scene where Freeman tells Nicholson about a theory of the afterlife and two questions that must be answered, have you had joy in your life? and have you brought joy to others? Granted this film is somewhat depressing because you know these two guys are doomed from the start, but you feel joy for them when they find that you are never more alive then on the edge of death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you," says the quietly wise Carter Chambers, played with gravitas and grace by a Morgan Freeman. In Rob Reiner's moving, often hilarious film The Bucket List, all sorts of people measure themselves against the two heroes, Chambers and his hospital suite mate, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson). But as Cole finds, having spent his entire life building a Fortune 500 company, none of that much matters when cancer, the great equalizer, pays a visit. The film traces the adventures of the two unlikely friends, who meet in a hospital cancer ward, each given six months to live. The "bucket list" of the title refers to a lifelong list of goals that a teacher of Chambers once advised him to compile--and achieve--"before you kick the bucket." Soon the two are off on what may be the last grand adventure of their life, vowing to tick off as many goals (skydiving, race-car driving, seeing the wonders of the world) as they can in the time they have left. What starts as a medical melodrama becomes a road trip, yet the men's mortality realities are never far from thought. The two leads give impressive performances, and remind the viewer of just how few American films focus on the lives and loves of senior citizens. Nicholson even manages to lose his persona in his character, much as he did in About Schmidt. There's a lovely John Mayer tune, "Say (What You Need to Say)," that's perfectly matched to the film's clear-eyed view of life: What does one person leave behind as his true legacy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so admit it, when you watched the trailer for this movie whether you were in a theater or at home you couldn't help but think, here we go again, another movie to add to the list of clichés. I know I certainly did, i figured there would be a couple of tears, maybe some smart remarks, but overall I figured it would be another chance for Jack Nicholson to play some cynical man lost in his ways, and Morgan Freeman would play a wise old man who had already figured out the secrets to life, again. So when I sat down to watch this movie I was surprised to find how well done it actually was. I loved that the horribly serious moments were spotted with humor and vice versa, but what I loved more was the messages behind the movie, a lesson believe we have all forgotten to learn, but its the moments of its simplest innocence that make it so profound, whether it be when Jack Nicholson is discussing his daughter, or finally knocking on her door, to the moment of Morgan Freeman's family dinner, to when he's nervously fidgeting in his room while waiting for his wife to come, the innocence and the simplicity of these characters shows through making them that much more endearing, for though we may not know what its like to be dying of some illness, most of us can relate in some way to one of those moments. That is why this movie is simply amazing, it takes the most cliché plot line, most overused characters and makes them human again, and make them relatable to its audience. This movie is amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you put two fine actors in a movie such as this, you got gemstone that shines forever! Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman play terminally-ill men who get a chance to enjoy themselves before they "kick the bucket". Nicholson plays Cole, Freeman plays Chambers. These total opposites start a bond that can never be broken by anything. Cole lives the lavish life, while Chambers lives the simple one. They bother have terminal cancers, Cole is bitter, while Chambers keeps a cool head about his. When Chambers writes out a "bucket list" Cole thinks its not a bad idea. They did everything on that list. The race between the Shelby and the Dodge is a riot. The sky-diving scene is cool as well. Another thing Chambers has a thing that's less than simple is high-class coffee. It's sad that Chambers died first. However, Cole owes it up to him when he tells him how to live life when you're dying. Being put in a can of Chock Full of Nuts coffee can shows about the "richness" of life. It's very heart-warming and very meaningful. Watch it! 4 out of 5 stars!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked the idea behind the Bucket List, but I thought this movie could have been so much better with a little more effort put into the script. I would have liked for the movie to include a few more comedic moments. In the movie, a mechanic, Carter, and a rich hospital owner, Edward, share a hospital room while receiving treatments for cancer. They become friends and once well enough to leave, they decide to set out on a journey to together to do things they always wanted to do. Both are told they won't live more than a year. They travel the world and Carter shows Edward he needs to put a little more joy in his life.FINAL VERDICT: Jack Nicholoson has a few good one liners in this, but the film starts off rather slow. It's OK to watch once, but not entertaining enough to watch a second time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bucket List is one of the best movies of 2008, and it would be cruel not to give it an Oscar award. It teaches viewers how to make the best out of any situation, even a tragic illness like brain cancer. The Bucket List features 2 of the best and most experienced actors in Hollywood (Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson), and the chemistry between the two is marvelous. Some of the recurring themes throughout the movie are living for the present (having fun in the current moment); appreciating the little things in your daily life, while not worrying about what happens in the future. The work that was put into making the movie was tremendous, and it shows during the presentation. So whether you are young or old, The Bucket List is sure to have a strong inspirational message for everyone.Jack Nicholson plays Edward Cole, a billionaire hospital owner who is recently diagnosed with cancer. Carter Chambers, played by Morgan Freeman, is a mechanic working on an average salary, also fighting with cancer. When the two are placed in the same hospital room, they do not get along. Cole's crummy attitude does not mend well with Chambers' wise remarks. However, after spending more time together, they learn to get along and become friends. Later on, both create a "Bucket List". It is a list of things you wish to do before your death. After some convincing, Cole and Chambers leave the hospital to explore the aspects of their lives that have been missing for quite some time. This is where the plot begins to develop, and the movie enters its lighter stages. There are many things in life which we have no control over; however, we must learn to accept them and make the best of the cards that we are dealt. When someone is struck down by a terminal illness, it is debilitating. I was recently diagnosed with Crohn's disease, and after spending some time in the hospital, I learned many things that were presented in The Bucket List. Everything happens to us for a reason, intended for self improvement. It is up to us if we want to learn the lessons presented to us, or ignore them.After leaving the hospital, they begin their journey to accomplish every task on the bucket list. There are some dangerous adventures, like skydiving and crashing race cars, but Cole and Chambers don't let anything stand in the way of their goals. They have some thoughtful conversations along their journey, filled with humor throughout. The light-heartedness of the film makes it so much more enjoyable for everyone. During the accomplishment of activities on their bucket list, Cole and Chambers experience true happiness, despite their poor health. This goes to show that no obstacle, big or small, can defeat the power of the human spirit. All you need is the willpower, and nothing can stand in your way.The main conflict occurs towards the end of the movie, where the relationship between our two main characters hangs in the balance. Edwin blatantly refuses to confront the biggest obstacle in his life, which strongly upsets Chambers. This conflict goes on until the end of the movie; when both characters realize their flaws, and make a great effort to improve the lives of others around them. While watching the movie, expect to feel a strong emotional pull towards the characters, as the editing, screen writing, and music incorporation is fantastic. It was very refreshing to see such an inspirational film like The Bucket List. The movie industry needs to learn from great movies like these, and just keep it going. We deserve to see a masterpiece, and we also deserve to have a chance to better ourselves. The Bucket List is a great movie to watch when you feel that life has given you a raw deal. Why? It can completely warp your perspective, and help you cope and improve any situation. This movie will definitely be on the list of movies to show my kids. While I may be a little bit young to make a bucket list, the idea will be inside my head as a guideline to live life by. We have such little time, why not make the most of it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rob Reiner produced a classic. A risky and necessary film that fills a silent need. We all die one day at a time. We each know someone dying. The uncomfortable anguish over how to be with a dying person haunts most people. This film will equip the public with options for the next time certain death rattles. A brilliant script with Oscar acting. Quality above quantity, dying well is the moral to the epic tale of Edward and Carter. This amazing adventure is one we all tread. Death is the delicate subject matter and Reiner builds a friendly bridge for the audience to cross over.We brush our teeth to prevent decay. We avoid fat to live longer, and now we can prevent the unnecessary anguish of death by adding this movie to our viewing library. The scenes flowed without losing point and magic poured through both Jack and Morgan's opposing philosophy. My father died in 2006 and he too chose to be buried, not burned. As instructed a simple pine box, without ceremony placed in a rural cowboy cemetery where tumbleweeds blow. His views mirrored Edward.</fullReview>

If there were different actors playing Edward &amp; Carter, the movie wouldn't have came out as good. Jack has a a long good record of great movies and he knows how to put emotion in his characters. Morgan knows when to show facial expressions at the right time.

It was brilliantly acted, filmed and written, I hope there is an Oscar in the future for this film and more Freeman-Nicholson, collaborations in ours. Rob Reiner, (whom I've considered brilliant for quite some time now), has once again outdone himself, (way to go meathead). Visually stunning, this film is a trip around the globe and through the senses, ending in the heart. If you haven't seen this movie, please do. If you love movies, and you don't love this, then you don't love movies, if you don't love movies... Well... I'm sure Pauly Shore will make another feature in the future...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie I've seen in a long time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's been a while since I've watched a movie that I really liked. The Bucket List definitely got me into the movie watching mood again. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson were absolutely perfect for their roles. It had a bit of everything, sadness, funny, and even some action! I thought it was a very good movie. It's definitely one that will have you calling your ol' dad the next morning to see how he's doing. You can't help but choke up a little throughout the whole movie, and it makes the things that Jack does and says, even funnier. I think Morgan Freeman is one of the better actors in our time. He is extremely lovable and you can't help but want to hug the guy! It's been a while since I've seen a movie that didn't leave me with that whole, "Uhm, so what ended up happening???" feeling. My only complaint about this film is that it seemed a bit short. I would have liked to see more on the background of both characters before they end up meeting.Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The title and numerous other reviews tell it all. If you want to watch another Jack Nicholson film to see Jack play Jack Nicholson, by all means you will love this. A billionaire who has traveled the world and dined with royalty picks up with a dying auto mechanic because he literally has no friends. Of course, they both learn the meaning of life and appreciation for the important things from each other. If you want to admire the way Morgan Freeman can endow characters with dignity, you will love this. If you like watching Jack doing his act of belittling those around him and making sure that everyone knows he could buy and sell them, you can know he will do it well. But don't expect any great acting, plot, or even a good road trip movie. Just Jack and Morgan doing their thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bucket List</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two great actors and stars ? Jack Nicolson and Morgan Freeman ? in one movie; need anything be said more? So there I was, watching this movie of 2 old men.Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) an old rich mega business person and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) an old and very intelligent vehicle mechanic end up in a hospital room as terminally ill patients. Two totally different characters, extreme in their outlooks meet and after initial hic-up, they develop an endearing liking and friendship and decide to enjoy the little life by doing things they always thought, but could never do. That ends up in a list ? The Bucket List. With the money of Edward, they get away from their surrounding and do what they would love to do. They travel to Pyramids, Taj Mahal, the Himalayas ? do sky jumping etc. But it is their interactions and talks that throws light on life lessons to ponder about.Jack Nicholson can not leave his type-casted weirdness, idiocracy and is crazy as the grumpy old rich man. Morgan Freeman brings peace, tranquility and patience to his character. Jack has got a constant eye stare, whereas Morgan has a continuously moving eye ball while talking. And it is only and only because of these two men that the movie is worth watching, otherwise the direction by Rob Reiner lacks depth. The movie does pose some spiritual and philosophical incites about extreme positioning of mind, but does not convey enough to make an impact.There are also a few goofs in the movie. When asked by Carter, Edward tears up the bucket list paper into pieces and throws on the road, after a while Carter takes the whole yellow paper of bucket list from his pocket. How did that magic happen? It is observed that the pictures of Pyramid and Taj Mahal suddenly turn to yellow tinge, and that is evidently because of computerized processing of the two characters to another film. Those two beautiful seven wonders stand out as sore thumbs.Overall, an okay movie ? watch it if you want to see real good acting by great maestros.(Stars 5.75 out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Had it not been for Freeman and Nicholson.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot, which an average moviegoer who has not even seen the movie probably has heard, is about two 70-years-olds with terminal cancer sharing a hospital room striking up a friendship and ending up pursuing a "bucket list" through all sorts of wild adventures before they kick it.In terms of screen persona, Morgan Freeman has become more and more of the embodiment of the spiritual comfort-giver (look at "Feast of love") while Jack Nicholson has always been obnoxiousness personified. Both can do these things with their eyes closed.In "Bucket", Freeman is true to form ? stoic, philosophical, soothing and all those things ? except for one instance which is not his fault but the movie makers'. Nicholson, to his credit, has tended towards underplaying (yes, for him it is), particularly during the first part of the movie when he is in hospital struggling against all the pains brought on by cancer and its treatment. I also like the handling of the way the old couple develops their rapport and friendship ? a delightfully low key affair that you might not expect in something where Nicholson is involved. That is the best part of the movie.The comedy and poignancy in the rest of the movie is very much by the book, offering little by way of surprise or delight. You laugh almost as if by obligation to the great actors and feel moved because you remember the last time (in fact, the many times) you saw something like that, you felt the same way.The ultimate failure is the writing of Freeman's character. They can write Nicholson into anything and I'll buy it. But Freeman's uncharacteristic outburst about having sacrificed 45 years for his family and therefore is entitled to have one last (and only) fling before his death is such an artificial contrivance to get the movie going that is tantamount to insulting the audience's intelligence. I said I like the early part about the development of the buddy rapport. What follows, however, is taking it too far. There is only one reason for accepting that a dedicated family man would want to trade spending the last few months of his life with his wife and family for what we saw in the movie: the show must go on.</fullReview>

The Bucket List has been held over for four weeks so far in our Arizona community where retired people live in abundance. People who are normally too cynical about the quality of our movies to attend, will find this is worth the time to break their routine.Rob Reiner's direction, combined with a terrific cast, and a wonderful, believable story is simply special. Morgan Freeman, Jack Nicholson, Beverly Todd, and Sean Hayes created something believable and compelling... leaving the audience reflecting upon life with emotion and handkerchiefs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is acting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bucket List is about two man who share the same destiny, dying in six months cause of cancer, but nothing else in terms of life style, economical status, faith or even color of skin! But those two man at the same hospital room, become friends and change each other in a good way while driving to the end of their lives.Nicholson and Freeman give a real acting lesson here. Both are in the same kind of roles that we're familiar with their previous movies but it doesn't make it any weaker here, they do it because they do it well.Movie is much more about Nicholson's character. He's an unhappy man. Although being very rich, he is lonesome, pretending to be happy, an peevish old guy. On the other hand Freeman play a guy who has accomplish many thing in his life like making three children to graduate from good schools and secure their lives. But he thinks he did all those by sacrificing his own life and when at the end of the road, he's uneasy, not because of losing his life, but losing a life that has not been lived well.With all those thoughts in their mind, they decide to do a list of things that they always wanted to do before they die. This journey also takes both of them to places that they did not plan.I watched it simply amazed, some of the flaws did not bother me at all. I wish they really had gotten to places in real and the conversations at those special places like pyramids, like Tac Mahal was a little bit stronger and deeper. Maybe this is because I hate sgi effects when it's not really necessary. There is also one point left me wondering if Edward Cole changed anything with the business of his own for good? This has been one of the rare movies that made me shed a tear. With all its simplicity this movie tells you some nice story about life and death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite movies of 2008 !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yep who knew an idea about two men about to die can be so enjoyable and uplifting?The Bucket List worked on only one thing: The chemistry between Edward and Carter (of course played by Nicholson and Freeman).Both are as different as oil and water : Edward is well-off,flamboyant yet stubborn while Carter is more quiet,intelligent and philosophical.Yet they meet one day in the same hospital room,both suffering from a terminal disease with only little time left.So they end up hating each other,then taking a liking and a mutual understanding for each other.Then came the Bucket List,something Carter made up,things they have always wanted to do and Edward with all his wealth left behind,convinces Carter (and his reluctant wife) to go and pursue those unfinished dreams..And you name it,they do it : Skydiving,traveling around the world in a private jet,patching up thing with estranged loved ones. All that before they,well,kick the bucket.So it might not be realistic at parts,like traveling lavishly,but this is such a feel good film,it doesn't come off as corny or cheesy in parts and instead what it did to me was that I ended up smiling by the end of the movie,and that dosen't happen very often.Nicholson is hilarious with his one-liners and and his familiar stubbornness that we've proceed to experience over the years.We've seen him in similar roles before,yet he has the power to charm the audience every damn movie.Morgan Freeman,like Nicholson,we've seen him in similar roles but the powerful persona he brings to the screen about a quiet,loving,intelligent man about to die is a treat.Yes,its not a flawless film,nothing much of a script,yet its a great film,which fills you up with emotions during every scene and I'm very glad I saw it.And if you happen to be reading this,do see it too,you just might end up loving it just like I did..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Bucket List</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From morbid time to time, I'd wonder what my own bucket list will be, when I'm given a certain number of months left to live. Will I have things to accomplish being totally selfish for personal glory, or will the list consists of things that're more charitable toward others? It's easy to to have the former I suppose, and easily quantifiable goals such as travel the world and the likes, but I'm beginning to appreciate the meaningfulness of making a difference in the lives of others, especially so since I think I haven't done anything in that respect.Two of Hollywood's veteran actors, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, team up as two unlikely characters turned friends when they find themselves holed up in the same hospital room seeking treatment for their terminal illness. And they cannot be more different of course. One's a family man, earning his keep in a modest job, whose source of entertainment is trivia. The other's a billionaire, having a personal assistant attend to his every whim and fancy, and having generally a mightier-than-thou attitude toward everyone, unleashing caustic remarks toward others for the heck of it.Through their interaction, they soon find common ground in having an obstacle in their lives to overcome, and that's whether to sit around and mope, hoping for a miracle cure, or to go out there and do things that they've always craved to do, of course with money never being an issue because one of them's a loaded man. So off they go on the adventure of their lives, visiting exotic countries, and taking risks that they don't normally accept. It's easy though to diss their list as implausible to mimic because frankly speaking, one does really need a lot of cash to accomplish exactly what they did. Needless to say, both Nicolson and Freeman are such strong actors, that you really wonder if they're really acting their roles, or are genuinely enjoying themselves as they feed off each other's energy as they have fun with the taskings.But if you take a step back and examine the list, they are in fact quite modest statements, which the characters themselves joke about as being quite lame and without balls. It depends on how one interprets those statements I guess. A majestic view can be a view from the highest of mountains or from the depths of oceans, or it can be, in simpler terms, like one of the most beautiful evening skies I've witnessed in a long while when walking to the cinema.And to top it all, it's again a reminder, like all films dealing with death as a subject matter, to live your life to the fullest every day, and not let it go to waste. Some of us are so busy trying to figure out our purpose in life that we fail to live it, and some, never taking a step back and appreciate what we already have, until it's too late. For now, my bucket list will look something like this: Witness the Aurora Borealis, trek around the world on a modest budget, race in an F1 car, and hey, I share one with the characters too - kiss the most beautiful girl in the world. Some of course could stay impossible dreams, but that's what makes it a bucket list, right? The last chance to go all out and complete the taskings. What's yours?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no doubt in my mind, that if the Cast was not Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, this Movie would have gone straight to Video. It is a feel-good film, with a great mixture of pathos and humour interspersed with some magnificent scenery although the theme of two men dying from Cancer has probably been done before, but certainly not as well acted as this one. Nicholson (looking a lot older and heavier) is quite brilliant in a "not too lovable" characterisation, and Freeman is the perfect foil as a family man who becomes just a little lost. It was good to see Sean Hayes in a small but telling performance, and hope this leads him to better parts in the future. Being just short of 100 minutes , it did not make the mistake that a few films are doing now of being too long, and therefore losing some impact. See it and enjoy some great acting.</fullReview>

It's no surprise that a movie with highly talented actors like Nicholson and Freeman would be good. It's not that I'm normally attracted to movies with a deep inner meaning, but this is one movie which didn't beat you over the head with it. I mean, here are two guys who are facing death and decide to go out &amp; do all the things they've ever wanted to. Some scenes are dramatic, others are funny, and in the end, the deep inner meaning just kind of shines through without a bunch of sappy sentimentalism. And yes, I did get a bit watery eyed near the end, which means this is a good story that you can get into &amp; feel part of.</fullReview>

I think the Bucket List is something we all think of from time to time......what we would like to do before we die. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll get to do everything I want to before I go, but to see these two live out their list was so gratifying.

		<shortDescription>Good, old-fashioned writing, acting and directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're looking for an action film with car-chases, blood and gore, death, seduction, stunning locations, then maybe The Bucket List isn't for you. Although, to be fair, it does have car-chases, blood and gore, death, seduction, and some of the most stunning locations the world has to offer. But it's not an action film. It's about people coming to terms with death, and what they want from life, and why do you have to wait until you're dying before you go and get what you wanted from life. And is there a purpose in life, other than "let's eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die." Obviously it's Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, so the acting is going to be brilliant. We don't know how he does it, but somehow Jack Nicholson never looks like he's acting. He looks like he really is the character - without the boring bits of course.The locations are almost worth going for on their own. You almost want to die yourself, so you can have an excuse to break out of the rat-race and spend all your money on living. But then you think - hey, why do I have to wait until I die? Why am I earning all this money anyway, because I have to work so hard I never have time to enjoy life, so why don't I - then you realise that's what the film is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good acting, somehow entertaining, but nothing special.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was't bored. I was't impressed. OK to watch, nothing special.Freeman and Nicholson are doing a great job acting, but any middle class actor could play their characters. The cast alone guarantees that the expenses will get more than payed, the movie itself is merely above average.It's no typical "road trip" like said in the plot outline. Sometimes the list feels more like being a reason to put the actors in front of a blue-screened exotic location. Nice to see, worth a big laugh how you can imagine the not-American world as being a big Las Vegas. On the other hand the list is a cool idea many people come up in their life and some points are more philosophic than "seeing Europe".The Dialogues are no WOW-Experience but most of the time you don't feel like speaking them along, watching The Bucket List for the first time. Some jokes also worth a laugh.There are some turning Points but the Movie is surely character driven. The center of the movie is the contrast between the rich, amoral clinic-owner Cole (Nicholson) and the high educated car mechanic Chambers (Freeman). It tries to be an emotional movie but i simply did not identify enough with the stereotypic characters to be moved (other people may do).If you are looking for a real good laugh, for action or for "culture", no way. The acting is good though and fans of Nicholson or Freeman won't be that disappointed.The movie is a good Friday-evening Entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an interesting and very well done film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first review I have done of a film so if it is not as good as some others I apologize, however having had the opportunity to see this movie last evening I wanted to comment on it and recommend it to anyone looking for a drama/comedy.Coming into this film I have to admit that I had high expectations with the Director and leading roll actors and I was not disappointed. The narration by Freeman was reminiscent of Shawshank Redemption, the comedic timing of Nicholson is still bang on and the charm and skill of both these actors in this film really works against and with each other to give great screen chemistry. The writing and pacing are both well done and the supporting cast as well complimented this film to make it an all around great movie.This film sort of brings to light a subconscious want of people to always "list" the things they want to do before they die in a very real way. Taken of course a little to the extreme for creative license but a concept that I think any person can relate with. It touches base in a lot of areas and is bound to hit home on some level with just about all viewers. Having had a fair amount of experience with persons near the end of their lives it was a refreshing look at the concept of death and the behavior of those knowing what is in store for them in the not so distant future.Without getting to deep or over analytical about the film I would say it is a great film that most any viewer can find something to like about it. 9/10 is my rating and a strong recommendation to see this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take two powerhouse actors and then build a story around them...it works...sorta</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Immediately I knew I had to see this. I mean you're talking about the amazing and unstoppable Morgan Freeman, a terrific actor, and the unbelievable, infamous and cool as hell Jack Nicholson together. And that is exactly what this is...see them together. Unfortunately the story lacks a little originality or depth. I think they wanted to put them together and then built a story from there rather than finding an existing story that would suit them. I mean the story is good, it's decent and fun and touching at times but it's a very predictable, simple, straight forward script with no surprises really and just doesn't give Nicholson and Freeman a lot to work with and that's kind of like not giving a bee any flowers. Still the film is very watchable and you have to see it for the two of them period. If it was anyone else in the title roles I honestly think The Bucket List might have been downgraded to a Sunday Night TV Movie...if that. But fortunately for the film makers they do have them. The thing that surprises me as well considering the script is that director Rob Reiner is certainly no stranger to film making and is a brilliant director and he is at the forefront of character creation and bringing the most out of characters...When Harry Met Sally, A Few Good Men, Ghosts of Mississippi and so many more...and yet they don't get a lot of depth out of the characters.Morgan Freeman plays blue collar mechanic Carter Chambers who is given months to live. Chambers is tough and strong and quiet in his own way and a loving family man who worked his whole life to support his family. Freeman plays the role like a pro and although the character isn't given a lot of depth he does his best with it. Jack Nicholson is the rich and powerful Edward Cole who is cut down to size when he too is given months to live. Cole has the most changes to go through considering he goes from powerful, and egotistical to humble and has to cope with his own death. Still both men are likable and they become fast friends. Nicholson and Freeman seem like old friends right from the start and they are fun to watch together and it's really like hanging out with the two of them for an hour and a half which is not too shabby. Sean Hayes is also very good in the role of Cole's right hand man. The scenes with him and Nicholson are classic and hilarious. Unfortunately since the main characters don't get a lot of depth...his character gets even less. Beverly Todd is portrayed as kind of a shrew as Freeman's wife. She's good in the role but it seems like she's always yelling and harping at Freeman and not really the way the character should have been portrayed.I just think that overall they didn't put a lot of effort into The Bucket List. They figured with the main cast, and Reiner directing it would just automatically be perfect and sadly it's not and it could have been. It's still a cute movie with a lot of fun moments with two amazing actors and it's a feel good movie despite the dark undertone of the two of them being terminally ill. You'll leave the theater feeling good for having seen this movie. Unfortunately it also falls victim to a common comedy faux pas and that is you see most, if not all the funny parts in the trailer and if you see enough trailers by the time those parts come up...it's almost like you've seen it before. It almost pains me to say this but to truly enjoy this it's probably more of a DVD rental for a Saturday night. Still it's worth seeing especially if you're a Freeman or Nicholson fan. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are nice together, but - sad to say - they have nothing special to play here. The script and characters are flat, predictable and plastic. I was surprised only by cheap digital effects viewed innocently in front of my eyes instead of real sightseeing which I was expecting.Nicholson was better in similar role of miserably lonely "Shmidt" few years ago. Freeman plays a copy of wise and distanced character from "The Shawshank Redemption". And - finally - more about evening of life and catching last chances you can find in "Nobody's Fool" with Paul Newman, where those mysteries are told in much much more intelligent, witty and heart-touching way.Besides what's above, I have to say that this movie gave me something like few minutes of... something. It was done in a hard way so there were only minutes instead of hours or days, but there it was - few minutes of asking myself so called "big questions". But I'm sure it could be not bad, or even better asking them at home, while watching DVD</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bucket List, The (2007) * 1/2 (out of 4) Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman learn that they're both going to die of cancer so they set out on a trip to see and do everything they've wanted to in life. As I type this little review I've been out of the theater for about ten minutes and I must admit that my blood is boiling in anger. This is an incredibly bad, worthless, mean spirited and downright tasteless movie that really, really rubbed me the wrong way. The first forty-five minutes we see the two legends on screen bleeding, puking and slowly dying. Is this a good way to start a comedy? Seeing this stuff gets one in a rather depressed mood and at the same time we have childish acts going on, which are meant to make us laugh but all these jokes did was come off very distasteful to me. When the road trip/buddy picture starts the material was just weak and not very funny. We of course then come to the forced ending, which begs us to cry but by this point I was wanting out of the theater as quick as I could get out. This movie jerks the viewer around so much that it's rather shocking to see the talent involved. If it weren't for the two stars then i'd probably be ripping this film a lot more but I'll be respectful to them and say I hope this isn't their last film. Nicholson is all over the place and really delivers one of the worst performances I've seen from him since his pre fame era. Freeman seems to be sleepwalking through the role but I suspect both actors knew this material was weak and were doing whatever they could to try and save it. Freeman plays the wise, quiet guy and Nicholson goes over the top to try a milk any laugh that he can get out of the script. It just doesn't work. A really big misfire as far as I'm concerned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geezer travelogue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a partial (but only partial) return to form, Rob Reiner has made a salt-and-pepper buddy picture-cum-comedy of sentimental uplift about two old men dying of cancer. The Bucket List is a vehicle for two big box office Hollywood seventy-year-olds, Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson. The contrasts between their on screen characters are neat enough to provide some promise of action. Edward Cole (Nicholson) is a sour divorcée with megabucks: he owns the hospital that treats him and a bunch more. According to a carefully stressed regulation that his system puts two patients to a room in every one of his institutions no matter what, he's assigned to a bed next to Carter Chambers (Freeman), a garage mechanic with a calm, forgiving manner and one quirk: he's a fact nut who loves to match wits with the contestants on TV's "Jeopardy" and can't stop reciting nuggets of information in between broadcasts. Middle class enough for his two sons to have become professional men, he has a fretful wife who's a longtime nurse. Cole's main associate seems to be a factotum he addresses abusively. Cole's an angry, acid dude whose long-gone wives are now merely the subject of innuendos. Can we guess the script was penned with these actors in mind? Cole and Chambers of course soon discover a bond that transcends their differences: their imminent mortality.A list of things to do before you die is a standard self-help motivational gimmick to lead one to a fuller life. Only this time, "before you die" isn't just a manner of thinking. After some get-acquainted scenes in the hospital room that establish these guys are actually sick (a point often neglected in the rest of the action), Cole and Chambers are informed of the same prognosis: six months to a year. The "bucket list" is Chambers' idea, but it's Cole's prodding and his money that lead the two men to embark on the project of doing the stuff on the list, plus some more items Cole adds. Even kissing a beautiful woman turns out to be an expensive proposition. Implied axiom: achieving your dreams is a whole lot easier and faster if you happen to be supplied with big bucks and deprived of emotional ties.Cole won't reveal how much he's got, but it's obviously plenty. The sudden buddies fly round the world in a super-posh private plane--or rather, a movie set made to resemble the interior of one. (The movie cuts corners on locations.) Along goes Cole's abused factotum, but not Chambers' former nurse wife, and there's a problem. Cole is virtually unattached. Chambers has a whole big family he's leaving behind to go on this spree that includes scenes (most of them obviously faked) that feature the Pyramids, the Taj Mahal, the French Riviera, and the Himalayas. It starts off with a comical jump from a plane, each geezer tied to a handler, and another sequence where they mess up two racing cars. They could have died right there but both are saved to expire back in the hospital, though we don't observe that, only a cute joint interment, in an illegal mountain location, of their twin ashes in matching Chock Full o'Nuts coffee cans. What never gets quite resolved is the question why this tripping was really better than spending quality time with the people in your life, or, for Cole, performing some acts of human kindness for a change. He does, but they're rushed in at the end so fast we barely see them happening.Of course Freeman and Nicholson are pros, and they know how to deliver their lines with good timing and rhythm. But the material is too superficial to provide them with depth of character or a rounded relationship. It's all just banter, really--as if friendship were a matter of trading one-liners (a venerable idea in Hollywood).If any wisdom comes out of all this, it eludes me. Well, there are a few thoughts about the process of dying . The Kubler-Ross grief cycle is even mentioned: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance--it's another of Chambers' factoids. Chambers really does know some interesting stuff, and whenever the dialog goes dead, out comes some more. One nugget finally helps the pair live their "bucket list" dream of "laughing till they cry." That's a cheapie, and a whole lot easier than climbing the Himalayas: but with Cole's money, they could always get a helicopter to drop them up there. Chambers also gets to have a big Thanksgiving dinner with his Hollywood-perfect extended family, and Jack, AKA Cole, gets to deliver a weepy eulogy of his three-month pal, who kicks the bucket first, while Chambers, as in the current romantic tear-jerker 'P.S. I Love You,' leaves behind a letter that persuades Cole to renew some of his own family ties. Hooray and boo-hoo.The faults of this movie are many. The travel sequences are hasty as well as inauthentic, and the "bucket list" itself--not arranged in any order, and barely glimpsed--isn't given the weight it needs to show why two dying men would want to spend a good slice of their last days following it. Apart the fact that the connection of the two men is forced and unlikely, each experience is dropped to go on to the next. Unexamined life? You've got it. The implication that dreams cost lots of money would be pernicious if it were not so silly and obvious. To go from the shallow to the profound, another treatment of the theme of what to do before you die is Kurosawa's masterpiece, 'Ikiru.' In that film, Mr. Watanabe's best solution turns out to be the one most ready to hand. Nothing comes out of 'The Bucket List's' travelogue but some hasty male bonding. It's never clear what these guys have in common other than the dialog written for them, the gags and the oddball facts. Even from what's obviously just an over-promoted Christmas comedy, we deserve better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It feels too soon for either Nicholson or Freeman to bottom out in an old fogy comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two cancer patients--a scabrous hospital tycoon and a low-keyed car mechanic with an encyclopedic mind--become friends while laid-up, later embarking on a personal journey together to try new things before death comes calling. Wanly-drawn 'serious comedy' with the buffoonish notion that skydiving and race car-driving are what dying men want to do in their last days. It's important to note that Jack Nicholson's character is exceedingly rich, and is willing to foot the bill for the trip, making any connection with reality a pipe-dream. This may, in fact, be one of Nicholson's very worst performances; he's still shouting at the top of his lungs, but this time only Morgan Freeman is listening. Freeman comes off better, and some of the early scenes have promise, but the whole thing collapses once the two men leave the hospital. Freeman's wife, the proverbial third-wheel, berates her husband for neglecting his family, and she has a point...practically the only point in evidence. * from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Saved by the performances of Nicholson and Freeman.Two men (played by Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson) share a ward in hospital. Both have cancer and once they get out of hospital they decide to compile a bucket list and start ticking items off...Despite its topic, The Bucket List is not that profound or emotional. It has its moments, but is, for the most part, light and lacking in substance.What makes the movie bearable, even interesting, are the performances of Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson. Both play to their strengths - Nicholson the surly, powerful one, Freeman the spiritual, sensitive one - and do so very well. Their interactions add substance and humour into what was otherwise a fairly dull movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all don't get me wrong. I think director Rob Reiner did a pretty descent effort in the making of this film. The problem with these type of inspirational movies is that they always manage to depress because they make you think about life and how soon it's going to end. It doesn't advise, good or bad, on how to live your life for it makes the crucial point of not caring about money if you are to spend the best 6 months of your life thanks to your new billionaire friend. I don't really understand the IMDb rating on this one and I'm not gonna spoil it in case you're interested but if you think the film was great and I should get over the rating because 50,000 people voted and clearly my opinion is the minority, I let you with this quote from the film: "If life has taught me anything it's that 95 percent of the people are always wrong."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I missed the first part of this movie so these observations should be thought of as qualified. I'm only making them because the structure, the whole pattern of the movie is so familiar that I think I could have written the first half hour myself. Anyone could.Rob Reiner, the director, is nothing if not consistent. Probably his most effective movie -- not necessarily the most entertaining -- was "Misery." I loved the scenes of conflict between Kathy Bates and James Caan. Not so much the bit with the sledge hammer, although that was handled skillfully, but the scene in which Bates heaps her calumny on Caan for demanding ordinary typing paper instead of non-corrasable bond. "Anything ELSE, Mister MAN?" Loved it.But Reiner is a commercially oriented director. If his work has a stamp of originality it's his opposition to authoritarianism. But always, in the end, no matter how implausibly, the ending must be cathartic.Two older guys get their pink slips from the doctors. Jack Nicholson is a one-percenter, a take-charge guy who runs a business and has a turbulent past. He's reckless, almost to the point of being dangerous. Morgan Freeman is more ordinary, with a loving wife, naturally depressed at his impending doom.The two men get together and draw up a list of things they feel they should do before they kick it -- sky diving, etc. They escape from the hospital with Freeman tagging along a little reluctantly. Morgan Freeman is a superb actor and so is Nicholson, but their age has reduced them to these predictable roles. Freeman is no longer the savvy, menacing pimp of "Street Smart," but by now he's got the role of the moral friend down pat. And he handles it extremely well, as he did in the stupidly title "Se7en." Nicholson has clearly lost the oomph of his earlier days but can still pull off an emotional scene with panache.The ending, by the law of financial necessity, tugs are your heart strings. As in "Grumpy Old Men," which did well enough at the box office to generate a sequel, somebody must die. But not before a lengthy, heartfelt, and thoughtful speech to his companion. A lot of stuff about faith and religion -- but no PARTICULAR religion because we don't want to offend the Sufi Moslems in the audience. I mean, Holy Outhouse Mouse, what if the dying partner prattled on about converting to Judaism or becoming a Tibetan monk! Anyway, you can see why he has to die. He has to die so that the surviving partner can give the eulogy, drawing out the tear-laden ending even farther. I don't know how the writers missed the opportunity to have the second partner slowly expire (after a heart-warming peroration) so that somebody else could give still another eulogy. How about if the guy giving the SECOND eulogy were also to expire, so that another friend could give a THIRD eulogy? How about an unending iteration of eulogies? One of them at least ought to be good enough to put both Lincoln and Pericles to shame.</fullReview>

The trailer/preview made it look kind of silly...why they show the car racing scene in the trailer is way beyond me...so I was hesitant to rent this one. As it turned out...the trailer did NOT do this gem of a film justice. The movie is very serious and almost a bit enlightening. So...I loved this movie. Great idea for 2 people to go around the world and do what they always wanted to do. However...to be clear...like the 'Shawshank Redemption' the conversations are what makes the film. Some great writing and Rob Reiner...excellent as always. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are so much fun to listen to and I am so glad to have seen them on the screen together. Very well thought out conversations so kudos to the writing staff. Sure some scenes are disturbing and hard to watch in the hospital...especially if you have a loved one who has or is dealing with cancer, but after they get out...it is all about deep conversations that may lead the viewers into their own deep conversations. Depressing yes, but not goofy like the preview or trailer was...it was so much more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dying Old Men Give Life One Last Desperate Cry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oscar Winners Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman gain their second childhood as they play two terminal cancer patients who head out on their own away from the responsibilities of their families and other interests.The diversity of these two actors is explored in the joining of their souls through the similarities they do share, which includes the horrendous reactions to chemotherapy. While the plot seems totally far fetched and Nicholson seems to have thrown some unnecessary vulgarity in there for the shear heck of it, the acting overcomes that as they grab your hearts. This is a two character story with only a few other characters thrown in as minor support (most notably Beverly Todd as Freeman's concerned wife), so as a "Buddy" movie, it works. Like the later day pairings of Matthau and Lemmon, it is a sentimental journey where two outstanding performers take center stage, whether climbing to the top of a pyramid, explore race car driving and sky diving, They hit the ignition heading towards death, enjoying every step of the way as they reach their final destination. Nicholson's humanity comes out in the conclusion in a realistic manner that shows the character's salvation and hidden humanity. But the quiet well-mannered dignity of Morgan's character is the outstanding performance and heart and soul of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bucket List is in my opinion very underrated.The story is fascinating. Two men, terminally ill, enjoying the time they have left to the fullest. The cast is fantastic. Jack Nicholson, bombarded with prizes and Morgan Freeman, one of my favorite actors of all time. The role of stubborn millionaire fits Jack Nicholson very well, and of course Morgan Freeman in role of accepter of his fate, a role he has played before( The Shawshank Redemption comes to mind). Needless to say, the acting is of superb quality. Morgan Freeman narrating parts of the movie is something he was born to do and has done in many movies. This movie tops my list of "cry-movies" as I call them. I have always said that when a movie makes me cry because it's so beautiful, it deserves a 10. When Morgan Freeman's character dies, tears were running down my face. You have that part, a movie impressing me so much but you also have the part of this movie that makes me laugh so hard.I have never had those two ends of the emotional scale hit me in one movie. On their bucket list, Morgan Freeman has written : "Laugh until I cry." When this happens (when Morgan Freeman tells Jack Nicholson from where his tea actually originates I couldn't stop laughing and I had to stop the movie to catch a breath. This movie worked out so good, Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson connecting very well. I would recommend this movie to anyone, it's a beautiful movie that is sadly very underrated.</fullReview>

The chemistry between Freeman and Nicholson is very believable and I expect they are good friends in real life. Freeman plays a mechanic who is bitter about life as his true dream is to become a history professor. The part of the film when they start doing the things on there bucket list is when the film gets really funny. I couldn't stop laughing when they both when sky diving. Freeman's face was a picture. Nicholson's character is actually quite complex. He has all the money in the world but during the film we learn that he is very lonely, and he masks this but making jokes. His personal assistant, 'Thomas'as Nicholson's character likes to call him is brilliant. The dry one liners he does with Nicholson is very funny.The films ending is predictable and very 'Hollywood' but all in all, a definite film to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful little film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Bucket List' does what it says on the tin really. It's an emotional journey about two elderly men with terminal cancer doing a lot of silly things before they 'kick the bucket'. It has two of the biggest stars in Hollywood starring in it and this carries the film making it a lot better than it would have been if anyone else bar Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman played starred. Their performances are as great as you would expect them to be. Nicholson in particular performs very well and it is probably one of his most unique roles. It's a rare occasion where you see him cry unless it is for comic effect. Freeman also performs well and suits his role perfectly, narrating the film as well, of course. The script is pretty basic, it can be a bit predictable at some points but the dialogue has been written really well and it flows naturally. As I said; the story can be a bit predictable but there are a few scenes which will surprise you a bit but you can pretty much guess what happens halfway through the film. This does not have a negative effect on the film as a whole however. It's not really supposed to be a film filled with lots of twists and turns.Overall, this is a delightful little film which can be really funny at some points and can also become quite tearful. It's not the greatest film of its type but it certainly should not be avoided, I shamefully left it on the shelf for two years before watching it but it really surprised me how nice this film is.</fullReview>

However, just reading the back of the box, or this review, is all you need for that.The execution in this movie is actually about a billionaire, who can afford to jet both of the main characters around the world on a whim. It doesn't seem relevant to the average person. And it focuses on the wrong kind of experiences. Theoretically, that is the message of the movie, but in practice it's mostly them jetting around.For such a profound message, this movie seems to get too distracted with the kinds of happiness money can buy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Heartwarming Drama About Living Your Last Days To The Fullest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great film. The Bucket list was shunned by many critics including Roger Ebert for its unrealistic portrayal of cancer patients and its light hearted and too positive treatment towards the issue of being diagnosed terminally ill and having a limit on how long one has left to live. While some of the humour could be regarded as inappropriate in relation to the topic and the attitudes expressed are false, it doesn't really stop audiences from seeing a nice feel good film if they're willing to lighten up.Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson portray Carter and Edward. Carter is a happily married working class mechanic whilst Edward is a corporate big shot. Both men are diagnosed with cancer and then begin having their treatment whilst they share the same hospital room. After some small talk allowing them to get to know each other and upon learning that both of them are terminally ill they decide to live the remainder of their lives doing what they always wanted to do before they 'kick the bucket'.From here we already know that both of these men are destined to die and any tension is only related to when they're gonna pass on, but during the short time we spend with them as an audience we learn about the ups and downs of the lives of both of these men. It's interesting to see a happily married man like Carter suddenly grow selfish and briefly abandon his wife in favour of seeing the world, and it's also cool to see an old and seemingly heartless grouch like Edward suddenly develop some emotion and enter a legitimate human relationship (something that has been unsuccessful many times considering his 4 divorces and non-existent relationship with his daughter).The Bucket List also got me thinking about how I would live the last few months of my own life. Granted that I'm still not even 18 and I don't have to worry about death for several decades, I could still connect to the thrill seeking lifestyle that these men desire as I would certainly be willing to do the same thing when my time comes. I'd certainly like to visit Egypt or France or Russia or any of the countries they visited and who wouldn't want to race cars or skydive sometimes in their life? I've never done any of those, but it certainly was nice to experience it cinematically through these two men whom we have formed a bond with as an audience.I don't think it needs to be said, but Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are great. They both seem to play the kind of character that they're known for. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Edward is similar to his performance in 'As Good As It Gets' and Morgan Freeman has always been good at playing a kind and seemingly aged man like he has in movies like 'Se7en'. However, I did find Beverly Todd's performance and character, Virginia to be rather unlikable and a barrier on allowing these two great characters to live it up.The Bucket List isn't any kind of masterpiece, but it is a heartwarming drama about living up your final days and it was great to experience such a movie in the company of such likable characters. Just be prepared to see something that portrays something as more positive than it should be and I'm willing to bet you'd enjoy yourself.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two very different men form an unbreakable bond and embark upon the adventure of a lifetime...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you could know in advance, would you want to know the exact day of your death? You may say yes as it would inspire you to live for the moment, or you may say no, because you would simply rather not think about it. In the case of Edward and Carter, choice is a luxury they do not have. The Bucket List is one of those hauntingly poignant films that will stay with you long after the end credits have rolled. Starring an unsurpassable cast led by Oscar-winning Hollywood icons Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, this deeply honest, human story is sure to touch even the coldest and critical of hearts.Nicholson and Freeman portray two terminally ill lung cancer patients, Edward and Carter respectively, who find themselves forming an unlikely friendship in their shared hospital room. The pair could not be more different, yet as both are forced to accept the devastating news that they have less than a year to live, a strong camaraderie develops between them. Billionaire Edward encourages Carter to embark with him upon the adventure of a lifetime in order to complete their mutual 'bucket list', a list of things they want to do before they 'kick the bucket'. In a whirlwind of spontaneity, Edward and Carter skydive, muse about love and life whilst watching the sunset over the Pyramids, race their dream cars, dine like royalty at a top class French restaurant, fly over the North Pole, witness the beauty of the Taj Mahal, motorcycle across the Great Wall of China and spot lions on safari in Africa. Through their intensely personal suffering, Edward and Carter grow to understand the common bond that exists between all humans.Dazzling performances are to be expected from the highly acclaimed Nicholson and Freeman, and they do not disappoint. Freeman, known for his role as the likable prisoner Red in The Shawshank Redemption, and Nicholson, famous for playing characters with anti-authoritarian tendencies, complement one another with a refreshing chemistry whilst managing to maintain their own unique styles. Nicholson's trademark devious grin is out in force, as is Freeman's screen-transcending aura of worldly wisdom. Nicholson has now well and truly established himself as the film world's archetypal lovable rogue, and as for Morgan Freeman, who else could Tom Shadyac have chosen to play God in Bruce Almighty? If I am being honest, the very reason I picked up The Bucket List in the first place was because I saw their names on the cover.Edward and Carter's admirable struggle to both accept and defy the inevitability of their mortality is naturally moving to watch yet the intended comic, light-hearted moments in the film fail to convince. I have no doubt that many critics would consider this a flaw. Personally, I found the tentative brushstrokes of humour all the more poignant given that they are painted upon a canvas of unimaginable personal tragedy. The duo's efforts to laugh and find joy in the face of their ordeals are powerfully emotional. Cancer however, simply isn't funny. The DVD case may guarantee 'lashings of comedy' but, unsurprisingly given the subject matter, that proves an empty promise. However, whilst you may not laugh until you cry, you will undoubtedly be left inspired by the courage of two men determined to make the best of the cards life has dealt them.I suppose the question that the film leaves you with is this. What would be on your bucket list? For in the words of The Shawshank Redemption's Andy Dufresne, you can 'get busy living, or get busy dying'.Jess Denham http://aspire-blog.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Its okay but its not Nicholsons best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To start with I didn't hear about this film through the internet or TV spots. In fact I heard about it on a film advertisement channel on my TV and that sends a bad message about this film already.But to be fair this film was actually pretty good. The characters were pretty clear: Morgan Freeman played the average working class man and Jack Nicholson played the rich billionaire type. And this film is the only film I have seen with Jack Nicholson playing an ordinary guy instead of a mad raving psycho.Well anyway the basic plot of this movie is simple: These 2 men come from different backgrounds one rich, one poor, but when they both meet in the hospital after having an illness they both begin to craft a friendship. But when Morgan Freeman writes a list of things to do before they "kick The Bucket" the common phrase that means to basically die. The list is obviously called The Bucket List and immediately the duo begin to complete the tasks they set themselves.But the ending is plainly obvious and this film will only appeal to around about 60% of film lovers.As I said before I hadn't heard about it on the internet and when I heard about it on a film advertisement channel on TV it was already out on DVD. This was the same with Juno (2008) for me and I found it quite annoying.Well anyway not the best film but its okay.Normally I'd say go watch it but this film doesn't appeal to every single film lover out there. So if your interested go watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, it's clichéd, but so what? You put Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman together and the resulting picture is going to offer SOME kind of take away. I think they had their say here pretty effectively - we all have our dreams and aspirations, and the years fly by pretty quickly until one realizes that those same dreams fly by just as fast. Every once in a while it's not so bad to run up against one of those speed bumps in the middle of life to jog your consciousness about what really matters. If this picture is one of those speed bumps, that's not so bad. And seriously, without it, how would you ever have found out about Kopi Luwak?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing, Inspirational, and Brilliant.This film is beautiful, the plot description seems straight-forward, but there is so much more depth to this film. You don't need to be old or dying to enjoy this film, you just need to understand that life is more than selfishness (and if you don't, you will!).The end credit song "Say What You Need to Say" fits the movie brilliantly, and so does the ending. The movie is brilliant, from the beginning to the end, nothing plays out as you think it would.This movie keeps you thirsty for more, and Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman, and Sean Hayes do some talented acting.Sean Hayes said in an interview that he has the time to sit back and take roles that he truly believes in and he felt The Bucket List was one of those rare films. He was correct.What more can you expect from Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman besides an incredible and ingenious film? Watch this film, enjoy it, learn something or some things from it, and spread the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best road movie since the 1980's Blues Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen plenty of good films recently, but none compare to the magical road trip that Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman embark on in "The Bucket List".Writer Justin Zackham has created potentially one of the funniest, cleverest and most charming road movies since The Blues Brothers (1980). The film focuses on Edward Cole, an entrepreneur, and Carter Chambers, a mechanic, who both are terminally ill. Inspired by a list-of-things-you-need-to-do-before-you-die written by Carter, Edward suggests they engage into a holiday of fun activities, such as stunt driving and sky diving. The plot is certainly original and simple. Simplicity is sometimes the best, and this is a perfect example.Beautiful locations and awe-inspiring cinematography are just some of the brilliant elements that Zackham trusted director Rob Reiner to find to help bring to life this touching story. The cinematography is in fact so powerful that it changed the mood of quite a few scenes. Wonderful sub plots triggered by the two patients' history and social lives make us feel sympathy, even for the short fused and nasty Edward Cole (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson). However, in a really clever movement not to have us crying our eyes out, Zackham Being whisked around the world, from the top of the Egyptian Pyramids to a motorbike ride across The Great Wall Of China, this film stole my heart, and I'm sure it will do yours too. This is a must see, and definitely put seeing it on your bucket list!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found it hard to come to terms with the 7.5 rating this movie has received on IMDb. Then again, as Jack Nicholson says in the movie, "95% of the people are wrong about most things in the world." One of the best movies ever made. Most movies that try to strike a balance between comedy and profundity fail miserably at it but Rob Reiner seems to have got it just right. The movie has its flaws but it still manages to touch a chord and make you look at life (and death) differently. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson both live up to the very high standards they've set for themselves. A must-watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll have to admit that I knew very little about the premise of this movie before I watched it, so I had not critic's hype to blur the story for me. My partner and I watched it together. The movie is a bit slow at first and doesn't pick up speed until the two main characters begin to interact. After that nothing short of an earthquake would drag you away from it. It is almost documentary in it's telling and it works. What makes it work is the actors, they ease into their roles almost with an almost uncomfortable confidence..The final scenes are highly emotional and justifiably so.. there is no fairy tale ending to it. The very last scene almost releases you from the emotional ride the movie gave you.. After watching it, my partner and I discussed writing our own bucket lists and then sat down an did one each... It was a great inspiration to us both... A must see movie!</fullReview>

Simple yet the way they carried the story was unbelievably excellent.The cinematography was beautiful almost flawless, and the story line is marvelous; from a simple opening to the exiting parts in the middle than to a part of sadness, all movies are like this yet the way the directors presented it, bravo.

		<shortDescription>A Movie must watch..!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've very recently seen this movie in its Home DVD version. Yeah, it turned out to be a wonderful life time experience of having been with two elderly people who knew and were awaiting their death.The comparison between the one who is rich in his money and fame, played by Jack Nicholson, and the one who is rich in his heart and mind, played by Morgan Freeman, were really great. The places where their conversations happen and the way they tend to be floating around makes the audience to be flowing in the air of thought-provoking look into life.Their list of last wishes and the things they, thereafter, start to achieve them looked firmly appealing and that has very carefully mixed with the ingredients of fun, joy, emotions and sentiments.There are a lot one can be looking out in this movie. After watching this movie, i wanted to be alone and think about myself, at least for sometime it made me to think out what is that i am really wanna achieve in my life.This should have already been in your list of must watch, even it hasn't been so far, right now add it and watch it with your mind and heart open. You will feel the difference this movie has brought into me..!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is about two men with terminal illnesses going on a road trip to make their lives complete."The Bucket List" is a special film, because there are not a lot of films about how to deal with impending death. Though the topic may be grim, "The Bucket List" approaches it from a positive and uplifting angle. It inspires viewers to discover and think what is important in life. How the two men become the best of friends is portrayed convincingly. "The Bucket List" is a touching drama about life and death.

		<shortDescription>It will be a classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a really nice film that I would recommend to anyone who is older than 30 or has experienced a personal tragedy Cancer. The story goes along the lines of two very different people and how they are drawn together with brain cancer and that they are staring at death in the face with only 6 to 12 months to live. I accept that this isn't an original concept in that two strangers meet and spend their last days living it up however i refute that this is not an original story that is "heart warming", "tear jerking" &amp; "rolling on the floor with laughter" that will stand the test of time and one day mark as a classic for future generations to come.Consider this ... Have you seen a love story that has the following; Boy meets girl, they fall in love and then they break up and it looks all but over and then they get back together to live happily ever after. Oh yes we have seen that in about 99% of love stories over and over again. Now if you say that this movie has been done once or twice and you then realize that it could be done better so why not do it again?Casting Jack Nicholson for role is perfect and he plays this character to a tee. It reminds me so much of my uncle Bobby who had a series of strokes who was plan stubborn in showed little or no emotion to anyone. However just months before his death i went to see him in hospital and for the first time in my life I held his hand and he cried. Having a chemo kid also makes me relate to the cancer jokes and relevance to the treatment. As you can see you might need to relate to the characters and when the younger reviewers gain some experience they just might appreciate it more than before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave this a 10 for a load of reasons. Not just because this movie deserved it, but I think it should be a requirement for people who feel stagnate in their lives. Most people reach a point where they become complacent or feel hopelessness, and this movie inspires the thought that maybe there is a better life out there. Hopefully most will come to this realization before they are terminal, but if you're really honest with yourself, we are all terminal. Life starts to end the moment you are born. It is what you do between birth and death that makes all the difference. Live life, don't be a bystander. I think the choice of these two actors was the best choice ever. They both have a quality to make you laugh one moment and cry the next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Indeed for the Bucket</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's imagine you haven't seen the trailer. Furthermore let's say you've never heard of the two leading actors before and you don't know what you're in for exactly. If that is indeed the case, then you can call yourself lucky! You're gonna like this movie a lot more, just because of those facts ...Now to the others. The majority who actually do know Mr. Jack N. and Mr. Morgan F. Normally you can say, put those two in a movie and nothing can go wrong. Well indeed this movie does not stink (the lead actors alone are the guarantee for that), but it's not great either.While you can cheer the filmmakers for putting to older men in the lead(s) and counter the "let's cast the cover-magazine top model" thing that goes on, it's not enough to justify everything.Unfortunately the movie does not know, if it is a comedy or a drama. And that shows in many scenes. The fact that the trailer indicated it's more a comedy, doesn't help either.A shame then, because I liked the idea and I hoped and wished for something better. You can still watch the movie and be somewhat entertained, but with those "ingredients" you'll be excused if you thought it'd be a lot better!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A long time working mechanic Carter Chambers (Oscar-Winner:Morgan Freeman) discovers that he has cancer due from chain smoking. While battling Cancer in the hospital, he shares the room with a billionaire Edward Cole (Three Time Oscar-Winner:Jack Nicholson). At first, Edward wants to have his own room. Since he builds Hostipals and other things for a living room. Edward's long suffering loyal assistant Thomas (Sean Hayes) thinks it's a good idea to share rooms with Carter. Since the public will think otherwise of Edward's reputation. Then Carter and Edward starts getting along, since they have many things in common. As both of their healths are getting better for them but Carter finds out that he doesn't have long to live. Carter decides to writes a "Bucket List", which Carter wants to do wonderful and meaningful things before he dies. Edward decides to Carter's dreams come true before he dies, while doing things together. Which Carter's wife (Beverly Todd) doesn't thinks it's a good idea to spin time with Edward instead of her and their family before Carter's passes on.Directed by Rob Reiner (Misery, The Princess Bride, Stand by Me) made an entertaining comedy that mixes drama quite well with a little bit of fantasy thrown in for good measure. This unlikely premise by first-time screenwriter:Justin Zackham works thanks to Nicholson and Freeman good performances. Which both actors have some fine moments and touching moments together. I also think this one of Reiner's better films in years. He hasn't made a feature i liked since "Ghosts of Mississipi", that's saying a lot. Which Reiner has his shares of good pictures and bad ones for sure. It's also the kind of movie, where the audiences will be pleased more than the film critics.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer (also in Pan &amp; Scan) and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD features are small, including a brief interview with the screenwriter and a music video. This was Reiner's most successful feature at the box office since "A Few Good Men". DVD could have used more special features but there's an few additional ones for the Blu-ray edition. Fans of the two lead actors will love it. Others might be pleased with Reiner's latest work.

		<shortDescription>Not a Bad Film But I was Hoping for More</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the previews, I thought this movie might approach the quality of "About Schmidt," which featured Jack Nicholson at or around his best. Morgan Freeman can be good, too, but he has become hopelessly typecast as the perennially color blind black man whom any decent white person can't help but love like a brother. That said, I tried to get into this flick as best I could. At first, the chemistry between the two principals seemed a tad shallow, but as the movie progressed, their apparent camaraderie smoothed over most of the apparent wrinkles. The supporting cast, however, didn't quite measure up. Although Nicholson's assistant handled his acting duties well, I became less than impressed with the job done by Freeman's lifelong spouse, whom he abandoned to go around the world with his newfound friend. The first real laugh was the way Nicholson looks in a helmet -- pretty ridiculous. Addressing the actual "bucket list" left something to be desired, as well, save for the African safari sequence set to "The Lion Sleeps Tonight." But just like the rest of the travelogue shots, it looked to be put together digitally. Really, in this day and age, a movie about world travel ought to take the viewer on an authentic journey, not merely be pasted together on somebody's PC. Despite the above mentioned flaws, the movie is enjoyable, if more than a little corny. It's basic message is that what one sees and accomplishes in life ultimately matters very little. It's true meaning, if there is one, can be found in the love of one's friends and family. Sounds wonderful, doesn't it? This theme is hardly a big stretch for a society hopelessly stuck on "family values," even considering the fact that a significant fraction of the country's citizens are left out of the mix (those who don't have many friends or much of a family). The fact is, most people can barely tolerate the members of their immediate family and despise their in-laws, even though Hollywood continues to serve up this maudlin crap that everyone would love everyone else if only we could rise above our petty differences and silly squabbles. Bunk! The differences got there for a good reason and aren't about to vanish for more than a few hours or days, at most. To have Morgan Freeman happily sitting down to dinner with his allegedly wonderful family just before he dies, to see Jack Nicholson easily patch things up with his estranged daughter and embrace the granddaughter he never knew he had, this stuff may make all the simpletons in the audience get a warm, fuzzy feeling, but after shedding a few tears over it, a person who must live in the real world will have to admit that it is a load of cowflop. Otherwise, "The Bucket List" is a nice enough movie. We got it out of one of those new DVD rental machines at the market, and for a buck, who can complain?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bucket, Brimming Over, of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Selecting a category for this very fine film results in the all-encompassing label 'mixed media', for lack of a better term. It is smart (with an excellent script by Justin Zackham), addresses some important social issues, and it has moments of touching tenderness and equal moments of very sold comedy. AND it greatly benefits from the casting of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, two consummate actors playing out a theme that is unexpectedly a solid study of friendship and love. Carter (Morgan Freeman) narrates the story: Carter gave up his dreams for a college education and major career to support his surprise child from his wife Virginia (Beverly Todd) and has worked as a mechanic to support his own family, including his son Roger (Alfonso Freeman, Morgan's son in real life also!). After his children have all become successful, Carter is suddenly diagnosed with terminal cancer. He is hospitalized for chemotherapy, only to be placed in the same room with the wealthy and cantankerous owner of the hospital, Edward (Jack Nicholson) who also has been diagnosed with terminal cancer and is also in the hospital for chemotherapy. Edward's only 'friend' (he has basically alienated the world through his behavior) is his assistant Thomas (an excellent Sean Hayes) who tends to his every need. Gradually the two disparate men grow into a friendship united by the common bond that they both must face impending death. Together they create 'the bucket list' - things they want to do before dying, and because of Edward's wealth, they leave the hospital on a worldwide adventure of skydiving, racing cars, visiting the pyramids, etc. The manner in which these two elderly men bond casts a warm glow over the film without ever touching on the maudlin risk of communication. They simply grow in their appreciation of life as they learn from each other. Freeman and Nicholson are in peak form here and the supporting cast is very fine. But special credit must go to director Rob Reiner for giving us yet another film about humanism that would enrich the lives of anyone who takes the time to watch this very fine film.

		<fullReview>I saw The Bucket List as I like Rob Reiner's movies a lot and I love Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Also because of the subject matter, which I think is something that a lot of cancer-sufferers or those who lost a family member or friend to it can relate to, having had a close friend(much older) who died four years ago after a very long illness I certainly did.I thought The Bucket List was wonderful. It isn't for me among Reiner's best not like Stand By Me, Misery and This is Spinal Tap, however it is nowhere near the disaster North was. The film is beautifully filmed and the scenery is striking. The soundtrack also adds to the poignancy, the film is exceptionally well written having some humorous moments as well as a number of genuinely touching ones without falling into the trap of cloying over-sentimentality.The story is well paced, without dragging too much or feeling too rushed, and is often very heartfelt. Reiner's direction is excellent, likewise with the performances of Nicholson and Freeman(they work so well together) and a surprisingly good performance from Sean Hayes(not that he's bad usually, I know him for comedy mostly and to see him have a more understated role than usual surprised me).Overall, a wonderful film that touched and warmed my heart. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward is a 70 years old billionaire who suffers from a terminal cancer and has no family of his own. Carter also suffers from a terminal cancer but a mechanic who has a loving family. These two meet up at a hospital and shares a room for a long time until they discover that they have reached the final year of their lives. Then they decide to do a list of things which is called a 'Bucket List' before they die and sets off with. For Carter it was a trip of his life time with all expenses paid and for Edward it's just luxury life style and temporary get away from the shadow of death. While in this journey they discover some meanings of life mixed up with experience and become very good friends.As the plot sounds and the story goes the movie is quite entertaining. The old dudes played by Morgan Freeman (Carter) and Jack Nicolson (Edward) are gritty , miserable yet funny. The script is intelligently written at times which throw good lines out of each of them. Morgan and Jack being veteran reputed actors undoubtedly does their roles very well. Jack is mean and low at values at heart portraying Edward and Morgan is intelligent and patient portraying Carter. There are no other characters which is worthy of mentioning as supporting actors because the whole movie is strongly depend on the old duo throughout. When you look at it from a point of a dying person who has regrets of his life and want to do something to at least to fix them while he can 'Bucket List' is a very emotional movie. Maybe even it will give you a tear or two at the end. But if you look at the whole movie and the plot in practical angle it becomes kind of a joke. That's the main reason why 'Bucket List' will not be an all-time memorable drama. Take terminal cancer for example and how it effect the oldies. After they were told that they have only 6-12 months to live they go sky diving. I don't have to be a doctor to understand that a patient at that age and stage of a cancer has more important and painful stuff to deal with every day of the rest of his life than going on a trip around the earth. And things which is less hassle to their health and practically achievable than trying to climb the Himalayas! And then it's true that these two build up some friendship and does a thing or two to comfort themselves while still living but those things does not really have a weight to call as 'life changing'. So if Carter thinks he has become a changed man after he met Edward then I got puzzled coz Carter was a good man any way. What the hell did Edward taught him that he already didn't knew? My advice is to take 'Bucket List' for its surface value. Sit back and enjoy its interesting moments and emotional times rather than going in to detail. If not you might actually think that you can do all the crazy stuff after you get cancer and that is not good. You really need to stay at home and be with your family you know what I mean.

		<shortDescription>Terminally unoriginal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this one because I recalled it receiving pretty good reviews when it first came out. Despite this, I had my reservations: films like this are either original and inspirational, or routine and over-sentimental, with the split being 90/10 in favour of the latter. Well, this effort very definitely falls into the routine and over-sentimental category. I should have known ? Morgan Freeman in a film and Morgan Freeman narrating a film has, for the most part, been bad news since around 1996.Freeman and Nicholson play a couple of ageing men who each learn they have only months to live. Nicholson's Edward Cole is a successful multi-millionaire businessman with four ex-wives and an estranged daughter, while Freeman's Carter Chambers is a humble but intelligent mechanic who has sacrificed his personal ambitions for the sake of raising a family and is beginning to feel a little resentful. Both are unhappy people before they receive their letter of intent from the reaper but their imminent deaths act as a spur for the fuddy-duddy buddies to perform some liberating deeds before taking their bows which they compile on a 'bucket list'.What follows is as entirely predictable as what has gone before, and the film's mediocrity is countered only by the usual likable performance from Nicholson and the pleasant lilt of Freeman's voice. The problem is that this film strives for life-affirming humour without having the faintest idea about where to begin. The entire story comes across as mechanical, as if writer Justin Zackham has drawn up a checklist of his own and has slavishly laboured to include every item on that list into his screenplay. Had these items been original he might have gotten away with it, but every incident on screen has been done before ? and better ? in films dating back to the silent era.If you want to see a decent film about terminally-ill guys going out with one last hurrah seek out a little-known film called Hawks ? it's everything this film wishes it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as it could have been, but not as good as it could have been either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Note: I saw this film on an airplane, so some of it had to have been cut, though I don't think my rating would have changed had it been the full film, and judging by what I saw, I have no desire to see the full cut either.Occasionally, films put together two or more high-profile actors in a movie together because they have never been together in a movie before. It's a potentially lucrative practice; legendary actors that survive the times are usually talented enough to act off anyone.However, often times these pairings are made only by big paychecks in order to bring money with bad scripts, and as a result, the films are almost never as good as they have the potential to be. "The Bucket List" is such a case, though the end result could have been a lot worse than it is.Everything about this film screams familiarity and safeness, which is probably the idea, and undoubtedly why the producers gave such a big budget to this movie. Admittedly even I can enjoy this sort of thing, as long as it's appealing enough. Unfortunately, "The Bucket List" has so many huge lapses in logic and it relies too much on unbelievable coincidences that even if it were fun, it's unforgivable.The acting is solid by the two legends, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, but the characters they play are just types, and there's really not much interesting about them. The two have chemistry, but the script doesn't allow them to do much with their characters. Even with a well-written script, there's not much that can be done. Apart from them, no one else really matters, though Beverly Todd overacts a lot, but isn't as bad as it could have been.That's how the whole movie is (and how it is with an uncanny amount of movies these days): not good, but not as bad as it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar premise, but the fine cast makes it entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the outset, it's pretty obvious where the story is going, but the strength of the film's journey getting there makes Bucket List entertaining and worth while.Two acting heavyweights, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, bring their most common personas as the principal characters, and the combination of these two, although very familiar to anyone who has seen each of them in other roles, still provides for some good contrasts that provide ample supplies of chemistry and conflict. Freeman does his optimistic mellowed grandfather type, Nicholson his over-aged pessimistic rebel without a cause, and these unlikely comrades form a bond after each is diagnosed with cancer. They join in an effort to experience unique activities on a wish list with their remaining time. The results are both sparks and heartfelt emotion.Overall, it's predictable, but these two veteran actors do it so well that it's easy to ignore the predictability. If there's a weakness to the film, it's the absence of any direction by Rob Reiner. It almost looks like he handed Freeman and Nicholson the scripts, told them to make the flick, and then just left the set. In spite of Reiner's laziness and lack of vision, not only the lead actors, but also the supporting cast all turn in fine performances. The actress playing Freeman's wife, struggling to deal with his illness and sudden vagabond behavior, was outstanding.One of the better movies of the year so far.</fullReview>

Nice enough for a cold Sunday afternoon if you're not too fussy. The leads do have a right royal good time though and must have had plenty of fun in filming this. They certainly don't stretch their acting abilities any. The script is sweet but the middle lags and the ending, oh God, the ENDING! Save me from schmaltz.

		<fullReview>Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson both play their roles beautifully, although Nicholson tends to play the same character in all his movies which makes him lean towards the "over-acting tough guy" character.Plot was good, although the beginning starts a bit dull. The story is very adventurous, and has moments when you feel inspired by the characters. The script is very good also.It's not really a theater movie, renting or buying it on DVD will give you the same experience. Whip up some popcorn and watch it with someone, that'll be all you need. Don't want to give away the plot but the main concept is that these two old men get terminally ill, have 6 months-1 year to live, they create a list of things they want to do before they die, hence the bucket list.Worth watching if you feel lazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie pushes all the right buttons. It's funny and it's moving. It has flaws like every other flick, but this is one of that rare cases when the final result makes you forget (or forgive) all of them.It's incredible how two acting titans like Nicholson and Freeman can grab your attention and make you ride with them in the big trip/journey of their lives, following a story that probably wouldn't have been of mayor interest with the presence of two other leading actors. The chemistry between them is great, and you can do nothing but sit down and enjoy the show.Sure, Nicholson isn't in the best of shapes (and I mean HIS weight and voice, not the illness of his character) and Freeman has been better in his early work, but as I said: These are mere details that shouldn't stop anyone from laughing and crying with this highly entertaining flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very meaningful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bucket List was a very heartwarming movie. I thought that The Bucket List had so much meaning to it. Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson worked so amazing together. Morgan Freeman probably did his best job he has ever done before. He didn't over act or anything like that, he did everything so perfect. Jack Nicholson did a great job as well. He always plays a great part in every movie he plays in. I loved some of the ideas they put in the bucket list. It was a very sad story. The story was so good though, having two men dying of cancer and just wanting to live their last few months to the fullest. The two mens last dying wishes are to make a bucket list. What the two men want to do is everything that they never had a chance to and they want to do before they die. It was great acting and had some great messages in it. The direction this movie was going was perfect. It was sort of slow moving in the beginning but then picked up. I thought that the movie had some pretty cool visuals. Especially when they go sky diving. Overall this was a very heartwarming movie. One of the feel good movies of 2008. It is worth your money you pay to go see it. One last thing this movie in my opinion is made for people older not quite for teens. I think older people would enjoy it more. It has more meaning for them. I think that old people would understand it more. Although I did enjoy it and I am a teenager. So go see it and have a fun time watching this movie filled with meaning.</fullReview>

The wit and implicit humour that the two class actors brought as a part of their natural persona was exceptional.The script was a little loose and could have been made into a much better movie.JN's speech at MF's funeral was very touching and was a bring out the hankies moment.All in all a good watch, but not a great movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bucket List starts with a narration from Morgan Freeman's Carter talking about Jack Nicholson's Edward while a solitary figure climbs a snow covered mountain slope. His narration has the same timelessness as that of Red's from Shawshank Redemption. Edward, on the other hand, reflects too much of Melvin from As Good as It Gets. This forms an immediate barrier in letting the movie get through to the audience, but not for long. Reiner does not waste much time on the set up - very soon these two seniors, sharing a hospital room, are diagnosed with cancer that sets the full-stop on their life-span after a few months. The rest of the movie is about the bonding between these opposite people - black polite mechanic family man &amp; white rich obnoxious business man playboy - as they go about fulfilling their 'Bucket List', a wish list of things they want to do before they 'kick the bucket'.It is not difficult for these veterans to play their parts - for one, they are great actors in their own right, and for second, they play exactly to their type. But let that not discount the wonder of their performances or from the movie that Reiner gives us. It's been some time since Reiner has given us a movie to discuss; he does so with The Bucket List. Reiner makes a very simple movie, with simple situations and modest aspirations - yet the same simplicity works in its favor. The two great actors that they are, Morgan Freeman &amp; Jack Nicholson inject subtle warmth to their dying screen-selves that makes them at once likable and identifiable.The Bucket List may not make you look back at your own life, but it may inspire you to do the things you always wanted to. And that works for me! My Rating --&gt; 4 of 5</fullReview>

In what may be The two leading actor's final great films, the chemistry between them in this movie is incredible. This movie really sends a powerful message about how to live on borrowed time and to make the most of what you have left. Even though this movie contains lot of laughs. It did contain a lot of tears and heartache, most notably the passing of carter and his funeral. I really hope that this film is awarded for an Oscar because of what it teaches and gives to the audience. So, when you combine Nicholson and freemen, a lot of laughs, some tears, and a strong message, you get rob Rainer's masterpiece the bucket list</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought that this was one of the best films I have seen in a while from Hollywood. In an era where things are dumbed down and ethical/moral questions seem to be over-looked, it is refreshing to see a film with wit and humor, heart and feeling, and actually teaches us something about life.Now I am not going to say that this movie is incredibly deep, it is actually rather simple in many ways; but I found that simplicity to be concinnous. It is a tale that should make you think about three things: What are you doing right now in life? What have you done so far? Has any of it mattered? We rarely think about what will matter to us when we are facing our own mortality; this film addresses many of these issues and gives some answers. Will they be your answers? See the film and see for yourself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mature, touching and mercifully witty reflection on mortality and embracing life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One could hardly be chastised for being hesitant about seeing The Bucket List - after all, a film detailing a pair of elderly men living out their last days with terminal cancer could hardly be described as a cheery and enjoyable way to spend the evening. With that in mind, plenty of credit should be given to director Rob Reiner and his dynamic two leading men for refusing to turn their grave subject matter into a preachy sob-fest - instead, the pervasive mix of cynicism, sarcasm and occasional downright silliness keep The Bucket List aloft, embracing the joy of life rather than morosely focusing on the end of it.The film's inspired script (despite being more formulaic than one would hope for) presents a truly poignant and wryly funny rumination on unfulfilled lives drawing to a close. Unfortunately, director Rob Reiner drenches certain emotional moments with sap when a quieter, more reflective touch would have been far more appropriate and effective. However, the cancer content is never exploited for the sake of bleeding tears from the audience, but instead handled maturely and tastefully, concentrating more on the two men's respective attitudes towards their approaching fates. Similarly, a potentially overly heavy ending is mercifully avoided by a quietly touching and eventually hilarious final moment. As the pair embark on a world-wide trip, fulfilling their 'bucket list', or list of things to accomplish before 'kicking the bucket', they experience staggering scenic attractions and world-wide monuments, well captured by dreamlike cinematography. However, beyond its natural splendour, the film's main joy is journeying alongside the lead duo, as they experience such wonders and revamp their own lives in the process.As expected, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are unquestionably what keep the film afloat - without their tremendous presence and chemistry, it is difficult to foresee the film being anywhere near as effective. Only the endlessly charismatic Nicholson could have inhabited miserly corporation head Edward Cole with such conviction. As Cole fiercely avoids introspection while struggling to cope with his own impending illness and mortality, an unprecedented wounded and uncertain tinge emerges in Nicholson's normally gleaming eyes, making for a tremendously poignant as well as amusing performance. Freeman is similarly at the top of his game, essaying the stoic, world-weary wisdom of working class mechanic Carter Chambers to perfection, once again proving his uncanny ability to instil even the most banal lines with the calm dignity of classic literature. The supporting cast leave more to be desired - TV's Will and Grace co-star Sean Hayes is nowhere near as funny as he ought to be as Cole's prissy assistant, and Beverly Todd is saddled with a far too poorly written part as Chambers' lamenting wife to emerge with much of a performance. Despite the film lapsing into formula and cliché at times, this is scarcely enough to distract from what is without question one of the most mature, affecting, and mercifully witty tales of friendship, aging and affirmation of life the cinema has beheld in years. Brought to life by the tremendous pairing of cinematic legends Nicholson and Freeman, The Bucket List exceeds expectations, neither patronizing its audience nor exploiting its subject matter, but rather flooding them with a truly inspiring warmth that even the most jaded viewers will find difficult to resist. -7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very good film about friendship &amp; the importance of life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A few years ago Country music musician Tim McGraw released a song titled "Live Like You Were Dying"; The Bucket List is the cinematographic manifestation of this song. The movie is centered on Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman's characters who have been diagnosed with terminal illnesses and pursue those things in life that they missed out on. Basically, they want to go out laughing and happy instead of spending their remaining time depressed and surrounded by pity and sadness. The concept of the movie is fabulous and it's directed by Rob Reiner who is also responsible for "Stand By Me", "North", and "A Few Good Men" to name a few. The only negative aspect of the movie is that some of the lines are just not that effective and many are hit or miss. This is a highly emotional film that can leave you shedding a tear or two and it is generally a good movie that leaves you feeling good when you walk out of the theater.</fullReview>

An allegory of the good death, of better values, of giving meaning to our final days, of how we would want to die, how those we know who have died from the terrible diseases that have ripped families apart in the 20th Century would liked to have died - and it is more than comforting, it is uplifting.Highly recommended as being a really fine cinematic experience - and one that really does linger...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bucket List is like Jumper in that it had a great concept to deal with but was executed unsatisfactorily. You want to like it so bad but it just feels empty.Bazillionaire Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is diagnosed with cancer and befriends his polar opposite Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman). Director Rob Reiner unfortunately feels the need to belabor the several points to stress how different these two stereotypes are: the rich, nasty but lonely Cole and the loving family man Chambers.Thank God Sean Hayes (of Will and Grace fame) is there to play Thomas, Cole's assistant. Even in non-comedic moments, he steals the scene. Another small-screen star, Rob Morrow (of Northern Exposure, Numbers) plays Cole's impatient doctor. In the few scenes she's in, Beverly Todd consistently turns in a heartfelt performance as Chambers' wife, Virginia.Unfortunately, there just wasn't enough wit and humor to make this film great. It felt like a lazy cash cow banking on the stellar power of Freeman and Nicholson. It didn't bring anything new, story-wise. There were some nice, thoughtful touches but they weren't enough to resuscitate this movie.</fullReview>

The Bucket List is the kind of a film after watching which you came out of the cinema realizing that it couldn't been made anyway except the way it was actually made. And the actors (Freeman and Nicholson were really perfect) were the only ones who could play such roles.I don't wanna talk about the meaning of the film and it's essence, cause' everyone can find something special for himself.

This is a must see for anyone wanting a feel good movie , it won't disappoint.This isn't a fast paced action movie with no guns a-blazing or exploding helicopters but a timely reminder that as acting goes, these two guys are far from "out to pasture", OK i'm slightly biased here as i have followed these two actor's careers for over two decades now and nothing surprises me about this movie ...GO SEE IT !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Films I've Seen!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bucket List is one of the best films I have seen in years, who is directed by Rob Reiner and starts the incredible and unforgettable cast Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. The Bucket List is about two men, who are two completely different people with two different jobs and life styles, who find out they have cancer and get placed into the same hospital room and decide to make a 'Bucket List' of things they want to do before they kick-the-bucket.The film's story definitely relates to real life and what dying cancer patients go through and think what will happen what will happen to them when they die. When each character learns and finds out that they have cancer and when they are going to pass, Nicholson and Freeman give great emotional performances. Nicholson gives one of his best performances in this movie since "The Shining", "As Good As It Gets", and "Five Easy Pieces." Not to mention Morgan Freeman who did an outstanding job since "Million Dollar Baby".Even though the film tackles on a depressing and true life subject, screenwriter Justin Zackham gives us great dialouge from each character, making you laugh hysterical and make you want to cry. The Bucket List is an excellent film that tackles on real life and friendship and how to live life to the fullest. Despite all of the harsh reviews from critics, I recommend this film to ANYONE who wants a good laugh or is in the mood for a tear jerker.~Will Phelps</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting movie premise without a real movie. For a comedy it is hardly funny, for a drama it is hardly dramatic. It seems that the writer's biggest merit was pulling up a map and selecting some sight-seeing highlights. Some people have liked it due to the teaming of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. Big deal ! Like that in itself should make the movie good. They deserve so much better than this script. There was a time not too long ago when you would think Rob Reiner was in a roll and couldn't make a bad movie (see Misery, The American President, When Harry Met Sally, A Few Good Men, etc.). What on earth happened to him ?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding Joy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Rob Reiner's "The Bucket List" Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson play virtually "in position". Theirs is not especially edgy casting. Jack basically is Jack. Morgan Freeman plays reliable and solid, and he is even the story's narrator. However, Jack delivers an emotionally naked performance as Edward that resonates with humanity. He and Morgan, who plays Carter, have a deeply rich and comfortable chemistry. "The Bucket List" refers to the list of things both want to do before, they "kick the bucket". Both Edward and Carter have terminal cancer. Although Carter's idea, the List contains mostly fun and ha ha things?nothing having any personal cost. Until Carter (Freeman) adds Edward completing his relationship with his estranged daughter. "The Bucket List" is about life working. Carter says to Edward, "Everyone's afraid to die alone." Justin Zackham's screenplay plays this out without the prolific payoff, instead concluding unexpectedly and so eloquently.Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are awesome. They are perhaps the best actors around, and refreshingly remind us throughout. Their Carter and Edward meet while sharing a room in a cancer ward at Edward's hospital. Edward is some sort of billionaire with four ex-wives. Carter is an auto mechanic, married for 45 years, and has sent all his children through college. Both could not be further polarized. However, both are given no longer than a year to live. Edward recovers Carter's "Bucket List", and suggests, "We should do this?" Thus, the journey begins, and Carter's wife Virginia (solid Beverly Todd) is not pleased.In an amazing scene atop the Egyptian pyramids, Edward and Carter talk. In Egyptian lore, to enter heaven one must answer two questions. First, "Have you had joy in your life?" Second, "Has your life given joy to others?" Looking from within Edward can not answer the second question. Carter implores and compels Edward to "Find the joy in your life?" Rob Reiner's "The Bucket List" is something very special. Acknowledge Reiner and Zackham for their whimsical touch, never maudlin or shamelessly sentimental. Their story of two men from completely different worlds facing their death is courageous, funny, and moving. We all must come to terms with our own mortality in our own way. Where do we have joy in life? Have we given joy to others? "The Bucket List" is inspiring as it looks at life's legacy, which includes our own.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>probably better than it has any right to be, mostly due to its star power</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bucket List only mildly calls into the A-list of Hollywood screenwriters Justin Zackham, and it only slightly elevates Rob Reiner as a director. He's had a slump as a director for what seems like the better part of fifteen years (oddly enough the last time the co-lead of this film, Jack Nicholson, appeared veraciously in A Few Good Men, was then) when before that he had one of the strongest careers of any Hollywood director. With the Bucket List he's made a film that's respectable, entertaining for its time being, and about as deep as a kiddie pool. It's nowhere near as bad as North or Rumor Has it, to be sure. But there could be some tweaking to the Zackham script, little things that could make it stand out just a bit more in dealing with aspects of the drama- what could be really dark and biting to level off with the cynical, jab-in-the-ribs sense of humor to it. What we're given, basically, is two old guys who are out to 'find themselves' in their time of dying. Ho-ho! OK, to be fair, it is a major credit to the stars that this even works as well as it does. One is an auto mechanic (Morgan Freeman) and the other a billionaire (Nicholson), and the two meet as sharing the same room, undergoing immense cancer treatments. Instead of undergoing "experimental" treatments after each finding out they'll be dead in at longest a year, Freeman's Carter has a hypothetical list of things he'd like to do before he dies. With Edward (Nicholson), he'll do it because, of course, Edward is wealthy enough to go the limit. It's interesting then to follow along these two figures for the simple fact that they are played by two of the best leading men of their generation. Strangely, however, if anyone could be said to have the edge over the other (all the more strangely because of how much I love the latter), Freeman did more with his part than Nicholson with his. This goes without saying Zackham doesn't reveal too much about Edward until late in the game, and only provides enough in the meantime for Jack to be "Jack" that we all know and love- perhaps, sad to say, too much so- while Freeman plays it touchingly, making the most out of a more well-rounded character with a few very good scenes (i.e. him at the bar in China).It should be way too schmaltzy to recommend, and if you do want the kind of studio movie-making that tries its absolute hardest to tug ever so hard at your heartstrings The Bucket List it certainly is that. But what offsets what could be a totally painful ordeal with such ideal stars. But Zackham, at the end of it all, does give enough fun lines and dialog exchanges and things for Nicholson and Freeman to do that one is distracted by the fact that Reiner as a director provides typical and dull imagery to the proceedings, only wisely enough giving the breathing room for the actors in some scenes. It's cheerful to see the bickering before sky-diving or the machismo flaring up during the car race, and it's insightful to see when the two just have a quieter scene like in front of the pyramids. It's a pithy romp about men being men dying of cancer. It's neither Nicholson or Freeman's best day as real masters of the acting craft. But it wouldn't be too bad to catch again, in bits and pieces, on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a fan of Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman and Rob Reiner and hated this movie. The screenplay was expected, sappy and unimaginative. It's as if a film student wrote it. I think Rob Reiner played it way too safe...The Bucket List is a great story and unfortunately, was not executed well at all. Morgan Freeman read his narration in the exact same tone as in The Shawshank Redemption.Jack Nicholson certainly didn't invent a new character for this film, either. The music was dull. The car racing sequence was embarrassing. All of the supporting characters were hollow. I didn't feel like I got to know any of them. This would have been a good short story. Shame on Rob Reiner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kick "The Bucket List"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kick "The Bucket List."The new Jack Nicholson &amp; Morgan Freeman buddy picture is downright depressing. Indeed, the Warner Brothers' trailer for "The Bucket List" made it look like a hilarious combination of "Grumpy Old Men" meet "Odd Couple" in a cancer ward. The Oscar-winning actors play an Abbott &amp; Costello pair of charismatic cut-ups with cancer. Unfortunately, this warm fuzzy frolic about two terminally-ill old-times that tear off for one final fling is predictable, preposterous, and ultimately pathetic. This is the kind of movie that would make a hospice nurse snicker out of one corner of his or her mouth. No disrespect intended to hospice nurses.Our elderly heroes loiter for the first thirty minutes in a hospital, the next thirty on a round-the-world, fun-in-the-sun, travelogue thrill ride, and the last thirty minutes taking forever to die. Ironically, billionaire hospital magnate Edward Cork (paunchy Jack Nicholson of "Anger Management") has never been sick a day in his life. He parlayed his fortune out of privatizing health care facilities. Two beds for each room, he stipulates early in the opening scene, he doesn't operate health spas. No sooner has Cork declared this dictum than he lands in one of his own hospitals with six months to live. When he awakens, Cork demands a private room. Not possible, his right-hand man Thomas (Sean Hayes of TV's "Will &amp; Grace") admonishes him. Cork's choice of a private room, Thomas points out, would undermine Cork's own dictum about low-cost hospital facilities. Thankfully, Jack Nicholson doesn't moon us like Tom Hanks did in "Charlie Wilson's War." Of course, what movie about chemo patients would be complete without the star in his hospital gown puking in a toilet?Auto mechanic Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman of "Unforgiven") suspects that he has his own tumor when he discards his last cigarette. Unlike the quadruple divorced Cork, Chambers has been happily married to his high school sweetheart for 45 years with two financially successful grown-up sons and a daughter. The boys have made him a grandfather while his daughter has become a world-class violinist. Cork and Carter wind up in the same room but they aren't made for each other. One day, Carter scribbles out an inventory of activities on a yellow pad he'd like to do before he kicks the bucket. Generously, Cork offers to foot the bill for their adrenalin-laced adventures. Our heroes behave like overgrown adolescents. They parachute from planes, careen around in race cars, climb the Great Pyramids, and motorcycle the length of the Great Wall of China. Lastly, they share the laugh of their lives when they discover Cork's premium coffee derives its unique flavor from the digestive tract of an exotic tree cat that feeds on them.Nicholson and Freeman together aren't enough to redeem freshman writer Justin Zackman's contrived clowning about friendship, death, and dying. We're none the wiser for watching this platitudinous pabulum. "The Bucket List" qualifies as another loser from director Rob Reiner who once made good movies such as "When Harry Meet Sally," "The Sure Thing," "Stand By Me," and "The Princess Bride." Lately, he has been dishing up dreck like "North," "The Ghosts of Mississippi," "The Story of Us," "Alex and Emma," and "Rumor Has It." The tear-jerking titans that Nicholson and Freeman play possess far too much stamina and energy as former chemotherapy patients to perform their daring feats. The skydiving scenes are the genuine item,with Nicholson and Freeman clearly in the air above th earth, but the racing scenes suffer from obvious back-projection footage. What? They could sky dive from several thousand feet for real, but they cannot drive like hellions for a quarter of a mile?Make "The Bucket List" the last movie you ever see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the worst films of the year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has two or three things going for it: a nice theme of people doing what they've always dreamed of doing before they die, and Jack Nicholson doing his thing. It also has some pretty scenery and a good sidekick to moan a bit at Jack. Other than that, the film is a formulaic Hollywood piece of garbage with a terrible script. Starting with Morgan Freeman's role, which we've seen many times before, this time so filled with saccharine and political correctness--he knows everything, his children are perfect, he's faithful (to a fault), but hes a frustrated mechanic who always wanted to be a history prof., etc. Freeman walks through the part with not much realism--just another paycheck as the token good Black man for the LA moguls' purposes. Nicholson is good at times, but his role as a corporate hospital wheeler dealer is not believable in the least. There is not one bit of dialog that rings true. If they could have shortened the hospital scenes considerably and had them really do some meaningful adventures with some real emotional depth, then the film could have been tolerable. As it is, it made me sick. The question is how could anyone like it? Go figure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful heartwarming &amp;heart breaking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman were perfectly cast as bromance buddies in this 'come of age' road trip with a difference film about coming to terms with a short life expectancy. Great performances, wit, comedy, intelligence and wonder make this film so special. It shows an unglamorous side to cancer, but also the strength of the human spirit to make something great out of something tragic.I want to give the film 8/10 but can't get past the difficulty of Morgan Freeman's character abandoning his wife and children, and what I believe is a weird premise for a storyline. That aside, it's a beautiful spectacle of a film although many of the "abroad" vistas look like sound stages so that detracted slightly from the spectacle. Sean Hayes (of Will and Grace fame, "Just Jack") was the plucky comic relief although he played it very straight (*ahem*) and was a superb foil for Jack Nicholson's typically acerbic wit and banter.This film, however, tried to be more than it was and didn't quite make it. Brilliant, yes, but missing something big, perhaps it failed to be truly comedy or truly a drama and fell somewhere in between, it also attempted some suspense with the opening/end scene and the narration voiced by Freeman... but you can't really have a suspenseful ending to a film about two men with terminal cancer, without going the Hollywood "Oh they found a cure!" route, which mercifully this doesn't attempt. Inspiring though the film is, wonderful, tear-jerking, emotionally shredding, it tries to moralise or be philosophical beyond it's means. I enjoyed this film for what I saw it to be, an emotive and sad tale, with uplifting adventure and friendship... it is friendship that is the star of this film; the meeting of souls and the finding of companionship in the blackest of times.Watch this, I highly recommend it, but have tissues to wipe your eyes to hand.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having a "bucket list" or as I say a "to-do list before dying" can be very exciting. I believe the director,made a great movie about having faith in people,loyalty to family and to yourself.It's a good movie,it has many beautiful landscapes in it.China,India,Nepal,Africa &amp; ... But the most powerful thing in it, is the great performance of the main characters played by, Jack Nicholson(Edward) and Morgan Freeman(Carter).Great point in the movie is you know they're both going to die, but you can't help it, you really feel hurt when (Carter) dies.The movie doesn't have any not-necessary scenes. No nudity, everything about sex is implied. I think it's a good score for a movie like this.The movie tries to imply that happiness, specially in the "joy" type of meaning, doesn't do anything with one-time physical intimacy with a person. It's all about having a good heart, not even necessarily a healthy one,just an open one,as Carter's Quote in the opening and ending of the movie.In the opening, you hear Carter's voice, but he's dead! So the movie is trying to show that carter lives the world after life as his beliefs.I think it's also implying that there is an after life living. Which is my belief too.Overall, I think this movie should have won many more awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>95% of people are wrong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Humans frequently lose sight of the true goals and purpose of their lives. Often, society strives for monetary gains and the development of industry, but rarely do we assess the actual growth of the person (or self-actualization as Maslow termed). Meaning is an incredibly subjective concept with regards to life, and what every person attributes to it varies greatly. Although straying away from money in life is crucial in understanding that we do not carry over our physical world past death. It helps us realize the essential fundament that we were once from the ground, and we will one day return to the ground. What some people love to do may be what others detest, but of utmost importance is that we enjoy every moment we have. People often argue over the value of a movie and say it must be unpredictable, unique, exciting and whatever adjectives they like to characterize films by. One not commonly expressed is their level of enjoyment! If there's one lesson to take away from this movie (and there are plenty) it is that there is a lot to live for, appreciate and seek in this world. It's remarkably sad that we confine ourselves to the houses we live and offices we work. Exploration and seeking are necessary in our lives if we are to ever learn more about the world we live in and ourselves. We've all been given the talents and tools necessary to learn about the Universe. It's a pity if we make an excuse for that.Now, I enjoyed The Bucket List. Sure it was predictable. Sure it wasn't a revolutionary movie that will alter the film industry forever. It gives perspective, though. People are afraid to pursue the things they want in life because they put these imaginary boundaries on their lives and tell themselves they must live within it. People worry too much about the future. Ultimately, just remember to not live like other people. Today's struggles are enough for today, so live today while you still can and cherish every moment. The Bucket List is a great reminder of this sentiment. Ultimately, The Bucket List asks us two vital questions we should think about on a daily basis: 1. When we are in our last days, nearing the end of our lives, will we be able to say that we were happy? 2. Will we be able to say that we brought happiness to the lives of others?Whether you want to debate if this film deserves praise, awards and/or high ratings is futile. It sheds light on life, and demonstrates that the physical pleasures of life are not worth fighting for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bucket List</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Rob Reiner (Stand by Me, When Harry Met Sally, Misery), this sounded like a quite bleak but at the same time quite an interesting comedy, and I certainly wanted to see the two lead stars together. Basically Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) is a great cultural intellect, married for forty-five years with wife Virginia (Beverly Todd), with two songs and one daughter, and he is placed in hospital being treated for terminal cancer. There he meets and shares his room with bitter billionaire Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson), who happens to own hospitals, he has had many divorces and has a missing daughter. In the days they spend in the hospital room together they get to know more about each other and become surprisingly close, and then Edward finds the list Carter threw in the bin. It is a "bucket list", everything he has ever wanted to do before he kicks the bucket, and seeing how Edward has been given at least six months to live, he suggests to Carter to actually do these things. So with the help of Edward's fortune, the pair travel the world to see the sights, sky dive, speed race in specific cars, and much more besides. For Carter though this list isn't all the enjoyable stuff to do before dying, it is finding closure and redemption, such as helping Edward's long lost daughter. Suddenly after a break-up by the two friends, Carter suffers a seizure and is rushed to hospital, with the cancer spreading to his brain, and he needs a possibly fatal operation, one that costs him his life. Edward carries out Carter's last wish to reconnect with the long lost daughter, and then he carries out his funeral before being cremated, and Edward's ashes join Carter's at the top of a snowy mountain, where the last item is crossed off of the bucket list. Also starring Sean Hayes as Thomas, Alfonso Freeman, Morgan's son as Roger Chambers, Rowena King as prostitute Angelica and Rob Morrow as Dr. Hollins. I can agree with the critics that this is filled with quite a lot of predictable moments, and the sentimental element is one of the most common things to expect, but with Nicholson and Freeman on screen together playing very engaging characters you can't go wrong. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is exactly what you would expect to see if you saw any of the trailers or previews for it. It is a feel good movie with two legendary actors who play their parts very well.Before seeing the movie I could probably have told you basically the entire plot, but sometimes its nice to just sit back and watch a movie that you know will lift your spirits. It is a good story, one that everyone on the planet probably has dreamed about actually living out, and nothing crazy is thrown at you. They do not take many risks in the story, but who cares. What the storyline does do extremely well is make you feel like running out and living life to the fullest. Hopefully there are people who do not need a movie like this to make them feel extremely high on life, but there are definitely people out there who can use a pick me up like this.The acting is as you would expect from two great actors and each of them have their moments when they shine. Everyone in the movie does a really good job with no complaints, except for the doctor that is taking care of Jack. He doesn't really do anything wrong, but I just remember him from Numb3rs and it is strange seeing him as a doctor rather than an FBI agent running around with a gun in hand.Anyways to sum it up, you get exactly what you pay for with this movie, a feel good flick that will lift your spirits and provide some good moments from two legendary actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this movie about 6 months ago. I can't say that I was really surprised and satisfied when I got out of the cinema nor can I say I was disappointed. The movie itself is alright and interesting and I must say it's worth watching.However, I expected more after reading all of the reviews. Of course, don't take my review like it's the only adequate one - after all, after expecting something good, you usually get disappointed.The plot isn't dynamic and if you're one of those people who only enjoy movies with sudden changes and breath-taking scenes, this movie might not be a good choice. Some scenes are stunning while some of them can be boring and if you really don't like this type of movies, I think you'll regret going to watch this movie. But, if you can adjust to all sort of movies, you'll be glad that you've seen this one. Personally, I think this movie was one of the most realistic movies I've ever seen ( maybe it won't look like that at the beginning ) OK - besides some parts of the movie. You'll see that movie does bring up some interesting questions to think about.I also think, if you take this movie to watch it at home, you can have a good time while watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See Nicholson and Freeman have the time of their lives? Check!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Take: A bit slow and dramatic, but Nicholson and Freeman steal the show.When I first heard the premise of Rob Reiner's new film THE BUCKET LIST, I'd want to giggle a bit at how silly yet charming it sounded. Picture this: Two old geezers have cancer and shares a room in a hospital. And after hearing the bad news that they only got a month or two to live, they set off on a globe-trotting adventure thinking "Hey! Why not go out in style?" This is definitely a silly story, and no doubt even cancer patients resting in their hospital beds will find this premise ridiculous. But thanks mainly to its first-rate direction and an undeniably charming tour-de-force teamwork of its two leads, THE BUCKET LIST is still a sweet and charming comedy.The story's more of fantasy than reality as two old cancer patients Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) hit the road in an around-the-world adventure, doing things they never had time or courage to do. Whether it's skydiving (!) or climbing the top of the pyramids, they don't give a damn even if they die earlier than their due date. Anyone else bother to ask these guys that their better off dying another day? Edward got the money and the guts. Carter's got the list. What's there to stop them? The story, written by Justin Zackham, is schmaltzy at some point, silly on some. The first half of the film, spent mostly on Edward and Carter's days at their hospital beds are pretty slow, despite a few wits cracked by Nicholson. The movie does pick up once the two get off the hospital room, no matter how sillier the affair is (the skydiving sequence, with Nicholson and Freeman's faces are "glued" to the faces of real stuntmen, is pretty cheesy though). But while I don't believe the movie for a second, I still found a lot to like, even love, about THE BUCKET LIST. It's funny and often charming, with a final hour that's bound to shed a tear in your eye. Nicholson and Freeman will keep a smile on your face throughout the film, even if these two seemed to be the only people we care for or know about in the entire film (Carter's wife and Edward's loyal assistants don't really have much to say). So, whether your an old geezer in bed or a anyone just looking for a lightweight yet charming slice of Capra-esquire fantasy, put a check on this BUCKET LIST.Rating: **** out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kicking it Old School...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson go on a green screen tour of the world.In Irving Stone's novel about Freud, *Passions of the Mind*, there's a line about, "...a time in a man's life when he stops trying to live and starts trying not to die." This movie is about turning those tables. And I guess its impact will only be felt when your social security kicks in...Carter (Freeman) finds himself sharing a hospital room with Edward (Nicholson), who also happens to own the hospital. Carter feels he is on the downhill slide, so makes out a "bucket list" - a list of inane things he plans to do before he kicks the bucket.Edward poo-poos the list, but somehow gets sucked into making it a joint effort. Carter knows the list is impossible to fulfill - he's just a lowly mechanic with outlandish dreams - but Edward, being a hospital billionaire, tells him "money is no object," and off they go, special effects flying hither and thither.Rob Reiner phones in the directorial job. And on the DVD commentary, the snide writer (Justin Zackman) tells us that everyone should make AND FULFILL a Bucket List - only saying so because he has absolutely nothing intelligent to say about his ludicrous movie.Geez, I wish *I* could meet a billionaire dying in a bed next to mine and fulfill MY bucket list.Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman go deep into The Method by pretending to be two really old guys gasping on the threshold of Death's door...oh, right...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice. Not great but, nice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No reason to trash this film entirely because of the acting power of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. They bring some dignity to what could have been an all out weepie three hanky experience.Although, there are some funny moments, (I especially liked the verbal sparring between Nicolson and Sean Hayes), there is a sad undercurrent because of the plot which is pretty much that these men are gonna die.Freeman's character is the most interesting because we find out that he has very strong regrets about his life. He had very high aspirations but somehow never followed through on them. Nicholson is basically playing the same smart mouthed character he has done dozens of times. The subplot about his daughter is tied up too nicely and is something we have seen many, many times before.Rob Morrow also has a few nice moments. He plays a doctor who of course has to give some bad news. He plays the moment very understated and it is probably the most memorable moment of the film.So you go to one of these films to see some great actors play and you could not find better ones.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The production company(Paramount? Columbia? I forget)that green lit this show must've figured that a film starring two Oscar winners(Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson)and directed by accomplished director Rob Reiner,dealing with dying cancer patients "grabbing the gusto" would be critical AND box office gold.I figured that if a show like this is being released AFTER the Holiday season that buyer beware.As such,having managed to finally get to watch this I was marginally impressed,mostly with the scenes between Freeman and Nicholson are good,and screenwriter Justin Zackham makes out a pleasant,if perhaps light on plausibility,script for the two to work on. I just felt like this film leans a little TOO hard on sentiment and emotion and too light on authenticity(How does a mechanic,Freman's character,afford such a nice home? How does someone who owns or runs a hospital,Nicholson's character,get to be OBSECENLY rich? How likely is it for people being treated for serious stages of cancer just get to "sneak out" on adventure escapades?And how likely is it that two disparate types like these two break down intimacy walls at such a quick pace? Those came to mind),probably hoping that audiences would be too touched by the interplay and humor to care about the details. BAsically,anyone whose endured,either personally or through family or friends,a serious illness would probably find something surreal and doubtable about this movie as a complete package.Not bad enough to be dismissible,not true enough to be thought of as serious. This movie is basically a chance to watch a couple of veterans(with some good supporting turns by Sean Hayes as NIcholson's assistant)act out scenes of acting exercises. And as that,this show's okay,but it's not nearly as profound or beautiful as I suspect it wanted to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is okay, but it's nothing special. Of course both main actors play great (as you can imagine - they are both are Academy Award winners), but the script is just not good enough for a movie that is only about the dialogs. It took the author 14 days to write - and that's obvious. There are not many scenes in the movie you will remind in 14 days. The bucket list itself is boring and the car driving scene is unbelievable. Why does Carter damage the car although he loves cars? Why do they talk to each other as if they would be sitting in a living room although they drive a race in different cars? So watch it with your girlfriend if you have to, but don't watch it alone or with a group of friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As each is diagnosed with cancer and have from 6-months to 1-year to live, Edward (Nicholson) challenges Carter (Freeman) to live the rest of their lives doing what they have always wanted to do. Hence the Bucket List. The story is okay even though the script is weak in many areas. I mean you have two of the best actors on the planet playing characters who do things they never dreamed they would do for lack of money for one and lack of time for the other. And, yet, there is something missing. You know, as the movie goes on, one or both will die. Yes, there are some philosophical questions for them to ponder, the meaning of life, God or no God, regrets etc. as they go sky diving, sit atop a pyramid, visit the Taj Mahal, race vintage cars, and have expensive dinners. Still something is missing. Could it be we see their trek only from their perspective and get caught up in it? And, ??go along with it too? Hmmmm??became sort of dull. If the people left behind or on the outs had more lines (oh, they had some, not much though), even among themselves, in what these two were doing, the movie may have had more of an impact. Hmmmmm???One thing that did bother me was this. When the movie starts you hear Morgan Freeman's voice as Carter and one would assume by the end of the movie he would still be alive to finish the story. Not so. At the end of the movie Carter has passed on, yet he continues the narrative. It would have been better if the Narrator was not Carter. Sorry to give something away like this, but it really doesn't take away from the movie. I just thought that was a stupid thing the Director did. The Narrator should have been Edward's right hand man, Thomas (Hayes) and the narration from his perspective would have had a greater impact and opened the movie up to better comedic lines and understanding of Edward (the rich one) and the way he interacted with Carter and life in general. And, Sean Hayes is one of the funniest around and you don't fully use him? But, Morgan Freeman's Carter, dead or alive, has such a wonderful voice the Director went with him. The movie saves itself because the chemistry between Freeman and Nicholson is really good, and we enjoy their banter. Violence: No, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes, there is some toward the end of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bucket List looked like one of several old-guy buddy movies in the vein of Jack Lemon and Walter Matthau in The Odd Couple II, Grumpy/ier Old Men, or Out to Sea or, more fittingly, Jack Lemon and James Garner in My Fellow Americans. But this one is more than just a frolic of buddy repartee and various sexual wannado's; it's actually a serious movie that strikes close to home (for Boomers and their aging parents) with a naturally humorous undertone.From the special features we learn screenplay writer, Justin Zackham, came up with this idea of writing down a list of things one would want to accomplish should one learn one's time on earth was short. Oddly enough, Zackham made "making a movie about a 'bucket list'" one of the items on his own personal bucket list......For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2008</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rob Reiner directs two great stars in this heartfelt comedy with melodramatic overtones. Edward Cole(Jack Nicholson)is a billionaire sharing a room with a life-long mechanic Carter Chambers(Morgan Freeman)in a hospital owned by Cole. Both men find out that cancer has their days numbered, but both refuse to let it kick their ass. A bucket list is composed...a list of things to do before that proverbial buck is kicked. Edward talks Carter into an around-the-world adventure crossing things off of their list. Racing cars, skydiving, flying over the North Pole, gazing at the Great Pyramids, Taj Mahal, a trip to the Himalayas...eating fancy food in France and going on safari in Africa; more things in three months than most people accomplish in a lifetime. An odd couple bonding into a heart warming friendship both knowing that death does not take a holiday. Rounding out the cast: Rob Morrow, Beverly Todd and Sean Hayes.</fullReview>

The next scene introduce Edward, (Jack Nicholson) defending (fighting) in court for his hospital policies and end up coughing up blood.Edward is a brilliant heretic businessman who has sacrifice everything over his business while Carter is a brilliant mechanic with faith who has sacrifice his dream of becoming a history teacher over his family. Both of there realities collide when they end up sharing the same room in Edward Hospital.The dialogs are simply magnificent, leaving clues along the way. The level at which they communicate and how they influence each other is a pure pleasure to watch and hear. Also a special mention to Thomas, (Sean Hayes) Edward's smart assistant who play a subtle tight game.This movie made by Hollywood reach a level that will be hard to top.</fullReview>

In addition, i know Nicholson (Morgan isn't a favorite) to be a great actor but i discovered in the promotion tour, that he was really astute and human: he was laughing at the fact that Death was the last thing we want to do and that it was really the last thing we will do!I sold this movie to my friend as addressing the "joy of life" but finally went alone, sited next to a deaf person!If the movie has flaws (too fast, too faraway for common people because their money is easy), it illustrates my most profound beliefs:1. The greatest pain is to be alone 2. The value of life is to bring joy to othersIt's great to see the evolution of characters and their hobbies (from pure egoistic fun to familial commitment) and i was moved to see Jack crying. It's a pity that this scene wasn't longer.Finally, i send all my compassion to Jack and Morgan, because at their ages, this movie should have raised some questions!

		<shortDescription>Overall, A Disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to be honest and say that overall I was disappointed with this movie. That disappointment certainly had nothing to do with Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. They are two fine, veteran actors who worked perfectly together and offered strong performances in roles that seemed tailor-made for them. Nicholson was Edward Cole, a wealthy operator of private hospitals, while Freeman was Carter Chambers, a mechanic who really wanted to be a history professor. Fate puts them in a hospital room together as they each do battle with cancer, and as they bond with one another through their shared experience, they also begin to share their as yet unfulfilled hopes and dreams. Out of that process comes the bucket list - a list of things they each want to do before they die, and they set off on a desperate round the world journey to complete the list.The premise of the ultra-wealthy businessman befriending the mechanic was a little too contrived for me. The goals Carter was able to achieve thanks to Cole's friendship and patronage were way out of anything I might hope to accomplish in similar circumstances, and so I found their journey somewhat difficult to relate to. That might have been all right if what I had expected from the trailers had been what I found. The trailers made this seem like a knee slapping comedy. In fact, I found it rather heavy for a good part of the way, and while there is humour in it the humour never really seemed to take over as the point of the movie. In the end, the point of the movie seems to be Cole's transformation - his discovery of joy as Carter puts it in his voice over narration. In fairness, that transformation did lead to some heartwarming moments in the last few scenes. Cole's way of fulfilling one of his bucket list wishes - to kiss the most beautiful girl in the world - was truly sweet, and his eulogy at Carter's funeral was very emotional. Then, the uplifting last few minutes was spoiled (to me) by the last scene, when Cole's assistant Thomas (Sean Hayes) places his ashes (alongside, presumably, Carter's) in a vault at the top of a mountain (which the movie implies was Mt. Everest.) Fine, I suppose, but let me get this straight - Thomas apparently gets to the top of Everest by himself? And - at the top - needs no help from oxygen tanks? Yeah - maybe it wasn't Everest (the movie never explicitly states it) but it sure was a high mountain! The closing scene seems unlikely.Nicholson's and Freeman's strong performances and those few powerful moments near the end compel me to give this a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bucket List is a fairy tale without a happy end.The story makes you think about what is really important in life. It also tries to point out the reasons people postpone dreams until time is almost over.The movie also makes us reflect upon death. Why is it so difficult to talk about this subject if this is part of everyone's destiny? Edward and Carter become good friends and they are in the same situation. In other words, since they find out they will soon die, they decide to make a list of things to do before dying. Throughout the movie, they exchange emotions, tears, jokes.I enjoyed The Bucket List simply for the fact that this film shows you realistic feelings, emotions everyone shares.

		<fullReview>Faced with the inevitable end of life two random people meet up in the grimmest of places - the terminal cancer ward of a hospital. Governed by anger and fear more than anything else they don't seek each other at first but eventually things warm up and the two become friends. From one things comes another and when one of the two indicates he has a list of things he wants to do before he dies the other jumps with the idea and the two decide to start doing all the things on the list, plus some more.Road movies like this stand or fall with the chemistry between the main actors. In this case both are veterans at the job and different enough to make it work. Nicholson plays the grumpy old man, angry at everyone at once. Freeman plays the working class man, with an enormous amount of patience and friendliness towards everyone. The way their friendship grows isn't entirely impossible, and solidly real enough for two people on the verge of death.While the air of death constantly hovers over the film the overall feel of it is good and positive. There's enough laughs in there to make the heavy subject lighter and although the inevitable end does come it can be taken with a grim smile and possibly a tear or two, it is no longer a real enemy toward any of the two of them. All in all, it's dark and dreary but leaving one with a warm heart.8 out of 10 beating hearts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, first of all I am no movie critic or expert... So the following is my opinion and only my opinion on the movie... This movie could be described as "deeply emotional" and the reason I'm saying this is because it makes you both laugh and cry... It makes you happy, sad, makes you think about life and what is the most precious thing one can pursue in one's life: finding the joy. You will laugh watching the funny conversations between Edward and Carter, and you will be moved to the point of tear shedding by the scenario of two dying, totally different men, setting out to find joy during the last months of their lives, giving joy to one another. I don't know if The Bucket List deserves an Oscar or anything like that, or a nomination, all I can say is both Freeman and Nicholson's acting is spectacular as always and the scenario is definitely interesting. This movie is a roller-coaster of emotions and a real life lesson, by all means go watch it.</fullReview>

It isn't about having limitless money in order to do a lot of wild things. That was the fantasy part. In the end, the most important things on their list, the ones that meant the most, didn't cost any money at all. Everyone that was in the theater with me were really moved, including the teenagers who couldn't get into "27 Coats".

		<fullReview>It was nice going to this particular film for several reasons.1. When both myself and my wife saw the trailer for it we both turned to each other in the cinema and nodded a mutual agreement that this was on our list.2. Jack Nickolson and Morgan Freeman, two of my all time favourites.3. And this one is for the sake of patience and frustration. . a blessing in it's own right- no kids with cell phones in the rows ahead of us.Bucket list is an honest, and heartbreaking, yet warm and incredibly meaningful film that can serve to inspire us. . those of us that can appreciate what I consider to be a message. It inspired me to complete a novel I have been working on off and on so that I can give a gift of my passion and joy to others- even though I can already answer both of the questions the film poses (in one particular scene).It's not a movie I think I would watch again; but that's OK, this does not lower it's standard. It's just that I tend to go for escapism, whether fictional or more true to life (The Goonies/Traffic).I'd recommend this one to couples, or an older generation of friends. When I say older I mean perhaps later twenties and up. It's not for kids because it doesn't entertain as such. It's popcorn for the more mature palette.Any downsides? Well, without the actor heavy weights, the film would be a dilute experience. Nicholson and Freeman have the gravity and the experience and the skill to keep us going. Their mutual bond far exceeds any comical flings of exploration. When the credits rolled I had a lump in my throat and a tear threatening to roll down my cheek. But I held firm and resolute, because a guy has to maintain his tough guy image ya know ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched the Bucket List expecting to see one laugh after another, and it did keep that promise as expected. Then it turned into a drama movie filled with ups and downs and heartwarming happiness that made me cry in the end. This was a deeply moving movie about two men from different walks of life who meet in the hospital and both are diagnosed as being terminal. They get to talking about themselves and the life they have led or the life they have missed out on and then comes the bucket list-things to do before I kick the bucket.This movie is not only great in providing laughter but it provides reasons to cry form its tender moments that are so darn touching that it makes you want to re-evaluate your own exisitence or lack of existence.Such a wonderful film, watch it buy the DVD and watch it over and over. The ending is very emotional and will live with me forever. Thank you Rob Riener, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this movie can be put in the same list as "Little miss Sunshine". Horrible things happen to them, followed by Humor, but it all has a deeper meaning to it. I didn't think they could make a movie about two men confronted with cancer, so entertaining. But they did, and they did it almost flawless. Nicholson and Freeman are great together, they both play their part very convincing. They act subtle, they don't go overboard with the humor, or the sadness. Nicholson plays the rich and extravagant Edward Cole, and Freeman plays the poorer but richer in life, Carter Chambers. They meet in a hospital, where they are both getting treated for cancer. They create a bond, after they both hear that they have less than a year left to live. It doesn't take long before they create a list with things to-do before I kick the bucket (that explains the name, if you didn't get it already). Since Nicholson's character happens to be a multi-miljonair, they decide to go and actually do them.It's a story about friendship and humanity, with a lot of humor between two opposite characters. This movie will make you "laugh till you cry". But more importantly, it shows you it's never too late to live your life. simply put: I paid to see this movie, but I came out richer, and with a big smile on my face.</fullReview>

Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are 2 cancer patients...Jack Nicholson is a billionaire and Morgan Freeman is a middle class man. Doctor tell them that they have months left. Then the movie gains some pace and also some background score, they make a list of things that they wanna do before they die (go into the bucket) and that is the "bucket list". In the remaining movie they try to do stuffs written in the list and one by one they do things and strike off from the list. The acting cant be criticized as they are the big guns. The screenplay may get the points in innovative script but rest is not out of ordinary...one particular thing about the movie is that Morgan Freeman narrates the story and in the end he dies...... Cinematography is good as the shots taken are very good and from the round the globe...for instance the image of Taj Mahal in the water in the backdrop as they are walking past it. Altogether a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We all know we should make the most of our time whether we know we are going to kick the bucket tomorrow or a year from now or eventually. The movie appears to be about that but it is really a journey of friendship under dire circumstances. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are at their best here doing what they do best and that is develop characterizations. I think a viewer would expect a certain level of excellence with Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Freeman acting and Rob Reiner directing and they will not be disappointed. And it was real fun to see Sean Hayes again after having him in the home all those years with Will and Grace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just got back from watching "The Bucket List" and all I can say is WOW!!!! It has two of the greatest actors in America giving some of the finest performances I have ever seen. If Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson are not nominated for Oscars, there is truly no justice in the world. When I went to the theater, there was not an empty seat to be found. I saw people in this theater that I would wager had not stepped foot in a theater since the 1960s. It is also a rare film when the audience gives it a standing ovation at the ending. I will not write any spoilers because that would take away from the experience that you must have when you see this film. The only true spoiler is not to run out and see this truly remarkable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film with sincere human emotions. It touched on the different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds with an intellectual and compassionate approach...emphasizing that when it comes to a common and shared situation (and what could be more so than death), nothing else matters..we are all human beings with basically the same inborn needs. This film will probably be used for many years in psychology and sociology classes..it could be discussed for hours! Aside from the in-depth analysis of the film, the acting could not be better..after all we had two of the greatest actors of our time in the lead roles!

		<shortDescription>Leave it to Nicholson and Freeman!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a nice treat to see two of my favorite actors in a movie together. With Nicholson and Freeman as the stars, I knew that this movie was going to be something worthwhile and it certainly is."The Bucket List" is a simple story about two men, both terminally ill. They're each given a life expectancy of six months to a year. As they share a room together, they come up with a list of things to do before they die. Rather than waiting for the cancer to kill them, they take the chance to live the next few months well as if they were in the bloom of youth.Jack Nicholson as always brings volume to his character as the obnoxious billionaire Edward Cole. Morgan Freeman is?Morgan Freeman, as the middle class auto mechanic Carter Chambers. The script was okay, but both actors make something out of it.There's plenty of one-liners and some sight gags which were only delivered by Nicholson and Freeman. I was laughing to the point of where I had to cover my mouth to silence myself from screaming.But, as much as there is humor in it there is seriousness when it touches base with one of the most feared things of mankind?death. Both characters shed their light on the topic. Edward, the cynic says, "We live, we die, and the wheels on the bus go round and round." Carter the humanist says, "You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you." Each statement makes you reflect on what kind of person you are as well your beliefs.The movie has a predictable ending, but it is still no0netheless sad and touching. Both actors make something out of it in which would have ordinarily just been an average film. There is no competition between who is the better actor. They play two characters with two totally different personalities, yet they're in the same boat. They're both simply astounding in their own ways and combined together, they make a solid film. 10/10 "All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you."-Ian McKellan, Lord of the Rings</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rob Reiner's 'Ode To Jack' Is An Embarrassment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Rob Reiner intended this catastrophic comedy to be Jack Nicholson's swan song, but it's not funny. And you can't even laugh at it, because both of these great stars are 70 years old, and we really don't know how many more times we'll get to see them on the big screen. I'm a Jack Nicholson fan, and, yes, I think he was on top of his game in "The Departed." But in "The Bucket List" Jack's in silly slapstick mode most of the time, playing down to the juvenile script, and it just doesn't work here. The audience can't forget the gravity of the subject matter long enough to enjoy all the light-hearted sight gags and one-liners. It's like having to watch TV while someone else flips between "Schindler's List" and "Laverne &amp; Shirley." If there is a reason to see "The Bucket List" it's Morgan Freeman. He plays his role straight, and does a fine job portraying a man who faces death with a quiet dignity. But another reason to watch the movie is simply to enjoy Jack Nicholson. I mean I giggled each time he flipped off his doctor. It's silly, but it's classic Jack. Also, there's this one moment in the movie when all action stops, and Nicholson simply stares at Freeman, and in Jack's eyes you can see the hopelessness, and the courage, of a man looking at the his life's end. It's a powerful look, and I'm still a little haunted by it actually. But that's what great actors do, they bear their soul in front of the camera, allowing you to feel what they feel. And Jack Nicholson is a great actor, whether or not Rob Reiner tried to pass off some dead duck as Jack's swan song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and it kept my attention unwaveringly from beginning to end. Having said that, I don't think it deserves to be considered for Best Picture for several reasons: It is textbook formula! The "good cop" meets and becomes best friends with the "bad cop". They laugh together, they cry together and ultimately they die together. Irascible Edward (Jack Nicholson) softens and even finds joy at the end, thanks to Carter's (Morgan Freeman) wise advice. Good-natured but somewhat off-course Carter reconnects with his wife and family after rejecting an Edward-hired prostitute and comes to the expected realization that he deeply loves his wife and needs to go home.This story could roughly be described as a "boy meets girl" (substitute "girl" for "boy" but without homosexual overtones) "boy loves boy ? boy breaks up with boy ? boys realize just before it's too late that they needed each other and learned life's most valuable lessons from each other ? boys die and are even buried next to each other in a most remarkable and tear-jerking ending. This is probably why I enjoyed the movie so much ? I love formula movies, which explains my affinity for "Pretty Woman" ? not a Best Picture candidate either. Incredibly predictable ? I was 4 steps ahead of every scene in this movie ? Carter fawns over the tiny red race car his wife gives him and you know he'll be racing later in the movie. Was anyone surprised that the prostitute at the bar was hired by Edward? Could there be any question that Edward would be reunited with his daughter? And of course, the "Bucket List"?very few surprises as to how each item would pan out (okay, kissing the most beautiful girl in the world turns out to be Edward's first embrace with his granddaughter ? I didn't see that coming). I honestly don't think there was an early scene in this movie that didn't spell out in capital letters the playing out of a future scene. The acting carries the movie ? Aside from the comments above, the Nicholson/Freeman chemistry was expectedly absorbing. It's hard to take one's eyes off the screen for a moment for fear that one might miss one of those rich Nicholson facial expressions. And who isn't compelled by Morgan Freeman's deep voice and rich laughter? If you take the great acting out of this movie, you would have an above average tear-jerker which would be placed in the Netflix library 6 weeks after opening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two great actors who unfortunately find themselves in a highly improbable story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I had heard so many good things about this movie so we had high expectations last evening before we saw it. Unfortunately, I think the Bucket List represents perhaps the worst movie that either Nicholson or Freeman has starred in. The story is literally incredible and oftentimes bits and pieces of the movie make very little sense or are simply impossible. There are aspects of this movie that we found so improbable or impossible that they were distracting and undermined our ability to take the movie seriously. For example, two guys in their condition simply are not going to lounge around in a hospital room for weeks on end (they likely would be moved into an in-home care or hospice environment). They are terminally ill yet well enough to travel internationally; the viewer of this movie is supposed to be appeased by the overtly explicit plot-manipulation suggesting that both are asymptomatic. Well, now that we know they are asymptomatic, the sky is the limit! Both cancer patients are subjected to extreme physical activities, such as skydiving (and the Freeman character has a chest catheter!). In one situation, Nicholson and Freeman are racing in muscle cars on a racetrack; driving alongside each other at very high speeds, they maintain an effortless conversation (without shouting) through the open windows of the cars (impossible); Freeman rams his car into the side of Nicholson's car, yet they both maintain perfect control, no wipe out or tailspin. The dents are not even consistent from one scene to the next. And once you get beyond the implausibility issues, the continuity problems here and there sink this movie to the bottom. Well, you get the idea; throughout the movie there are several continuity goofs, obvious manipulations, and mistakes you can evaluate for yourself. For these reasons we thought the movie was rendered ridiculous. I am a fan of Rob Reiner movies (except this one) and enjoy Freeman and Nicholson and will always consider them as some of the finest actors in the industry. But I hated this movie. Our entertainment came not from the movie but from making fun of its many shortcomings. It is very clear by the low-quality of the script that it took only two weeks to pen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dare I say it.............Crap?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right. First off, I'm not an expert critic. I simply enjoy films. I know what I like and its pretty varied. My favourite film of all time is One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest - starring none other than Jack Nicholson. I also love Morgan Freeman as an actor. Always solid and reliable. I had not heard much about this film and stumbled across it by accident. When I heard the premise I was very excited. Two of the greatest actors ever, a feel good/bittersweet/buddy type story. Oscar season looming. This must be good - right? Well, yes and no.The film starts off well. Its quickly established that Jack is the well off, bitter, angry in need of a life lesson of the two. Morgan is the humble, hard working family man who never thought of himself. To cut a long story short both get cancer, end up in hospital together (with a lot of the scenes quite heart warming), decide they need to live their lives better and more selfishly before they die and then do just that. From there I found the film extremely boring. It seems to jump too quickly from scene to scene. Often random. Its like the writers went "hey, I can get Jack and Morgan together. Crap, we don't have a script. Well I better write one". Its just rushed, boring, done it all before and totally predictable. People will hate me and ridicule me for writing this comment. That because they like Jack and Morgan (which I do too). This film will be defended as it has two of the greatest actors of all time in it. Fine - they acting was good. But you need a story. It just doesn't work without it.Some people will love this film. I just like mine a bit more interesting....5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching And Silly In Equal Measure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the late eighties (starting with 'Street Smart' opposite Christopher Reeve) and particularly the early to mid nineties. Morgan Freeman could do no wrong in my book. A wonderful actor who brought a touch of class to every movie he made. Then something happened, every movie maker and studio caught on to the fact, and he suddenly became the 'go to' guy. Then suddenly he was everywhere releasing several movies a year, all of varying quality. In the ten years prior to this movie, Freeman made over twenty movies whilst his co star Jack Nicholson made only 5. By the time this movie was released, I'd stopped bothering to see his movies. Even with the always awesome Jack Nicholson, I never got round to seeing this movie. Until it was on TV last night. The plot follows two terminally ill men (portrayed by Nicholson and Freeman) on their road trip with a wish list of things to do before they "kick the bucket".Touching and silly in equal measure, I enjoyed a lot of it. It's not without it's faults, including some awful CGI, and it gets a tad melodramatic at times too. Sean Hayes as Nicholson's trusty assistant is the only supporting character who stands out, is almost as of they forgot to give any thought to any characters except Freeman and Nicholson.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death can be hopeful if thought in the right way.I liked this movie but could not fall in love with it. It's very well made and exquisitely shot and the characters have all the right notes to make you empathize for them. Yet, this film has the missing element the soul of a movie comes not by good dialogues or relatable characters or even great cinematography, it comes when you start rooting for a character. When you think that Carter Chambers would return from the operation when you think that edward Cole would complete the rest of the journey. My heart did not go out for either coz it was all very predictable. A bit of unpredictability would have made this go hay wire and too much of it right from first frame made me just a spectator to an event rather than making me involve. The two protagonists touch all the right chords at the right time when they just realize that end is all pervading death and there is no escape. But they loose when they start to plot for each other like Edward Cole sets up a girl for Carter and Carter wants Edward to get back in touch with his daughter. These points digressed the movie and though it made the movie realistic, I must confess they just made the movie miss the point. The point is to get things done which a man wants to do before he ends his life.It's surely a good one to watch and if there is movie that had an urgent message which says "There's no time left out, just do in this life" and that has been made in last 5-10 years then here it is. I am going with 3/5 for a movie that had all the good things in the bucket but the list should have been completed before the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well intentioned failure of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bucket List" is a film that I had above expectation for. I'm an admirer of both acclaimed actors Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, who portray the two lead characters in the film. With a sad story to tell, this film would have been better, written as a serious drama. The film qualifies as an unusual mix of humor, wish fulfillment and sentiment.The story concerns two older men of very different background, who meet by chance, in the same cancer treatment ward and room of a hospital. One man is a billionaire bachelor who owns the hospital and the other is an auto mechanic family man. After both men receive grim news from their doctors about their future, one mentions an idea to create a bucket list, or list of meaningful things to do before death. What follows is not entirely convincing or plausible.There are some moments of genuine and heartfelt emotion as portrayed by Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman.This film, with it's sad and tragic drama story, would have been much better done as a serious psychological drama. How comedy is used in this film, is in questionable taste. Combining comedy and serious drama requires a careful, intelligent, wise and sensitive approach, things this film is sorely lacking in.Overall, I honestly have a mixed reaction to this film. The drama works fairly well, in bits and pieces. The comedy, as done in the film, was not the right way to go with a story of two dying men. I dislike having to see such fine actors as Nicholson and Freeman being wasted on a mediocre screenplay.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't especially looking forward to seeing this movie. I wanted to talk my wife into 'Vantage Point' but none the less she wanted to see Nicholson. I was shocked. My first wife didn't even like Jack. Well, we set the baby up at the sitter and went out and of all things, I was pleasantly surprised. This had a building quality about it that allowed the story and friendship to take place and develop, even in spite of terminal illness. I thought that the two personalities, even with cancer looming might have taken a little longer to develop. But as it goes these two paired up, the odd couple that they are, and made a heart warming and truly touching story, that is one of those long standing films that are good for years to come. Freeman is such a talent of familiar quality. He aways seems to be someone that you could trust, and count on no matter what the problem was. Jack, is wild...rockus and sometimes predictably unpredictable. He will always shock though. Rob Reiner (meathead) delivered a great pairing in these two of ego, attitude and a good sense of humor. The adventures are something that everyone who can should go and see the world and discuss God and country. Morgan's man was a solid friend for Nicholson's 'mogal'.Many different cultures are very interesting to see and feel, some folks will never even get out of a small town in their whole life, that is a shame. There is so much to take in and in some cases more than others so little time to do just that. I'm talking of course for those that have money, budget and plan, without that many won't be going on even Grey-hound. Always plan ahead, especially with eternity.Recommended (**)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is so great, it provokes you different felling like happiness, sadness, joy and grieve. The story although predictable, it is also very touching and emotional. Two completely different old men, one a billionaire and the other a mechanic, are dying from cancer; they will become friends by sharing a list of everything they want to do before dying. The direction by Rob Reiner is excellent, he knows how to express an infinite amount of emotions without being corny. The cast is simply excellent, watching Nicholson and Freeman together in a movie is wonderful, their performances are flawless just as we are custom from them and the secondary role from Sean Hayes gives the perfect support to the main actors. This is that kind of movies which leaves you a smile on your face after it ends and a message to consider living your life to the fullest until your last day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A moving story about two men who become friends under unfortunate circumstances. One of the men Edward Cole ( Jack Nicholson) is a billionaire who owns private hospitals with a strict policy of two beds to every room. He is an indulgent man that enjoys his money and lives the single life despite the fact that he is aging. The other man is Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman) who is a panel beater/Mechanic who is strictly a family man who loves his children. Both men discover they are terminally ill with cancer and by a twist of fate end up in the same hospital and same room. Cole realizes the folly of his Hospital policies now that he is a patient for the first time in his life whilst Chambers comes to terms with his fate. Both men find empathy with each other and Cole discovers a list made by Chambers of all the things he would like to do before he dies. Cole thinks its a bit humble and decides to make the list and takes humble working class Chambers on a Billionaire extravaganza with no expense spared. They travel the world and do all the things many dream of doing. In the process Chambers imbues Cole with the gift of appreciating being loved and the preciousness of family. A very moving and sad film and with both actors now aging you get the sense that this film had real side to it. I think its worth seeing as the acting is superb and the story has values.</fullReview>

Of course it helps to have Freeman and Nicholson doing their usual excellent acting. I will not deconstruct the plot here but suffice to say that it is believable in most aspects and will carry you along swiftly to conclusion. The supporting cast members also emote with an ease that belies the difficulty inherent in making any movie.

		<fullReview>Anytime I am going to see a movie starring the likes of Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, I am a bit wary of being let down, as they have both consistently set the bar so high for so long. Based on the ads for Bucket List, I was expecting an entertaining but rather lightweight effort with lots of "old man" jokes. On the contrary, this was one of the best films I have seen in years. Nicholson and Freeman are magic together. The chemistry between them and the genuine affection their characters convey for one another is nothing short of astounding. The storyline is not particularly unpredictable, pretty much following the script that is expected based on the trailers. I guess the sentimental twists and turns that accompany their journey should not be a big surprise either, given director Rob Reiner's affinity for aiming at the heartstrings. But, the climactic final 20 minutes will take the plot and your emotions in directions you will probably not anticipate. Anyone who has had a true, deep, soul-to-soul friendship will genuinely appreciate the amazing job Freeman and Nicholson do with this film. It has secured a spot in my all time top 20. Truly special and outstanding!</fullReview>

There are some great quotes in this movie; one of my favorites made by the character Carter Chambers is, "You measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you." We recommend seeing it with the ones you love. When we saw the previews months ago, we waited with anticipation to see this. It did not disappoint. This is a great example of how we should learn to love each other and cherish the time we have with loved ones and "love each day to its fullest potential." We also liked the comment that "Thomas" tells Carter that his name is really Matthew and that Edward only calls him "Thomas" because "Matthew is too Biblical." It would have been nice to hear Edward call him by his real name in the end and realize that "Thomas" is also a Biblical name. We will definitely purchase this movie when it's available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can talk about gritty movies reflecting real life, but they reflect the life of no one I know or want to know. On the other hand, the showing of Bucket List that I attended was packed with people who were already predisposed to like the movie and the men in it. It was evident by the way they responded to the least excuse to laugh. They were ready to laugh. They wanted to laugh. And yet this movie isn't funny. It also isn't maudlin, which it could certainly have been had it not been for the sensitivity of Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson. Mostly, this note is about an audience who broke into applause at the film's end, and who stayed for the last credit. I write a movie review for our local paper. This one will get high-fives and I have not been able to say that in a very long time. I listened to the audience reaction. I mingled among them, listening, afterward. I noted that the packed house was full of those I wager no longer generally go to movies, and by an impressive number of those under thirty. The comments were all favorable, even enthusiastic. At last, Hollywood, you gave us a real movie, about real people.</fullReview>

The short comings of the film continuity are EASY to overlook in order to watch these two characters tell a story worth being told. It is not a believable story.

		<fullReview>This is really just your traditional, getting close to cliché, old-timer, getting close to death, recognizing you've missed out and been caught up in the trivial film. You'll notice this by all the "live life to the fullest" comments in other reviews. There's nothing new in terms of what the "fullest" is here.Add Reiner as director, Nicholson and Freeman to be the buddies, and suddenly people start talking Oscars. They shouldn't be. Any year this film or any part of it gets mentioned in an Oscar is a year the Oscars should recognize that the year in film has been so bad they are officially not holding Oscars for that year. It will never happen, but it should if this film gets a nomination. Fortunately, there are enough really good films already this year that it shouldn't be a problem.It's not a bad film, which is why I gave a better than average rating. The title of the film and its integration into the story is probably the best and most original part. Beyond that, it depends heavily on the acting and Freeman's voice, both of which are very good but far from the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What could be better! The perfect actors for the perfect picture and Rob Reiner Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.Wow! Absolutely a dream come true. The best in the business all in one film that is of course very sad at times but screaming funny the rest of the way. Jack is Jack, simply outstanding and and Morgan is equally spectacular. His voice is unparalled and his actoring simply brilliant. Add a dash of Rob Reiner and it is the best movie of the 4 we have seen thus far in 2008. Don't miss it! It will have you crying and roaring with laughter and give you lots to think about.Kudos to all. Oh and Sean Hayes is terrific as Jack's helper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A conventional, but heart-warming comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shaun Munro's Film Reviews (www.shaunmunro.co.uk): The Bucket List is a quick grab ? Morgan Freeman, the master of voice-over that he is, soothes us into what is one of the more offbeat, yet curiously enjoyable titles of 2007. The concept alone, of two old coots running around, causing mayhem on their last legs, portrayed by Oscar-winners no less, is a promising one.Fortunately, Rob Reiner's return to the camera wastes little time in building up its characters ? it, for fear of sounding cruel, gets them terminal rather quickly, and introduces them to one another so we can zip to the rather zany concept as soon as possible. The lines drawn are ones of stark contrast ? Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) is a high-flying, brazen man, whose values differ distinctly from those of the noble, wise family man that is Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman). People will naturally draw upon the racial aspect of the situation, yet such posturing is very much beside the point here. Both men are diagnosed with terminal illnesses, and share the same hospital room, in which they compose a "bucket list" ? a list of acts to carry out before they "kick the bucket", and so the adventure begins.The bonding between the two characters leading up to the creation of the list manages to avoid seeming forced ? their discourse isn't overly memorable or interesting, but it is certainly effective enough to engage. The film takes its time to get to its core concept, yet once we get there, observing Cole adding his wild ideas to the list (such as skydiving) is a delight to watch. It is, however, a shame that Nicholson and Freeman barely had to get out of bed (literally) for their roles, in that each instance of diving out of planes and racing stunt cars is inexorably smothered in an unhealthy, horrendous-looking measure of CGI. As Cole and Carter race in their stunt cars, Cole utters, "Are you trying to kill us?", to which Carter retorts, "So what if I do?". Thus reflects the mild gallows humour that pervades throughout the film ? Carter's reply in this instance is slightly disturbing, but the scene, with its pop-rock soundtrack and Dukes of Hazzard-esquire stunt racing, is quite the barrel of fun. It is simply a shame that the scene didn't last longer, and wasn't so diluted by visual effects.This is, however, not simply a film chronicling the hedonistic delights of two dying old men. As hilarious as some may find that concept within itself to be, a source of conflict is nonetheless introduced ? Carter's family wish for him to return home, feeling that Cole is taking him away before it is his time to go. However, Carter remains steadfast, and his revealed ambivalence towards his wife adds considerable depth to the conundrum. Underneath the jovial undertaking of two men's transition into death is a mildly layered approach, which, albeit dealt with in piecemeal fashion, at least hints at the strain and anguish endured by the families of these men. To entirely tar the film with a comical brush would be a misstep, one which Reiner narrowly avoids.Whilst the film is very evidently slanted in favour of the sage, wise Carter, it is slightly more complex than a cut and dry, black and white (literally) duality. Rather, Cole recognises Carter's ideals and philosophies, yet rebukes them with his own stubborn ones. As the picture progresses, an air of mutual understanding is felt between the two, and whilst they both learn a lesson or two, they also both retain their core values, to the (not so) bitter end. As such, there are no convoluted character reversals, and the picture manages to avoid becoming bogged down in contrivances.Near its close, The Bucket List quite predictably fractures the friendship between these two men, and draws the stark social contrasts that I was hoping that it would not. Nonetheless, by the time the conclusion rears its head, Reiner does not back out on his promise, and whilst the film does bathe in a wealth of sentimentality as the end draws near, it is affecting, and works within the context of the film. It is, however, simply a shame that only in the film's final moments is Nicholson able to truly exhibit his acting credentials, and Freeman is barely able to kick into gear at all.The Bucket List is a wild film, and whilst its message of "live life to the fullest" is neither new nor refreshingly told, Freeman and Nicholson carry a fairly tenuous concept with their spirited portrayals of two lovable oafs. The fact that Reiner never provides them with material worthy of their acting calibre is a huge waste, yet at this stage, as Nicholson and Freeman themselves endure "accelerated development", the material is relevant, and it is clear that the principal actors, despite coasting through the largely rudimentary script, had a lot of fun with it. With most other actors, this film would likely not have worked, even with the emotional chord it strikes, yet when such an absurd concept for a film is handed over to two of the most critically acclaimed actors alive today, one can at least expect a decent payoff. The Bucket List is certainly not Rob Reiner's best work, but it is far from his worst, and as a feel-good holiday film (even with its dreary undertones), it succeeds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A grand mixture of personality, grace, eccentricity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's entirely possible that when creating the character of "Edward Cole", Justin Zackham had a picture of Jack Nicholson in his head. This film was taylor made for Jack and I feel that he might just have found a little bit of himself in Edward. Rob Reiner is one of the most talented directors of this age, and he handled this project brilliantly. It's well known that Nicholson runs free with dialog and the tape doesn't stop recording until Jack's stopped talking. I'd be interested to see how much of this script was improvised and re-written. It seems to me that the character of Edward Cole is far more complex than recent critics have given him credit for. It's easy to grasp the surface psychological profile of the man. What's not as easy to understand and even harder to portray is the inner conflict Edward undergoes. His heart, mind, body, and soul are pulling him in four different directions. As a man, Edward's heart is closed, his body is strong, his mind has been in overdrive, and his soul has been in hibernation. When his body starts to give out, his heart starts to open up, his mind takes a break, and his soul carries him half way around the world with the most honest, kind, and noble man he'll ever have the pleasure of knowing. Morgan Freeman handles the character of Carter Chambers with a simplistic grace we have come to expect from him. Carter was a great man, a great husband, and a great father. His sin was getting so caught up in the "business" of life, that he forgot to live it. He had forgotten how to enjoy life's simple pleasures. He like Edward had fallen off the path years ago. The irony of a meaningful friendship between a man whose accomplishments have exceeded his talents and abilities, and a man whose intelligence far exceeded his accomplishments has a beautiful message. A message that insights the idea that a man's accomplishments cannot be measured by his success but by the simple concept of "joy". Edward stumbles onto a life's epiphany. Atop a pyramid in Egypt, Edward explains to us that he has found Joy in his life, yet his life has not given it to others. I believe that Carter Chambers had yet to find the joy in his life, however had indeed passed that gift to his loved ones. These men completed each other. In living together for a short while, showed each other how to appreciate life in a way neither had ever considered before. Carter's character had a shorter distance and an easier road in which to travel. Edward needed more time, and a stronger reason to understand the gift Carter had given him. His character grows more in the few months we know him than in the sum of the passed years of his life. Jack becomes a window for the audience. He shows us fear through eccentricity and he shows us love through loss. I ask you one question. After seeing this film, can you now imagine anyone but Jack playing Edward? Finally, Sean Hayes gives a surprisingly "grace"full performance as he depicts the idea that when you find yourself in the presence of truly great men, you cant help but fall in love with them. I give this movie a 10, my reasons? Cast selection?if you can call it that, in my opinion?the roles chose them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay its fluff, but good fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess I just love Morgan Freeman and I think Jack Nicholson is funnier that he ever use to be when he was young. Bucket List is, well yes its a male bonding movie and yes it's sentimental to a fault; but its good male bonding and its great sentiment. There are no great performances or lines or action in this movie. It's all about two grown men making a list of the things they'd like to do before they die (trailers tell us that much). It's easy to watch and eat popcorn to. Women will cry and men will laugh and everyone will have a great time. But if you look closer, just like The Fountain, it says buckets about life and the thing we're most afraid of - death. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack and Morgan are a pleasure to watch.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. I'll admit I have my guilty pleasures. These are films I see not because they are great art or original storytelling but because they make me feel good. The Bucket List falls into this category. It's a feel good movie with some laughs. You can pretty much figure out the whole story from the trailer - yet you still want to be in that world. Jack Nicholson plays a gruff businessman who is treated for cancer. He eventually connects with his trivia spouting, family man roommate (Morgan Freeman) because of their shared condition. When they discover that they both have less than a year to live, they make a list of things they would like to do before they "kick the bucket." The problem I have with the script is that everything comes so easily to them. First, they have unlimited financial resources to travel the world because one of them is rich. I could live with this contrivance if the filmmaker used that screen time to develop the relationship of the two characters. But their relationship comes easily too. There are no real obstacles to overcome that would allow them to fully bond. But luckily, Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman give such lived-in performances that we feel like we know them. While gazing at the pyramids, they touch on universal themes such as the importance of faith and share some regrets. They challenge each other to discover the true joy in life. It is certainly a joy to watch Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freedman at the top of their game (and the top of the world!) If this movie inspires you to find the joy in life or contemplate it's meaning, I'd say that was worth the price of admission. Jana Segal, Reelinspiration dot blogspot</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What more can be said about a meaningful and profound movie. The Humor was timed perfectly,...the pyramid scene looked real until I saw that the shadow didn't move after a few minutes. At that height it would've been more evident, but that's such a trivial technicality cause it was all just a backdrop to what is really important in this movie. Not too many films have effected me like this in a long time. But, then again I'm a bit over sensitive when watching dramas. hee hee... Many good quotes in this movie. Definitely an important family film. Makes you realize what's really important in life, and Death. Well, that's all I have to say about it, but I can't post this until I reach 10 lines so I'm just going to type some stuff here. So, just see the movie, it's really that good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>GREAT film; great actors......a must see.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is another AMAZING piece of art --- the art lies in the timing &amp; presentation of sensitive material which in other less able hands may have gone off the rails and lost it's way. The sheer poignancy of the subject matter which is part &amp; parcel of the human condition, and by consequence their off spring, creates a challenge in the presentation. It could have easily slipped into trite clichés, but nothing of the sort.You will laugh 'til it hurts, and cry for the same reason.It takes an unpalatable scenario, and brings us face to face with our own mortality --- waiting for each of us around the proverbial "next corner" . It has the potential to awaken those sleeping among us; frittering away their lives, and cautions us not to waste our years. It challenges each one of us to experience at least some of our dreams. Yes, however, fanciful is the travelogue, the message to seek our bliss should not be missed. Some of the photo ops on their journey give us great glimpses of some of the wonders of the world.Perhaps you will make your own "Bucket List". :)</fullReview>

It was a touching movie about how two strangers learned about life, friendship, love and yourself. I think that the movie will go on and earn a lot of praise and an award or two. The only reason it wont is cause it came out so soon in the year. Jack and Morgan did a great job and made the characters real to the audience. Not only did it have it's touching moments. It had it's lighter funnier moments too. And those lighter moments made the movie even more enjoyable. You will cry some. But you will laugh as well. One for all to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My main man Ray?The Bucket List</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With absolutely no interest in seeing The Bucket List, the opportunity presented itself to check it out. I enjoy most Rob Reiner films?I mean come on, he did The Princess Bride and This is Spinal Tap, he gets a reprieve for every other bad movie he makes?and love both Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman, so I thought, what the hell? It ends up that the film was actually pretty good. The trailer does not do it very much justice, though. Sure all the sappy sentimentality is there, the plot is transparent throughout, and it tries to tug at your heartstrings, but as a whole it is so much more than that. The evolution of Nicholson's character is believable and the journey the two take in order to complete their "bucket list" is fun to go along with. What I anticipated being a hokey trip to different landmarks, with no real payoff, surprisingly turned out to be a trek worth taking.It all begins with the realization that both our leads are terminally ill and soon to share a hospital room. We are treated to a brief glimpse into their lives pre-news to get a grasp on what their characters are like, and this is very welcome, putting us in the mindframe to have preconceived notions of them that will soon evolve. Freeman's role is very likable and very relatable. He is a family man that gave up on his own dreams in order to make sure his children would be raised with all the support they needed. Never forgetting his love for history, this mechanic is a wealth of knowledge and a Jeopardy wiz. He is an immense contrast to the crass, wealthy, and non-personable hospital owner played by Nicholson. This role is where the laughs come fast as he is sharp-witted and sarcastic to great effect. Conversations between he and Sean Hayes, as his assistant, are never dull.It would be interesting to know whether the cast and crew actually went to any of the places they visited?Hong Kong, France, Himalayas, etc.?because at times the scenes looked horribly bluescreened, and others looked real. Even when they are skydiving, I wasn't sure if their faces looked flat due to gravity or because they were mapped onto real divers post-production. I would think the budget would be too high to actual go to all of them besides just taking exposition shots. Either way, you are really on the journey to hear the interactions between the two men, and the environments are secondary. It is the way in which these two disparate souls come together and ultimately save each other's final moments on Earth from being full of loneliness, regret, and pity.No one besides the two leads is given that much screen time, but those moments they do receive are always honest. Between Freeman's wife, played by Beverly Todd, and his son visiting the hospital and really letting him know where they stand on his final days, we are shown how this family has been put together. They are close-knit to the point where their relationships have been out of more duty than love. Sacrifice and routine have taken the place of spontaneity and compassion long ago. Where they all want to be with him at the end, because that is what they should do, he finds that it is a vacation from them for him that is absolutely necessary. Todd is very good with her anger at Nicholson's character for taking her husband away, and by the end?where she seems to have made amends?it is completely appropriate despite the quick turnaround. This is due to the fact that these men forged a strong bond in the few months they knew each other, as well as the fact that it was a few months, not days. Time travels fast in this film and you need to realize that you don't get to see every single second.This is no masterpiece and it will not engage your mind at all, but as far as un-intrusive fluff stories with heart go, you can do a lot worse. The acting is great and there are some really good laughs throughout. It is definitely what you would expect from it while succeeding on all accounts, letting your cynical mind take a backseat to a tale of redemption and friendship that will warm the heart and bring a smile to your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A joyful road to death..."Find the joy in your life" Two of the best actors in the world will make you laugh and cry, in what is a 1hour 39 minutes of pure art.Morgan Freeman and Jack Nicholson compete each other for the kudos. There is no image wizardry, no steamy scenes or besotting beauties but pure emotion and magnificent portrayal."Everybody is afraid to die alone" The way Nicholson and Freeman help each other to find the joys in their life and the way the bucket list is completed, the director needs a praise...The scene where Freeman goes to his house and rings the bell,instead of opening it with his own key, to let his wife open the door- how good to have someone to care for you! The Collage where Freeman has dinner with his family and Nicholson-a multi-millionaire- smashing the boxed-food all alone in his suit and crying Ah! Do I need to say more? Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance....the 5 stages...One of the two,maybe both, are up for an Oscar.' With a good screenplay and direction that worked out flawlessly, "The Bucket List" is yet another testimony to the power of human emotions and ideas. It is not the highly expected Christmas blockbuster, but it sure will be remembered long after the Christmas...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Synopsis) Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) has worked hard his whole life to build his hospital corporation into a Fortune 500 company. As CEO, Edward is on top of the world when cancer comes knocking on his door. In the hospital, Edward is put into a room with another cancer patient, Carter Chambers (Morgan Freeman). The doctors have given both the news that they have six-months to a year to live. Carter just blocks out the bad news and continues watching Jeopardy on TV, because he knows all the answers. When Carter was young, he was able to attend the first year of college, but when his wife got pregnant, Carter found work as an automobile mechanic. Carter remembers that in one of his classes the professor gave them an assignment to fill out a "Bucket List" of the things you want to do in life before you kick the bucket. Carter starts writing his list of things to do. Edward sees the list and writes some other things to do like skydiving and race car driving. They both decide to leave the hospital and embark on fulfilling all the things on the bucket list.(My Comment) I totally enjoyed this movie. It has an original story line that everybody can relate to. What will you do if you know when you were going to die? Instead of waiting to die in the hospital, Edward and Carter take the high road and decide to live. Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are both excellent in their parts, and it makes the movie flow with ease. They make you believe that they really have become friends and finally find the joy of life. Even though the movie is based on both men dying with cancer, the movie will make you laugh and cry at the same time, but it is one of those tender types of cries. Whether or not we know when we may expect to die, we all should live life to the fullest. This is a must see movie; Jack and Morgan have a winner, and maybe an Oscar. (Warner Bros. Pictures, Rated PG-13) (10/10)</fullReview>

Whatever you do, do not listen to the media on this and watch it because it will give you that warm feeling in your heart that you have been longing for. It is a story about friendship and more importantly what is really important in life. This movie made me cry and laugh, all the visuals are so aesthetically pleasing you will not be disappointed. It made me decide to make a bucket list now and save it and then later in life check it not only to cross things off but to decide whether something still holds merit or should be switched with something I learned over the years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two old men dying promises bathos. Throw in one who's not spoken with his daughter in 15 years, one who's not sure if he's still in love with his lifelong partner, one who believes in god and another who doesn't and you have a Hollywood formula designed to elicit cheap tears and easy philosophy. To its credit The Bucket List knows how its own setup could be overplayed. Freeman and Nicholsen, with Reiner's deft hand subtly present, step up their games and render what could be melodrama into a unique look into what it means to live a life and what living a life means. The film all but announces that it doesn't have an answer. What it does do is conclude that not asking makes the journey not worth the effort. Brilliant performances by Freeman and Nicholson and a nice turn by Sean Hayes make this a definite must see.</fullReview>

However for those who cherish cinematic power - like the one present in "The Bucket List" - there was something missing, something very tiny but of great importance. It was as if the best cooks in the world had dedicated themselves to making the best cake, taking care of ever little detail and at the end, had produced the best cake ever to be baked but had forgotten to dredge it with sugar powder.

		<fullReview>I watched this one a couple of days ago.And i have to admit it's a touchy storyline with Jack Nicholson easing into the character of cynical billionaire who finds out the rule he made for his own hospital isn't really that great when he is detected with a brain cancer. On the other hand Morgan Freeman a hardworking mechanic,life loving and a walking encyclopedia who seem to know something about everything,lands up in the same hospital room as Nicholson's and thats when the emotional and entertainment roller-coaster begins.With days numbered they end up making a list of "things to do before i kick the bucket".Nicholson is at his wittiest best with most of the one-liners working for him.Freeman still have that charm from the last time i saw him acting in Bruce almighty.Enjoy it with your family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly one of the greatest movie ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually have a distaste for Hollywood productions. During the past few years, I've come to terms with the fact that when you see big names on new movies, you're usually in for a disappointment.... I'm glad to say, that this time I was wrong... This film is a true masterpiece. Ever so often, a movie comes along that is so profound and reminds you what good movies can do to you. For me, it's a movie that is funny, heartwarming, genuine, has a message, and most important of all - a hell of a cast. "The Bucket List" is one of those films. Not only is it one of the funniest movies I ever saw, but it's also a movie that reminded me, that I need to live. To make the most of my life before it's all too late. This film is so great, words do not suffice. Do yourself a favor and see it. A classic is born, ladies and gentlemen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another feel good movie that has left me with a smile. Im 18 and I'm Male and I don't really tend to watch these sorts of movies but when I was told it was worth it I had to see what the fuss was about.Going into this movie I thought it would be Comedy Orinetated and given the trailer I watched it had a lot of classic funnies material, but when the credits rolled I would have had the same smile on my dial as if it was a comedy. Don't get me wrong there were a lot of funny parts, but as mentioned above I was HeartwarmedThis isn't a movie Just for women, I would recommend this to couples looking for an Entertaining evening.Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman both Outstanding actors had amazing chemistry together and it seemed like they were Best Friends LONG before the filming of this movie commenced.Morgan Freeman made a remark in the film "We were supposed to write down things we wished to achieve before we kicked the bucket, and i wrote things like Earn a Million Dollars and Be The First Black President." I thought this line was Ironic Because he clearly has earned 1 Million Dollars and he was a black President in Deep Impact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in NYC on Christmas day. I wasn't sure what to expect given that the movie reviewer in the NY Post loved the movie and the movie reviewer in the NY Times apparently hated the movie. All I can say is that the Bucket List was thoroughly entertaining in all respects. The script was funny and heart warming. There was not a dry eye in the house at the end of the movie. Anyone who has had a family member or friend touched by a serious illness will relate to this movie in a good way.So I say go with the NY Post reviewer recommendation and see the Bucket List.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Bucket list' explores the old theme of the 'things you want to do before you die'. The theme is no way deeper than, say, 'what would you do if you had a couple of million dollars' or 'what would you do if you had only one more day to live'. In fact, The Bucket list finds a way to combine the two.Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson) owns the hospital he gets to be in after being diagnosed with cancer. His roommate Carter Chambers (Freeman) is a middle class Auto mechanic who, as it turns out, is faring no better. Both men are told they have approximately one year left to live, at best.After this the men decide to draw up a list of things they have always wanted to do but never did. With entries like 'race a shelby Mustang and 'kiss the most beautiful girl in the world' the two men set out to fly around the world to achieve all the entries on the list.The film is really nothing more and nothing less than what the tagline describes and often feels a bit schmaltzy in it's deliverance. Both Freeman and Nicholson give away ample performances but the real chemistry between them I hoped to see fails to emerge due to the often slightly ponderous script.The story could have easily been more insightful if the writers had chosen not to let the men pursue such soapy theme's like Nicholson looking up his long lost daughter. Then again, real life usually is pretty soapy, isn't it...but I digress...That said, there is absolutely nothing wrong in bringing this one home for a view. It just could have been a lot better.6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of attending a screening of this new film recently. As was so well described by the previous posts, this is the holiday film to see. Beautifully conceived and dispatched, our old friends Jack and Morgan have unabashedly created a sentimental road trip. A perfect remedy to the hype of the season.A word on the film's featured song, "Say", by John Mayer. Clearly written for the film, this is my bet for the Best Song of the 2008 Academy Awards. A lovely song, well scored and performed, of advice and optimism. It has the kind of broad appeal which the members typically vote for, and lyrically expresses the film's message: Life is short, so square up your relationships and enjoy the journey while you may.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nicholson &amp; Freeman excel in this nicely produced dramedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BUCKET LIST (2007) *** Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman, Sean Hayes, Beverly Todd, Rob Morrow, Alfonso Freeman, Rowena King. Well executed but predictable dramedy about two strangers who become friends after discovering their one thing in common: both are dying from cancer. Nicholson and Freeman make for a fine cinematic duo as the unlikely partners in crime who are out to share in life's rewards before they 'kick the bucket' ? hence the list of things to do prior. Filmmaker Rob Reiner gets both the drama and comedy balanced nicely and novice screenwriter Justin Zackham avoids the truly mawkish and instead finds the one theme: life is worth living with love in it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>movies are made to elicit emotion / reaction / the highs and the lows in our lives that collectively define who we are... and this movie delivers in bucket fulls...better to see this movie with a general idea of the story line...don't need spoilers to take away from this experience. so much to look for...the characters, the locations, the lighting, the seemingly seamless scene transitions, and the power of the performance. the mood swings... escaping to joy and laughter...suddenly plummeting back to the grim reminders of our vulnerability and how fleeting Time really is... this movie will suck the air out of your gut and reach deep into your soul. be there before it's too late !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Great List...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner, the director of Sleepless in Seattle brings forth this warm and tender film, The Bucket List starring Academy Award winners Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman. The film tells the story of Edward and Carter, two older men just diagnosed with terminal cancer who break out for the road trip of their lives. Written by Justin Zachman responsible for penciling some lesser known works completely creates three-dimensional characters for the viewer to love and know.Nicholson in his later years of cinema has been coming off a little dry lately. Not feeling him as authentic in previous works Nicholson completely changed my mind here. His Edward as fun as he is, is so encouraging and engaging to the eye. Very reminiscent of his wondrous turn in About Schmidt, Nicholson puts forth new efforts and caricatures. Showing the vitality of Edward and his soft weaker parts is no easy task. Nicholson is still at the top of his game in his sixties.Freeman who brought in a powerhouse performance in Gone Baby Gone earlier in the year is at the peak of his acting game now. Winning for Million Dollar Baby and previously nominated for his works in The Shawshank Redemption, Driving Miss Daisy, and Street Smart, I was sure his ship had sailed in the 90s. This might be the best performance of the veteran actors career as his Carter is so inviting and beautiful in artistry, it's unbelievable he isn't being considered for any awards consideration. Co-leading with legend Jack Nicholson, the two are both so good they cancel each other out.Supporting players are viable as ever especially coming from comedy TV-star Sean Hayes who is less flamboyant and even more superb. Beverly Todd as Carter's wife takes the suffering wife role to a new level of tragedy and sadness. Director Rob Reiner's direction here is one of the best of his career. Topping his previous works of Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry Met Sally and Misery, this stands up next to Stand by Me and A Few Good Men as the director's most personal film to date.The Bucket List is so inspiring and so beautiful and should be seen by all especially those of earlier generations who feel they never got that chance. When the National Board of Review named this one of the ten best films of the year, heads were scratched across the web. I, too was scratching; on the surface who looks so plain and bland. Watch top notch actors bringing in their most personal and tender roles of their careers. That will change your mind.Grade: ***?/****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best movies I have ever seen! Academy Award Winner Jack Nicholson does it again, this time playing an elderly millionaire dying of cancer. While undergoing chemotherapy the Nicholson character shares a hospital room with the ever wonderful Morgan Freeman, who plays a mechanic, also dying of cancer. They form a friendship, the basis for this picture, that is as enduring as any other cinematic friendship we have ever witnessed on the silver screen. Freeman creates a Bucket List (things to do before you kick the...) and the two men embark on a world journey to fulfill their lives, their hearts and the list. A movie about a sensitive subject, one that we avoid because it is too real - dying - is so aptly and tenderly handled by director Rob Reiner that you feel wonderful watching it. Of course, there is sadness and crying, but at times there are hilarious moments and belly laughs. This is a movie we can all relate to, for those guys could be us..or maybe our fathers. The acting is touching and tender, the best either actor has ever performed. The music is appropriate and the photography wonderful. You'll laugh, you'll cry and later you'll be discussing "The Bucket List" for a long time to come. I highly recommend the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Appealing movie with a suggestion of irony on a serious topic - simply great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is about Edward Cole (J. Nicholson) and Carter Chambers (M. Freeman) who - both at the age of 45 - are facing the same faith: death due to cancer. The doctors gave them not more than 6 months to live. Owing to this estimation, they write a bucket list featuring everything they were wishing &amp; planning on doing in their lives. So, these two strangers and a bit contrary persons leave hospital and cross out things of their bucket list point by point. This is the beginning of a strong friendship and a journey thru the most beautiful and impressing places on earth.The Bucket List is a very inspiring story showing you one meaning of life (which in this case is "not only to dream" but to actually live your dreams in time!) and how faith can bring two strangers together. It points out what immense effect a forecast of having only 6 months left to live can have on you and your life. Once you know how much time you have left everything changes - your attitude and your perception (this applies especially to Edward Cole). The Bucket List really manages to bring this atmosphere to the big screen which is rare to find in a movie these days. Another thing that contributes to the quality and value of this movie is the acting which is completely over the top - thanks to this awesome cast. Nicholson and Freeman proved once again how good and experienced they are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie really sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Rob Reiner made some excellent films (such as When Harry Met Sally and Stand By Me).But,in recent years,he's making craps like Alex and Emma,Rumor Has it and ,now, The Bucket List which is not only the worst movie of his career but also one of the worst movies I have seen in recent months.The Bucket List is full of cheap sentimentalism.Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman are two great actors but they are wasted in here.Also,the concept from this film is copied from the German movie Knocking on Heaven's Door.They are different on their development but the main concept is the same.The Bucket List is a crappy movie with a lot of cheap sentimentalism.If you wanna see an excellent movie about someone with cancer,I totally recommend you Le Temps Qui Reste,which does not have cheap sentimentalism,but a very intense realism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Went to the premiere of the Bucket List on Dec. 16th and walked away feeling inspired and ready to come up with a Bucket List of my own! Jack and Morgan were great and delivered excellent performances. I actually read an earlier version of the script (about two years ago now) and am not sure that parts of the script, which I remember being very lyrical and touching, were translated into the film. Overall, though, the movie turned out great, and I'm sure will be a hit. I definitely recommend for all you film people out there to read the script - it was one of the best scripts I've read this year, and I know that our company is on the lookout for the next scripts coming from the writer, Justin Zackham.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Miss This Bucket!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes this movie better than just another Disease Of The Week Movie is that it CHOOSES LIFE. That is no small distinction as it could have easily been condescendingly mawkish and all-too-precious. The gimmick is that two men are given separate diagnoses that they each have less than a year to live. Nicholson is a powerful CEO, Freeman is a humble automobile mechanic. That they share the same hospital room is a device that we accept, because the opportunity to see the likes of Jack Nicholson spark off of Morgan Freeman is too delicious to quibble over. Sean Hayes is perfectly imperturbable as Jack's efficacious personal assistant, Rob Morrow is appropriately low-key as Jack's doctor. Morgan has a loving family that he undervalues, Jack is as wealthy (and as alienated) as Citizen Kane: their only common ground is their fatal illnesses. One day Morgan writes a wish list of things he would like to do once he gets better, a list that Morgan tosses away once he is given the bad news. Jack takes Morgan's list out of the trash, criticizes it for being "too weak", and the movie kicks into high gear. Morgan has made a career to being Best Friend Forever to very unlikeable people; from DRIVING MISS DAISY to SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION to MILLION DOLLAR BABY; but he has never had a better foil than Jack. Jack has been tempering his machismo with surprising tenderness for several years now; from AS GOOD AS IT GETS to ABOUT SCHMIDT to SOMETHING'S GOTTA GIVE; this movie allows him to ruminate about religion, family and Carpe Diem: it is a summing-up of his acting persona. The screenplay by Justin Zackham is wise without being arrogant. The sure-footed direction is a remarkable return to form of our old friend Rob Reiner. It has the elegiac tone of TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, the exuberance of COCOON and the coolest acting duet since BUTCH CASSIDAY AND THE SUNDANCE KID. So get a BUCKET of popcorn and a BUCKET of soda pop and SEE THIS MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...well, I love Jack Nick's work, but I wish he had retired after The Departed. Wait a sec....just hear what I have to say first before everyone goes all..."Well, he's the greatest actor of all time!!!!" on me. First, ...I am not saying that he's a bad actor...I mean c'mon,...is Nocholson....he's a foundation for acting. Second, I'm just not amazed with his sentimental-romantic-one liner films again and again and again. I mean, yes, Jackie's got a f@*king great way of acting, but I get mad at the trailers that just advertise him saying the "badass line" of the film just so that people can say..."Ooooh....the new Nicholson film looks awesome!" You know what I mean?"You all are...act accordingly!" "Now, why did I just do that?" "We're not all doctors, baby!" "You can't handle the truth!"I love them, but......how many times can we hear them before going...."another one?....okay...I'll get a ticket. Crap!" Yes....I get it...Nichoilson can kick anyones ass in style and personality, but I think that his quality goes beyond simple memorable lines on films. Third, yes....the story seems like a great pitch....two cancer bound patients going on and about the things they should do before death and actually doing them. Cool. I'm not interested....I'll wait for it on video because I kinda see what the films going to be about...after all it is kind of a self explanatory tittle.... "The Bucket List." I love Jack Nick, but I wish he'd retired because after a crapload of Oscars, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, and million of dollars, thousands of movies,...it's kind of like....well.. "you've made your point!" Finally, I think most of us have an affliction with silver screen legends and we wish that they'd always be forever and ever. The sad truth is that that is impossible. As for Morgan Freeman...he's awesome too and I love him,...so....whatever...hell! I'll probably go watch this just because you have to like the fact that they're acting together. No I'm not a hypocrite nor am I trying to contradict myself. I mean, yes I know what will happen, sure it's cliché and mushy, but both Jack and Morgan are great entertainers. I mean...call me a sucker, but on the other side of my argument, I believe that as long as they're around, I'll go watch it just out of respect and admiration for those guys. The day those two mofos' kick the bucket, then I know I'll probably be sad. So...What the hell! Why not. hahahahahahaha</fullReview>
