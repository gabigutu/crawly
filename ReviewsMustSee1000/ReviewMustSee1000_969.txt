		<shortDescription>One Of Schaffner's Best...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL opens in scenic and remote Paraguay where Barry Kohler (a young Steve Guttenburg) is on the trail of a mysterious gathering of former Third Reich heavy hitters, including Eduard Seibert (James Mason), now in exile. As his information becomes more detailed, he contacts Ezra Lieberman (Laurence Olivier), a renowned Nazi hunter. In the meantime Dr. Josef Mengele (Gregory Peck) makes the scene and after Kohler's bugging of a secret meeting goes wrong, Lieberman is left with only a thread of a much deeper story, which he sets about to unravel...Even though the plot is fairly well known by now, I will assume some people are not familiar with Ira Levin's book or the film. In fact the less you know about the plot the better; I think that the dust jacket gives far too much of the story away...Anyway, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL is a film that toes a very dangerous line, I mean few film makers want to turn a man like Menegele into a camp figure. But the cast and crew handles the material with deft intelligence. The cast is fantastic: Peck, as Mengele, delivers a strong performance that never falters. In the tired yet determined Lieberman, Laurence Olivier creates a wonderful character; a late highlight of a distinguished career. James Mason, as Seibert and Bruno Ganz as a mouthpiece for outdated genetic research, do well to support the action, but are given little to do. It is Peck and Olivier that propel the film along; the violent showdown between the two men is a must see.Jerry Goldsmith supports the on screen action with a Straussian waltz to tie in the Austrian backdrop. Goldsmith also provide some terse action music for the third act of the film. This is one of the last films that Goldsmith and director Franklin J. Schaffner would collaborate on. On that note, it would seem to me high time for a more detailed retrospective of Schaffner's body of work; which includes THE WARLORD, PATTON, ISLANDS IN THE STREAM, PLANET OF THE APES, PAPILLION, LIONHEART. It is Schaffner's sensibilities that keep THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL from jumping the track. He uses steady camera work and smooth style to create a world the characters can inhabit (something "over" directors of today know little about). Schaffner's style is more subtle, workman like, which may explain why he is not better known among the general populace. He keeps THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL grounded and allows his actors to flesh the characters out, which makes all the difference in the world. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than you'd think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Had I seen the film without reading the back of the video cassette, I would have enjoyed the film a lot more. But for some reason, a major plot point, revealed 1 1/2 hours into the film, is plainly written in black on orange. Since the movie moves in ever decreasing circles to reveal this secret quite efficiently, I don't see why the publicity department chose to sabotage it.Nevertheless, the plot is more plausible than it sounds when you try to describe it (which, as I have just said, should be avoided anyway), and the leads play beautifully. Especially incredible is Laurence Olivier as the doddering, worldly-wise jewish Nazi hunter, Dr. Lieberman. You'd never expect the frail form in this movie to be the same man as Hamlet. Gregory Peck also plays Dr. Joseph Mengele as suitably and calmly evil. A lesser actor would find playing the part of a Nazi Death Doctor, responsible for some of the worst atrocities in human history, a perfect excuse to ham it up and click into the black-hatted, moustache-twisting token villain.The less impressive acting of Steve Guttenberg overacting into a telephone and Jeremy Black with a really strange german accent as Erich Doring. This I can forgive. The ending is also comfortable and understated, with a moral instead of a huge explosion, as could have been expected in a 90's movie. Worth seeing, especially if you know nothing about the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Scary Concept!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When "The Boys From Brazil" was released in 1978, the concept of cloning was more science fiction than reality. Now, almost 25 years later, the possibility of human cloning is here. The fictional story involves real life German WWII "Angel of Death", Dr. Josef Mengele (Gregory Peck) having cloned 94 baby boys from the cells of you know who and placed them around the world in environments that closely approximate the real life conditions in which the donor was raised, in the hope of reproducing an exact duplicate. Student Barry Kohler (Steve Guttenberg in an excellent early performance) discovers the plot and tries to alert famed Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman (Laurence Olivier). After Kohler is murdered, Weisenthal begins to take the warnings seriously. He too discovers the plot and frightens the Nazi commanders in South America (including James Mason) enough to have Mengele's project canceled. Mengele tries to carry on alone before the inevitable showdown with Lieberman. Gregory Peck, cast against type, gives a chilling performance as Mengele. Olivier, complete with Jewish accent and looking thin and frail as the Nazi hunter (allegedly based on Simon Weisenthal), gives an excellent performance as well. Mason is given little to do as Mengele's Chief of Security. Young Jeremy Black plays the various clones convincingly right down to the accents. Others in the cast include Lili Palmer as Lieberman's sister, Uta Hagan as Frieda the prisoner who provides Lieberman with vital information, Anne Meara and Rosemary Harris as two of the mothers and Denholm Elliot and John Dehner in other roles. It's really frightening to realize that the concept of cloning presented in this story could now become a reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent film translation of Ira Levin's novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had read "The Boys From Brazil" years before I ever saw the movie. When I did see the film, I was amazed how closely it actually tracked the brilliantly-written novel.  This is an excellent thriller. The Nazi's plot is unraveled slowly, first filling you with confusion, then disbelief, and finally, astonishment &amp; terror. As far-fetched as the Nazi's scheme sounds at first, it really is close enough to medical reality for a taste of true horror. Gregory Peck is disturbingly realistic as the Nazi doctor Mengele, who masterminds the entire fiendish plot. His character in the film is so real and sinister as to be completely believable. In fact, the entire cast does such a great job that the movie's plot strikes even closer to home. If you like well-written, well acted suspense/thrillers, this is one of the very best. I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man, does Gregory Peck seem to be enjoying himself here. He was never good with accents but he forges ahead anyway, so "Bobby" comes out as "Buppy." He huffs and puffs. He blows houses down. He strangles a man among bowls of fruit and caviar on the buffet table, and afterwards tells the guy's wife, "Shut up -- you ugly bitch." He makes horrible faces with his jowls widened like a basilisk's. He revels in his villainy. And the best moment in the film is at the end, when he finally greets his nemesis, Lawrence Olivier playing a Nazi hunter, raises his pistol, and smiles, "Herr LEE-ber-man."Olivier overplays as well although in a more subtle fashion, as befits Lord Olivier, ex-Hamlet, using time-honored techniques such as long pauses before and during significant utterances, and a tendency to look out of the side of his eyes without turning his head. He also projects a kind of wiliness that Peck doesn't show, a kind of ferret compared to his adversary's bulldozer.Both of them evidently had a good time working together. During the hilarious climactic struggle in which the two aging men with tasty scarlet slashes on their cheeks roll over each other, grabbing for the obligatory gun, biting each other's ears, Olivier at one point during the shooting found himself on the bottom, being crushed by Peck, and looking up at Peck he pursed his lips and batted his eyelashes. The plot is an effective thriller, so silly that even Ira Levin joked about it. But it makes a kind of nutty sense and carries you along. The kid who plays Hitler really IS obnoxious and I wouldn't mind seeing David Rubenstein knock him off. The location shooting is terrific and distracts one from the weaknesses of the plot. There is an enormous dam set in a mammoth mountain range. And it captures Lancaster, Pennsylvania, perfectly -- the early winter drizzle and chill, rolling hills of woodlots and farm land, the Grandma Moses farmhouses with their distinctive architecture and their barns. (That part of Pennsylvania really looks like what is called "a picture postcard.")There actually was an organization of ex-Nazi comrades rather like the one described. And a lot of Nazis made it to safety in South America where they lived quietly in modest settings, not the white-suited baronial splendor of Peck's place. They kept busts of Hitler on the mantelpiece, hung Nazi flags on the walls, and even had a Miss Nazi contest. (I'm not making that up. It's from the staff of the Jewish Heritage Museum.) The historical inaccuracies are unimportant to the plot but perhaps not to our understanding of human nature. The mind seems to have a tendency to operate in superlatives. It makes it easier to think about things if they can be divided up clearly into good and evil. Not just good and evil, but perfect good and perfect evil. Thus, Mengele was a dentist, as we know, but here he is given both an MD and a PhD -- "the perfect combination for a scientist." Mengele, instead of a monstrous and lowbrow sadist, is turned into the personification of evil. He doesn't even have a dog or a girlfriend. Mengele is useful to human thinking -- the mythological Mengele that is -- because he provides us with a perfect bad example, someone we can fully hate without guilt. If Mengele didn't exist we would have to invent someone like him. (PS: he does not exist anymore.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good flick. Good, not great.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An exciting plot, a workmanlike script, and good performances from Peck and Olivier help overcome the complete implausibility of the premise. It's fun seeing what may be Steve Guttenberg's best performance. And Lilli Palmer was still gorgeous, even in her 60s.The worst thing about watching it for the first time is knowing beforehand what the film's big, shocking revelation is (in fact, summaries of the film's plot tend to give it away, apparently not realizing that it's supposed to be an epiphany). I would really like to have seen it without knowing in advance just what Ezra Lieberman was going to figure out about the mysterious deaths of those harmless old men.Those who have looked into Mengele's postwar career will be amused at Peck's makeup. In an effort at accuracy, it is based on a picture which was widely circulated for years in the belief that it showed a middle-aged Mengele. In fact, the man in the photo was just some poor South American shlub who had the misfortune to be snapped by an overenthusiastic photographer. We now know that Mengele himself was much less impressive in his later years, with his sagging jowls, gray hair and walrus mustache. In fact, photos show him as rather friendly-looking and avuncular--except for his eyes, which are stone cold.This film, of course, has nothing to do with the real Mengele's postwar life. Mengele was not a commanding, white-suited figure, living the high life in expensive hotels, attending parties with sycophantic underlings, and continuing his hellish experiments in a jungle laboratory. He lived out his days as a sad, pathetic weasel of a man whom nobody liked. That's a better fate for Mengele...but it wouldn't make such a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Engaging mystery with impressive performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young Nazi-hunter Barry Kohler (Steve Guttenberg) is tracking war criminals in Paraguay when he discovers that the old Nazis seem to be plotting something big. Kohler's fears are confirmed when the Nazis' guest of honor arrives: the infamous concentration camp scientist Josef Mengele (Gregory Peck). Mengele order his followers to carry out the murders of over 90 men, all of whom are 65-year-old civil servants, none of whom are Jews. Kohler phones his idol, Ezra Lieberman (Laurence Olivier), with a report of what he's uncovered. Lieberman has fallen on hard times and lives in a leaky apartment where he cannot pay the rent. He's spent his life following every lead about Nazi war criminals and is tired of the chase. However, when Kohler's call (and his life) are abruptly cut short, Lieberman knows he must act. He begins to investigate the bizarre plot. Why should Mengele want to kill these men who seem entirely unconnected to each other or the war? Why 65-year-olds? Why civil servants? Sadly many of the blurbs about this movie give away the solution to this mystery and the meaning of the title, but the mystery is much more engaging if the viewer unravels it along with Lieberman.Olivier is fantastic in his role! He always put as much effort into his roles in genre films like this one, "Marathon Man," and "Dracula" as he devoted to Shakespeare, and it shows. He is thoroughly convincing as an elderly German Jew. Gregory Peck is also magnificent; he radiates pure evil. The top-notch supporting cast includes James Mason and Denholm Elliott. (So what's Steve Guttenberg doing in this movie?)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is such a classic piece of mystery drama, it's inconceivable that it's not better known. A late seventies film starring the cream of cinema from 20 years earlier, this follows a Nazi plot (in the present day) and the efforts of a Nazi hunter to put the pieces together. The elements include a number of apparently unrelated children, a decades-old plot, a series of murders, Josef Mengele, and a short appearance by one `Steven' Guttenberg, in an early film role. When you finally realise what has been going on, it ups the stakes dramatically. Well worth seeking out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Boys from Brazil" is admittedly an improbable movie, but chilling nonetheless. American college student Barry Kohler (Steve Guttenberg) finds Nazi doctor Josef Mengele (Gregory Peck) hiding out in South America. Kohler tries to report Mengele's diabolical plans (for a Fourth Reich) to Nazi hunter Ezra Liebermann (Laurence Olivier*), but Mengele murders him. The rest of the movie shows Liebermann investigating the mysterious deaths of several men around the world, all of whom had sons who look exactly the same. The climax comes when Liebermann and Mengele finally meet.As is apparently always the case with Ira Levin's stories ("Rosemary's Baby" and "The Stepford Wives"), everything seems to be normal at first, until some point where you realize that there is clearly something unseemly going on. It may be an outlandish concept, but the whole movie is quite intense once you realize what Mengele and his cronies are planning.*Interestingly, Laurence Olivier had played a Nazi in "Marathon Man" two years earlier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, thought provoking thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boys From Brazil was made in 1978, but it deals with human cloning. At the time, short sighted people dismissed it as ludicrous, but in light of recent cloning experiments the films has a topicality about it and probably seems marginally more plausible nowadays than it did when it was released.So who are the boys from Brazil? They are young boys all bred from genetic skin grafts taken from the body of Adolf Hitler during the war years. In Paraguay, in the '70s, one of Hitler's most feared accomplices, Josef Menegele (Peck), has been toiling away in a jungle laboratory trying to breed young Hitler clones. A young reporter (Guttenberg) hits upon the plot, and is killed, but not before passing a message onto famed Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman (Olivier). As Lieberman investigates, he realises that something is going on and tracks down Mengele when he visits one of his creations in America.There are some surprisingly violent moments, such as the savage dog sequence near the end, and a shocking murder at a dam in Sweden. The performances range from excellent (Olivier, Palmer, Mason) to stiff and unconvincing (Peck). The film is pretty interesting and thought provoking. I still don't totally buy the idea that Hitler could be cloned so perfectly that he would turn out like a power-hungry, racist, evil Nazi (surely it would be impossible to recreate all the life experiences that turned hium into the type of man he was). However, it poses some disturbing thoughts and is worth seeing provided you don't try to pick out the plot holes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An intriguing thriller about human cloning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Boys from Brazil" (1978 - 123 minutes) is an intriguing and a present-day thriller about human cloning directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, based on the Ira Levin's book. Twenty years before the birth of the sheep Dolly, the actor Gregory Peck plays the doctor Josef Mengele, Nazi who lived refugee between Brazil and Paraguay carrying out genetic experiences. The story begins when 65 years old men started to die in various countries. A famous and obstinate Nazi hunter, Ezra Lieberman (the actor Laurence Olivier), is alerted to the fact by a young American investigator and starts an investigation that will decipher a mysterious conspiracy. 94 clones of Adolf Hitler had been created and sent to families who had the same characteristics of the Nazi dictator family: parents profession, father who dies at the age of 65 years old, only son. The film shows an insane Mengele in his house in the Amazon Forest where, with the help of other survivors of the Third Reich, he commands a tenebrous project that was initiated when clones of Hitler were made from preserved sanguine cells. A scene that deserves prominence is the one where the scientist Professor Bruckner (the actor Bruno Ganz) shows how is the laboratory development of all the cloning process. The Professor stands out that "it is not enough the cloning of an individual to turn him into a Mozart or a Picasso, the environmental background also must be reproduced". The unquestionable and irremediable advance of the biological sciences, particularly the genetic engineering, turns out perfectly viable today what was before considered mere science fiction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[ * possible spoilers * ]I had seen bits &amp; pieces of this high camp classic over the years but finally had a chance to see it from beginning to end on American Movie Classics, and I am dumbstruck. It's a real challenge to describe how truly ridiculous the thing is.Perhaps the best place to start is with the two leads. I somehow can envision Olivier and Peck getting together after having seen the script, and then, before the start of shooting, making a wager as to who can come up with the worst accent. It's a tossup; Peck's attempt at a German accent was not outdone in hilarity for almost twenty years, when Brad Pitt in "Seven Years in Tibet" seemed to use it a model and outdid himself. Olivier's Jewish accent puts one in mind of a tipsy Harold MacMillan doing an impersonation of David Ben-Gurion (you Gen-Xers will just have to look those names up in Wikipedia).As far as their acting itself, words fail. Peck's Mengele is so cartoonish - as are all the Nazis here - as to seem to belong in "Hogan's Heroes". Portrayals so stereotyped drain away all terror and move things to the level of comedy. Olivier's Lieberman does not help matters; what is supposed to be a portrait of a dedicated Nazi hunter is so shot through with fleeting attempts at Borsch-belt humor as to come off as a poor impersonation of Myron Cohen (..back to Wikipedia, kids). The high - or low - point, and the scene which almost makes one believe that humor was the real goal, is the famous party scene, with the ballroom draped in swastikas. Mengele, interrupting Mundt's "second honeymoon" dance with his stunningly ugly hag wife, throttling him to the ground on top of the hors d'oeuvres, and Frau Mundt's asking for a doctor only to have Mengele growl 'I AM a doctor, you stupid bitch', puts one in mind of some of the more classic moments from the Three Stooges. Could Mel Brooks have had a hand in this production? Talk about shades of "Springtime for Hitler" ("Maytime for Mengele" ???) !It is true that what was in 1978 a ridiculously far-fetched plot device, human cloning, has become with the passage of time a frightening possibility. None the less, the idea of a hundred teenaged Xeroxes of Der Fuehrer set to "go off" around the Globe is still a concept that seems to have come out of an episode of "Get Smart", as does the whacky script. How so many big names - Peck &amp; Olivier, James Mason, Denholm Elliot, Uta Hagen, and Lilli Palmer - allowed themselves to be bamboozled into the making of this stinker must remain a mystery. Maybe they were paid VERY well. It must be noted that the elegant Lilli Palmer retains her classic beauty even despite the passing of time (she died 8 years after this flick; thank goodness she was able to to redeem herself by making a few more movies).Having said all these nasty things, it must be conceded that the production values here are extremely high; the movie looks great. Everything is beautifully shot, setting off the on-location scenes wonderfully. But to have all this technical skill employed in the service of such silliness is like the mountain laboring and bringing forth a mouse, as they say. The movie is worth watching, I suppose, but only if viewed as camp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Franklin J. Schaffner's The Boys from Brazil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many spoilers ahead in this review of a chilling film thatis given more credence today than ever before. Laurence Olivier isLieberman, a broke Nazi hunter being bothered by phone callsfrom a very young Steve Guttenberg. It seems Guttenberg hasdiscovered a gathering of Nazis in Paraguay, including the elusiveDr. Josef Mengele, played by an unrecognizable Gregory Peck.Before Guttenberg can give Lieberman details, he is killed.Lieberman learns Mengele has ordered the world wide slayings ofover ninety civil servants who have turned sixty-five years old. Thekillings begin, and Lieberman soon discovers a link between allthe men- they all adopted a little boy, who has piercing blue eyes,pale skin, and dark black hair. Lieberman sees a couple of theseboys and assumes they are a multiple birth divided betweeninternational parents. He could not be more wrong. We find out theboys are all clones of Adolf Hitler, and Mengele is trying to bringabout another reich. He figures he has taken care of the"environmental" concerns of the boys' upbringing by killing thefathers at age 65, just as Hitler's father died at age 65. The bloodyclimax mixes a clone, Lieberman, Mengele, and a room full ofDobermans.Franklin Schaffner directed from Ira Levin's novel, which seemedso far fetched just a few years ago. There is a chilling scene whereMengele talks of Hitler living into the 1980's, the 1990's, and theyear 2000, a year that seemed so far off in 1978, when this wasreleased. Schaffner uses a lot of silent scenes to convey the plot,like when Mengele stands in a broken down building andremembers this was where the women were impregnated with theclones. Another chilling scene involves the "experiments" thatMengele has been working on. These scarred, abused peoplenow roam around his South American estate, and they are alwaysin frame for scenes taking place there. There are light moments,as well, that do not seem forced, but completely natural.Lieberman's run in with his landlord is perfectly choreographed.Olivier was one of the great actors of all time, and proves why here.He is Lieberman, he does not simply play him. Peck is equallygood as Mengele, his scene at the farmhouse where he tries topin a murder on Lieberman is brilliant. The cast has manyrecognizable names in supporting roles, all of them superb:James Mason, Lilli Palmer, Uta Hagen, Denholm Elliott,Rosemary Harris, John Dehner, John Rubinstein, Anne Meara,Bruno Ganz, Walter Gotell, Michael Gough, and Steve Guttenberg,who is quite good in a type of role he should have stuck withbefore becoming the washout poster boy he is today (anyone for a"Police Academy" film? I didn't think so).I had one quibble about a plot point, but I think the film makersexplained it for me. Mengele flies from Paraguay to New England,and I thought, gosh, wouldn't anyone recognize him and arresthim? Schaffner shows us that Lieberman's battle is all uphill, andhe is discouraged by those who would rather forget about theatrocities of WWII instead of tracking down old men. It is totallybelievable that these war criminals can travel around, who cares? Ithink we can apply this lesson today, as we try to get our lives backto normal, we should not be so normal as to lapse intocomplacency and forgetfulness about the thousands are no longerwith us.What seemed impossible over twenty years ago rears its uglyhead today, and makes "The Boys from Brazil" not only anincredible film, but an important argument about cloning humans.If Hollywood can find this story and scare us with it, we should takenote. I highly recommend this one.This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gun violence,gore, some profanity, very brief female nudity, and adult situations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In The Boys From Brazil, Gregory Peck gives a truly mesmerizing performance as the infamous Nazi scientist Josef Mengele. He is wicked and cruel and yet sympathetic and charismatic. I sometimes use the scene select option on the DVD just to rewatch some of his scenes. While Olivier is a great actor I just think he is totally overshadowed by Peck in this role. Olivier's character is allegedly based on the ruthless Nazi hunter Simon Wisenthal. But the way Olivier was asked to portray Lieberman, it makes him look bumbling and weak. Maybe the filmmakers are just sticking to the source material, Ira Levin's book, which I admittedly haven't read. Mention should also be made of James Mason who plays the Nazi colonel who at first supports Mengele but then abandons him after Neo-Nazi command pulls the plug on the good doctor's project. In summary, this film is a pure treat for Gregory Peck fans, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A very well done (if quite implausible) fictional account about a post World War II Nazi plot based in Paraguay and led by Josef Mengele that could lead to the establishment of the Fourth Reich.Gregory Peck was well cast as the evil Mengele. Having seen him primarily in "good guy" roles, I was impressed by how well he pulled off this role as one of the more sinister characters of the 20th century. Laurence Olivier also put on a good performance as the Nazi hunter Lieberman.The basics of the story (I won't give it away) are implausible, but strike me as the sort of thing Nazi scientists might have wanted to do if the knowledge had been around in the 1940's. Some parts are predictable (I figured out who - or what - the "boys" were soon after they appeared) but I must confess that I wasn't able to figure out the reason behind the killing of the 65 year old civil servants who were married to younger women until it was revealed. And the ending of the movie was appropriately spine-chilling. What will this boy (indeed, these boys) grow up to be, anyway?Well done, indeed. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>94 Bouncing Baby Hitlers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Josef Mengele, one of the most wanted of Nazi war criminals has been a very busy man. What started as an experiment back in 1943 when Adolph Hitler let Mengele take some blood and skin samples is about to come to fruition.Gregory Peck whose screen image runs more along the line of Atticus Finch is a truly frightening and malevolent Mengele. Hidden away in his Brazilian jungle hideout, Peck has made remarkable progress in cloning, something we are only grappling with now.Without the serious moral questions that would trouble most people, Peck successfully cloned 94 bouncing baby Hitlers and has deposited them among selected families of proper Aryan background. Of course part of the experiment is that the fathers have to die when the children are 14 as Hitler's father did. Steven Guttenberg who gets himself killed doing a little amateur Nazi hunting, before he dies manages to tell what he knows to a man who makes it his life vocation bringing Third Reich criminals to justice. That would be Laurence Olivier as Ezra Lieberman(Simon Wiesenthal). It's a race against time before the evil scheme is either carried out or thwarted.The Boys from Brazil is a great suspense thriller which asks some very sticky moral questions. Laurence Olivier got his last Academy Award nomination for his role, yet another dusting off of his patented mittel Europa accent. Yet I really do believe it is Peck's film. He shows what he can do as a villain and successfully breaks all bonds of his stereotyping.If you could kill a baby or an adolescent Hitler, would you?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I vaguely remember reading the book a while ago, but I have never seen the movie until now.The concept, of course, is excellent. What would happen if Hitler was cloned? Take it a step further and incorporate a heinous Nazi scheme to reproduce the psychological conditions that created Hitler, and you have an even better plot. But what may make for a good read (book doesn't seem to have made much of an impression on me though), doesn't really make for a good movie. Instead we get a rather weak thriller where the audience figures out the plot pretty quickly on, those with some familiarity with Hitler even faster than others. And once you figure out the plot, waiting for the protagonist to realize it becomes more of a frustrating chore of "come on, NOW do you get it?" And of course once the plan becomes known, we realize that it never will be stopped. (I must admit I never had any notions that Lieberman would kill the proto-Hitlers, so maybe that killed some of the suspense for me.)Had Mengele's plan included the focus on just one boy, with the organization taking a more detailed interest in psychologically nudging the young man, perhaps Mengele feeding him quiet whispers to stir his hate, it might have been more compelling. Seeing them trying to replicate the exact details of Hitler's life over the years would make a cool movie. Engineer his series of failures and rejections, foster his hatred of Jews, that would be a scary film. There seems to be too much focus that just the death of the father would drive the child to become like Hitler. Hitler was far more a product of his times, than a product of the death of his father. Placing these children in prosperous families of western nations is hardly the circumstances that would replicate post WW I Germany.To me the best part of the movie were the few minutes at the end. The scene in the hospital bed was probably the only thought provoking part of the film, asking the question, which Spielberg touched on in Munich, does the end justify the means? The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Thankfully the character of Lieberman was wise enough to see down that road and closed that path right away. The death of Mengele was another good scene, although also kind of a miss. Having Mengele whine as he died, showed him to be a less calculating and chilling villain that originally imagined. A sharp mind would have figured out what sort of impact the psychological trauma of having a child order an intruder mauled to death by his dogs would cause, and relish his death would help create the next Fuhrer rather than die in screams. Perhaps this was done for the sake of the audience to get some kind of positive resolution that the villain who caused so much pain got his comeuppance, but it would have been far more chilling to see that even in death Mengele was trying to accomplish his goal. Perhaps I'm seeing too much of The Emperor in this, daring Luke to strike him down, knowing the consequences.Great concept, but the movie was weak in and of itself, and the idea could have been developed in a far more chilling fashion. With the current crop of "lets understand the evil" films on Hitler you'd wonder how this film would be made today, probably focus more on psychology and less on a thriller plot.OK film to watch, but more enjoyable for the personal thoughts on "what if?" that it spawns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Nazi Conspiracy Films I have seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********** SPOILER ALERT************ I guess this movie would be heaps better if you don't actually know that it is about a Nazi plot to resurrect Hitler through the use of clones. If this is what you know about this film then you are likely to write it off as just another piece of Hollywood rubbish. However the film is far from that, and that fact that it has Lawrence Olivier and Gregory Peck as the lead actors should suggest that it is actually a lot more than that. Needless to say, both of those actors play their roles brilliantly, and when somebody suggested that if a lesser mortal than Gregory Peck were playing the villain then no doubt this movie would have fallen in a heap.There are a few problems though, however the idea of cloning that is explored in this movie suggests that the original writer really knew his stuff. Basically what Megnele (Peck) is attempting to do is to create the same conditions of life that gave birth to Hitler, and this after producing a huge batch of cloned Hitler babies he places them in families around the world that matched the age of Hitler's parents. However, at a specific moment, Hitler's father died, so Mengele sends out a team of Nazi assassins to kill the adopted fathers of these children at the right time in hope to turn one of them into Adolf Hitler.There is a problem though, and that is that while he may be able to control the family upbringing, he is not able to control the geopolitical events that led to the rise of Hitler. For instance, Hitler went into World War 1 as a corporal, was shot and wounded, and spent the rest of the war in hospital. Germany then went on to lose the war, suffered economic collapse, and revolution as a result, and was then humiliated by the victors. Even after that, the entire world economy collapsed at which point Hitler was able to rise to power.Despite those factors, the film itself is still very, very well made, but then again, if you are reading this, then you have probably already seen the film, because I suggested that if you haven't seen this then you shouldn't read this commentary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The less you know about The Boys From Brazil the better, A quite well known story based upon a Ira Levin novel. Is a good thriller, which allows two of the greatest actors there has ever been a chance to ham it up a bit.The plot involves Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman (Laurence Olivier) trying to unravel a devious plot by Dr Josef Mangele (Gregory Peck). Directed by Franklin J Schaffner of Planter of the Apes fame. Provides us with a nice slow burning build up in setting the story, and keeping me enthralled with it really quite ludicrous but entertaining story line. It has a great score adding dread to certain moments and heightening the tension. The film at times almost slips in to horror with it's certain plot elements, and also containing a horrific confrontation between the two leads at the end.It is not perfect by any means though, as some accents are all over the place and can become a little distracting, and some may find the films idea to unbelievable to take seriously, which i can't say i had a problem with.A good film, with two acting powerhouses, worth a watch just for them. But a smart thriller i highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing thriller uncovering a diabolical Nazi conspiracy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite a few reviewers seem to have disparaging comments about this movie. It may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but I personally found the plot quite gripping The idea if not totally plausible at least makes a compelling film.The story, set in the 1970's, begins with a young Nazi hunter, Barry Kohler, who is tracking down a group of SS officers meeting in Paraguay. The aging veteran Nazi hunter, Ezra Lieberman (Kohler's hero), is first uninterested in his findings, but when Kohler turns up murdered, Lieberman uncovers a plot masterminded by the evil Nazi scientist, Dr. Mengele. These modern Nazis are attempting to set up a Fourth Reich by cloning their hero &amp; Fueher, Adolf Hitler.The actors make this movie, which might come off as a ridiculous tale with a less inspired cast. Lawrence Olivier is masterful as always in the role of the aging German Jew, Lieberman, whose character seems loosely based on Simon Weisenthal. However, Gregory Peck gives an absolutely chilling performance in an uncharacteristically villainous role for him, that of the notorious Holocaust 'doctor', Josef Mengele. Of course this story is purely fictional, with no resemblance whatsoever to Mengele's post war life. He was still alive in South America when this film was made and died a year or so later, unfortunately never brought to justice for his monstrous crimes.Of course the tale takes on something of a different dimension in this era, when we actually have cloning of animals. The modern Nazis in this film take care not just to duplicate Hitler's DNA, but also endeavour to provide these cloned boys with a similar childhood environment to young Hitler's as well. The civil servant father would be murdered at a suitable time in order to elicit rage and hatred in the young clones. However, I agree with comments that Hitler's rise to power had more to do with conditions in Germany following its World War I defeat than to Hitler's disturbed master race, anti Semitic ideologies, whether genetic or environmentally induced. In other words, the impact of Adolf Hitler on Germany cannot be duplicated by cloning him and replicating his childhood environment.Personally, I found the character similarities between all the young clones unbelievable, even given the identical genes &amp; similar family environments. At least four of these boys are portrayed as arrogant, rude, and nasty and the last one, Bobby, positively cruel &amp; heartless. However, the tear flowing down young Bobby's cheeks when he learns of his father's death is touching and reminds the viewer of his humanity. The Dobermans certainly make for a dramatic finale. However, I think a more effective closing scene might have been for Bobby to be shown perhaps mourning at his father's grave or interacting normally with his mother, not developing his sadistic photos. Also, at least one of the other clones might have been shown with some shred of decency. The villainy of every single one of these boys actually made the tale less credible for me. However, the entire premise of the film is intriguing (though disturbing) and makes for a suspenseful movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just turn off your brain and enjoy!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was certainly NOT the best thing made in the 70s, nor was it among Gregory Peck's finest moments, to say the least!! This was a very silly film that despite everything still managed to be very entertaining in a "turn off you brain and just enjoy it" way. The plot is dumb, I'll admit, but there's just something about this movie that is intriguing.Peck plays Dr. Mengele and he's been a busy maniac all these years since the war. He apparently has cloned Hitler and placed all these potentially evil babies in foster families around the world. The plan is to have the babies' childhoods be as similar to the originals as possible, so when the boys reach a certain age, Mengele kills their fathers so that the boys lose their father at the same age Hitler did. Much of the film consists of watching Peck do this evil deed to various families.Somewhere along the way, Laurence Olivier finds out about the Mengele plan from a young reporter. Olivier plays a Nazi hunter and at first he thinks the story is crap. But, once he realizes the plan is true, he springs to action.In the end, Peck is visiting one of the little Hitlers when Olivier arrives for a final showdown. The way this is resolved--in particular, the way Adolf, Jr. reacts is priceless and the movie concludes.I think that aside from the kooky plot, one of the big reasons I like the film because it looks like Peck and Olivier are having a contest to see which one is the greatest ham in film history! Peck wins it by a nose for his totally ridiculous German madman imitation--I just loved the silly makeup!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an interesting film. Gregory Peck is thrilling in his portrayal as Dr. Josef Mengele, Hitler's Death Camp architect and mastermind to develop the superior Aryan Race! Peck obviously relishes his role as Mengele. James Mason, classy as always, is Mengele's military henchman who supports the network of Nazis that invade Paraguay after WWII. Laurence Olivier is brilliant as the "Simon Wiesenthal" character, (Lieberman), a Nazi Hunter who makes a living chasing Nazis all over the world.This film discusses the scientific art of cloning as the plot thickens. The Nazis (Mengele)are trying to recreate a new Adolf Hitler from the DNA preserved by Mengele in the blood and bones of Hitler. Interesting plot if you "suspend your disbelief." A great climax where 4 Doberman dogs tear Mengele's throat out after he goes rampaging about killing people off like flies in order to recreate his dream of a 4th Reich, with Hitler orchestrating the Wagnerian strains to a future of Death Camps set up to exterminate the inferior races of the world. An extension here in this film to what was going on in Nazi Germany and Nazi-occupied lands in Europe during WWII.Worth seeing, but only if you like seeing Gregory Peck titillated by playing such a sadistic monster! Fun to watch! Note that Lilli Palmer has a significant role as Herr Liebermann's sister. Denholm Elliott also stars. And loads of Nazis in Paraguay, (filmed, however, in Portugal).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and suspenseful thriller about terrible experiments carried out by Joseph Menguele</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Ira Levin (Rosemary's baby)'s readable novel , this is an exciting thriller about The Doctor "Joseph Méngüele", (Gregory Peck), known member of the Nazi party German, and cruel medic of the concentration camp of Auschwitz . He escaped and pursued by the Mossad took refuge in Paraguay and Brazil after the fall of the Third Reich. There in South America get together a group of young people, militants of the Third Reich, to work in a strange issue in which he can proceed their repugnant experiments. Menguele attempts to reconstitute the Nazi movement from his Brazilian sanctuary cloning of boys' genes . A young American, "Barry Kohler" (Steven Guttemberg), contact with the Nazi hunter "Ezra Liebermann" ,( a Simon Wiesental-alike ,magnificently played by Laurence Olivier) , helped by his sister (Lilli Palmer), who begin to investigate and discover the horrible plan of "Méngüele . The storyline based on genetic engineering resulted to be revolutionary for its day , so it was a mythical picture in its time, and had too much impact , his importance lies mostly in its scientist approach . At that time cloning was on initial developing and Ira Levin was the first author who wrote about this sensational and dangerous scientific discovery , almost science-fiction with moral dilemma included. The screenplay by Heywood Gould takes many licenses and is less developed than the successful novel of Ira Levin, but gets certain tension and amusement . ¨The Boys From Brazil" is a suspense movie that amuses and entertains , has good taste and in general lines is above average . Story is not boring , neither tiring but is entertaining at any time, though it is true that turns into a picture that tends to underline its latent absurdities and entangled in his ending . In the picture appears some of the best actors of all time, the three principals as Laurence Olivier, James Mason and an awesome Gregory Peck who however overacting in some scenes . Good supporting cast full of fine players usual in Nazis roles as Walter Gotell , Joachin Hansen ,Wofgang Preiss, Gunter Meisner and Uta Hagen as brutal concentration camp chief. Plus prestigious veteran actors as John Dehner , Michael Gough , Bruno Ganz and Denholm Elliott , among others. Special mention to unpleasant ,repulsive boy , well interpreted by Jeremy Black. The soundtrack by the classic musician Jerry Goldsmith, is the most part of time lively and nicely like is heard at the beginning and the end of the movie , nevertheless in some moments he composes strangely, perhaps attempting to remind Puccini and other musicians so admired by Mengele, but conveys us a mirth that it is not fitting to the plot. Furthermore , it packs magnificent and colorful visuals by French cameraman Henry Decae .Franklin J. Schaffner directed excellent motion pictures as "The Planet of the Apes", "Patton," "Papillon", "Nicholas and Alexandra", after the flop of his film titled " Islands in the Stream ", in which went on to coincide with the actor of "Patton," George C. Scott, decided to embark on a project more commercial and successful as "The Boys From Brazil" . Rating : Better than average , worthwhile watching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Occult, Bronze-Age Comic Book of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oddly what stood out to me the most watching The Boys From Brazil, an extremely well cast thriller, was its tiring overload of mostly unnecessary orchestral score. And don't get me wrong; I wish Jerry Goldsmith were still alive composing scores like those for Alien, L.A. Confidential and Seconds. I think it's Franklin J. Schaffner, the director, who should've known where the absence of music increases the drama, instead of always going for the more-is-more approach. But it's a small (though indignant and annoyed) gripe, having little to do with the movie's substance. Let's talk about that then: What makes The Boys From Brazil scream implausibility is the same feature that makes it so engaging, and that is how it isn't a war thriller, a spy thriller or a political thriller, or any certain kind of thriller, instead taking a slice from each kind of thriller. It's about a war, but it takes place over thirty years after that war. Its characters engage in conspiracies and espionage, but none are actual government spies. It is also technically a sci-fi film. The thing is, explaining how would diffuse the freshness of the plot's surprises, but the point is it's a narrative that, whatever else you can say about it, is not the least bit boring.Indeed the plot brushes comic book superhero proportions, but the diabolical master plan conceived by Gregory Peck's grimacing, straight-backed Nazi death camp doctor Mengele is a refreshment of that sort: In stories of bombastic color and adventure, especially those of godlike stock characters and dictatorial genius antagonists, there are often caveats that make them silly or forgettable rather than engrossing in their suspension of disbelief. Take the Superman saga's evil mastermind, for instance. Lex Luthor plans to make a fortune in real estate by cheaply buying large amounts of desert land and then diverting one of two nuclear rockets from a missile testing site to California's tectonic boundary, causing earthquake and radioactivity to wipe out most of California and leave Luthor's desert as the new West Coast. Yeah, I'm sure everyone's gonna clamor to be neighbors with the radioactive site of a 500-megaton nuclear strike and the biggest earthquake disaster in world history. I feel as though Luthor is part of a long assembly line of completely moronic, half-baked supervillains that are only brilliant masterminds because we're told they are. Dr. Josef Mengele is the supervillain I've always wanted to see our favorite caped crusaders fight.Alas, the movie doesn't go that far out, but it does one better. On Mengele's trail is an old Nazi Hunter played by Laurence Olivier as a man who's almost all wit and seemingly no muscle. The way he walks, squints, appears, I feel like buying him a cane. This is good; it builds tension. He keeps getting pesky calls from well-intentioned young Steve Guttenberg claiming a secret sect of Third Reich war criminals are holding clandestine meetings in Paraguay. Olivier is doubtful, but Guttenberg is dispatched and Olivier traces the White Supremacists through Europe and North America, finding a thread of fishy deaths of several public officials. He interviews their widows, and is stricken by an extraordinary similarity in their adopted, black-haired, blue-eyed sons. I'll stop there.The situations led to and the performances of Peck, Olivier, Uta Hagen as one of the widowed mothers and Mason as Peck's coldly sensible right hand are intriguing, because they are not what one would expect from a big-budget, star-studded sci-fi thriller by the director Papillon and Planet of the Apes. A shocking, strange climax is reached in a farmhouse in rural Pennsylvania. There is the jingoistic and repetitive bearing and social graces of the mad Dr. Mengele character. And there is the grave, chilling moral question of what to do with the "boys from Brazil." I've stumbled upon some information on the real Josef Mengele, of whom I wasn't aware before. To read of his concentration camp exploits is to confront some of the very most excruciating and hair-raising images the Holocaust produced. There are two things that can be done with that material, and The Boys From Brazil is one of them. Yes, it turns one of the most depraved monsters about whom I've ever read into an entertaining comic-book mad scientist. But not only does Peck chew the scenery just the right amount, but he also creates a behavior that could well infer a work history of taking children's eyeballs and attaching them to the back of other children's heads, changing eye color by injecting chemicals into children's eyes, various limb amputations and other nightmarish doings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!I love this movie. I saw it first on tv at a time when big moviepremiers were just that. I loved it then and I love it now. Why?Well, we all know the plot. It is in the fact that everyone both in frontof and behind the camera seems to have put an awful lot of effortinto getting the riveting story told in as epic a scale as possiblethat makes the film such a good movie.The cast is sensational. Gregory Peck, cast against type as the evilDr Mengele walks through the proceedings with a true air ofsuperiority over everyone else. His calm and efficient ruthlessnessfills the screen. It is possibly his most powerful role, especiallywhen - to me - he seems completely bland in everything else Ihave seen him in (and believe me, there is a lot!). Against him, wehave Olivier playing his nemesis. He gladly hams up many scenes but here lies his strength: when it comes down to the fightbetween good and evil (not just in the climax to the movie but alsoin his visit to the state prison to see an ex-worker of Mengele's)that he becomes so deadly serious in his intent that we forget heis an actor - he becomes the character. And what about JamesMason? Phew...that silken voice just oozes menace. it's such ashame that he only makes a fleeting appearance in the proceedings. Yet, he steals every scene.On the technical side, everything is top notch. Henri Decae'sbeathtaking photography of the Brazilian jungle and the Austrianalps ensure that we get the feeling that this is a globe-trottingadventure. Jerry Goldsmith's score is possibly amongst his bestand he perfectly captures the feelings of not just the seriousnessof the movie but also the fact that this is a big budget production -as such the score is fabulous. And the direction? Well, Franklin JSchaffner succinctly puts plot points across with the least amountof fuss, whilst eliciting good performances from his cast andcreating a real sense of 'epic' about the preceedings. That hiscareer seemed to falter after this is a shame (especially since hewon an Oscar for 'Patton' in 1970). Perhaps he will remain one ofthe many anonymous directors of film that have provided excellententertainment for us to enjoy. Perhaps he will be rediscovered oneday - I am certain this movie will ensure this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't thunk much of this movie and much of the blame should be centered on Ira Levin's source novel . Someone rightly points out that personality is possibly more to do with environment that genetics , so how come nobody realises that Nazi Germany wasn't all down to Hitler ? I'm thinking of millions of Germans who fought and lost a world war from 1914 to 1918 and tens of millions of Germans being affected by the terms of the Versaille treaty . Hitler himself fought in the war and was lying in hospital when the war ended and all these factors had far more importance in the creation of Nazi Germany than Hitler's father being a civil servant . In other words Levin's plot is totally ludicrous to say the least .Apart from the silly plot the main problem with the film version of BOYS FROM BRAZIL is the acting and it's quite ironic that with a story centered around Jews that there's so much ham on display . Really the acting is really awful , so bad that you can't help laughing at the performances . Laurence Olivier gives possibly the worst performance of his career while Gregory Peck seems to be giving an impersonation of Basil Fawlty , oh gawd even James Mason is bad and that's not something I can say lightly Yeah this is an entertaining movie but if you're making a thriller it's vital that you thrill the audience and not have them rolling in the aisles with something that feels like it's a sequel to THE PRODUCERS . How amusing is it Theo ? It's so amusing that I burst out laughing when someone made the very predictable cry of " Help get a doctor " - " I am a doctor you idiot "</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Much like The Omen, Don't Look Now, The Exorcist, Halloween and The Wicker Man, Franklin J. Schaffner's The Boys From Brazil is one of the best thrillers from the 1970s. Yet it has never enjoyed the same critical kudos and audience awareness that the films mentioned above enjoy. I have never understood why, because in my opinion, this is one of the best films of it's era. I remember catching this film on TV late one night as a teenager, and I've never forgotten it. Re watching it, it's just as unsettling, tense and nerve-wrenching as when I was young, perhaps even more so, because now as an adult, having read about the real life Dr. Josef Mengele, the film has more resonance to me now. Franklin J. Schaffner really was a chameleon filmmaker, I was surprised to find that the same director of this film made Planet of the Apes and Patton. However on closer inspection, his earlier films do have a reoccurring style. Back in the 70s the possibility of cloning Hitler seemed implausible, but now the film is even more chilling because we are now capable of creating such monsters. Laurence Olivier is brilliant as the aging Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman, and Gregory Peck gives a chilling performance as Dr. Josef Mengele. The music is haunting, and the bleak cinematography adds to the overall feeling of dread and inevitability. The ending feels a bit rushed, but that's a minor complaint. Few films have stuck in my mind quite like Boys From Brazil. It is a must watch for genre fans and film buffs in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like its sister film MARATHON MAN, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL is a sinister and realistic thriller that looks at the question of surviving Nazis hiding out in South America. Did they survive and did some of them continue their sinister human experiments that were started in the concentration camps? While I think MARATHON MAN has the edge in terms of being an enjoyable, all-time classic, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL is still a very good, taut thriller that just happens to have an excellent ensemble cast to boot.Two old-time heavyweights are pitted against each other here: a virtually unrecognisable Gregory Peck as sinister Nazi scientist Dr Josef Mengele, and Laurence Olivier as the doddery old Jew hot on his tail. The two men don't meet until their climatic showdown, but what a treat it is when they do! Throughout the film, both actors remind us why they were considered worldwide stars. Peck is utterly repulsive as the ruthless Nazi, but Olivier steals the film as the sympathetic Nazi hunter in a reversal of the role he played in MARATHON MAN.The film is slow paced, but remains engaging throughout, and the suspense never ceases. There's globetrotting action, assassins and a scary storyline including cloning as well as Jeremy Black playing an extremely creepy child. This is an unashamedly old-fashioned film that doesn't rely on fight scenes or car chases to tell the story, and here intelligent scripting and fine cinematography win out over the usual humdrum staples. The supporting cast is remarkable: James Mason as a Nazi, Denholm Elliott as a shifty bureaucrat, Steve Guttenberg surprisingly good in one of his earliest roles as a tragic investigator, along with the likes of Walter Gotell, Michael Gough, Wolfgang Preiss and even a couple of British actresses in brief roles: Prunella Scales and Linda Hayden.The last twenty minutes or so are absolutely riveting as the story comes to a head, and it finishes in an extremely satisfying way too. As chilling a film as any horror, THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL is a fine example of the thriller genre at its best.</fullReview>

He plays a determined Nazi hunter that no one takes seriously anymore who goes after a gang of Nazis who have just launched an outlandish plan to reconquer the world. I'm not going to spoil the plot of the movie, even though it's almost impossible to approach this movie without knowing "the big surprise", but for those of you who have never seen Boys from Brazil, do yourself a favor and try and watch the movie without prior knowledge and see how long it takes you to figure out the mystery.A great double feature with this movie is The Marathon Man, in which Olivier plays a Nazi war criminal. It's almost unfortunate the two movies were not made as one, so we could see Olivier hunt himself, but one doesn't get everything one wants in life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having just gotten through Claude Lanzmann's nine-hour Holocaust documentary 'Shoah (1985),' I felt I needed a change of scenery. So I picked another movie about Nazis: 'The Boys from Brazil (1978).' This ridiculous 1970s sci-fi thriller from Franklin J. Schaffner (who also gave us 'Planet of the Apes (1968)') features the distinguished cast of Gregory Peck, Laurence Olivier, James Mason, and... uh, Steve Guttenberg. Peck portrays the infamous SS officer Josef Mengele, who fled to South America after WWII, and here continues his grisly human experimentation with the Fourth Reich in his sights. Olivier plays an elderly Nazi-hunter who receives information from Steve Guttenberg about the Nazis' latest sinister plot to assassinate 94 seemingly-innocent, seemingly-random civil servants across the world.'The Boys from Brazil' is probably one of the earliest films to deal seriously with the concept of human cloning (and, indeed, it would be two more decades until Dolly the sheep proved that mammals could, indeed, be cloned from somatic cells using the nucleus transfer process). But, good science aside, this film isn't particularly smart. It spends most of its running time leading up to a revelation that I already knew, and the Nazi plot never felt as menacing as it should have. However, the veteran actors manage to retain their credibility. Gregory Peck, one of Hollywood's most distinguished and respected actors, surprises everybody with his booming rendition of the line "Shut up, you ugly bitch!" There's also a death-by-doberman scene that was more graphic than I had been expecting.</fullReview>

In typical Hollywood (or television) style, what would happen is that somebody would put a drop of Hitler's blood, or a lock of his hair, or whatever, into the cloning machine, which would then flash a lot of lights and make noises: whooooo, whoooo, Whooo, WOOT! And Adolf Hitler, full grown, would step out of the machine, complete with mustache, German accent, and all of his memories and twisted personality. He would immediately start to give a speech about conquering ze vorld (but would probably speak English). An episode of Wonder Woman did it exactly that way.Of course, what would really happen if somebody cloned Hitler is that somebody would find himself having to care for a baby, a baby boy who, as he grew up, would have none of Hitler's experiences. A boy who would probably grow up to be an ordinary guy.The Boys From Brazil recognizes this, and shows Josef Mengele (Gregory Peck cast utterly against type) trying very hard to duplicate Der Führer's upbringing. No whoo whoo WOOT here. Altogether the best cloning movie I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A battle of the greats.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a gripping, highly amusing and entertaining film starring the two greatest actors of all time, Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck. They both ham it up significantly but to necessary effect, their larger than life performances makes the concept of the film believable (Hitler clones). Unfortunately the boy actor in the film seems to be dubbed in every accent, I do wish they wouldn't do that. It is an episodic film with some good old stalwart British actors supporting. The climax of the film where Olivier's Nazi hunter gets to grips (literally) with Peck's evil Mengele is the greatest cinematic, geriatric scrap of the twentieth century. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great old fashioned thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No less a person then Stephen King said that Ira Levin is the Swiss watchmaker of suspense novels. The Boys From Brazil is truly his masterpeace. It is hard to believe that the man who wrote the delightful plays No Time For Sergeants and Deathtrap could write such a terrifying tale. It is chilling when you think about a madman cloning Adolf Hitler and Levin makes it seem entirely plausable and something out of your worst nightmare. People were really surprised when Gregory Peck was cast as Mengele. I think that this is the only time in his long and distinguised career that he ever played a bad guy and he is absolutely chilling as the Angel of Death. Laurence Olvier, perhaps the greatest actor of all time, is also brilliant as the Nazi hunter based on Simon Wiesenthal. These two old pros make movie magic. The final confrontation between Lieberman and Mengele at the farmhouse is unforgettable. Not to be a spoiler but I cheered when those Dobermans gave Mengele his just desserts. The thing that really makes me angry is that the real life Josef Mengele, a man who murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent people in the most horrible way imaginable, was never brought to justice and died a free man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid, But Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ira Levin's novels were known for containing outlandish plots that, against all odds, appeared plausible due to the understated way with which they were portrayed. What they were not known for was an intelligent prose style. As such, they were perfect fodder for film adaptations. After 'The Stepford Wives', 'Rosemary's Baby', and 'A Kiss Before Dying' were successfully brought to the screen, 'The Boys From Brazil' was the next viable candidate for the film treatment. And for good reason. It's plot - which I refuse to impart - is so absurd that even William S. Burroughs would do a double take. All the film needed to excel was a fresh-faced auteur with a knack for subtlety and nuance to capture the quiet menace of Levin's novels. Instead, it got Franklin J. Schaffner. Now we have Laurence Olivier as a Jewish grandpa, Gregory Peck as a Nazi (Dr. Josef Mengele, to be precise), and Steve Guttenberg as a Zionist. And that's only the first fifteen minutes...However, whilst Schaffner abandons any attempt at capturing the quiet menace of the book, he does deliver the sort of well-structured, competently made thriller that an old-school director of his ilk is so adept at making. You're intrigued to follow Olivier's Yiddish caricature around the world as he pieces together the perverse conspiracy, encountering bizarre, scene-stealing characters along the way played by the likes of Rosemary Harris, Uta Hagen (making a rare film appearance), and Bruno Ganz. And you're intrigued to watch a group of Nazis viciously and spectacularly murder a bunch of old guys for no apparent reason, especially when Peck is hamming it up as their leader.It's a seventies thriller through and through, replete with killer Dobermans and a gloriously Germanic score by Jerry Goldsmith that could legitimately rival the best of Wagner and the Strauss dynasty. You either like that sort of thing or you don't. But for my money, it's cheesy, it's stupid, and it is VERY memorable.</fullReview>

It is sad seeing fine old actors doing "anything" to earn a buck. It is also hard to laugh at Nazis-outside of Schultz and Hogan's Heroes or To Be or Not To Be. However,James Mason(realizing he was in a crock)gave a lovely characterization of an urbane sophisticate,determined to stop Mengle(who appeared to have escaped from Castle Frankenstein)embarrassing the new age nazi mob.He half-failed but gave the audience some grim chuckles.Right from the start the viewer understood Mr Mason,thought his colleague Mengle to be off his proverbial trolly.Likewise Olivier's doddery old Liebermann,hardly an avenging angel-more a geriatric with a profound fixation and a godawful accent!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** At the hight of WWII with the war going bad for the Third Reich Nazi big wig Dr. Joseph Mengala, Gregory Peck, convinced his Fuhrer Adolf Hitler that he can reproduce him as an exact copy through the process of cloning Something almost unheard of back then in 1943. With a sample of Hitler's blood and skin tissue Mengala plans to restart, with about a hundred little Hitlers, the now fledgling and about to be destroyed Third Reich. In hiding for some 30 years Dr. Mengela had put his idea of re-creating Adolf Hitler into practice. With the advancement of cloning research now in 1978 Mengela is about to make his first major step. After the birth of 94 baby Hitler's, whom he personally delivered, Mengela is about to bring his beloved Fuhrer back into the world spotlight with now planned murder of his 94 teenage Hitler's fathers. The movie "Boys from Brazil" goes deep into explaining the cloning process through of all people Bruno Ganz playing professor Bruckner. It was actor Bruno Ganz who some 25 years later played Adolf Hitler in the highly acclaimed film "Downfall" which many consider the best portrayal of the German leader ever. Did Prof. Buckner get caught up with his obsession of cloning by somehow morphing, instead of cloning, himself into Adolf Hitler?In 1978 the word gets back to Nazi hunter Ezra Liberman, Laurence Olivier, from a young Lieberman wannabe Barry Kohler, Steve Guttenber, about Dr. Mengela resurfacing in Paraguay. Mengela plans to have his Nazi hoods murder 94 elderly men within the next two and a half years. Kohler's bug that picked up Dr. Mengela speech was discovered in time by the Nazis before he told them the reason for this strange and off-the-wall plan. Being the eager beaver that he is Kholer runs back to his hotel room and gives Lieberman a call back in Vienna only to be cut off and murdered by Mengela's perusing Nazi thugs.The remainder of the film has Lieberman put the pieces together in just what is the reason for Dr. Mengela wanting 94 old men murdered all over Europe America and Canada? It's only when Lieberman sees the wife of a man, a civil service worker, who was killed unexpectedly in Massachusetts that things start falling into place. The murdered mans widow Mrs. Curry's, Ann Meara, young 14 year-old son Jack, Jeremy Black, is a dead ringer not only in looks but mannerisms to another young boy that Lieberman saw back in Germany who's father, also a civil servant and in his 60's, was killed in a car accident. Another piece of the puzzle falls into place when Mrs.Curry comes to Lieberman's hotel room scared that her son Jack would be taken away from her. It turned out that Jack was illegally adopted from this woman Frieda Maloney, Uta Hagen, who's now saving time in a German prison as a Nazi war criminal.Back in Paraguay Dr. Mengela's Nazi bosses begin to fear that his plan had been uncovered, by Ezra Lieberman, and want it stopped immediately. Mengela is just too caught up with bringing Hitler back, by creating the same environment that Hitler grew up in as a young boy, that he decides to do it, kill the remaining little Hitler's fathers, all by himself. A bit too much to take seriously "The Boys from Brazil" is more funny then anything else with Dr. Mengela leaving his private sanctuary in the jungles of Brazil and then flying and driving to Lancaster County Pa. to murder a Mr. Wheelock, John Dehner. Mr.Wheelock's son the sensitive and creative little Bobby, Jermey Black again, is slated to become the next, like the other 93, and future Adolf Hitler. There's a double reason for Mengela going to pay Wheelock a visit he's to see Lieberman about his possible murder. The imaginative Dr. Mengela want's to knock off two birds, Wheelock &amp; Lieberman, with one stone and this is his best chance to do it.Unbelievable ending with Dr. Mengela having it out with Lieberman at the Wheelock residence, after he murdered Mr. Wheelock. Little Bobby comes to Lieberman's rescue with his pack of vicious Doberman Pincher guard dogs that Mengela tricked Mr. Wheelock to lock up. Mengela trying to convince little Bobby that he's to become the greatest man in the history of the world, Adolph Hitler, is only treated with total disdain and ridicule by Bobby, oh man your weird Bobby tells him, as he calls the dogs on the crazed Mengela, after finding that he murdered his dad, who tear him apart.Lieberman who's life was actually save by Hitler later decides to burn the list of little Hitler's that he took from the dead Mengela's jacket pocket. Lieberman feeling that the mad doctors insane plans, to re-create nurture and bring back into power Adolf Hitler, were as ridicules and as dead as he is and so was the now harmless, without Memgela guidance, 94 14 year old Hitlers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where do they get these plot ideas from???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An...interesting film, it probably wouldn't be even half as good without impressive performances by (surprise!) Gregory Peck and Laurence Olivier. The plot takes too long to develop, though, and some scenes are too laughable for a film that deals with such serious subject matter. The roll-on-the-carpet and bite each other's arms off fight between Peck and Olivier comes too mind.Based on a stroy by Ira Levin, whose talents brought us the glorious Sliver (that was sarcasm for those who didn't get it), this film displays much of the schlock that sells so many of Levin's books. Olivier plays a Nazi-hunter whose work was responsible for Eichmann's capture follows on a lead from Steve Guttenberg's quickly deceased character, which leads to a plot by Joseph Mengele (in hiding in Paraguay) to repopulate the world with Hitler clones. Not just clones in terms of DNA, however, but right down to the type of family and domestic background, as well as specific family circumstances that are repeated as closely as possible.Yeah, I don't believe it either, but hey, without a little suspension of disbelief (and of modern science) we have an interesting plot idea. Filled with holes and bad German accents. Again, without the great acting skills of Peck and Olivier this film would be destined for the trash bin. But they save this film and make it something actually worth watching. And the (unintentional?) humour also makes it more enjoyable than it probably should be. Look for a small role by the late, great Denholm Eliot. Was going to give it a five or six, but I actually enjoyed it quite a bit, so 7/10.</fullReview>

Basically the scenario is this: Mengele (Peck) clones Hitler about 100 times, then kills all the clones' adoptive fathers because Hitler's father died. And there's something about a dog's birthday. One of the few B movies by the otherwise great actors Peck and Olivier. The only interesting scene was at the end when Olivier shakes hands with a clone.

		<fullReview>A lot of research seems to have been carried out by the team behind the creation of 'The Boys from Brazil'. It is not only the information about important former Nazis officials hiding in South America which can be appreciated by viewers but also the mention of the term 'Cloning' which would amaze many viewers. It is true that we are all currently enjoying enormous comforts of life in year twenty fifteen. However, there was also a time some thirty seven years ago when there were not many scientists nor common people who didn't have much clues about 'cloning'. From this yardstick, director Franklin J. Schaffner has done a great job of giving a lot of authenticity to evil designs of former Nazi officials who are determined to bring the world close to disaster. Apart from amazing performances from all actors, there is ample suspense for viewers as the film builds its momentum progressively to reveal the extent to which former Nazis would go in order to promote their cause. Lastly, The boys from Brazil is a good film for viewers who take pride in reading their history lessons in a serious manner.</fullReview>

In Vienna, Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman (Laurence Olivier) dismisses Kohler's discovery and tells him to go home. Kohler continues his investigation and finds Dr. Josef Mengele (Gregory Peck) arrive with plans to kill 94 seemingly ordinary 65 year old men from around the world. The Nazis kill Kohler while he's on the phone with Lieberman. Lieberman continues Kohler's investigation and discovers striking resemblance of the victims' adopted sons. The children are all clones of the Hitler whom Mengele hopes to scientifically recreate.I expected better. It's surprising how slow and prodding this movie is. The compelling aspect of the movie is the sinister plan. However it reveals too much of it too early and the plan is kind of silly making Mengele a Bond villain. On paper, it sound appealing to have an old master actor as a heroic lead. On film, the movie suffers from a lack of pace and tension. No matter how much Peck camps it up as a Nazi villain, this is an intriguing but slow thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hugely enjoyable "Boy's Own" adventure / sci-fi thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the 1976 novel of the same name by Ira Levin concerning an attempt to establish the Fourth Reich by cloning Hitler, I saw the film for the first time about 10 years ago and did not particularly enjoy it but, this time, I thought that it was enormous fun. It's not the cleverest or deepest film in the world and it has a few campy moments but it makes for a great "Boys' Own" adventure as well as a very good paranoid sci-fi thriller. I had completely forgotten that the film was directed by Franklin J. Schaffner, who also directed my sixth favourite film "Planet of the Apes". I thought that "Nicholas and Alexandra" was the only other one of his films that I had seen but I was clearly wrong! In one of the oddest cases of casting against type in film history, Gregory "Integrity" Peck, easily one of my ten favourite actors, plays the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. Casting against type can work very well - some of the best examples are seen in the two "Roots" miniseries where many very likable actors such as Lloyd Bridges, Ralph Waite, Chuck Connors and, most notably, Henry Fonda play racists - but I'm afraid that Peck was miscast in this instance. If I were Schaffner, I would have probably cast someone like Charlton Heston (who later played the role in "My Father, Rua Alguem 5555") or George C. Scott, both of whom had worked with him before and could be very creepy when they had to be. Now, Peck is an excellent actor and his performance is most certainly not awful. It is actually quite a good performance but it was not a role that played to his strengths. That said, he is at his best towards the end of the film when he is in his element and has to deliver an impassioned speech but, in stark contrast to his best and best known role, it is pro-racism rather than anti-racism! Incidentally, what was not known, at least for certain, when the film was made was that Mengele was still alive and living in Brazil. He died in February 1979, only five months after the film was released.The film benefits from another very strong cast member in the form of Laurence Olivier, another of my absolute favourite actors. He plays the role of an elderly concentration camp survivor turned Nazi hunter named Ezra Lieberman, a thinly veiled version of Simon Wiesenthal. In one of his last major roles, he is extremely good as Lieberman, playing the Nazi hunter as a man of great courage and principle who no longer has the credibility that he once did. However, Olivier loved accents and had a tendency to go over the top when using one, which happens on several occasions in the film, but it did little to detract from his otherwise great performance. Olivier received the last of ten acting Oscar nominations for the film. He was nominated for Best Actor for the ninth time, tying Spencer Tracy's record. It has yet to be surpassed. I mentioned earlier that there were a few elements of camp in the film and the biggest is probably the fight scene between the 62-year-old Peck and the 71-year-old Olivier. At their age, it was a bit on the silly side.The film has a great cast of superb actors in supporting and small roles such as James Mason, Uta Hagen (in a great cameo appearance as the former concentration guard Frieda Maloney), Denholm Elliott, John Dehner, Michael Gough, Lili Palmer, Walter Gotell, John Rubinstein, Anne Meara (who sadly died in May) and Bruno Ganz, who later played Hitler himself in "Der Untergang". I wouldn't call Steve Guttenberg a superb actor but he has a nice early supporting role as Barry Kohler, the young Jewish American man who alerts Lieberman to Mengele's plot. Jeremy Black, who plays the title characters, was not a very good actor and never appeared in another film but he only has a few scenes, all but one of which are very brief, so that's okay. The writing is quite strong. The same is true of Schaffner's direction though the film does get a little too gory towards the end.Overall, this is an extremely fun film which, while best enjoyed if not taken too seriously, does manage to raise some interesting questions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird, absurd but undeniably fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The re-birth of the Third Reich has proved to be an oddly desirable topic for many an inspiring schlock-maker. Titles such as They Saved Hitler's Brain (1968) and Gestapo's Last Orgy (1977) come to mind - movies from a bygone era when cinema-goer's would travel to like their local drive-in or tune into their TV sets late at night and expect to see something cheap, awful, but most likely hilarious. The Boys from Brazil, directed by Franklin J. Schaffner (Planet of the Apes (1968), Patton (1970)), is an event movie with a budget and an A-list cast that plots a Jewish Nazi-hunter against a tyrannical doctor hell-bent on creating a new fuhrer.Such a mainstream movie could be labelled as insensitive for creating outlandish fiction out of such a terrible event and for profiteering from it, but The Boys from Brazil, although handsomely filmed and mostly well-performed, is pure pantomime exploitation. This is evident from the moment we meet Ezra Lieberman, an ageing Austrian Nazi hunter played by Laurence Olivier, who delivers his lines in an accent so ludicrous he could be voicing a Disney character. When a conspiracy to assassinate 94 civil servants headed by SS surgeon Josef Mengele (Gregory Peck) is brought to Lieberman's attention by young Jewish activist Kohler (Steve Guttenberg) - who quickly vanishes - the old man travels throughout Europe to investigate the potential targets.Mengele's plot seems like random, senseless madness at first, but it doesn't take long to figure out what's going on. The goal, when revealed, is utterly preposterous but may have been scarily plausible if executed with care. But The Boys from Brazil is often camp, with Peck especially hamming it up and gobbling up the scene whenever he appears. He's the best thing in it - a moustached, maniacal lunk with the complexion of a pint of milk - and has greatest line of the film when he shouts "shut up, you stupid bitch!" to the unfortunate wife of an SS officer. It all leads to fisticuffs at the climax between the frail Lieberman and the bulky Mengele, which despite the extraordinary levels of gore and the presence of three angry Doberman, is unintentionally hilarious. Weird, absurd, but undeniably fun, this is pure nazisploitation polished by a talented director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Schaffner's finest films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Franklin J. Schaffner's The Boys from Brazil is a thrillingly entertaining movie with a somewhat vengeful plot adapted from an Ira Levin novel. The movie stars Gregory Peck as Dr. Josef Mengele an evil Nazi doctor who was responsible during the Holocaust for killing millions of people and amputating limbs, who is in Paraguay and is now coming up with a plot to kill 94 65 year old men and at first doesn't know that he is being recorded by a young man named Barry Kohler (played by Steve Guttenberg) a young Nazi hunter who later tells an older man who also happens to be a Nazi hunter named Ezra Lieberman (played by Laurence Olivier in an Oscar nominated performance) who all of the sudden wants to find out more about the plot. Another person who is backing Mengele's plan as much as Mengele's remaining fellow Nazis is one of his closest friends which also happens to be a Nazi named Col. Eduard Seibert (played by James Mason). Schaffner's direction for the movie is nothing short of excellent, along with Heywood Gould's intense screenplay, and Jerry Goldsmith's suspenseful music, all go well for a fast-paced thriller of this type. At the 51st Academy Awards a little more than 36 years ago this movie received 3 Oscar nominations Best Actor for Laurence Olivier, Best Film Editing for Robert Swink, and Original Score for Goldsmith, but for me this could have been nominated for a lot more awards for example with Gregory Peck being nominated for best actor, Olivier and Mason being nominated in the supporting actor category. Although this isn't Franklin Schaffner's best film that he ever directed I do think that not only it is one of his most superb, I also think that it was a wonderful film to watch.The one thing that this movie proves most is that the Nazi party is the most evil political party ever to face mankind, as well as other films such as Spielberg's Schindler's List looking at the horror that the Jews faced during the Holocaust, and Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds showing what we felt like doing to the Nazis but what we didn't do to them anyway, and the thing in this film that shows the most of Nazi cruelty was the Gregory Peck performance as Dr. Mengele which was not overplayed it was top-notch. This is a movie that will entertain as well as somewhat horrify, but also many movie lovers will really like to watch as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out and I really enjoyed it. Compared to today's more authentic period pieces, it might not stand up that well? yes, the accents are pretty bad, for example? but all things considered I thought it was well done and I've seen it several times, the most recent being just last night. I loved the foreshadowing in the scene where one of the cloned boys lets Olivier's character into his house and is reflected an infinite number of times by the hallway mirrors? it appears to be nothing more than an odd directorial choice the first time through, but for those of us who know what's coming, it's a very clever device.The dam scene was very intense and from the Trivia notes I gather it was a real dam, not a special effect. Very striking sequence in a very interesting location.I didn't follow the bit about the dog's birthday? maybe that led somewhere in the book, but if it was explained in the film I must have missed it. There were a few other awkward moments here and there (I did chuckle at the cloning expert who could reproduce DNA at the drop of a hat yet demonstrated his high-tech theories and technique using a chalkboard and a film projector), but all in all I'd recommend this movie. Intriguing idea that translated very well to film, with a classic cast the likes of which we'll probably never see again.</fullReview>

If you like old-ish science fiction movies I recommend it highly!SPOILERS TO FOLLOW!The movie concerns the cloning of Adolf Hitler by a hardcore Nazi who plans to use the Hitler clones to start a new Nazi Reich and a third world war. Obviously our hero wants to stop him from succeeding in creating his vision of the master race and the domination of the entire world.I want to read the book it's based on now! I am assuming it is a great read.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror of the Nazis continues decades after the war...and after this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the most German of movie musical scores (by Jerry Goldsmith) since "Judgement at Nuremberg", the most vile political group of all time is said to be still thriving way down in South America where a nefarious plan is underway. One of the most villainous of all Nazis is in charge, and an all-time Hollywood hero takes on his only evil role to play it. He is joined by one of the all-time classic British actors who just two years before had received an Oscar Nomination for playing another Nazi, so to see him on the opposite side of the spectrum is quite a testimony to Sir Laurence Olivier's career.The evil here comes in the form of Gregory Peck. Yes, Audrey Hepburn's protector in "Roman Holiday" and the heroic attorney of "To Kill a Mockingbird" takes on the role of Dr. Joseph Mengele who at the time of the release of this movie was actually rumored to be living in Brazil. Novelist Ira Levin used Mengele as the doctor based upon his actual experiments during World War II on concentration camp inmates who were apparently too weak to work or were deemed appropriate for misguided medical research. That element of Mengele's real life is utilized here, particularly evidenced on the poor little Brazilian boy whose radio happens to pick up a meeting between Mengele and his constituants over the plan to return the Nazi party to its former Satanic glory.Olivier plays Ezra Lieberman, a fictional character based upon Simon Wiesenthal, the famous Nazi hunter whose investigation helped lead to the arrest of the notorious Adolf Eichmann. Through Jewish college student Steve Guttenberg, Lieberman learns of Mengele's presence in Brazil and further investigation leads him to Brazil for a confrontation with his life-long enemy. The confrontation is violent and bloody, but brings on a moral dilemma for the revelation that part of Mengele's plot has succeeded and that an element of Hitler's evil still resides out there in all parts of the world.Fascinating acting between Olivier and Peck (who share only one lengthy scene) and the tense atmosphere leads to a sinister battle between good and evil. James Mason has a smaller role as one of Peck's co-horts, but is basically wasted. Among the character cameos are by Lilli Palmer, Uta Hagen, Denholm Elliott, Rosemary Harris and Ann Meara. As for Peck's villainy, he is not only genuinely evil as a human being, but deliciously mean, especially when he brutally attacts an underling who was supposed to be elsewhere then tells the man's rather over made-up wife yelling for a doctor, "I am a doctor, you idiot", then adds "Shut up, you ugly bitch!" when she orders him away. Having just played MacArthur, Peck's turnabout is rather shocking, and he takes every opportunity to chew the scenery without choking on it.This is the type of movie that might make an anti-Semite re-think their feeling towards the Jewish race and while obviously fantastic in a Science Fiction way, it also shows the danger of experimental science, particularly cloning. Political explanations of how good this could be for the world are reminiscent of Donald Sutherland's speech in "JFK" of how governments have been doing these sort of things since the days of Julius Caesar. This remains up there with political dramas such as "The Manchurian Candidate" and "All the President's Men" that will keep the eyes of the keen viewer upon the government to make sure that they are doing what they were elected to do-serve the people, not the needs of the 1% or nefarious political ambitions. In an ironic twist of fate, the real Joseph Mengele died a year later while swimming in Brazil, sort of a slice of ice cream to go on the cake of the destruction of that evil political group that almost destroyed the world 35 years before.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Hollywood starts turning out movies this good again, then maybe they will solve their problems with declining ticket sales.This movie grabs you from the opening scenes and keeps grips on you until the end. It makes me want to dig up the original novel (Ira Levin, Rosemary's Baby and a long list of others) and read it.I watched this on DVD the first time, which is the way to go. I've only seen scratchy versions chopped up by TV commercials before now. The DVD version looks like it's been taken off the master prints. It does not have the scratches and other defects of a circulation print.I knocked off a star because of Gregory Peck's congenital inability to master foreign accents and some continuity errors. These minor flaws are easy to ignore. Hollywood should learn from it past successes, and this is one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Horror/Thriller From the Author of Rosemary's Baby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This multiple Oscar nominee (including Best Actor for Lawrence Olivier) was directed by Franklin 'The Planet of the Apes' Schaffner and adapted from the best-selling novel by Ira 'Rosemary's Baby' Levin. Josef Mengele who slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people conducting sadistic scientific experiments at Nazi death camps emerges from seclusion after the war and embarks on a campaign of mysterious assassinations tied to the adoption of baby boys from Brazil. Gregory Peck was nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance as Mengele while Olivier plays the Nazi hunter who discovers the terrifying conspiracy involving human cloning and it's connection to Adolf Hitler. The Boys from Brazil is a brilliant horror/thriller and a first class production from start to breath taking finish. It was nominated for a slew of Saturn Awards including Best Film yet still remains somewhat obscure which is a shame because it is an excellent film. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mixing real names and real past with unreal present and unreal future can be intriguing and fresh, but can easily become a "porridge" of this and that with ambivalent elements - if not deliberately mocked or twisted as e.g. Quentin Tarantino does. Franklin J. Schaffner, however, has chosen to create a warning movie with "modest" sci-fi tinting, and combination of painful past with scientific opportunities is often odd, at times even doltish. The almost 2-hour-length contained some protracted and unnecessary scenes as well.Luckily, there are at least good actors even in supporting roles, and Gregory Peck as Dr. Josef Mengele and Laurence Olivier as Ezra Lieberman are pleasant to follow both together and separately. Besides, different venues, both nature and dwellings, provide the movie additional value and opportunity to compare different attitudes and lifestyles.Thus, a decent creation, but hardly for those willing to keep real historical persons and their imaginary deeds separate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Nazi hunter in Paraguay discovers a sinister and bizarre plot to rekindle the Third Reich.Who would have thought that award-winning actor Gregory Peck would star alongside perennial goofball Steve Guttenberg? Not me. But that is what we get in this film, Franklin Schaffner's second science fiction thriller, made ten years after his box office smash hit "Planet of the Apes". Dare I say, this is the better film.I do have to wonder: why was a meeting held in English rather than German? And what was up with Mengele's homosexual friend? Apparently Jewish folk, Slavic people and others are revolting to this Mengele, but he is totally fine with the effeminate men of the world. Strange, but I guess it is not out of the question.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Plausible Today Than When It Was Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recent medical discoveries have made the plot of The Boys from Brazil -- creating clones of Hitler and arranging for them to be adopted as babies by far-flung couples -- a good deal more credible than it was when Ira Levin wrote the book and it was transformed into a movie with a high voltage cast: Gregory Peck as the infamous Dr. Mengele, Lawrence Olivier as an obsessed Nazi-hunting Jew, and James Mason as the Nazi officer assigned to oversee security for Mengele's project. The intricacies of the project aren't worth describing. However, they bring a terrifying teenager (Jeremy Black) on to the screen four times as sons of four families that are unknowingly raising the next Hitler. The film culminates in a bloody battle between Mengele and his Jewish nemesis at a farm house in Pennsylvania guarded by a platoon of dobermans trained to attack anyone holding a gun. Before cloning was feasible and before anyone thought of cloning a human being, The Boys from Brazil was a nightmare fantasy. If what is scientifically possible now had been possible in 1978 when the film was made, it might have scared a lot more people than now go to see movies about maniacs with chainsaws.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such an original and audacious concept (taken off Ira Levin's novel. The author of 'Rosemary's Baby' and 'The Stepford Wives'), but I couldn't help but be distracted and mainly uninterested in something at heart is arrestingly engrossing. 'The Boys from Brazil' is an epic large-scale production with classy direction (Franklin J. Schaffner's competent handling makes this more than just camp), which doesn't entirely suit the material's destination. As it gets lost amongst an outrageously fantasy based story and the great screen presences' of Laurence Oliver, James Mason and largely an over-stated villainous Gregory Peck. These factors seem to trump over the thrilling nature that was waiting to break out, because what happens is cold, talky and calculative in a numbingly monotone rhythm. When it should be menacing, it transcends into silliness. The opening and closing acts were suspenseful with some brutal and unpleasant images (watch Peck and Oliver wrestle and scratch it out with each other), but in between was schematic with the verbose script trying to be thoughtful with it's conflicting themes and laden conspiracies, but eventually the nature and convictions become absurd. Although I got to hand it that it finishes on a terrifyingly moralistic dilemma. Within some occurrences is a cruel underlining, and the humour has a dark, if nervous streak about it. Everything is played straight, which makes it all the goofier and insanely offbeat. The performances are uneven. Peck's character is the most interesting and Oliver with his accent and mannerisms at times got a bit overbearing. Mason comes and goes rather effortlessly and there's an early lively turn by Steve Guttenberg. Lilli Palmer in a minor role provides some bite. William Goldsmith's gloriously remarkable overpowering score violates the senses and the authentically ever-changing settings perfectly complements the brooding atmosphere that's unfolding. It's hard to simply take your eyes off this strange film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most effective if you don't know the plot beforehand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time a few days ago but had been familiar with the book for a number of years. I enjoyed the picture though individuals who are unfamiliar with its plot concept will enjoy the picture most.First the bad. The science behind Mengele's plot to clone Hitler is laughable...and I'm not referring to the cloning idea. As present day science tells us, the idea of cloning a human is not too far off (the ethical ramifications I'll leave for others to discuss). However anyone with a passing knowledge of psychology or sociology will tell you that simply recreating Hitler would not recreate Nazi Germany. Nazi Germany was the result of certain socio-political forces that combined to create a national environment in which a Hitler-type individual COULD rise to power and exert influence. The science behind this movie would tell you that it was ALL due to the efforts of Hitler.BUT if you can suspend your disbelief enough, you'll have to give Levin credit for taking into consideration some important requirements for recreating a historical figure. For example, he takes into account the fact that environment must be reproduced as well as genetic material. Or the idea that you must have SEVERAL of these clones to ensure that at least one will experience the necessary influences to emerge as a duplicate of that infamous leader. Levin takes these ideas and builds a very suspenseful and interesting plot around them.Getting back to the movie, many have criticized Peck's and Olivier's performances as "hammy" or "campy". Personally, I disagree. I think Peck relished the chance to be the bad guy and what we see on the screen is simply his enthusiasm for the role. He certainly is memorable. Olivier's soft-spoken but determined Nazi hunter is a great counterpoint to Peck's charismatic villain and their meeting at the end of the film leads to a climax that is shocking, bloody, and, ultimately, ironic.There are several other very good scenes in the movie. Olivier's interview with the flirtatious mother of one of the boys. His encounter with the former Nazi guard he helped send to prison. (Good performance by Uta Hagen). Peck's maniacal attack on one of his underlings at a party (Okay, that was a little over the top).But my favorite scene in the movie doesn't involve either Peck or Olivier. One of the Nazis who has been sent to kill a clone's father encounters an old friend (a former Nazi in hiding)on top of a huge dam in Switzerland. He tells his friend that he was sent to kill a harmless old schoolteacher in the village where the friend lives. He confides in the friend his doubts about the mission. The friend urges him to "follow orders." The Nazi then turns to him, informs him that the schoolteacher is not who he has been ordered to kill, and promptly pushes his friend over the side of the dam. Morbid but terrifically ironic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a good movie that's really exciting all the way through. The plot is interesting, although it's very special. When the people behind a movie wants to select a bunch of bad guys who are extremely psycho and who have really evil master-plans, the Nazis are always a good choice. It doesn't have to be World War 2 either, because there are always someone who survived that one and wants to take over the world at a later time anyway. In that case this movie is nothing new, but the way they tried to do it here was as I said before really interesting. The actors who portrayed the Nazis did a good job here. The whole concept was so bizarre that it nearly became funny, but since it's a movie from the 70's it was too dark and serious to make that happen. I guess this had been an unintentional comedy if it had been made in the 80's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Boys from Brazil" outlined a nightmarish cloning prospect pertaining to the Third Reich. In view of the recent Lebensborn baby factory victims becoming more vociferous, Boys From Brazil has more of a chilling nod to reality than it did when it was made. It is felt by this writer that Olivier, with his accomplished aplomb, portrayed the disorganized and increasingly ignored Nazi hunter with flair. We so totally want him to be victorious.As Joseph Mengele, Gregory Peck portrayed a beyond evil man convincingly, but just a tad over the top. James Mason tries to set some limits on the megalomaniacial Mengele.The young teen played several people with the beginnings of a sociopathic personality and steely eyes. Where is this actor now?

		<shortDescription>Interesting But Sort of Falls at the End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Ira Levin's novel, "The Boys From Brazil" is a most interesting sci-fi thriller that sort of weakens in its final part. The film deals with the famous fugitive Nazi Dr. Joseph Mengele and his intent to create the Fourth Reich.The first part is most entertaining and "catching" as Mengele's plan comes to life and director Franklin Schaeffner handles the clues very well so that we finally discover what the "Angel of Death" is up to (it will be easier to find out for those of us interested in Hitler's biographies). But in my opinion the final part of the film when Mengele faces the Jewish Nazi hunter that is chasing him looks sort of standard and rather ordinary something unusual in Schaeffner's films.Gregory Peck plays Mengele with his undeniable acting skill though he kind of overacts every now and then; this one and his early role as the mean Lewt in "Duel in the Sun" are Peck's only villain parts in his career (if you don't consider him as such in "Yellow Sky" where he redeems at the end). Laurence Olivier plays the Jewish hunter -a sort of Simon Weisenthal character- with his usual talent and conviction. James Mason is there too in a not much demanding role as well as the always reliable Lilli Palmer as Olivier's sister and assistant.For those who enjoy thrillers based on real characters and what they could have been up to in fiction -like me- "The Boys from Brazil" stands a most entertaining and enjoyable product.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>..WOW ! - for The Boys from Brazil !..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with many of the comments about this movie's plot being absolutely preposterous - modern-day "cloning" or not. It reminds me of all the Russian royalty/aristocracy sitting-around Europe after War II just waiting to get back home. There were many pretenders to the throne, each with their own court....even one in Hollywood ! Kinda dangerous, too - the Bolseviks killed everyone who had any legitimate claim to the Russian throne. So, the others could spend their money and "pretend". HOWEVER, this movie also shook me up a bit to think there were so many "cloned" Hitlers - don't you think they'd have been fighting amongst themselves ? True, there were lots of Nazis in South America - but, its countries had its own dictators, and most likely benefited from Nazi money........and, I DID enjoy watching it, as silly as it is. That's the secret of watching this kind of movie: just get into it and laugh right along with it....The cinematography was gorgeous, but I kept waiting to see Brazil (some of it was filmed in Portugal). Gregory Peck (Mengele) had a ball in his fantasy-world - it would have been my opinion that HE was the biggie of all the Nazis. Mason got to call the deals, and did so with zeal and good acting. Olivier was perfect in his role - that was acting, not ranting so much like Peck. Lilli Palmer was great - still beautiful. The "students" who were doing the "outing" were excellent, all the extras enjoyed their dancing - some sex for those who need that in every movie, lots of moving-around from country-to-country. Who was Jeremy Black ? - not very convincing in this film. And, I had no idea that Hitler had blue eyes.....couldn't care less. Ann Meara again ! and Uta, too ! Gruesome ending........guess ole Mengele got what he deserved. I'm still trying to figure-out why the last Hitler-boy was developing all those pictures.......so: I giving it a 10, because it thoroughly entertained me - still LOL !

If you have already watched it, try watching it with someone who doesn't know what it's about. I think the film plays much better when you look at it from the perspective of someone who doesn't know the ending.Gregory Peck's portrayal of Dr. Mengele is gripping, the work of a true master of the acting art. He steals every scene he is in. The same can be said of Laurence Olivier.No, this film doesn't have CGI. No, it doesn't have a fast-pace. No, it doesn't have a lot of frenetic action.

		<shortDescription>Interesting thriller, questionable ethics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ira Levin's "The Boys From Brazil" was a tough, mean thriller that worked because it fashioned a preposterous idea ? that Dr. Josef Mengele was alive in Paraguay and attempting to clone Hitler - into a setting that seemed to have the pace of real life. Levin is an expert at this kind of thing, he was the man who achieved the same effect earlier with "Rosemary's Baby".The problem with The Boys From Brazil as a film is that the preposterous plot is afoot but the film achieves no sense of reality. We feel, at all times, like we're watching something so odd and bizarre that it often feels like a bad dream.The story is based partly on fact. Dr. Josef Mengele, the evil Nazi doctor who performed unspeakable surgical experiments during the reign of The Third Reich, went on the lam after the end of the war and died 34 years later while living in South America. However, this movie turns that fact into a pot-boiler, about how a Nazi hunter named Ezra Lieberman (Laurence Olivier) is fed information that Mengele is operating in Paraguay with a plot to kill 94 men around the world in an effort to make multiple clones of Hitler. If that plot sounds ridiculous, then that's exactly how the movie plays out.The story is told in large overtones. There are no subtleties here. Director Franklin J. Schaffner who always expands his canvas to make his films and his characters seem larger-than-life (he directed Patton and Planet of the Apes). In The Boys From Brazil, he uses that tone to over-inflate a story that should take place mostly in shadows. The most overinflated element here is Gregory Peck who overplays Mengele as an egomaniac whose painted hair and mustache make him look less than human. His adversary, Lieberman, is a nervous little Jewish man whose voice that doesn't seem to rise above a strong wheeze.My problem with The Boys from Brazil comes down to a question of ethics. This film's intention is to entertain, but as an entertainment film I can't help being reminded that this film is founded on a subject that seems too serious to be thrown away on a simple espionage thriller. It is founded on the hunt for a man who was part of one of the most unspeakable chapters in history, who was partly responsible for those mountains of skeletal corpses that we see in the black and white photographs from the Holocaust.I know this is just a movie, but I can't escape the fact that if there were there no Holocaust, this movie wouldn't even exist. I think it is less a question of "Isn't this just a movie" and more a question of responsibility.** (of four)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This must have been a hell of a movie back in '78. The idea of cloning tagged with the wackiest plot line for a movie to that date, it must have had audiences in shock.I kind of like this movie in a weird way. It is original, I grant you that.I will not unveil the plot for this movie for it is better left unsaid; to be discovered by the watcher. What needs to be revealed is the acting. The acting in this movie is so comical that I can't believe it was two of the greatest actors ever on the screen. Gregory Peck as a pasty faced Josef Mengele with the lamest German accent I ever heard is totally miscast. Laurence Olivier as Ezra Lieberman was so terrible as the cliché older Jewish Nazi Hunter that they nominated him for an academy award. It's obvious movies have come a long way from the seventies. I dare anyone to watch Ben Kingsley in House of Sand and Fog and Olivier in this role and think they should be nominated for the same award. He must have been laughing out of his ass when he was nominated. Another aspect of this movie that needs to be mentioned is the horrible music score at the start. Talk about grating.All that aside, the sets were great and the plot line was so unbelievable it kept me guessing. I really didn't know where it was going to take me next because it was coming so far out of left field. The greatest point in this movie comes three quarters of the way through when Liebermen visits a scientist and they discover the truth behind Mengeles's experiments. I can imagine a seventies audience trying to digest that bit of news.To a 2000+ decade audience, this movie should be taken as good campy fun and nothing else. I kept expecting Elvira, Mistress of the Dark to pop up and give us a little comment. It would make a great plot line to another Castle Wolfenstein video game. This movie needs to be seen for it's wonderful strangeness and to watch two of the centuries greatest actors hamming it up for the screen. Good Fun.</fullReview>

While several comments regarding its overall production are arguably true, for those of us who knew that Mengele was still alive when we saw the movie, it was a most intriguing concept. I went back and read the book, which I enjoyed even more. The suspense was ruined late in the movie by one of the greatest unheralded lines in movie history as the hunter finally catches up with the hunted: Lieberman (with accent): "Vere's Veelock, did you kill him too? Mengele (with sarcasm): "No, he's in ze kitchen, fixing cocktails". In my mind, it ranks right up there with "No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die"</fullReview>

Laurence Olivier (71 at the time) received an Oscar nomination for the part, was very convincing, and unknowingly does a very good impersonation of my grandmother!! In 1978 cloning was more fantasy than reality, so the film wasn't taken very seriously, now that it is reality the film's premise is even more chilling.

Schaffner, director of Planet of the Apes and Marathon Man, this fine film is the crown-jewel of his career. The chillingly realistic plot involves dogs and Hitler. Its hard to talk about the movie without giving away important plot details, but it involves nefarious Nazi doctor Josef Mengele and his blue-eyed beauties. The story comes to a tragic end when Mengele's plans are ruined by scheming Nazi Hater Ezra Lieberman (Olivier). The first half of the movie is adorned with the beautiful performance of veteran actor Steve Guttenberg as a naive but starry-eyed young Nazi Hunter.

		<fullReview>Warning: SPOILERSThis movie was kind of strange. The basic premise: Josef Mengele tries to clone Adolf Hitler. It is a little slow at the start, but it gets quite interesting once things get going. At times strange, at other times funny, and sometimes eerie, this film takes some odd turns. I love Dobermans, and found it quite interesting the role they were given, as well, for personal reasons, where they choose to end the film. The thought of seeing Mengele there was strange.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the dangers of human cloning?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of only two movies I have seen specifically about cloning, the other being Jurassic Park. It boasts two of the biggest names in Hollywood history, Gregory Peck and Laurence Olivier. The movie is a bit dry for the first hour or so, but from then on it is a chilling, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Even though it predated the recent sheep-cloning by twenty years, the process described in the movie is elaborate and, to my understanding, accurate. I'm no expert, but the articles I read about Dolly, the cloned sheep, describe the cloning process quite similarly. The movie is definitely worth watching. If anything, it'll get you thinking about the moral dilemmas involved the human cloning issue. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outlandish Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laurence Olivier stars as Nazi Hunter Ezra Lieberman, who is contacted by a young student(Steve Guttenberg) that he has discovered the whereabouts of infamous Nazi criminal Josef Mengele(Gregory Peck); Ezra dismisses it as a crank call, but when the student turns up murdered, Ezra decides to investigate further, and discovers to his horror that Mengele is alive, and working on a sinister plan to resurrect the Fourth Reich! Olivier is magnificent as the Nazi Hunter, a well-rounded and sympathetic, thoughtful performance; sadly it comes in a film that defies logic to such an extent that it feels wasted. Gregory Peck as Mengele is too one-dimensional; he is portrayed as evil incarnate, and that's it, as if Peck didn't have to try very hard, as a result, his performance seems campy. Idea of recreating Hitler is ludicrous, though climax with the Dobermans is memorable, and brutally ironic.Based on Ira Levin's novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply......Not a Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Boys From Brazil is not a good film. Franklin J. Schaffners direction lacks any imagination. It is so deliberate....it becomes the stuff of farce. Its hard to believe (at any stage) that we are watching a movie about the cloning of many Adolf Hitlers !! Gregory Pecks acting is is stiff and totally un-convincing. Laurence Oliviers acting is "over the top". Peck and Olivier play the two leads...so the movie is handicapped to the extreme.The normally reliable James Mason goes along for the ride in this inept piece of motion picture bunkum. Ira Levins very good novel disappears completely into the abyss as this strangely awful film gets lost in its own mediocrity. There are no memorable moments in this instantly forgettable movie. It is very hard to fathom...how Olivier was nominated for an Academy Award for his "over acting."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been just another bad political thriller, but Peck and Olivier make it very watchable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Boys from Brazil" is a film which attempts to combine science-fiction with a political thriller. Something similar was attempted in another thriller from the period, "Capricorn One", which took a standard plot about a government conspiracy and placed it in the context of a manned flight to Mars. The film is clearly set in the seventies, even though such an ambitious space project would not have been feasible at that time.Similarly, "The Boys from Brazil" combines futuristic technology with a contemporary setting, although in this case the technology in question is not space travel but human cloning. The central concept of the film is that Josef Mengele, a real-life Nazi war criminal who escaped to South America at the end of the war, perfected cloning techniques at some time in the sixties. Mengele has used these techniques to produce ninety-four cloned versions of Adolf Hitler, from tissue taken from his body during his lifetime. The powerful neo-Nazi organisation to which he belongs has had the boys adopted by families in various parts of Western Europe and North America, hoping that one of them will grow up to become the Fuehrer of a new Fourth Reich.In order to maximise the chances of this happening, the neo-Nazis are anxious to ensure that the boys are adopted into family backgrounds which match Hitler's own as far as possible. In each case the father is employed in a relatively minor position in government service- teacher, railway official, postman, civil servant- and is considerably older than the mother. Mengele clearly believes that this is the optimum social and psychological environment to breed a future dictator and, to add a further touch of realism has decreed that the young clones must lose their fathers while in their early teens (just as Hitler did). As a result a number of elderly men across the world start to meet mysterious deaths in their mid-sixties.Unlike Ira Levin's original novel, the film does not discuss the possible drawbacks to Mengele's scheme. Not all dictators come from similar backgrounds; Stalin and Mussolini, for example, were both the sons of artisans rather than of government officials. Moreover, Hitler's rise to power was not simply the result of his personality but was facilitated by world events outside the control of any one individual. Had the assassin's bullet missed Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914, there would have been no First World War and Hitler would have remained a unsuccessful artist, notable more for his fanatical opinions than for the quality of his work. Had there been no Wall Street Crash in 1929 and no Great Depression in the early thirties, German democracy would have survived and the Nazis would have remained a small extremist faction in the Reichstag.A film with a lurid storyline like this one would normally have been made with a cast made up of every actor you've vaguely heard of but cannot quite put a face to. "The Boys from Brazil", however, managed to attract three of the biggest stars of its day, Gregory Peck as Mengele, James Mason as his Nazi superior Seibert and Laurence Olivier as Ezra Lieberman, the elderly Jewish Nazi-hunter (said to be based upon Simon Wiesenthal) on Mengele's trail. This is an older man's film; Peck and Mason were both in their sixties at the time, and Olivier in his seventies.Mason is not particularly good in this film; an earlier reviewer points out that Peck was never good with accents, but the same could equally be said of Mason. His character Dr Quinada in "Caught", for example, is supposed to be a New Yorker, and Humbert in "Lolita" is supposed to be French, but Mason makes them both sound like English gentlemen. The nineties vogue for giving Nazis and other villains upper-class English accents (e.g. Ralph Fiennes in "Schindler's List") had not yet caught on in 1978, so Mason is forced to attempt a German accent, but it is never convincing.We are so used to seeing Peck as the calm, rational hero in films like "The Big Country" and "To Kill a Mockingbird" that it comes as a surprise to see him playing a ranting, carpet-chewing villain, but he makes the most of Mengele. Unlike some reviewers, I found his German accent reasonably authentic- Germans of Mengele's generation, who learned their foreign languages in the classroom, generally spoke English with a more pronounced accent than do their modern-day descendants who have had more exposure to English as spoken by native speakers. The heroes of cinematic thrillers are normally young, handsome and athletic, and generally end up with a beautiful young heroine on their arm. Olivier's Lieberman is about as different from this as one can imagine- a tired, world-weary old man, haunted by the past and driven by the compulsion to bring the Nazis to justice. "The Boys from Brazil" could easily have been just another bad political thriller like "Capricorn One". Peck and Olivier, however, make it very watchable. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Premise. But Fails to Satisfy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One would think with the acting talents of Gregory Peck, Lawrence Olivier, and James Mason,that this would be a stellar film. It falls far short of the mark in the story about an evil Nazi doctor trying to clone a Fourth Reich.There are some occasional decent moments, but the cloned Hitlers, (All played and overacted terribly by a young Jeremy Black who hasn't acted since) simply do not add the type of suspense or intrigue that the screenwriters and director appear to be looking for. The supposed "German" accents are laughable. The story itself often drags immensely with a plot that had started out well, moves, to unbelievable, than silly, followed by a very violent and disturbing conclusion.IMPORTANT SPOILER HERE: I felt compelled to write this because it's important to warn the viewer. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE (even in censored versions) IF YOU HAVE A FEAR OF DOGS! THE LAST 15 MINUTES OR SO FEATURE VICIOUS DOBERMANS IN A FARMHOUSE WHO ARE TRAINED TO ATTACK. THE ATTACKS ARE EXTREMELY GRAPHIC AND UPSETTING AND ARE EVEN BOTHERING ME THINKING ABOUT THEM AS I WRITE THIS REVIEW. Don't be fooled by the shocking TV-PG rating that this film gets on regular TV or standard cable. Some mild nudity and language is edited out of the broadcast versions, but the dog attacks are not edited. You have been warned.In addition, the film is too long for presenting the material it tries to cover. Good actors are the only thing that made me give this film a GENEROUS 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing premise, but much of the story is wildly unbelievable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL does anything, it proves that GREGORY PECK had his limitations when it came to playing evil characters (as opposed to his Atticus Finch real-life image), and that LAURENCE OLIVIER was indeed a very gifted actor in the right role. In fact, Peck's character might have been much more believable in Olivier's hands.It's amusing to see them both in the same film, and watching them is an example of two different acting methods at work. But what finally defeats everyone concerned, is a wildly improbable story that has Dr. Mengele attempting to clone hundreds of Adolf Hitlers from a graft of Hitler's skin.Everything is played for dramatic effect, so the story does have a certain amount of suspense and shock appeal for viewers who like these kind of stories, but by the time it reaches a ferocious climax involving some Dobermans attacking a frantic Peck, you realize you've been had. It's wildly implausible that the events depicted here could ever have happened in real life...and that's despite the fact that today cloning is a subject commonly discussed.Readers of the Ira Levin novel will no doubt be curious to see how the film treats a very weird subject, but others beware. It's certainly not a film for all tastes.The strong cast includes JAMES MASON, LILLI PALMER, UTA HAGEN, ROSEMARY HARRIS and DENHOLM ELLIOTT.Summing up: Intriguing premise but story lacks conviction and Peck is badly miscast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very odd movie... I would describe it as a serious, high budget, mad scientist film.Gregory Peck Hams it up in his role but he does it in a fun, enjoyable way.. The rest of the acting is all excellent but that's about the best aspect of this movie. The script takes a too long to develop and parts of it are overly predictable. The direction is solid, but it feels like someone is going through the motions except for a few scenes (The violent scene near the end is very memorable, so i have to give some credit there). This is a B-movie script, only with high grade talent, and somehow, it just doesn't deliver the way you would expect. It's nowhere near as good as the concept would suggest.I would recommend this, but only if you're bored and catch it on television.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly but good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Ira Levin's book. It has Josef Mengle (Gregory Peck) setting into motion an international plot to clone Hitler (don't ask). Nazi hunter Ezra Liberman (Laurence Olivier) tries to stop him.The plot is ridiculous--purportedly even Ira Levin said it was just preposterous--but this movie pulls you right in. Silliness aside the plot itself is ingenious and makes you actually think "what if..." This was a big budget production shot all over the world with an international cast. It's well-directed, looks great, moves quickly and has a great score by Jerry Goldsmith.Peck is cleverly cast against type as a sadistic Nazi. Sadly it doesn't work. He seems VERY uneasy and struggles under unconvincing makeup. Also Jeremy Black is lousy in his multiple roles--no surprise that this was his only movie. However Olivier is just great (and was Oscar nominated) in his role and the rest of the cast is right on target also--especially James Mason (doing a convincing German accent) and Lilli Palmer. And it was fun to see a very young Steve Guttenberg, Michael Gough and Anne Merea in small roles. My only complaint is the truly sick violent fight between Peck and Olivier at the end. Seeing these two talented actors biting, clawing and gouging at each other is truly disturbing. But I think (and I could be wrong) that that sequence has been edited. I clearly remember seeing it in a theatre in 1978 and seeing Peck biting Olivier's ear pretty clearly--it's barely shown here. I'm not complaining though.A good, well-made thriller. I give it an 8. Trivia: Olivier played a sadistic Nazi himself in "Marathon Man" made two years before this.</fullReview>

Gregory Peck worked his butt off, manfully, but getting Mengele right was a bit too tough for him.The file has some good dialogue, too, to recommend it, though the plot is a bit too much, as they say!All in all, watch it for Laurence Olivier, and some good photography.

		<fullReview>As a student of history and a movie buff myself, I was excited when a friend told me about 'The Boys'. I was looking forward to what sounded like a wildly original and fascinating story with a terrific cast, set against a very serious historical backdrop. What I got instead was a boring, drawn out laugher that seemed to get sillier and sillier as the thing drug on. Disappointing isn't the word. The lasting image I will take from this film (SPOILER COMING!)is that of Josef Mengele (A.K.A. Atticus Finch) wrestling with Lawrence Olivier (who is way, way too old to be running around Nazi hunting in the first place), followed by lots of biting, followed by dogs.......two hours I truly wish I had back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For psycho-history students it might be one of the most interesting films produced. The plot involves both re-creating the socio-psychological family structure of Hitler, and early cloning technology. The significant aspects of Hitlers make-up are: 1. Spoiled childhood. 2. Civil servant father. A very good movie since Eichman apparently was picked up by Israel in Argentina. The ultra-violet technology used to remove the DNA of the cloned cell and then to later impregnate with Hitlers blood or something appears to have been in the forefront of technology. Apparently the film discusses cloning of animals as a reality already in 1978. It is dated for year 2000. For computer science students the use of ultra-violet light to remove RAM software today might be interesting as well. As RAM software is put into the chip by the computer manufacturer but supposedly can be infected by virus through the ROM software technology anyway. Which would then make it impossible to start your computer. Anyway have I used up my ten lines yet? Rent this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh boy...this has got to be one of the biggest turkeys I've seen lately.Apparently, this is supposed to be a serious thriller, but I found it hard to take it seriously for a single moment. First, the entire cast is acting extremely poorly (the accents of the main characters are incredibly fake, and just about every single performance is over the top). Characters act in totally unbelievable ways (the famous nazi hunter isn't the least bit interested when somebody tells him about a serious nazi plot, the apparently calm and sophisticated Dr. Mengele nearly strangles somebody to death for no reason) and just about everything else, up to the overly dramatic score, is exaggerated. Secondly, there simply isn't enough plot to fill a two hour movie with (it can be summed up in a single sentence), resulting in a very slow movie with gives you plently of time to reflect on how utterly silly and far-fetched the story is. To make matters even worse, the flimsy plot is over-explained to the last detail, ruining any mystery there might have been."The Boys From Brazil" is an overblown, exaggerated thriller that I really couldn't take seriously for one moment. Slow moving, poorly acted and silly in the extreme, I think it can only be enjoyed as camp.*1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ira Levin's bestseller becomes embarrassing, low-grade melodrama posing as an 'important' thriller. Gregory Peck chews the scenery as Nazi-loving doctor who wants a Fourth Reich; growling like a pit bull, his face intentionally pasty-white and his mustache intentionally Hitler-black, Peck's over-the-top performance would easily slip into camp were it not for the off-putting material, which makes all his rotten deeds less intriguing and decidedly more nauseating. Laurence Olivier, playing a Nazi-hunter on the lines of Simon Wiesenthal, feyly sniffs about like a fussy Pekingese; when his ire is up, Olivier drops his nasal tones and speaks in a slow, steely warning voice, spreading his dialogue out to the breaking point. "Boys" is a highly absurd movie, with tasteless bits of business involving the females in the cast, and big introductions to the many supporting characters, each of whom get a turn in the spotlight to try and outact Peck and Olivier. The only cast member worth noting is the young man playing the Hitler clones: with a startlingly deep voice and scary, faraway eyes, he embodies what Ira Levin was trying to capture originally: the fear of the past reincarnating itself. Unfortunately, director Franklin J. Schaffner is quite inept at staging a coherent thriller, and there's no black comedy in the conception (even with the over-acting). It's all so stupid--too stupid and silly eventually to even be offensive. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boys from Brazil (1978) Directed by: Franklin J. Schaffner Starring: Laurence Olivier, Gregory Peck, James Mason, Walter Gotell et al.The first thing which attracted me to this film were leading actors Laurence Olivier, Gregory Peck and James Mason, all three not being in their younger years anymore. It's always nice to see aging actors acting alongside each other, because they can sometimes be quite surprising. Before moving on to their acting though, I will describe the plot of the film.The story starts in Paraguay, late seventies, where Barry Kohler (Steve Guttenberg) discovers that several high ranking Nazi party members are having a meeting about something which seems important. He learns that Dr. Josef Mengele (Peck) himself will be leading the meeting and that they're talking about killing 94 men around the globe. He therefore contacts legendary Nazi hunter Ezra Liebermann (Olivier) to tell him about it, but he doesn't seem interested and is too busy with other things. Only when Barry is killed while he's talking to Mr. Liebermann on the phone, does Mr. Liebermann understand there's something really sinister and important going on. He starts an investigation which brings him all around the globe in search for clues. As he comes closer to the truth the Nazi's become more cautious, except for Dr. Mengele, who won't allow Liebermann to kill off his master-plan. Eventually he must take matters in his own hands when Eduard Seibert (Mason), an old friend of Mengele, tells him that the Nazi party won't support him anymore. By this time Ezra Liebermann has discovered the sinister plan of Dr. Mengele, which will bring glory to the Arian race once more when the time is right. Liebermann must race to prevent Mengele from executing his plan and they finally meet at the house of the next potential murder victim. This final confrontation must stop Mengele in his tracks, but it becomes quite brutal, as the two old men struggle for victory.The story begins really interesting and mysterious, but when you learn the goal of this sinister plan, it becomes somewhat laughable. It just doesn't make any sense. Luckily there are enough good qualities to the film to make up for the silly plot. First off, there's some good to really good acting, so there are indeed a few surprises by the older cast members. Gregory Peck is great to watch as Dr. Mengele, his only truly unsympathetic role. He plays Mengele a bit over the top, but it all works, especially since Peck is consistent in his performance and he makes it fun to watch, without losing a credible side to Mengele's evilness. The best scene he has is when he sees Mundt (played by Walter Gotell, known mostly for his roles in the James Bond franchise) on a Nazi party, while he should be killing his targets. He throws him on the ground and starts strangling him in front of the crowd. When the two are separated, he proclaims: "He betrayed me, he betrayed you, he betrayed the Arian Race!!". It's a great and fun scene to watch. The scene following this one is great too. We see Mengele learning from Seibert that Mundt was back because the operation got canceled. This conversation is really well done and has a great feel to it. James Mason, who plays Seibert, is nice to watch alongside Gregory Peck. It may not be a standout performance, but it is a good one, making Seibert feel like a real character. The best acting comes from the legendary Laurence Olivier. He plays it more subtle than Peck does and he's utterly believable as the frail old Nazi hunter who won't give up. He's at his best when he gets agitated (look for the scene between Ezra and Frieda Maloney), but his acting when he learns about Mengele's plot is some of his best too. Sadly though, I found the acting of Steve Guttenberg and Jeremy Black to be lacking. Guttenberg was unconvincing in my eyes and Jeremy Black was annoying and not really convincing too. These important characters are therefore not really believable, which does hurt the film a bit. The rest of the cast was adequate though, nothing bad, but nothing really special too. The direction by Franklin J. Schaffner is good; he keeps a nice pace and he builds the tension well. The action scenes are handled quite believable and some of them are quite brutal. I am referring to the final confrontation between Liebermann and Mengele, where a number of dogs brutally attack them. There are some beautiful scenery shots as well, the best one being a dam in Sweden, surrounded by snow covered mountains. The shots of Mengele's villa, which is located at a lake, surrounded by jungle, were done well too. The fore-mentioned dam scene is a good one from an emotional point of view too. It features Mundt meeting an old school friend on top off the dam and it seems they're just being friendly, but then suddenly Mundt attacks him and throws him over the top, revealing that the person actually was a murder target.To help set the atmosphere of the film, Franklin Schaffner is helped (once again) by the great Jerry Goldsmith. His main theme, based upon an Austrian waltz is lovely, but especially the Nazi theme and the action music are really good. His music helps set the mood of the film really well, although the previous collaborations between the two were more memorable.All in all this is a really nice thriller, which has a strong build up and nice action, but features a silly plot. It's saved though by good acting from the lead actors and a noteworthy finale to look forward to. Watch this if you want to be entertained and thrilled and if you like to be surprised by older actors.My vote is 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All those who wrote comments and gave away the spoiler - much like the VHS cover copy-writers - should be moved to later on in the comments pages! Unbelievably I'm 31 and saw this movie for the first time on BBC2 last night. I took it as it was - a seventies movie with choppy editing and mono soundtrack, but fabulous acting, intriguing plot and breathtaking locations. A cleaned-up, re-scored (not re-written), Blu-Ray release would do wonders (maybe they should call ILM?).The performances from Lawrence Olivier as an elderly holocaust survivor, Gregory Peck, not this time as the Devil's father (see Omen) but arguably the Devil himself, Josef Mengele are superb. Olivier seems like he's on death's door in every scene, yet radiates humour, surprise, anger, emotion, and frustration with even just his eyes. A great man, worthy of all praise that is bestowed upon him. Peck, as his nemesis, is just the right side of OTT, a lesser director may have edged him into ham-ness and ruined the movie.The story is chilling. When you realise what is going on it is easy to see how ahead of his time Ira Levin was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>at first i didn't like this movie.i mean,it is a slow paced movie.despite the fact that Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck are in it,i couldn't muster much enthusiasm for it,in the beginning.it does pick up enough in the second act to maintain more interest,so,i did watch the whole movie.the story takes place in 1977 or 78. the basic premise is that Ezra Lieberman(Olivier)a Nazi Hunter(and presumably concentration camp survivor)has discovered a plot to make perfect clones of Hitler-94 to be exact.Barry Kohler(a young Steve Guttenberg)a young Jewish man has provided Lieberman with some of the intelligence on the plot.The evil mastermind behind the scheme is none other than Dr.Joseph Mengle,(Gregory Peck)a sadistic Nazi who tortured many Jews during the war.it is during the last act,where Peck gives a tour deforce performance,that really elevates this movie.however,the movie is something that should be watched because of the message it has.namely,the horrible cost that would be incurred if some madman decided to clone a nut job like Hitler.this movie is actually ahead of its time,but is really relevant in modern times,given the controversy over cloning.normally,i don't go for this message type of movie,but in this case i'll make an exception.the whole concept is disturbing to say,the least,especially when you consider all the nut jobs running around in the world.i'd recommend this movie to anyone. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I hadn't known that the clones were of Hitler, because this would have been a fantastic movie. But if I hadn't known it was about Hitler clones I probably wouldn't have watched it.I think some of the other people misread the movie slightly, or possibly I read too much into it.Mengle was trying to create a Hitler-esque man, not Hitler himself that was impossible. It was a case of the arguement of Nature vs. Nurture. Mengle evidently thought that the boys upbringing was more important then his pedigree, if all he thought he needed was Hitlers genetic code then he could have raised the 94 boys on his little island (imagine 94 hitlers arguing over what to watch on TV). Placed 94 "Hitlers" in families similar to Hitlers own, in hopes that statistically 1 or 2 would possibly follow in Hitlers footsteps of promoting Aryan..... ya da ya da ya da. Of the 4 or so children we saw all were little b******s, so then you have to decide for yourself if the cause was the childrens horrible enviroment or if it was due to some sort of evil hitler gene.Peck and Oliver were great as usual.

Best part is watching two real pros, Gregory Peck as Dr Mengele and Sir Lawrence Olivier as a Nazi-hunter named Lieberman. Not as good techically as Marathon Man(in many ways similar, featuring Sir Lawrence in a Mengele-like role) but, I think, much more enjoyable. See them as a double feature on 'Nazis in the 80s' night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Boys from Brazil is as much a comedy as a thriller it seems, the direction and cinematography are just plain dull and each scene is played like they are reading lines and the look of the film is very cheap, although there are some good location shots.The acting is some of the worst I have seen, which is a shame from two well known leads. I have never really liked Peck as an actor and here he is at his worst but I blame a lot of that on the dialog, and the accents are just laughable. The story, which is all fiction except for the fact that Josef Mengele was in South America is simple and over the top. The murders are all done in weird ways, the idea of these little Hitler clones all over the place is stupid, although cloning is possible a clone does not grow up to act like his original, especially with different parents and in a different time.Mengele was never caught, and he died from drowning as an old man in Brazil, not mangled to death by dogs in someone's living room.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly due to age most reviewers do not comprehend the English accents portrayed. In most earlier (30's thru 60's) all the actors whom portrayed Germans, Nazis, or east Europeans where either English or English trained actors. IE: George Sanders, Basil Rathbone, Yes even James Mason. The great Conrad Veidt, (Major Strasser Casa Blanca) whom actually was German Jew was type casted in USA.This film is great. When I watch same again &amp; again I actually am Hoping Mengele wins out. This is only due to the fact the great out of character performance of Gregory Peck. Only a MAN with his real life Calibre of excellence can convey this Emotion from me, all the while I knowingly understand Mengele is EVIL Personified. Olivier performance was mediocre at best. Please note this film had many good character actor whom are German. With that contrast I understand why some viewers depict Peck's accent as Ham.Remember it is only a film. The possibilities of cloning only are needed to excite us movie watchers.. Just as the Omen with anti Christand Sting with potential corruption of our children to commit illegal scams, only shows that potential of excitation and our ability to protect our children should be Paramount.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frightening film dealing with the cloning of future Hitler's. This very disturbing dramatization is well realized thanks to the splendid performance by Gregory Peck as Joseph Mengele. Peck really shed his usual wonderful person-liberal who always benefits humanity in an amazing performance as this vicious animal of a person.Am surprised that Peck did not receive a well deserved Oscar nomination here for playing Mengele. The nomination for best actor instead went to Laurence Olivier for playing Ezra Lieberman, a man in hot pursuit of Mengele and other Nazi animal war criminals. The Lieberman character was based on Simon Wiesenthal.Who was that lady that Peck referred to as an ugly bitch? She certainly looked like a clone of Ruth Gordon as Mary Todd Lincoln.Look for a young Steve Guttenberg at the beginning of the film. Uta Hagen gives an excellent one scene performance as Frieda Maloney, who works with Peck in his horrible diabolical scheme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grandiose, larger than life thriller that engrosses all the way through</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I own this film and the excellent soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith, and also have the book by Ira Levin.This is one film that is a rarity that is based on an outstanding book, and succeeds in its adaptation because it follows the story all the way through. the only other case I can think of is Silence of the Lambs.The acting by Peck and Olivier is not hammy or OTT as lesser reviewers here have criticized; they are finely tuned, powerful performances by two masterful actors with real presence and skill. Larger than life characters are needed for a project of this size and you need these larger than life actors to grab the attention from their first appearance.Peck is entirely convincing as Mengele, you get a real sense of evil from him that few other actors playing Nazis have succeeded with, and he is counterbalanced by Olivier as the weary yet sprightly Nazi hunter who has an iron will under his flamboyant exterior.As to some of the incorrect other postings, Hitler did have blue eyes, not brown. Mengele had an MD and a PhD, he was not a dentist. Read Gerard Posner's autobiography of him, see the actual photos of him, he even bears resemblance to Peck.The atmospheric photography and use of European locations as well as the score build up a real feel of the Nazi era and its echoes, you really get a sense of the strangely compelling Teutonic evil that permeated Nazi culture.In particular the flashback to the hospital scene with Mengele where he walks through his old ward, and also the scenes in Paraguay at the Nazi function and in Mengele's den.Mengele's first appearance is itself a masterpiece in pure cinema style, he lands in darkness, at an airfield in Paraguay, suddenly the awaiting military jeeps light up the airfield with their headlights, illuminating Mengele is his white suit.The score as already mentioned by Jerry Goldsmith is very Wagnerian in tone, one of his best.Now it is being remade by the same director who made Rush Hour 2, so God knows how this will turn out, but he will need to have some really fine actors on hand to even begin to compare to this outstanding version.Compare this film to a piece of modern trash like the new Mark Wahlberg conspiracy film "Shooter", and yes it is true that they don't know how to make them anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have this theory that TCM runs moldy 'classics' like this to cash in on current releases, in this case "Munich." Maybe that's a stretch, but the final scene makes the comparison clear.As for the bulk of the plot: Ira Levin seemed to write the same story repeatedly. Like "Rosemary's Baby," this one involves tampering with the reproductive process and endangering the world as we know it. Instead of the devil's spawn, this time we get 94 clones of Adolf Hitler.Here's the way to enjoy this movie: pretend it is a Mel Brooks' project and you will kill yourself laughing. I promise. Viewed as a Brooksian satire, "The Boys from Brazil" is even more hilarious and transgressive than "The Producers" (hence my 10 rating). After the ironic remake of "Stepford Wives," how soon will Hollywood remake the rest of Levin's work? Problem is, it is hard to imagine anything more silly than the original "Boys." Keep your eyes peeled for Bruno Ganz as a scientist who explains the cloning process. Yes, that Bruno Ganz, who later played Adolf Hitler in the truly scary "Downfall."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Olivier, Peck and Mason give what they have to this horror fantasy about Nazis and Nazi hunters living in South America. Old Nazis dream of the continuation of the Third Reich. Old Jewish survivors do what they can to stop it. How the Old Nazis plan to achieve this continuation is the most chilling part of this horror story.When the movie came out, the possibility of such a plot was not so funny or implausible. Years later, with scientific advances and with the resurgence of Neo-Nazi youth in Germany and Austria, we must continue to address the annihilation of such movements who will stop at nothing to continue the old reign of terror.Peck has taken many risks and has principally chosen roles which emphasize "Social Conscience: Keys to the Kingdom, Gentleman's Agreement, To Kill a Mockingbird, Boys from Brazil and many others. Normally he has played the underdog, the good guy. Here he plays the unlikely role of the monster. I respect him for that.Some may say that this film is high camp. Some may say this is high drama. All I can say is that the evil premise of its contents cannot be ignored. Whether wrought in your mind as pathos or bathos - evil of this ilk has many names and many methods. But above all, evil like this has no conscience whatever. And it cannot be ignored...and so... ...this film cannot be forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1970s paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people like to attack or mock the anti-communist films of the 1950s for "paranoia" and "hysteria." They do this despite the fact that Soviet intelligence, using many prominent Americans like Alger Hiss who was highly placed in Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal administration, made deep penetrations into U.S. institutions.But more than thirty-years after the National Socialists were defeated in World War II -- with thousands of Soviet warheads aimed at the United States -- Hollywood resurrected the Nazis in a string of films of which "The Boys From Brazil" is one. Nevermind that Hitler never had anything close to the Fifth Column Stalin had or that Nazism was irrevocably ground into the earth with Germany's defeat of 1945, the Nazi Threat was back with a vengeance."The Boys From Brazil" isn't a really bad film but, when one weighs the respective threat of Nazism to communism at the time, it is hilariously paranoid. At the time this film flickered to life in threaters, the real Josef Mengele (a detestable ass) was living quietly in a bungalow in a suburb of S?o Paulo. Yet no one would dare call "The Boys From Brazil" or "Marathon Man" a hysterical relic of the 1970s!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In terribly poor taste</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One might think that wasted potential is the worst thing that can come from an unimpressive flick... it takes away the opportunity for more capable people to use the same idea, at least for a while. Here, however, we have such a misuse of historical events... it's frankly disgusting. I believe in educating all future generations about the Nazis, and understanding how, and especially why, they did what they did, so that it may never be allowed to happen again. Meanwhile, I do not agree with using what happened as the basis for this "cool little concept" they cooked up. Also very offensive, albeit considerably less so, is the blatant oversimplifications that, like other movies about this subject(which I will not reveal here, I intend for this to be a spoiler-free review), may disturb those who do not know enough facts to dismiss this, and, for all the wrong reasons, be scared of the use of that science in real life. This has pretty obvious and easily avoided holes. It postulates that Mengele had a specific plan at the time this was made, and it involves killing 94 men. To do this, he employs known, surviving SS officers and the like. Why? They're recognizable. It would be logical to use untraceable guns for hire or something. The pacing is decent. With Peck(who manages to look the part perfectly, and be genuinely intimidating) and Olivier being so talented, it was an unbelievably stupid idea to have them speak every single line, at least several of which potentially effective and strong, through those silly accents. What's the point? They don't go into full German, no matter who they're talking to. The dialog varies greatly. Acting tends to be good, the kid is shockingly bad, I mean, to the point where it's just short of being downright painful. This is, in the end, nothing but a run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller, and it could have been infinitely better. The novel(which I have not read) was by Ira Levin, and look how astonishing and unforgettable the film Rosemary's Baby(also from a book of his) is! I can definitely see how both were written by him. Though I would love to, I haven't watched Patton or Planet of the Apes, by this same director. What happened here? Three decades pass, then it's fair game? Had this been about an entirely fictional, fanatical group... and/or, at the very least, provided some compelling drama, instead of hoping to stir up excitement from a plot that seems as though it originated in a campy 50's sci-fi schlock-fest, maybe it would be acceptable. As it is, it's passable, and, frankly, on shaky(if not outright collapsing) moral ground. I recommend this only to those who are smart enough to not take it too seriously. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, after the 1976 success of Marathon Man and The Omen, it seems that Franklin Schaffner and ITC decided to release a blend of the two. They took the tale of a fugitive nazi doctor and combined it with the demonically messianic tale of a newborn "antichrist." The result, a viewable yet strained thriller about a Jewish nazi hunter and Josef Mengele, whose genetic experiments have produced numerous clones of adolf hitler, which are all now in their early teens and living secretly with families similar to hitler's all across europe and north america.Laurence Olivier, who played the sadistic nazi Szell in marathon man, modifies his german accent to a jewish one, and goes to work as a wise grandfatherlike caricature of Simon Wiesenthal. Gregory Peck, on the other hand, who played the naive (some would say really stupid) ambassador in The Omen, now portrays the evil nazi Mengele. In addition to that, we've got Jerry Goldsmith's musical score, which isnt as creepy as in the omen, and numerous foreign locales, including a south american hideaway (briefly shown in marathon man). And like both predecessors, we have plenty of gruesome deaths, many of which are noticeably similar to the omen and marathon man. For instance, a young british girl is killed during the first hour by a nazi murderer just so he can get to his real target, a 65 year old civil servant and adopted father of one of the hitler duplicates. This is quite reminiscent of the nanny who is forced by satan to hang herself so that Damien can get an evil nanny replacement in the omen. And Mengele's brutal Szell-like portrayal and killings is also too familiar. Even Jeremy Black, who plays the 14 year old Hitler clones (in 3 different countries) is meant to resemble the evil 7 year old Damien, with his noticeable hair and deep blue eyes.I could go on, but you get the picture. All in all, this wasnt a terrible film, just not too creative and not nearly as attention grabbing as its predecessors.</fullReview>

Henry had yet to fix that. He meant for the light to gradually increase in strength with the music, but instead it suddenly bathed in a blinding white light. He had however managed that the music would start softly and then rise to an acceptable level. Acceptable meant that they both could hear each other. Normally they would start talking when the credits started to roll, but on request of Kristl they had sat in silence until the black at the end of the credit roll would show. "Why is that? Because it is an old movie?""No... It is because it got some of the best actors from around that time in it. Laurence Olivier, James Mason and Gregory Peck. I can not help to like movies which contain the latter two. I am a bit so-so on Olivier, but he is considered by most to be one of the best actors to date.""Is it insulting when I say that it's an old men movie?""It depends on what you intend. Is an old man movie, something bad? It is true, that it is a remarkable movie in that way. It stars people who are well into the sixties.""Yeah. That fight at the end had something funny. Those two old men beating each other up. ""Oddly enough, I found that struggle quite unsettling. Shocked me more than fights from action movies. Maybe because I had not expect it.""And bloody to.""So.. no scantily clad ladies waving swords about.. did you like it?""It was okay. The story has an interesting angle. Actually you know what the bad guys are doing and how, but you don't know why. And you follow Lieberman, Olivier that is, trying to figure it out. I bet a lot of people figured it out halfway through..I didn't. Although it wasn't much of a surprise in the end..""Only an very implausible plot. It is impossible to recreate the same conditions that shaped the people in the early twenty century, in the second half. The world was just completely different. Just to name a few important changes: you got cars, airplanes and television. This alone changed the world. Totally impossible.""Yeah, but fun.Besides, maybe they thought: let's give it a try.""If you are a fanatic you do not even to think that. You just do it..""Right. And Nazis are fanatics? just look at Raiders of the Lost Ark?""Yes.. or you can be a scientist obsessed with a project.""Like Mengele.""A fanatic and a scientist.. a dangerous combination. They can make the world go boom just because they want to.""And it is fun just seeing them old actors act. Peck seems very there in every scene he is in. And his boisterous overbearing personality contrasts with the down on his luck old Olivier. Yet these Nazis can not touch the vulnerable Olivier because then other people will get on to them. Publicity has its advantage," Krisl said.Henry nodded."It is a nice movie.. based on a story of Ira Levin. Yet again.""And there was this German guy in it.""You noticed?""Yeah.. that guy from that German movie we once saw. Der himmel uber Berlin.. and the one that played Hitler in Downfall.""Bruno Ganz.""Ah, that is his name?""Yes.""Another movie about Nazis and that Hitler guy.""It is an infinite source for stories," Kristl nodded."Yeah.. he sure casts a long shadow over Germany.""It is a sad thing?

		<fullReview>A well-made film that unfortunately forgets it's a fantasy. It's so grave one would think this was historical fact. In Ira Levin's speculative novel, Josef Mengele lived, moved to Brazil and starting creating little Hitlers. Nazi hunter Ezra Lieberman catches on to the scheme. This film version is suspenseful, sometimes exciting, but ultimately done in by director Franklin Schaffner's heavy hand. As Mengele, Gregory Peck is suitably nasty if a bit hammy. Laurence Olivier plays Lieberman (a thinly disguised Simon Weisenthal) as an infirm, dotty old man who somehow manages to chase Mengele all over the world. They're both oddly cast, but their final confrontation is not a let down. The unusually strong supporting cast includes James Mason as a Mengele crony, Lilli Palmer as Olivier's sister, a young Steve Guttenberg, and, as various "Hitler mothers," Anne Meara, Rosemary Harris (hitting on Olivier in a rare moment of levity), and Prunella Scales. The great Henri Decaë provided the rich cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disturbing yet so fascinating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a great example of how the fiendish Doctor Joseph Mengele tried to revive the third Reich, using families that were still involved with the Reich but at a low level. The film shows us the way the mad Doctor used genetic engineering to in fact create exact duplicates to Adolf Hitler. Over one hundred boys were born with the same traits, but never the same mind. Each one an investigator had found to be identical in different countries, London, Madrid, Paris, and so on. Each boy with the same features, eye colour, hair colour and height. But the Doctor could not take chances to the fathers of each child, and he has them murdered to prevent them from making any objection to the experiment. The movie was even better with Laurence Olivier as Lieberman, the Jewish activist who wants to expose this demented and horrific circle of Joseph Mengele. I read this book years ago and was so fascinated by it that when the movie came to theatres, it was just like reading the novel. A grand and beautiful film that takes us to the four corners of the world. This is a good reminder of how evil can still exist in these modern times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good one here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gregory Peck hams it up big time in this 1978 thriller based on Ira Levin's bestselling novel. Peck plays an old German Nazi behind a mysterious series of murders, the investigation of which leads to an astonishing plot to create the Fourth Reich. Laurence Olivier is equally outrageous as a Nazi hunter who stumbles onto the scheme. Director Franklin Schaffner (Planet of the Apes) doesn't make any bones about the preposterousness of the story or of his legendary stars' performances, and a viewer is advised not to push too deeply into this tall tale for cautionary meaning. The film is a bit bloody--particularly unnerving in a climactic scene involving some attack dogs under the command of a young but familiar-looking monster.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now you know what DVD to look for next -- this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A historical thriller that is mainly a detective story, as a diabolical plot to unleash a "4th Reich" by an infamous nazi doctor killer (Peck) through cloning the original Hitler, is unraveled by a famed but seemingly obsolete nazi hunter (Olivier). The characters, mood, settings, and music all intertwine to pull you into a world that only a movie or good book can take you.I saw this movie when it first came out and sat through it 3 times, getting more out of it with each viewing. Needless to say I was chilled, enthralled and in awe from beginning to end. Peck is mesmerizing and cold as ice, commanding every scene he is in. The secondary characters are all wonderful, particularly Uta Hagen as a war criminal murderess who inadvertently provides the key clue in uncovering the plot for a new world conquest, which said clue is, of all things, a dog's birthday. It turns out that dogs will finally put an end to this devil's work.And Olivier? Absolutely brilliant. What other actor can play a sadistic nazi dentist so convincingly (1976's "Marathon Man") and 2 years later play an equally convincing Jewish nazi hunter? Not many.Suspenseful, violent, captivating -- the epitome of a good vs. evil adventure story. Uplifting at the end yet leaving a trace of doubt that the plot may yet succeed, forcing us to be on the lookout for evil in this world, even in a young boy (Jeremy Black, who never made another film). All in all a master work by master craftsmen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another great '70's classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another fine example of '70's movie making at its very best and a typical case of; 'They don't make them like this anymore'.The movie might not be as gritty or realistic as with other '70's genre movies was the case but it has other different qualities. "The Boys from Brazil" is mostly an entertaining movie but with a serious story. Very much like also always was the case with WW II movies they used to make in the '50's and '60's such as "The Guns of Navarone". It was really a movie I enjoyed watching. The movie has a great and original and intriguing story about some old high Nazi's who fled to South-America, under the command of Dr. Josef Mengele, setting a plan in motion to establish a new Fourth Reich. Without giving away too much, it's an insane plot that features cloning. It perhaps is the first movie that handles cloning in such a serious and common way. It in a way also really makes the movie its story at least 20 years ahead of its time.Every movie should get excited seeing Laurence Olivier and Gregory Peck in one frame. Their confrontation at the end is a real classic in my book. Some real power there and director Franklin J. Schaffner exploits this very well!Leave it up to Laurence Olivier to convincingly play a character with a thick heavy accent. Perhaps his best roles involve characters with such heavy accents, this movie included. It was also refreshing for a change to see Gregory Peck in an evil villainous role for a change. The movie also has a solid supporting cast with actors such as Denholm Elliott, Walter Gotell, Rosemary Harris, Richard Marner, James Mason and Steve Guttenberg. It was really weird seeing Steve Guttenberg, who is known for his role in the Police Academy movies, in an '70's classic movie!The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith was totally surprising and great! It also helps to give the movie that typical kind of '70's movie atmosphere.It has some great thriller, science-fiction and drama aspects in it, all blended very well together. It makes "The Boys from Brazil" also certainly an original movie to watch. The movie offers surprises, tension and chills and has some great actors in it, uplifting the movie. Perhaps the movie works so well mainly thanks due to the actors, who play some heavy characters so extremely well.Another essential '70's viewing.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, entertaining but mostly camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film gets going slow and somewhat difficult to follow then turns basically into pure camp. Another reviewer hit it exactly by saying that this would have made a good X-Files episode. The theater I first saw this in erupted into total laughter when Pecks character Mengele says to an extremely homely woman at a party "Shut up you ugly B****" If nothing else see it just for that one scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated gem of the 70's ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prepare yourself for a delightful waltz with twists and thrills in one of these underrated gems like only the 70's could have brought up on our screens. I named "The Boys From Brazil": Franklyn Shaffner's exquisitely captivating thriller, starring two of the most beloved and respected actors of Hollywood's Golden Age: Gregory Peck and Sir Laurence Olivier. Two classy gentlemen in two roles that couldn't have been more antagonistic: Gregory Peck as the evil Dr. Jozef Mengele and Laurence Oliver as Ezra Lieberman, a veteran Nazi Hunter, whose life is dedicated to honor the memory of the Holocaust's victims by chasing and punishing their executioners.And the first surprise that will probably tease your mind in the first part of the film, concerns the acting department. Both Olivier and Peck are amazing and for two different reasons. While Olivier proves again his tremendous versatility by playing a venerable and inspiring Nazi-hunter after having portrayed the evilly iconic Nazi dentist, Dr. Christian Szell two years before in "Marathon Man", Gregory Peck surprises us through a role which is a 180 degree turn from good old Atticus Finch... and it's one of these villainous performances that impacts you whether you take them seriously or not. Peck is indeed a delight to watch.But I know I shouldn't use that word because Peck is playing a particularly despicable character, even worse because he really existed. While Szell was based on Mengele, Peck played Mengele. The character is the real-life Nazi doctor whose crimes in concentration camps reached a level of barbarity so atrocious one could wonder how we can decently make a character enjoyable to watch, out of this man. But the cleverness of Heywood Gould's script relies on its approach of this quite difficult subject. The approach is simple: the film is a thriller adapted from a Sci-Fi novel, helped by Schaffner's impeccable direction. The whole story is based on an incredible plot device so original, so unexpected that you understand you can't take the movie seriously, and I mean this as a compliment. It's a movie that doesn't pretend to be another thing than a movie, its purpose is to entertain and to thrill us though a complex and puzzling plot whose twist is revealed earlier enough to make the climax more enjoyable. Anyway, at the end, you're satisfied. And believe me, you'll be surprised.And that's what I loved about the film, its unpretentiousness to deal with a difficult subject in a subtle over-the-top but necessary way, because ironically the movie could only work by distancing itself from gravity and seriousness. Don't expect intellectual complexity, or Oscar worthy performances, but you can expect one hell of an entertainment from beginning to end. The movie got some Oscar nods though starting with Laurence Olivier in the lead role -while Peck got a Golden Globe nomination- I concede that both were great but not really Oscar worthy. I guess I'm biased because I would have nominated Brad Davis for "Midnight Express" instead. The editing was rightfully nominated, and so was Jerry Goldsmith's brilliant score, a well-deserved nomination for a score that perfectly delivers the mix of thrills and insanity that govern the plot structuring the film. To conclude on the Oscar chapter, I would have added the script, full of so many one-liners that almost flirt with comedy, and I'm not sure it was unintentional. Heywood Gould may not be famous for you, and for me, but only for this script, he would have deserved an Oscar nod.And forget about political matters, this movie condemns barbarity but not in the way you'd expect. All you have to do is to keep in mind, there is a Sci-Fi element in this film that might fool you in the beginning, because everything else is perfectly normal. There's just this little something that takes you by surprise and makes the rest of the film so incredible. This thing is precisely what all this "Boys from Brazil" business is about, and it won't be a samba party! Consider the two great actors involved in a cat-and-mouse thriller to serve an ingenious but diabolical scheme lead by one of the most redoubtable Nazi War criminals, portrayed here in a fictionalized role, and you'll get what you expect in a cinematic tour from Vienna to London, with a detour from Paraguay and a terminus in Pennsylvania. The last part features the most memorable lines, so priceless I think I remembered them after one viewing.Finally, I should also mention the other great presence of the suave James Mason in one of his last memorable roles. In fact, the whole film is lead by elderly actors, making it like a tribute to a generation that would desert the cinematic scene very soon. The 70's constituted for many of them the occasion for last shining moments. And "The Boys From Brazil" is one of the last great films of the 70's, whose underestimation is not even a problem because it creates many pleasant surprises to those who don't know about the film and who just want to discover, how the same actor who played Dr. Christian 'Is it safe?" Szell can play a totally opposite role. Nothing else to say except that I highly recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Franklin J. Schaffner shows us one of his mythical films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Doctor "Josef Méngüele", (Gregory Peck), known member of the Nazi party German, took refuge in Brazil after the fall of the Third Reich. There in South America get together a group of young people, militants of the Third Reich, to work in a mysterious project in which you can proceed with their repugnant experiments. A young American, "Barry kohler", contact with the hunter of Nazis "Ezra Liebermann",( Laurence Olivier), who begin to investigate and discover the terrible plan of "Méngüele".Schaffner, ("The Planet of the Apes", "Patton," "Papillon", "Nicholas and Alexandra"), after the failure of his film " Islands in the Stream ", where returned to coincide with the actor of "Patton," George C. Scott, decided embark on a draft more commercial "The Boys From Brazil". We probably, before the last great movie Schaffner .The plot on genetic engineering was well for his time, so it was a film mythical in its day, as has happened to other works of Schaffner. Today are films essential for fans of the classic cinema . With the passage of years, the film cobra force to be less science-fiction his argument.The script is less robust than it is the good novel of Ira Levin, author of "Rosemary'S Baby", novel that was carried to the cinema in 1968 by Roman Polanski. But it has a mounting mint, which won him the Oscar nomination.In the movie, we have some of the best players of all time, as James Mason and Laurence Olivier, and a Gregory Peck that except in scenes late, gives a character very successfully.The soundtrack with music by Jerry Goldsmith, is appropriate the most of the time, but in some moments the directs strangely, perhaps trying to remind Puccini and other musicians classics so admired by Mengele, but conveys a joy that it is not going to the argument. The novel by Ira Levin takes many licenses, to the point that doesn't approach in anything, what really happened to Mengele in South America, who fled frightened of the Mossad. Its importance lies more in the scientific approach, since in those years, cloning was a theory, pure "science- fiction", and was Ira Levin the first to explore publicly its potential consequences, with the moral dilemma posed."The Boys From Brazil " is a thriller that entertains, has good taste and that in general lines is well above what is now in cinema of intrigue and thriller. History is not bored at any time, although it is true that becomes entangled in a final too novel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nazis will be fair game to those who want the perfect villain due to their ruthlessness, murderous hatred of innocent people, amoral efficiency, and devious plots long after the last WWII-era nazi has gone to thewing of Hell created for them. They will always be fair game for themost savage retribution from natural force and accidents that they well deserve.Note that one of the most brutal means of killing a prisoner in the camps was to turn dogs against the weakened prisoner. Of all the ways to die, an attack by predatory animals must be one of the most painful and the most exploitative of primal fears. Of the predatory animals, dogs are even more horrible than the big cats because they are less efficient -- but just as effective. The dog may be man's best friend, but it's also one of the last animals that I would want as an enemy. Crocs and tigers kill more swiftly; dogs literally tear a victim to death. Saying more about dogs and the plot introduces a spoiler, so I shall say no more on the topic.Josef Mengele (Gregory Peck) was among the very worst of the Nazis, the quack doctor who used his medical skills solely for cruel ends in the service of Hitler. Here the evil doctor clones boys to be new manifestations of Adolf Hitler so that the Third Reich can arise throughout the Western World. Middle-aged, authoritarian men seeking children get clones of the Antichrist. Mengele watches the development of the boys from afar and notices with pride that they develop much like his hero. As they reach their teens, Mengele arranges the deaths of the adoptive fathers so that the boy can have an important commonality with the Fuehrer: the loss of a father at the appropriate age.An aging Jew, Ezra Lieberman (Laurence Olivier) discovers a plot at which he first scoffs -- before he realizes that it is all too real -- and attempts to thwart the plot by preventing the murder of the fathers. In the most important instance, he and Mengele meet one of the young "Hitlers" about as his father is about to be 'offed'.Note well that this story is science-fiction, dealing with technologies (cloning) not quite in use and the ethics of dealing with both biological and psychological determinism. What would you think of a young clone of Hitler raised in an authoritarian home as the arrogant son born to a 52-year-old man, whose mother spoils him, and who has artistic aspirations not supported by his talent, and who has the genes of the worst person who ever lived? What would you do as a Jew if you had such information?Historically incorrect and implausible? Sure. That's why it can't rate above 'good', or about "7".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I owned a gay bar, I would run snippets from this right along with "Mommie Dearest".I was in college when this came out and we used to quote from it constantly. We didn't even have to do the whole "Shut up you ugly bitch" line,we'd just start the little Mengele growling "Sh" and howl with laughter.We'd usually do this under our breath when some woman began to drone on...Liebermann's lines counteract the growling with an almost Dr. Zachary Smith (Lost in Space), "Oh the pain, the pain" shtick.The climactic fight scene is uproarious -- starting from the "Did you kill Mr. Wheelock/ no he's making us cocktails" exchange to the Bobby "man, you're weird -- ACTION!" ending.Ah the days of the late 1970s / early 1980s comedies: "Animal House", "Airplane", "Pink Panther" sequels, "Blues Brothers", "American Werewolf in London" and yes the previously mentioned "Omen" (same dogs as TBFB?)series, especially "Omen II" with the raven appearance/truck rolling over the reporter with the mud flaps providing the final insult.They don't make them like they used to and we don't have the superstars any longer -- as Joan Crawford/Dunaway said in "Mommie Dearest": "they gave the bad scripts to me because they knew I could make them work!"</fullReview>
