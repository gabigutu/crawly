		<fullReview>This is my all-time favorite movie. I've probably watched it 300 times and I can recite it line by line. I once wrote the script during the course of one semester in a class I hated. I still have the notebook.Demi Moore definitely is the film's weakest link, but the acting is superb and Aaron Sorkin's story sucks you in from the opening minute. There is so much great dialogue, headlined by Tom Cruise's courtroom battle with Jack Nicholson at the movie's climax.Too many people say the movie is average because it's "too slow," but I really believe anyone who appreciates good acting and good stories has to put this one near the top of their list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thought Provoking Drama From Rob Reiner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of the most telling scenes in this movie, Navy Lieutenant Commander Jo Galloway (Demi Moore), a lawyer who is helping to defend two Marines on trial for murder, is asked why she likes these guys so much. And she replies, `Because they stand on a wall, and they say ?nothing is going to hurt you tonight, not on my watch'.' Which veritably sums up the sense of duty and honor which underscores the conflict of `A Few Good Men,' directed by Rob Reiner, and starring Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise. There is a code by which a good Marine must live and die, and it is: Unit, Corps, God, Country. But to be valid, that code must also include truth and justice; and if they are not present, can the code stand? Which is the question asked by director Reiner, who examines the parameters of that code with this film, which centers on the murder of a young Private First Class named William Santiago, who was killed while stationed at the Marine Corps base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The case draws the attention of Commander Galloway, Special Counsel for Internal Affairs in the Judge Advocate General's Corps in Washington, D.C. Galloway, taking into consideration the impeccable service records of the two Marines charged with the crime, convinces her superiors that a thorough investigation is warranted in this case, though there are those in high places who would rather see this one plea bargained and put to rest.  Galloway persists, however, believing that Santiago's death may have resulted from a `Code Red,' a method of disciplinary hazing employed in certain circles of the Corps, though illegal. And if this was a Code Red, the real question is, who gave the order? Ultimately, her tenacity prevails, but though Galloway is a seasoned lawyer, she has little actual courtroom experience, so Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee (Cruise) is assigned to the case, along with Lieutenant Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak), with Galloway, as ranking officer, to assist. Kaffee, the son of a legendary lawyer, has skated through the first nine months of his Naval career, successfully plea bargaining forty-four cases. Outwardly upbeat and personable, Kaffee seems more concerned with his softball game than he does with the time he has to spend on the job. But underneath, he's coping with living his life in the shadow of his late father's reputation, which is an issue with which he must come to terms if he is to successfully effect the outcome of this case. And on this one he will have a formidable opponent: Colonel Nathan R. Jessup (Nicholson), who commands the base at Guantanamo. As Jessup, Nicholson gives a commanding performance, and once he enters the film you can sense the tension he brings to it, which begins to swell immediately, and which Reiner does a great job of maintaining right up to the end. Jessup is a soldier of the old guard, a man of narrow vision and a particular sense of duty; to Jessup there's two ways of doing things: His way and the wrong way. He's a man who-- as he says-- eats breakfast three hundred yards away from the enemy, and he's not about to let a couple of lawyers in dress whites intimidate him. And that's exactly the attitude Nicholson brings to this role. When he speaks, you not only hear him loud and clear, you believe him. It's a powerful performance and, as you would expect from Nicholson, entirely convincing and believable. Cruise, also, gives what is arguably one of the best performances of his career as Kaffee. He perfectly captures the aloofness with which Kaffee initially regards the case, as well as the determination with which he pursues it later. Cruise is convincing in the role, and some of the best scenes in the film are the ones he plays opposite Nicholson in the courtroom, the most memorable being one in which Kaffee exclaims to Jessup, `I want the truth!' to which Jessup replies, `You can't handle the truth!' And the atmosphere fairly crackles.  Moore is outstanding, as well, and she manages to hold her own and make her presence felt even in the scenes dominated by Nicholson and Cruise. It's a fine piece of acting by Moore, who deserves more than just a passing mention for it. Also turning in notable performances are Pollak, whose dry humor adds such an extra touch to the film, and Wolfgang Bodison, who makes an impressive screen debut as Lance Corporal Dawson, on of the Marines on trial for the murder of Santiago. The supporting cast includes Kiefer Sutherland (Kendrick), Kevin Bacon (Ross), James Marshall (Downey), J.T. Walsh (Markinson), Cuba Gooding Jr. (Hammaker) and Christopher Guest (Dr. Stone). A powerful drama, superbly delivered by Reiner, `A Few Good Men' is a thought provoking, unforgettable motion picture that makes you take pause for a moment to consider some things that are for the most part out of sight and out of mind. Like who is on that wall tonight, and are we safe because of him. And it makes you reflect upon some things perhaps too often taken for granted. And that's what really makes this film so good; and it's all a part of the magic of the movies. I rate this one 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guantanamo Bay is, apart possibly from the 38th Parallel in Korea, the only place left on earth where the US Military still confronts hostile Stalinism, eyeball to eyeball. Ceded to the USA after the Spanish-American War of 1898, Guantanamo is America's only outpost on the island of Cuba. Marines guarding the perimeter of the naval base are under immense pressure. Here in the Cold War's last remaining hotspot, they are responsible for protecting the Free World.A border incident has occurred. A marine sentry has fired a 'live' round in the direction of the communists. One of his colleagues has informed on him, bringing on himself a 'code red'. The 'code red' is an unofficial disciplinary measure, imposed by a marine squad when a member offends against the unit's esprit de corps. Having been gagged, bound and beaten, the marine dies at his colleagues' hands. There will now be a court-martial.Demi Moore plays Lieutenant-Commander Joanne Galloway, a lawyer in the Navy's Internal Affairs Department. A deft plot device has her rehearsing to herself a request to be assigned to the case as she walks across the parade ground, efficiently conveying necessary information to the viewer.Dan Kaffee (Tom Cruise) is a smart, flippant, good-looking young Navy lawyer. His father was a renowned jurist, and Dan feels the burden of his father's reputation. Indeed, his casual, tongue-in-cheek attitude to the law is his way of avoiding comparison with his father. You can't fail if you don't even try.Kaffee is assigned to defend the two marine privates accused of killing the informer. Why a junior officer should be given conduct of such a serious case is baffling, unless of course the Marine Corps wants these men to be found guilty, in order to protect somebody more important...Colonel Nathan Jessep is fascinating. Jack Nicholson always turns in a magnetic performance, but this one is special. He makes his character by turns urbane, self-assured, sarcastic, professional and menacing. Gradually, Demi and Tom start to pull together and to function as a defence team. The 'code red' doctrine is exposed as a pernicious practice.If the film is a stock courtroom drama pretty much like all the others, it certainly has qualities which set it apart. Three outstanding performances from the stars, Nicholson, Cruise and Moore, make it a bit special. The denouement is very hard to believe, but there are things in the film which linger in the memory and compensate for the exaggerations of the plot.The opening credits roll over lovingly-filmed images of a precision-drill rifle squad in action. The viewer is, from the very start, placed emotionally in the context of a severe, inflexible discipline which is both admirable and unnerving. Kaffee indulges in some sparkling legal jockeying. Though he may lack trial experience, we feel that he will defend these men ably. He is nobody's fool. The flirtatious bickering between Kaffee and Galloway is well done. Jessep's walk to the witness stand is a moment of high drama, with Nicholson filmed from a low angle, emphasising the formidable authority of the man.This clever, highly-polished film finally convinced me that Cruise can act. As for Demi, I am still unable to figure her out. What is it about her that remains stubbornly unsympathetic? She has abundant intelligence and talent, and is exquisitely beautiful, and yet is is impossible to warm to her. Does she get these parts because of her dark personality, or do the roles colour our perception of her?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A good film is what A Few Good Men is. It is not perfect but especially the performances take this film to a higher level. Tom Cruise and Demi Moore as the 'good guys' are good, as is Kevin Bacon. But the 'bad guys' make this movie really good. Kiefer Sutherland and most of all Jack Nicholson are masterful.The story is interesting and well told. We all know the truth from the beginning, or we think we do, but the movie is still exciting in its own way.I liked this movie very much, it was never boring, and I was real pleased that some of the cliches you normally see in a movie like this one were left out. If you like a good story, good directing and perfect performances this is your movie. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome Courtroom Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young hotshot naval lawyer (Cruise) is given what seems to be an open and shut case of two marines murdering another while he slept. Cruise, who has a reputation for plea bargaining was assigned by division, to defend the accused. Could it be so it never sees the inside of a courtroom? Over seeing the defence of the accused is Demi Moore, from internal affairs, who is renowned for her attention to detail. She believes their innocence and suspects a cover up.In charge of the marine unit in question is Jack Nicholson, a hard-ass marine who commands respect and demands the best.With outstanding performances from Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise, and Yes Demi Moore as well. The plot develops, and the conspiracy surrounding the case becomes apparent. And its up to Cruise to lay his career on the line to find the truth.This movie is a powerful drama, and is fantastically well made.I love it 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson bring some seriously stellar performances to the table in this legal drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Starring: Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore This movie is for people who like lawyerly stuff and military type stuff. This movie is an episode of Jag on crack. This movie was made by Rob Reiner. Really, after that last statement, need I say more? If you didn't know that Rob Reiner did The Princess Bride, then hang your head in shame now.It starts out in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, when a couple marines enter the room of another marine, stuff a rag down his throat, duct tape his mouth shut, duct tape his hands behind his back, duct tape his legs together, and so on. Then the credits roll and we cut to D.C., where we find out that the marine getting gagged and tied died that night. The two marines that were doing the gagging and tying are charged with murder and flown out to D.C.The task of lead counsel is assigned to Daniel Kaffee (Cruise), a lieutenant junior grade with a track record for plea bargaining and smooth talking. Lt. Cmdr. Jo Galloway (Moore) is assigned to be co-counsel, despite the fact that she tried to get in as lead counsel. They start the investigation down in Cuba where they meet Col. Nathan Jessup (Nicholson), the man who ordered the two men to give Private Santiago the Code Red, which accidentally led to his death. Of course, Jessup doesn't tell this to Danny or Jo. Why would he? He'd look pretty bad for it, right? So when they get back to D.C. and do some legal maneuvering with their clients and the prosecution, Danny manages to get a deal for a mere two years of prison time, where they are actually home in six months. And the two that are charged turn it down on principle, because they still believe they have done nothing wrong. Danny decides that he wants to get a different lawyer assigned to the case because he doesn't want to go down with them, but then has a change of heart after talking to a few people and thinking about it.So the trial starts, and that's when the movie really picks up speed. The skill that Danny has as he strides around the courtroom asking all the right questions and probing in just the right ways is phenomenal. It almost makes you want to be a lawyer.There are some major setbacks along the way, some things go right, a lot more go wrong, but eventually everything turns out okay in the end. But like so many movies where we know how it's going to end, it was never really the ending we were banking on, but the fun of getting there.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for Jack Nicholson and his dialogues</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the movies, I have watched many many times. First few times, Tom Cruise seemed to be giving an ordinary performance; probably my shortcoming that I was not able to understand his character. But, then I realized that he was playing exactly the character he was supposed to portray and he did it in a impeccable manner - wow!!!! He was just second to Jack Nicholson.I could not imagine if anyone else could have replaced Jack Nicholson - his stellar performance (as always) and the intensity and ferocity with which he delivered his dialogues - man, even his facial expressions at times were worth a watch.Story line and plot don't seem to be so strong and there will be many people who would not agree with its end and even with the message of the movie, which is although not so clear but definitely points towards some of the not so best practices being followed in any country's army (over discipline in the name of straightening the people and getting things in order or even avoiding any further chaos or things being run by certain people just to settle their personal scores and run in a way they think is the best, even disregarding other people's reasonable opinions). However, the other things apart, movie was a treat to watch. Director Rob Reiner and writer Aaron Sorkin didn't leave any stone unturned when it came to dialogues in the movie - in fact, the dialogues delivered by each and every character (not only Jack Nicholson) have been simply stunning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not the greatest fan of Tom Cruise, yet A Few Good Men along with Jerry McGuire would have to rank as one of his best performances. Owing to a transition from stage to celluloid, the movie has the intimacy of drama written all over it.The emphasis on facial expression, the length of dialog and the sheer drama make the watching of the movie a unique experience. The writer doesn't cater for the unenlightened, doesn't drawl over or repeat facts. Afterall, it is the experience of watching A Few Good Men that is a winner over and above all else.Demi Moore is gorgeous alluring and vulnerable all at once. Worth a watch and perhaps another.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, meaningful and surprisingly funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many powerful dramas have been made throughout the history of motion pictures. This is one of few to combine intense meaningful drama with a funny script, full of witty dialog. The ensemble of nothing but renowned competent actors ensures excellent performances throughout the movie. This would have been an almost perfect film if it wasn't for one little consistency issue regarding Colonel Jessep. Until the very end of the film, the script portrays the events from Jessep's point of view with gruesome accuracy, but after his confession he becomes a man with no apparent sense of causal relations. The fact that the man who formerly went to such extremes as to make entire flights disappear to protect his secret, doesn't understand the consequences of him confessing that secret, in the court of law, makes me confused. Of course you could argue that the colonel lives by the rules and notions of the Marine Corps and doesn't fully comprehend the world outside. I still don't accept it completely though, but that doesn't matter much overall. This is an excellent film. Watch it, watch it again and then re-watch it. You won't be disappointed.(9/10)</fullReview>

Absorbing and crowd-pleasing adaptation of Aaron Sorkin's hit Broadway play from director Rob Reiner about two Marines charged with the murder of a fellow GI at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with a tangled web of power and a green defense lawyer (excellently played by Cruise) assigned to follow the motions without a trial. Superb performances all around especially Nicholson in rare form as a colonel with one hell of a Napoleon complex. Trivial note: Bodison was a production assistant to Reiner from previous films; this is his acting debut. </fullReview>

Especially in the scene where the following words were uttered (found it in the quotes):Lieutenant Sam Weinberg: Why do you like them so much?Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway: Because they stand upon a wall and say, "Nothing's going to hurt you tonight, not on my watch."Do I have to say that almost every soldier in that cinema burst out laughing at that?It's a well made movie, but I could not bear the naivete.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Few Good Men (1992) - Starring Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Bacon, and Kiefer Sutherland - Written by Aaron Sorkin - Directed by Rob Reiner - MPAA Rating: R - 10/10Every now and then, we see a movie that we know is going to be looked at in film study and film appreciation classes. That one movie that you just know is going to be referred to as a classic very soon. Once in a while, a movie comes along that you just KNOW everybody's going to see; that the AFI is going to hold it in high regard; that's going to be highly quoted, referenced, spoofed, and cited. A Few Good Men is one of those movies.A Few Good Men is a powerful courtroom drama centering around two troops that murdered a fellow soldiers because they were ordered to by a superior officer. The screenplay and direction are absolutely flawless.The acting was good. Many of my friends disagree with me on this one, but I really don't think Tom Cruise is that great of an actor. He is a DECENT actor who's been in lots of great movies, but as an actor, he's really nothing special. His abilities don't exceed good, not even in this film, sadly. Jack Nicholson on the other hand was absolutely percfect. He was better than perfect. Jack Nicholson is one of the greatest actors of all time, and I don't think anyone else could do that part any better than he did.A Few Good Men is what you'd consider a modern classic. It's one of those films you know the filmmakers put their heart and soul into, and the end product was this brilliant piece of artwork. That is the truth. Can you handle it?Smitty's evaluation: 10/10 - A must-see, flawless film.</fullReview>

I recommend this movie for all people, and especially ex military or people who are planing to join the military. The overview of the movie is, fighting with your own conscience weather to follow the order given form your superior officer. The outcome of movie leaves you wondering whether or not we should follow orders that are ethically wrong to our beliefs, even if it comes for some one above you.

		<shortDescription>A Command Production</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A hotshot young Navy lawyer named Lt. Dan Kaffee (Tom Cruise) teams up, rather grudgingly, with a female officer named Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore), to defend two soldiers accused of murder, in the death of a Marine trainee at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.The film captures two stories in sync; accusations of murder against, and the subsequent trial of, the defendants, and the change in Kaffee that these events inspire. At the outset we learn that Kaffee is the son of a famous military man. As a result, Kaffee comes across as smug and flippant in the film's first half. Not much is demanded of him; his life as a routine Navy lawyer is easy enough. But as he sets out to defend the soldiers, his courage is tested when he must confront Marine VIPs, especially the dreaded and intimidating Col. Nathan Jessep (Jack Nicholson). As much a character study of Kaffee as a story of military justice, the film is about taking risks, and going beyond one's fears."A Few Good Men" is a topnotch, command production. The plot is riveting, especially in the second half courtroom scenes wherein Kaffee must spar with the prosecuting attorney (Kevin Bacon), and present his case before a very imposing judge. The film's color cinematography is excellent. The use of anamorphic optics inside the courtroom creates the perception of grand spaciousness, a visual depth and scope normally reserved for outdoor epics.The film's detailed production design and costumes are highly credible. Background music is haunting and low-key. The cast contains some Hollywood big guns ... so to speak. And the acting is wonderful. There's not a weak performance in the bunch. Some of the acting by Tom Cruise may be a tad over-the-top, but it's entertaining. I was pleasantly surprised by his overall high caliber performance. Nicholson does a very good imitation of Jack Nicholson and as such, is fun to watch. And Director Rob Reiner gets terrific performances from Kevin Pollak, Kiefer Sutherland, and Noah Wylie, in support roles.Marine Corps life at Gitmo during peacetime is not a subject that I would normally be interested in. And I could have done without all that ceremonial pomp at the beginning. But "A Few Good Men" is so well made overall that the film practically sells itself, despite the subject matter. The characters are interesting, the plot is absorbing, and I enjoyed watching Tom Cruise give a highly animated Perry Mason courtroom performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that everybody seems to love, but I can't stand. Here's why.They should have re-titled this "Ken &amp; Barbie Go To Military Court". Cruise and Moore are completely unbelievable as their characters. They're both too young and good-looking to play navy lawyers. The roles cried out for more mature, hard-edged actors. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed both Moore and Cruise in other roles, but I think they're the wrong choices here.The script never misses an opportunity to be obvious. The animosity between the two leads which turns to admiration. The overly sincere speeches about duty and bucking the odds. Then there's the climatic courtroom showdown between Cruise and Nicholson, which is so ridiculous I have to address with specifics:*****************SPOILERS*************************** After his key witness kills himself, Cruise risks a court marshal by sending a subpoena to the evil Colonel Jessup (Nicholson). His strategy: he hopes to goad him on the witness stand into admitting he directly ordered the "code red" that caused Santiago's death. He thinks he can bully a hardened Marine Colonel. Forget evidence, he'll just admit the crime when he gets angry. All courtroom procedures are cast aside. Nicholson gets up in the middle of his testimony to leave. Uh, that's not allowed in court. But it does give the two macho guys a chance to yell at each other. Then the judge lets Nicholson give a long speech about how he defends the US. Aren't witnesses just supposed to answer questions? Well, not when it adds to the drama, or should I say melodrama. It's all so ridiculously over-the-top. The most cringe-inducing moment is when Nicholson finally admits he gave the order, "You're Damn Right I Did!" Nicholson the actor is too smart to be believed as a character so stupid. I rolled my eyes so much in this final scene that I think I sustained retinal damage.Obvious, embarrassing, hackneyed, maudlin - I run out of adjectives to describe how silly this movie is. It's amazing what people will swallow when it's fed to them by big name stars.</fullReview>

More character involved are the Commanding Officer Colonel Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson), Lieutenant Colonel Markinson (J.T. Walsh), and Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland). The prosecuting lawyer, Jack Ross (Kevin Bacon), wants them in jail for life. Kaffee doesn't and is prepared to so just about anything to get them off of the charges. Sounds simple and normal? Well, from there on out, the story's many plot twists and elements are played out masterfully. While it may be a bit slow paced for some viewers, it is an excellent film that can be viewed over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tribute to the writer, director and cast. Superb Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Few Good Men is a truly outstanding collaboration between the amazingly talented director Rob Reiner and the masterful screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. They have created a film with both humor and suspense; sly wit and thunderous energy. The murder trial of two U.S. Marines is the backdrop for a wonderful collection of characters to thrive. Cutting dialog makes every scene compelling, memorable and expertly crafted. A Few Good Men is movie-making at its very best.In A Few Good Men, two U.S. Marines from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba are accused of murdering a member of their unit. Their defense is assigned to a cocky rookie naval attorney, Daniel Kaffey. Paired by an experienced member of his office and an idealistic representative from Internal Affairs, he plans the path of least resistance. But as more facts come to light, it becomes clear that higher forces are at work. The Marines are patsies; the results of a Code Red gone terribly wrong. The problem is proving it.Rob Reiner is as eclectic a director as there is in film. From classic comedies like The Princess Bride and When Harry Met Sally to gripping dramas like Misery and Ghosts of Mississippi, Reiner has consistently made compelling films. His movies are character based. Few special effects. No slight of hand. He believes that people and experiences are fascinating. The plots are usually simple. But that gives him the freedom to explore his characters. By the end of the film, we truly understand their motives and desires even if we loath and despise what the characters stand for. He puts his players together and let them feed off of each other and the script. And he has had some good material to work with. Stephen King's talents in Misery and Stand By Me come to mind.Aaron Sorkin is the magnificent writer paired with Rob Reiner for A Few Good Men. They will team up again on The American President, which will pave the way for Sorkin's best work. The West Wing is one of the most critically acclaimed series in television history. Sorkin's writing has everything to do with it. It is crisp, smart, flowing dialog that at times can tire you out. You are forced to pay attention to every word. Eventually, you want to pay attention. You want to grasp every word, everything that is said and not said. His work assumes an intelligent audience. Sorkin forces you to rise to his level, or be left behind. That's fine. Great entertainment should be an experience; one that takes effort.The cast of A Few Good Men is impeccable. Tom Cruise plays Daniel Kaffee. He is a fine lawyer; but he's a cocky and impassioned. Kevin Pollack is Kaffee's rock. He keeps him pointed in the right direction. Demi Moore is Kaffee's motivation; if only to keep her off his back.Jack Nicholson plays Colonel Jessep. He is a career military man. He runs his unit the way he runs his unit. He is entrenched in the 'code' of the Marines. Kiefer Sutherland as Lieutenant Kendrick is born out of this same mold. Their military world is an island that Kaffee and company are invading.A Few Good Men combines the best of everyone involved. A few characters working off of a compelling script leads to one entertaining scene after another. Many have subtle humor; though this is not a comedy. Many have passionate, powerful exchanges; as all legal dramas should. But every scene has its place. Every scene is perfectly written, directed and acted in a tapestry that is marvelous. And while the film's climax has gained notoriety for the classic exchange between Cruise and Nicholson, A Few Good Men should be viewed as more than just one moment, powerful though it may be. It should be viewed as many, many great moments. Such is the way with truly great films. A Few Good Men is one of those films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a brilliant courtroom Drama, that's extremely engrossing, with a top notch story, Cruise and Nicholson are phenomenal!. All the characters are wonderful, and it has one of the most intense endings ever in my opinion, plus Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson are simply incredible in this, and Demi Moore is amazing!. The ending with Cruise and Nicholson in the courtroom truly amazed me, they were both full of intensity, as it was actually quite chilling, plus it's extremely well made and written as well. It's very unpredictable throughout, as I never knew what was going to happen next, and while Nicholson Doesen't have a whole lot of screen time, he sure made the most of it when he was, and as a result gives one of his finest performances, as that's certainly no small feat considering how many amazing performances he has given, plus it has one hell of a cast as well, possibly one of the best ever!. I'm not a huge fan of Courtroom films, but have enjoyed a few of them, as this is definitely the best one I have seen yet, plus Cruise and Demi Moore worked really well together and had awesome chemistry.This should be even higher then 7.5 in my opinion, and it will stick with you for a bit after you have finished watching it, plus the script is extremely smart. There are so many powerful scenes in this film, and this is most definitely one of Rob Reiner's best movies, plus even at 138 minutes it left me wanting more somewhat. Kiefer Sutherland also gives a top notch performance, and there are a couple of very disturbing moments as well (especially one that involves Col. Markinson's character, J.T. Walsh), plus all the characters are extremely likable for the most part. It's also quite tense and suspenseful a lot of the time, and I really liked the music in it as well, plus I really liked Kevin Pollak's role in this. There are a number of surprising and shocking moments, and I enjoyed Cuba Gooding Jr.s cameo quite a bit, plus we are able to Identify and care for Cruise's character and root for him to solve the mystery!. This is a brilliant courtroom drama, that's extremely engrossing, with a top notch story, Cruise and Nicholson are phenomenal, and if you Haven't seen it, please do so immediately, you shouldn't regret it!.The Direction is outstanding!. Rob Reiner does an outstanding! job here with wonderful camera work, fantastic angles, creating lots of tension and suspense, and keeping the film at an extremely engrossing pace.The Acting is stellar!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always, and is incredible here he is very cocky but extremely likable and full of charm, like usual, had one hell of an intense scene with Nicholson, as usual brought tons of charisma, had awesome chemistry with Demi Moore, as he is so good at playing Lawyers!, I especially loved his anger scene when he got drunk on Jack Dainels, as he gives yet another top notch performance here! (Cruise Rules!!!!!!!!!!). Jack Nicholson is also amazing as always and is incredible here, he is extremely intense, had powerful screen presence had some brilliant lines, and while he didn't have as much screen time as you would expect, boy did he ever make the most of it, this is one of his finest performances! (Nicholson Rules!!!!!!!). Demi Moore is amazing here, she is beautiful, very likable had awesome chemistry with Cruise, and I was really surprised by her intensity here, she didn't take any crap from anyone, as I loved that! this is definitely one of her finest performances. Kevin Bacon is very good here even though I didn't care for his character at times, as I found him to be a bit of an ass, still he played his role to perfection, and was very good. Kiefer Sutherland is fantastic here, he always adds so many awesome qualities to any film he's in and here is no different, as he had quite a character here I really dug him. Kevin Pollak is great here, he was quite likable and gave a good show, I liked him, he worked well with Cruise and Demi Moore. James Marshall and Wolfgang Bodison are good as the two officers accused of murderer I really liked them. J.T. Walsh did well with what he had to do I liked him,as this is the 1st time I have seen him play a good guy so that was cool. Cuba Gooding Jr. is fine in his cameo. Rest of the cast are fine.Overall if you Haven't seen it please do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!. ***** out of 5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After what is in this day and age a remarkable run for a drama on Broadway, 497 performances from 1989 to 1991 Aaron Sorkin's A Few Good Men was given the class A treatment in terms of a cast. It was also nominated in several categories for Oscars, including Jack Nicholson as the powerful and malevolent commandant of the U.S. Marines on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba for Best Actor. One of the many Nicholson quoted lines by impersonators is that famous "you can't handle the truth" during a cross examination. Tom Cruise who asks the question for which that's the answer is not so certain he can and neither is the audience which is riveted to their collective seats watching this courtroom duel.Every player worth his salt wants a courtroom drama in their resume because of the inherent conflict and drama built in on a good case. The case here is two marines, Wolfgang Boddison and James Marshall, who are on trial for murder of a fellow marine on Guantanamo Bay. They are being prosecuted by Kevin Bacon and are defended by a team of navy lawyers that include Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, and Kevin Pollak. This death turns out to have national implications as Nicholson is up for a big Pentagon job. Of course there's a lot more to it than that, but can we handle the truth.Paramount had the good sense to get playwright Aaron Sorkin to adapt his own play for the screen and he and director Rob Reiner do a grand job in bringing it to the screen. There's no trace at all of the stage origins of this story, they've done their work that well.Besides those I've already mentioned pay attention to J.T. Walsh as Nicholson's conscience stricken second in command and Kiefer Sutherland as the hard-nosed platoon leader of the accused men.My favorites in this film are the two defendants and Tom Cruise. Cruise does a wonderful job as a navy lawyer who grows from a deal maker to a passionate advocate for what Nicholson says he can't handle. Cruise's scenes with the defendants, especially Boddison, are the most touching in the film. You will get a tear in your eye when Boddison smartly salutes Cruise and offers the review title quote. To me A Few Good Men belongs on the top five list for all of the cast members involved. Don't miss it if it's broadcast, it's the best military court martial film since The Caine Mutiny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A timeless courtroom drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films that I never tire from viewing. Despite the fascination with legal dramas these days, this film is unique as it focuses solely on one trial, almost exclusively and does not get thrown off into tangents of relationships, sexual tensions between counsel, a shadowy villain who threatens the life of the protagonist or any other outlandish 'Hollywood' circumstances. This is an extremely well-made film, not without humour, that provides a fascinating insight into the military and the litigation process.This is one of Cruise's best roles as the brash and confident young naval lawyer Daniel Kaffee, a talented attorney who has never been to trial before, who is assigned the case of defending two US Marines charged with murdering a fellow Marine. The cynical Kaffee is reluctant to take such a seemingly unwinnable case to trial, the facts of the case apparently very damning. But he is persuaded by the ambitious Commander Galloway (Demi Moore) that the two Marines have a case, and that there may have been a higher power responsible for the murder.This is an absolute all-star cast. Keifer Sutherland and Jack Nicholson are terrific and despicable as the God-fearing, fanatical military superiors. Kevin Bacon delivers a solid performance as Captain Jack Ross, the ruthless but impartial prosecutor. This is a fantastic film full of twists and surprises and ultimately a very thought-provoking conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best of the decade.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that you know almost the entire truth about halfway through the film only further proves how incredible it is. The mystery of trying to figure out what actually happened is gone but the film still manages to be immensely compelling and I was itching to see what happens next in this tumultuous story of knowing what the truth is, but figuring out how to get these people to tell it. Aaron Sorkin cleverly unravels this ingenious story with intrigue and flawless pacing until Jack Nicholson's infamous tirade in the finale. Sorkin's dialogue contains flesh-piercing jabs and razor-sharp delivery from everyone in the cast. They pull off this very intelligent screenplay as if they were built for it. These impressive exchanges of words are just as compelling, if not more so, than any high-octane action extravaganza. Everything is so perfectly orchestrated in this well-oiled machine; every part works together so seamlessly and creates a phenomenal end result. The entire cast from Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson (who is my personal win) all the way down to Kiefer Sutherland and Xander Berkeley are sensational and knocked these performances out of the park. The film feels like a throwback to classic American cinema and it succeeds admirably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is certainly much better than a regular 7.6, the currently running rating. I think it deserves an overall rating closer to 9, its one of the best movies of all times.There are actually very few evergreen movies that one likes to see again and again, this is one of them, you always feel great after watching it.The final court room scene between Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson is electrifying. Without a single kiss, the chemistry between cruise and Moore is simply delicious, all characters are well developed, attention has been payed to every single detail. One of my favorite scene is the one between Sam and Daniel after Downey's testimony where Cruise gets drunk - a really beautiful scene about how what our parents think about us, matters.Worth collecting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Drama Depicts the Struggle Between Justice and Military Code</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Toward the beginning of the film, smooth-talking JAG litigator Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) and self-righteous career officer Luitenant JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) travel to GitMo to investigate the death of a Marine supposedly at the hands of a "code red". Their escort informs them that the next leg of the journey will be by boat to which Kaffee explains that he just doesn't "like boats" to which Galloway replies, "Kaffee, you're in the Navy for Christ's sake!" This comic relief also expounds upon the rhetoric of the entire story which is the conflict between several different ideologies. There is the "law" and "justice" as it is written in the law-books, in this case the military law-books. There is the "law" as practiced, not identical to the law-books, which includes the plea-bargains and other behind-the-scenes deals. (A character even states the difference between "book law" and "trial law") There is the military code of conduct. And there is the real code of conduct as practiced by the Marines at GitMo.At the beginning of the film, we learn that JAG corp attorney Daniel Kaffee and Colonel Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson in an Academy-award caliber performance) represent the worst of these extremist ideologies. Kaffee has made a reputation of plea-bargaining JAG corps cases, sacrificing work and research in favor of quick results, often ignoring the finer points of the law. Colonel Jessup is no-better but in a different reality, condoning and sometimes encouraging practices either frowned upon or forbidden by military authority. His rationale is that no-one understands the circumstances with which he must face enemies and therefore he is justified in engaging activities that are court-martial offenses, including the so-called "code red".The story becomes how all of these ideologies collide, each represented by different characters. Dawson and Downey, the accused suspects charged by the US military with 1st degree murder for the death of the Marine, represent, before the incident in question, the best of military conduct, following orders to the letter and showing the utmost respect for their superior officers. Galloway represents the law as written in law-books but not necessarily as practiced in the courtroom. She is passionate about her work but does not quite have the street smarts of a seasoned lawyer. Kaffee represents the other side of "law" which entails plea bargains and other behind-the-scenes dealing removed from the law as written. He also seems a fish out of water, practicing in the JAG corps out of college but never formally serving in the military. And Jessup represents yet another code of military conduct--a code written and executed by him which he feels he has been given the right because of his ranking.The film works on almost every level. There is never a dull moment, from the scene where Lut. Galloway reprimands Kaffee on the baseball field for not being more aware of the needs of his clients, to the face-off between Dawson and Kaffee in the detention area, to the climactic scene in the courtroom when Kaffee puts Jessup on the stand. The story chronicles the growth of Kaffee who at first admonishes the accused Marines for their steadfast indignation at not pleading guilty. He then finds inspiration from them and Galloway to take the case rather than pass it off.The story is about facing unpleasant circumstances rather than sweeping them under the rug. Outstanding performances all around, including Wolfgang Bodison as Private Dawson who does a tremendous job at standing up to Cruise, as well as fine supporting performances by Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon. Cuba Gooding even appears in a small role as a witness. An excellent movie, not to be missed, and maybe one of the best military courtroom dramas since "The Caine Mutiny" 40 years earlier.</fullReview>

Despite not getting lead counsel Jo Galloway(Demi Moore in a wasted role), thinks Daniel needs to take up the case and not plea bargin. Despite a risk of getting court martial, Daniel takes the risk and puts the Colonel on the stand as the Col ordered the hazing of the poor misfit private.

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Ten</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie a few hours before making this comment; but it has been out long enough that they are not only tons of comments here, but also a wider opinion that it is a good movie. So here, I will give my opinion of why I would call it a Perfect Ten, rather than "just" and eight (8) or nine(9).Movies are supposed to accomplish a few key things, in my humble opinion:1. suspend disbelief 2. entertain for their duration 3. enhance the audience, or at least provide something interesting to talk about afterwards 4. showcase the talents of the crew, actors, and management who worked on making the movie a realityA movie doesn't have to be technically perfect, have 100% flawless continuity, or exacting dialogue in order to achieve a perfect score from me, because if the first two rules are met, then I won't notice those flaws during a casual viewing, and neither will 90% (or more) of the viewing audience. Nonetheless, I should still be impressed by the "workmanship" and "production values", although in recent times "production values" has come to mean "eye candy" and "excessive use of special effects technology". So perhaps it is best I just stick to "workmanship"; the movie should seem like a quality product made by professionals. Finally, something to talk about afterwards: for those who haven't watched it yet, here is where the spoilers start, so I advice you stop reading. Just go watch it, or read a few more comments by other people and then make a decision. Okay, so, let the spoilers roll:From the opening scenes, "A Few Good Men" held my interest. They set the tone for the rest of the movie by introducing the context, demonstrating the disciplined, ordered, co-ordinated m.o. of the armed forces, and slickly introduced Lt. Galloway and her struggle to manifest her intent with authority. Soon after we see what this show is about: an accidental death which occurred under questionable circumstances... but as we watch on, there's a lot more to it.This is a movie that can leave people with different opinions by the end of it, but the important thing is that it provides the opportunity for intelligent discussion (or, less intelligent and more emotional discussion, if that's your cup of tea). Plus it inspired that all-time famous quote, "you can't handle the truth!". The presentation is spot-on in that it is easy to forget you're watching a fictional movie rather than spying on real people involved in real situations; the suspension of disbelief is there. Also, the outcome of the case, and even the exact sequence of events, are not certain until the end (unless you read a spoiler or just guessed luckily). All in all, for a drama, this was really interesting. It's not at all like other military-court films which also involve extensive action sequences, and in a way that's refreshing. Even more refreshing is that minimal romantic involvement - personally, I hate that every story has to also have a romance side-story in it as well (but maybe that's just my personal loneliness speaking). Anyhow, the movie is great, you should see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A FEW GOOD MEN was even better than I expected. I thought that Tom (Cruise), Jack (Nicholson), and Demi (Moore) gave dazzling performances. Also, I was deeply moved by this movie, and it made me feel good. The most moving thing about it was the trial. This was because two Marines (whom I thought Wolfgang Bodison and James Marshall portrayed very movingly) were on trial for their lives. I got a little scared at some parts, especially when Colonel Jessup (Jack Nicholson) was on the stand. This was because he got a little aggressive and scary. In my opinion, the music score was absolutely spellbinding, especially the march that played at the beginning and end of the movie. If I can find the soundtrack in the record stores, I'm buying it. When Lieutenant Kaffee (Tom Cruise) said, "I'm sorry, your time's run out. What do we have for the losers, judge? Well, for our defendants, it's a lifetime in exotic Fort Leavenworth. And for defense counsel Kaffee, that's right, it's a court martial! Yes, Johnny! After falsely accusing a highly decorated marine officer of conspiracy and perjury, Lieutenant Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career teaching typewriter maintenance at the Rocko Club School for Women. Thank you for playing 'Should We Or Should We Not Follow The Advice Of The Galactically Stupid?'" I laughed my head off! That was a really funny quote! This is a really good courtroom drama. Having said that, I give A FEW GOOD MEN three out of four stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful movie with a timeless message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I viewed this movie the day that it opened in December, 1992, and immediately felt what director Rob Reiner was going for. The story itself has many of my favorite elements in film: something new for me (The JAG Corps), a compelling story (The Code Red), and a great cast from top to bottom. I was also pleased that Demi Moore (JoAnne Galloway), and Tom Cruise (Daniel Kaffee) were not written into an unneccessary (and unrealistic) love plot, either. The dialogue between the two of them was, at times, however, as simmering as between Kaffee and Lt. Col Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson), but for different reasons. Jo was looking for the truth, and Jessup was trying to cover it up. And even though his (Jessup's) character is only on the screen for something like 12 minutes, his presence is far reaching. He represents to me the arrogance of some military officers who are appalled that they even have to cover anything up. Kevin Pollack (Lt. Weinberg) does a good job as the other of Kaffee's sidekicks, Kevin Bacon plays against type with his portrayal of the USMC prosecutor, and Keifer Sutherland is chilling as a Marine loyal to Jessup (even more than to his God and to his Marine Corps guidebook). Interestingly, even the minor roles are played well by a combination of experienced and some then new faces, Noah Wyle (ER) as another Marine in Cuba, Cuba Gooding, Jr. (Marine), J.T. Walsh (Markinson), Christopher Guest (Doctor Stone), Wolfgang Bodison (Lance Cpl. Dawson), and James Marshall (Pfc. Downey). With the cast, the direction, and most of all the story (I saw the play and it is just as dramatic--but without the scenes of Cuba and D.C.), I felt than and I feel now that "A Few Good Men" deserves its place near the top of the decade, if not the half-century. Rarely have I walked out of a theatre with a feeling that I've experienced "something" than when I walked out that night. I'd like Reiner to direct something similar so I can have that feeling again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two U.S. Marines, Lance-Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey, are charged with the murder of a fellow Marine, Private William Santiago, at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. Their alleged motive is that Santiago was threatening to name Dawson as the man who illegally fired a shot into Cuban territory, but the two men's defence is that they did not intend to kill their victim. They claim that they were ordered by an officer, Lieutenant Kendrick, to carry out a "code red" on Santiago. This is slang for an unofficial punishment whereby Marines whose conduct or efficiency is regarded as unsatisfactory are beaten up by their comrades. Officially "code reds" are forbidden; unofficially (according to the film) some officers are will tolerate them, even encourage them, as a way of maintaining discipline. The defence team therefore must establish that an order for a "code red" was given, something the "top brass" are determined to cover up. Leading Counsel for the defence is Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, a young Navy lawyer, who has been given the job because he has a reputation as a skilled plea bargainer. The authorities hope that he will persuade his clients to plead guilty to a lesser charge, thereby avoiding the damaging publicity which might arise from a contested trial. The authorities' hopes are seemingly fulfilled when Kaffee and the prosecutor negotiate a bargain whereby the accused will plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter in exchange for a much-reduced sentence.The only problem is that Dawson and Downey refuse to play along. The U.S. Marines have a strict code of honour- "Unit, Corps, God, Country", generally in that order. (One of the reasons why Santiago was attacked is that he was felt to have breached this code). The two accused believe that to admit to wrongdoing would be cowardly and dishonourable. Dawson, in particular, despises Kaffee, whom he sees as a desk-bound officer incapable of understanding the Marine Code. So, of course, there will have to be a trial after all. (As we all knew there would. Whoever heard of a courtroom drama which ends with a plea bargain?)In my view there is one major plot-hole. Under cross-examination Downey admits that he was not present when Kendrick ordered the "code red" but learned about it later from Dawson. It is never explained why the defence team, who have otherwise prepared thoroughly for the trial, were unaware of such a crucial fact. Nor is it ever explained how, after this fact comes to light, Downey and Dawson can continue to be represented by the same lawyers, as they have quite different, and incompatible, defences. Dawson is saying "I was ordered to do it by Kendrick" and Downey is effectively saying, "I was ordered to do it by Dawson, who may or may not have ordered to do it by Kendrick". You don't need to be an expert in legal ethics to realise the problems this could cause for a single defence team.Despite this plot-hole, "A Few Good Men" is an excellent film. Director Rob Reiner keeps events moving at a fast pace and knows how to maintain tension throughout. Courtroom dramas are not always noted for photography, but this one contains some striking shots of Washington DC, where the trial takes place. Reiner also receives good support from his actors. I have not always been Tom Cruise's greatest fan; during the early part of his career he could too often come across as cocky and irritating. In the late eighties and early nineties, however, he began to emerge as an actor of genuine stature in films like "Rain Man", "Born on the Fourth of July" and this one. The rise of his character here, Kaffee, can be seen as parallelling his own rise as an actor. Kaffee starts off as a rather cocksure young man, confident (despite the misgivings of his colleague Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway) that the whole thing can be sorted out with a minimum of fuss. When he is forced into a contested trial, against his better judgement, he at first seems unsure of himself, but later begins to emerge as a lawyer of genuine status.There are good supporting performances from Demi Moore as Galloway, Kevin Bacon as the prosecutor, Kiefer Sutherland as Kendrick and Wolfgang Bodison as Dawson. The real star turn, however, comes from Jack Nicholson as the base commander, Colonel Nathan Jessup. Jessup is outwardly a commanding, authoritative figure, but even when he tries to seem at his most controlled it is clear that there is a nasty streak of uncontrolled anger and aggression just below the surface. His anger is directed partly at any man under his command, such as Santiago, who does not fit his idea of what a marine should be, and partly at civilians in general, who he believes fail to understand or appreciate the efforts and sacrifices which the military are making on their behalf. He has a particular contempt for men like Kaffee, whom he sees as mere civilians- in-uniform despite their ostensible military rank. The confrontation between Cruise and Nicholson when Jessup is being cross-examined is the great set piece of the film.The film was made in 1992, when Guantanamo Bay was not yet being used as a controversial detention centre. (Some of Jessup's aggression may derive from a sense of frustration that the recent end of the Cold War had left him in command of what must at the time have seemed like an anachronistic relic). Since the nineties, however, events at Guantanamo seem to have reinforced this film's central message, namely that the military's mission needs to be tempered by a sense of humanity, by fair play and by respect for the law. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Haha' I thought to myself as I gazed into Tom Cruise's eyes on the front of the video box, 'this should be good for a few chuckles.' It did not disappoint.Tour de France doesn't even begin to describe the journey this film took me on. Up, down, left, right; there wasn't anywhere I didn't go (emotionally speaking). First things first; the chuckles. Although as previously stated (see above) there are some good chuckles this is not a comedic film. Like most classics it transcends genre though if you forced me to tell the 'truth' ;) I'd probably say its more of a drama set in a court room? I don't think there's a name for it. Anyway, before I get carried away I should write a few words about the plot. Three words to be exact: Cruise v Lawyers. Saying any more would be spoiling the surprise #spoileralert #hewins. As always the film gave me a lot to think about, whether it was raising questions about the military's unquestioning faith in chain of command or who'd win in a cook-off, Tom Cruise or Kevin Bacon (#nocontest), the film stayed with me long after the credits rolled. To conclude I would salute this film (like Tom Cruise does at the end of the movie (I'm referencing the movie (you'll get it when you see it (trust me ;))))) and give it 12/14 Bens, you do the math ;).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent court room drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent court room drama that is set in the military. Here a lawyer is the hero. He puts his career and life and on the line to find the truth. The movie does an excellent job of exposing the hypocrisy of a corrupt organization that will do anything to cover up its criminal behavior. Jack Nicholson gives a classic rendition of a arrogant and pompous military martinet. His abuse of authority is equaled only by the brazen manner in which he conducts himself. The movie does contain certain technical flaws regarding the depiction of the military, such as the condensing of the chain of command, but they in no way detract from the dramatic power of the story. Lieutenant Kaffee has certain choices to make: take the expedient route and thereby save his career and sacrifice the lives of his clients who are the tools of a corrupt colonel, or confront the colonel knowing that to do so may mean the end of his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Masterfully Acted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a courtroom drama this film may not give some the action or excitement that they are seeking but it was always enough to keep you enthralled in the storyline. It was a pretty simple plot but sufficient in that fact. The acting was all around magnificent and while Jack Nicholson usually gets all the praise for his final speech which gave him an Oscar nomination, I thought that Tom Cruise gave the best performance. The direction and cinematography were also very good especially the opening credit sequence of the marines doing gun drills. I thought that there were a few hiccups in the script but overall it was very entertaining and had creatively clever and funny dialogue. I don't know that this has a very good rewatchability factor but it is definitely deserving of a higher score than its current 7.6. Masterfully acted and a wonderfully made film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mesmorizing court marshal drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a courtroom drama starring Tom Cruise as Lt. Daniel Kaffee, who is assigned to defend two marines accused of murdering a fellow colleague. Joining the defense team is Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) and Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollack), and all three engage in a rigorous attempt to help clear the marines, who contend that their assault against the colleague was a result of acting under orders.While this film doesn't have much, if any, action scenes, the tense and riveting atmosphere of the court marshal makes the plot very captivating and the high momentum of the defense vs. prosecution case keeps your mind mesmerized.Tom Cruise's Lt. Kaffee character was a bit of a turn-off at first because of his indifferent behavior toward Lt. Cdr. Galloway and his nonchalant response toward the cast. However, his character grew to be quite likable once the case progressed throughout the movie and his partnership with Galloway came into fruition. I enjoyed seeing Kaffee's humor and Galloway's collected and commanding personality as they deal with the case with all the odds stacked up against them, from the prosecutor Capt. Jack Ross (Kevin Bacon) to the intimidating Col. Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson). Nicholson's delivery was spot-on, owning to those who question his authority; he makes sure that those who shows him the least courtesy realizes what his rank is and what he goes through as a lieutenant colonel, as he powerfully depicts. In addition, the exchanges between him and Kaffee are what I think the highlight of the film.All the legal stuff, case examinations and witness testimony are thought provoking; they make for a very captivating film and one to see for any drama movie fans.Grade A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic of straight-up edge-of-your-seat storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting that I picked this off a shelf after the release of the Senate torture report (12/2014). Coincidence... or *Conspiracy*!?!?!?Fact is, there's been so much official wrongdoing in the years since the release of "A Few" that I'm forced to ask: Is _A Few Good Men_ just yet- another in a long line of pop mythologizations that give us a vicarious outlet for the myth that America is a nation of laws?In other words, we watch movies like _A Few_, then even when our financial elites and highest elected officials commit heinous crimes ("Too Big to Fail", 2003 Iraq invasion, CIA torture), we still find a little spot in our hearts that believes, in direct opposition to the evidence of our own eyes, that America lives up to its ideals.The film is a sort of niche masterpiece: It shows how Sorkin by that time had buffed his storycrafting creds to a high sheen, and Meathead was certainly no slouch, either. And the acting and production are excellent, from top to bottom.But if America doesn't wake up and smell the real-world injustice and inhumanity, films like _A Few_ are going to wind up being hologram showpieces for an American myth that's gone completely hollow. And that would be a damn shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than A Few Good Men Here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot In A Paragraph: A young hotshot naval lawyer Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) is given what seems to be an open and shut case of two marines murdering another while he slept. Kaffee, who has a reputation for plea bargaining was assigned by division, to defend the accused. Over seeing the defence of the accused is Jo Galloway (Demi Moore), from internal affairs, who is renowned for her attention to detail. She believes their innocence and suspects a cover up. In charge of the marine unit in question is Col Nathan Jessop (Jack Nicholson), a hard-ass marine who commands respect and demands the best.All of the leads are perfectly cast and superb. Kevin Bacon, Keifer Sutherland, JT Walsh, Kevin Pollack, Wolfgang Bodison and James Marshall are all solid support. Noah Wyle and Cuba Gooding JR both have small roles here.One of the problems (and this really is nit picking) is Tom Cruise's character is unbelievably cocky and arrogant early on. The scene where he is eating the apple in Moore's office annoys the living hell out of me. Demi Moore is great, she always delivers, whilst Jack Nicholson does what Jack Nicholson does. And nobody does it better.It's well directed with excellent performances all round and a great score. How Rob Reiner was not nominated for an Oscar for this movie baffles me, especially when the movie it's self was up for Best Picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Few Good Men concerns the trial of two Marines who are charged with the murder of a fellow Marine. They are assigned a Navy lawyer who is known for plea bargains &amp; has never stepped into a courthouse but when the two accused refuse to sign the plea &amp; maintain that they were acting under orders, their lawyer is left with no choice but to face the biggest challenge of his life.Directed by Rob Reiner (Stand by Me, The Princess Bride &amp; When Harry Met Sally...), the flow of events is smoothly paced &amp; keeps the entertainment alive throughout its runtime. Written by Aaron Sorkin, the exchange of dialogues is very dynamic and is at its best during the final showdown. Rest of the technical aspects like camera-work, editing &amp; music add to the enriching experience this film is but the best contribution comes from its cast.As far as performances go, A Few Good Men features a star-studded cast in Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson &amp; Demi Moore plus makes excellent use of its supporting characters. Cruise once again steps up to the task &amp; adds another impressive feature under his bag on his road to stardom. Nicholson is absolute badass &amp; is the most impressive of all. Moore juggles throughout the story &amp; the rest of the cast does a commendable job in their given roles.On an overall scale, A Few Good Men is a smart, slick &amp; highly entertaining courtroom drama that easily succeeds in keeping the viewers invested in its story and never lets its stars become bigger than the film itself. The best moment for me is of course the final showdown between Cruise &amp; Nicholson in their war of words and is easily one of the best films in the career of both. It didn't feel like a masterpiece but it does its job very well. Definitely recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>brilliant military court room drama - watchable again and again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is possibly Tom Cruise's best role, one of Jack Nicholson's most iconic roles and one of Demi Moore's most underrated in this star-studded court room drama.The plot centres around the death or a marine in Guantanamo Bay naval base, and Kaffee (Cruise) is the inexperienced arrogant new lawyer called in to defend the two men accused of his murder, whereas they protest they were acting on orders - a "code red" for discipline. Also in this are Kevin Bacon, Cuba Gooding Jnr, Keifer Sutherland, J T Walsh, Noah Wyle, Kevin Pollak ... plus outstanding performances by Wolfgang Bodison and James Marshall as the two marines on trial.Jack Nicholson plays Col. Jessup the highest ranking officer who has the level to order the code red and to prove that the two squaddies were just following orders, but Kaffee has to prove this up against the stubborn code of the marine commander who believes the rules of the corp are above all else. Nicholson plays a fantastic mix of hubris and superiority... the arrogance that he cannot be caught, he's above the law, and he has some impressive monologues but Tom's famous aggressiveness and determination, seen in many of his roles, is perfect and opposite each other they sizzle. Whilst this is a gripping murder mystery and court room drama, there is plenty of humour and emotion and the writing of Aaron Sorkin is (as ever) flawless with a less than Hollywood ending. Realistic and believable, you are sucked into this story and the clues are truly clever. This is a film that can be watched over and over despite knowing the outcome, and the performances of all the players makes this film completely absorbing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Individual moral conscience is above all 'codes' and norms, even supposedly those of unit, God or country.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Which is the highest authority that decides what is good and what is the right thing to do? Is there a code ? a formula that can determine what the right choice will be in any given circumstance? Throughout History very few men have grappled with the most important issue of being human ? that of moral choice. Most people simply follow the 'code' determined by social, cultural or institutional norms, and even when that 'code' is in trouble, they try to take the path of least resistance and least risk, even if it means 'cutting a deal with the devil' or in other words, making a compromise with what is actually or out-rightly wrong.Most of such situations arise when institutions become the hotspots of fanaticism perpetuated by authoritarian figures and some individual or few individuals gets caught in a conflict in this fanatical code. They then have to make a choice whether to go with the flow and take the easy way out by becoming part of it or to fight it to keep their moral integrity but sacrifice their security and comfort in this battle ? and this moral conflict happens over and over again for it has to do with the very purpose of our being human ? to know right from wrong and to act upon it even when the consequences are detrimental to our own security ? financial, physical or social.Lt. Kaffee is a lawyer in the navy who has become a specialist in cutting deals, arranging plea bargains so that all sides do not have to go through the process of 'justice'. The general technique is to put undue pressure on the accused to admit a plea of guilty, even though they may be innocent, and in turn they receive a much lighter sentence than what they would get if they contest and are convicted. Notice that in either case of the accused being guilty or innocent in a plea bargain, the outcome is basically unjust ? the principle of justice has been compromised for the sake of convenience of the lawyers, judges and jury. In such a system of expediency, no one cares for the truth or justice ? it is thus a state of a collapse of moral.Dawson ? the murder accused however does not want any kind of plea bargain and insists that he and his co-marine were merely following orders to give the victim Santiago a 'code red' which is an illegitimate call for roughing up or beating up errant marines. Santiago dies in this roughing up because he has a heart condition which has not been diagnosed. The accused are trapped because their superior officers denied they ever gave any orders for a 'code red'. So that the muck does not hit the fan, the expedient course is for the defendants to go for a plea bargain, and Kaffee assigned as defense lawyer also wants it that way since he has been so successful at arranging plea bargains that he has never seen the inside of a courtroom. But his superior officer Joanna is passionate about a proper defense as also the accused, who think that they have done nothing wrong.Kaffee who vehemently resists initially slowly gives in to the relentless passion of Joanna and the trial takes place with many twists and turns. The case which is hopeless is to begin with, becomes almost completely hopeless after one of the accused is found to be lying about the precise facts, and success finally hinges upon Kaffee's latent talent to virtually force the Col. Jessup to admit to giving the orders for 'code red'.The intense courtroom drama, the brilliant dialogs and acting, the plot, the vital theme, the direction and perfect cast makes it an unforgettable masterpiece for anyone interested in justice, law, psychology and morals ? provoking the viewer to think deeply about these vital issues of ultimate human concerns.</fullReview>

Danny Kaffee is an attorney working for the Navy and he is assigned with his colleagues Jo Galloway and Sam Wienberg to defend two Marines who are accused of killing a fellow officer after giving him a code red. Throughout the course of the trial, Danny and his team try to prove that high-ranking officers like the ruthless Col. Nathan Jessup and Jonathan Kendrick have given orders to both Marines to carry out the penalty against the young officer thus ending his life. Danny, who lacks the experience does all what he can to defend the two Marines and live up to his late father's legacy as a successful lawyer. A Few Good Men is a great movie that continues to attract audiences since its release twenty years ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Few Good Men is the epitome of performance for every member of the cast. And what a cast it is. Tom Cruise give the best performance of his career as Daniel Kaffee, the young JAG attorney with a reputation of plea bargaining and taking the easy way out. Demi Moore is incredibly adept as the driven, passionate attorney who lacks the skill to be a successful litigator, but possesses the insight to motivate Cruise's character. Kevin Pollack is the low key foil to Cruise, and his role in the film heightens the tension with a palatable air. Jack Nicholson is nothing short of phenomenal as the arrogant, powerful Marine commander who believes he is untouchable. Kevin Bacon is both Cruise's friend and his opponent and plays the quintessential professional attorney who must represent his client without "passion or prejudice". Frankly, I could write a paragraph for every character in the film, but if you haven't seen this incredible movie, you need to. Rob Reiner proves beyond a shadow of a doubt his ability to bring out the best in every actor. The end result is a film which requires no explosions, no fluff, no extraneous diversions to be timeless. Rated R for language, this incredible piece of art is one that will be talked about for years to come. Collectible in every sense of the word, and without it, you do not have a collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Code vs. Code Red</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Cruise (Lt. Kaffee), Demi Moore (Lt. Commander Galloway), and Jack Nicholson(Col. Jessep) star in this Rob Reiner dramatic legal thriller about the dangers of following orders at all cost as a United States Marine. Two marines are court-martialed for the murder of a fellow marine. Kaffee is a Jr. Grade Naval Attorney known to plea-bargain, who is teamed up against his will with a highly motivated and passionate litigator Galloway. They must defend these two marines who were caught in the moral cross hairs between their conscience and their code: Unit, Corps, God, Country.It is up to Kaffee and Galloway to show the judicial system that sometimes even Officers take things into their own hands, and that words like "Code Red" still exist in places we don't like to talk about. Caution is advised to counsel, there is a very fine line between asking questions and smearing the name of a Highly Ranked Officer (Jessep) on the witness stand.From director Rob Reiner's view, this movie was based on a true event that came from(screen play writer) Aaron Sorkin's sister, a brand new law graduate. I believe the message and the biggest question was "Why was this case given to a Jr. Grade Attorney with a track record for plea-bargaining? Was it so it never saw the inside of a courtroom?" The message in this movie was clear, in fact it was "crystal clear."What struck me about this movie was the damned-if-you-do and damned-if-you- don't situation that the two marines found themselves in. By following the "code red" order, they violated the oath that they took to protect the innocent. By disobeying the order they were in direct violation of their code. The supporting cast was outstanding, and the seat-gripping courtroom argument between Kaffee and Jessep was the performance of a life time, and in my opinion a must see movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Courtroom Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Few Good Men was adapted for the screen by Aaron Sorkin from his play of the same name.It is a courtroom drama that revolves around the trial of two U.S. Marines namely:Lance Cpl. Harold W. Dawson and Private First Class Louden Downey,who are both charged with the murder of a fellow Marine,PFC William Santiago.Also,it tells the growth and transformation of their lawyer,Lt. Daniel Kaffee, as he prepares a case to defend his clients. It has an all-star cast headed by Tom Cruise,Demi Moore,Jack Nicholson.Also,it has a talented supporting cast:Kevin Pollak,Kevin Bacon,J. T. Walsh,Kiefer Sutherland and Noah Wyle.The story is about Lieutenant Junior Grade Daniel "Danny" Kaffee (Tom Cruise),who happens to be an inexperienced U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps lawyer who leads the defense in the court-martial of two Marines, Private First Class Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Corporal Harold Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison).Both are accused of murdering a fellow Marine of their unit, PFC William Santiago (Michael DeLorenzo), at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, which is under the command of Col. Nathan R. Jessep (Jack Nicholson).Kaffee is known as being lazy and had arranged for a plea bargain.However,Downey's aunt appoints Cmdr.Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) to represent him. Also on the legal staff is Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak). The legal team discovers many facts. The defense is originally based upon the fact that PFC Santiago, the victim, was given a "code red". Santiago was basically a weakling. At Gitmo, these types of marines aren't tolerated especially by Col. Nathan Jessup. In Cuba, Jessup and two senior officers try to give all the help they can, but the legal team knows something's is not right.The film ends with a great scene between Cruise and Nicholson as fireworks are set off by a confrontation between Jessup and Kaffee. This is one of the best films I have seen in the 1990's.It was probably one of Nicholson's and Cruise's best films of their careers.The final scene was just as powerful as it can be. The acting was superb from the cast to the supporting actors/actresses. The screenplay was exceptional. The direction of Rob Reiner was simply fantastic. And most of all,the line,"You can't handle the truth" has remained a classic quote of the 90's. Highly recommended for people who loves the 90's and great movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When 'they' say a movie is as good as its script, 'they' are correct. And when you throw in some brilliant acting by some veteran actors, you've got yourself a masterpiece.A Few Good Men is just that, a masterpiece. This meaty, juicy story of fight for justice of two unfortunate soldiers who are pitted against the head of the battalion, shines in all its glory as actors like Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise &amp; Demi Moore do complete justice to it.The story revolves around the plight of two soldiers who are ordered to basically rag a member of their battalion (informally called code red) since he hasn't been living up to the expectations of the group and is accused of breaking the chain of command. They do as they are told but in the course of events the victim dies and the two soldiers are taken into custody on account of murder charges.Then comes in picture, the idealistic lawyer Demi Moore who believes that the soldiers are innocent and wants to handle the case herself. But the superiors consider a young, brash &amp; over-confident lawyer (Tom Cruise) better suited to take the job. After initial ego clashes both Demi Moore &amp; Tom Cruise's characters decide to call it a truce.Though Tom initially believes the case to be a sure-shot defeat in his otherwise victory laden career, he later after an emotional turmoil realizes that he can win it and sees it as a means to make his father proud, who also was a respected lawyer.People who love courtroom dramas and even those who don't would enjoy this movie equally. Jack Nicholson's has given one of the most brilliant performance as Col. Jessup who is a stuck up, highly egoistic, pain in the ass superior and holds respect above everything else. If it weren't for his character, the movie wouldn't have been what it is. In fact the viewer waits for his face-off with Tom cruise in the court.And a bonus for the female viewers, Tom Cruise looks like a dream. Ah! The good ol' days before the couch-jumping incident.It is a classic that anybody can watch and enjoy irrespective of age or taste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Few Good Men" is one of those movies I never miss the chance to watch when it's aired on TV. It's such a great movie. It's so good, that all stereotypes and other possible flaws one might point don't prevent me to give it a perfect 10.Jack Nicholson IS Colonel Natan Jessup, USMC. He IS! You can swear he has always been a Marine and nothing else. He delivers such a performance that you just forget he's the most Oscar-decorated male actor ever. Just amazing.Tom, Demi, Pollak, Bacon, Keith, Walsh, Marshall, Bodison and Preston are great, too. I't's not so easy to forget that Tom is Tom and Demi is Demi, but not to the point of either impairing suspension of reality or immersion in the movie. Pollak IS a Navy lawyer, Keith IS a USMC Lieutenant, Preston IS a judge, and Bodison IS Corporal Dawson.The script is intelligent; the cinematography, perfect - colors, shades, mood, everything; the sound track, engaging; direction, magical: speed, rhythm, flow, everything is in place.The superb performance of the close order drill demonstration squad close to the movie's beginning cleverly acclimates the viewer to the military establishment the story is about and where all the drama will unfold. It reminds that the movie is about a noble entity - the United States Marine Corps - whose members abide to a strict code of perfection and fitness to perform its solemn duty to its Country, thus setting the stage for a story about the conflict that steel tempered men face when one of them under-performs and their difficulty to demonstrate, feel and act with any degree of softness towards their own.The verdict is perfect in its moral, making the experience of watching this movie completely worthwhile.There couldn't have been a better closing theme song than John Philip Sousa's "Semper Fidelis". It's a smart move: it absolutely pins you down to the seat and forces you to read all the credits right to the end."A Few Good Men" is one of the best movies of all times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best courtroom movies out there, and it's my personal favorite. The cast is just great, Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollack, J.T. Walsh, Kiefer Sutherland, whom all give excellent performances, especially Jack. This is one of Nicholson's best roles, Col. Jessep has all of the best scenes in the film. It's a good story and it's very well put together, but the dialogue is just a little sloppy. There's too many comedic lines by Tom Cruise mainly, and it made his character seem a tad phony. It's like they were trying too hard to please the audience. Rob Reiner was the director, so what are you gonna do... The filmmakers really could of had a pure masterpiece if they would of got rid of all the unnecessary jokes, but I'm scrutinizing this movie way too hard; it's so entertaining. The give-and-take between Bacon and Cruise is great. Moore has a really strong character, Sutherland seems perfect for his role, Jack makes the movie. Most of the writing is very sharp, very smart. It totes a fantastic music score. It really is quality movie making. It has a nice theme and identity. A Few Good Men is easily top 50, more like top 25 for me, one of the all-time greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every once in a while, mainstream Hollywood gives us a film that not only earns its budget, but actually entertains us. Take this year's "Avatar" for example. It clearly cost a lot of money, but every penny was well spent, and the result is a wildly entertaining epic. "A Few Good Men" is another classic big-budget movie, and although it has no violence or special effects, it is nonetheless an extraordinarily compelling film that has capture the minds and hearts of millions since its release nearly twenty years ago (has it really been that long?).A young marine named Willie Santiago was murdered in his bedroom, possibly after threatening to rat out one of his superior officers for illegally firing his weapon. Two men, his commander, Harold Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) and comrade, Louden Downey (James Marshall) are on trial for Santiago's murder. The lawyer assigned to defend them is Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), who is all about making deals. But their sense of honor is so strong that they will not admit to something that isn't true, even if it meant that they could spend the rest of their lives in jail. The marines claim that they were ordered to give Santiago a "Code Red" (a sort of hazing act) by the respected Colenel Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson). Kaffee thinks their story is ridiculous, not to mention impossible to prove. But the lawyer he is working with, JoAnn Galloway (Demi Moore), sets out to prove their innocence.For a movie that's all talk, the script and performances have to be top-notch. Tom Cruise is terrific as the lawyer who would rather make deals than get the truth. But this is just a mask for the truth: he's afraid he won't live up to his father's reputation (it's a clich, I know, but Cruise is good enough that we actually believe it). What I really liked about Cruise's performance is that he carefully measures how gradually his character becomes invested in the case. First he's all about getting the best deal possible, then it's about what he can prove. Finally, he's determined to win at all costs. Director Rob Reiner plays this transformation gradually yet deliberately, and Cruise is up to the task.Demi Moore has the weakest part as the co-worker who sees through Kaffee's exterior, and the one who has to convince him to take a stand and fight for the truth, but Moore makes it all worthwhile. She's feisty and very independent (and she outranks Kaffee). Moore makes the most out of a clichd part (at least when compared to the others).Then there's the film's real star: Nicholson. If there is one reason why this movie is so popular, it's because of Nicholson. The setting and the culture of the Marine Base that plays so heavily in the plot is developed only through dialogue, and as spoken by Nicholson, it seems dark, dangerous, and very "hard core." It's pure scenery-chewing, but that's what Nicholson does best.Director Rob Reiner knows exactly what to do with the material. He's got a strong story, but he also knows that this is an actor's show. He lets them do their best without too much interference; he does his job and they do theirs. The result is a near masterpiece. The only real reason keeping me from giving this film a 10 is an ill-placed and unneeded flashback.Nevertheless, this is an amazing film, and one of the few mysteries that is enjoyable enough to watch over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searing, politically poignant courtroom drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While a courtroom drama dealing with unscrupulous military procedures (the assault and resulting death of one marine by two other marines in his unit, who may or may not have been acting under orders) may seem almost too topical to avoid a preachy, ham-handed execution, it would seem director Rob Reiner was up for the challenge. Demonstrating an unusually deft touch at handling potentially incendiary subject matter, Reiner's unwillingness to let his source material glide by on its controversy is what raises his film from the ranks of average, instead culminating as a tremendous success. The result: A Few Good Men, one of the most fervently engaging legal dramas in modern cinema, which even decades down the line maintains its political poignancy and searing emotional tension.Unsurprisingly, Aaron Sorkin's snappy, intelligent screenplay (adapted from his own play) is the real highlight, making what could have been a rote courtroom thriller bristle with emotional intensity and vivacity, leading for some highly quotable lines (Nicholson's legendary "You can't handle the truth!" is the highlight) while simultaneously making some intriguing points about the moral ambiguity of modern military, as well as the fanaticism instilled in young recruits. However, the film's emotional resonance is similarly laudable, as Reiner demonstrates a surprising ability to draw the audience in and present a highly familiar situation while extracting an exceptional amount of emotional engagement and making the audience care in a surprisingly vivid fashion. While the film does stumble into occasional sappy or clichd patches, it mercifully dodges them at others (the exclusion of a romantic subplot between Cruise and Moore is a blessing) making the overall product far more satisfying. Technically the film also excels, as the quality cinematography and editing aid the transition from stage to film by adding a sweeping quality to the film punctuated by a clipped, military feel, perfectly capturing the terse tension and intrigue of the film. Similarly, Marc Shaiman's score is usually effective, substantially raising the tension with a quality mix of military drums and horns, but similarly overdoses on sentimental patriotic themes, often at crucial points of the film disappointingly enough. Despite the indisputable quality of Sorkin's script, it is really the actors who bring it to life, with each performer unquestionably operating at the peak of their considerable abilities. Tom Cruise perfectly essays the transition from cocky hotshot lawyer to a passionate, obsessive one striving for justice, and Cruise's immense charisma adds a strangely likable quality to what is mostly a highly unlikeable character when first introduced, while shining in later dramatic scenes. However, there is no question that the film is Jack Nicholson's show, timelessly inhabiting shady military Colonel Nathan R. Jessup like a weathered glove. One of the strongest points in his outstanding acting career, Nicholson crackles with ferocious muted intensity held to a captivating simmer, and with three (disappointingly but necessarily brief) scenes he sears the screen and walks away with the show with ease.Demi Moore also fumes with appropriate dramatic intensity as a lieutenant fiercely maintaining moral standpoints, taking the bulk of the film's weaker moments and infusing them with genuine passion. Kevin Pollack gives a firmly quality performance as Cruise's skeptical legal assistant, though many of his comedic moments seem out of place. The always reliable Kevin Bacon is superb, taking the thankless role of the opposing lawyer and infusing it with genuine energy and easygoing charm, alternating between effortlessly inciting the audience's hatred then defusing it with an endearing sense of humour without missing a beat. Keifer Sutherland is deliciously oily as an unscrupulous lieutenant, his detached, silky voice and fiery eyes making a genuinely detestable antagonist. A painstakingly crafted script, Reiner's quality direction and a few exceptional performances make for a resoundingly more than 'good' final outcome, as A Few Good Men achieves a level of emotional engagement few other courtroom dramas can muster. While certain patches of clich or overdone American patriotism do slow the film down, its uniquely subversive take on fanatical patriotism makes for a more compelling and satisfying watch. While hardly flawless, the film excels on so many fronts that it easily merits viewing for any in search of a quality legal drama, or a captivating and thought provoking film pulsing with real urgency and emotional poignancy.-9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My number one film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is officially my favorite film of all time! A bold statement, but one I truly stand by. The reason it rates so highly? Well, there's quite a few, but the most important being the glorious cast and the amazing script. Two factors that, when not in tandem, can seriously derail a film. But here it works together perfectly in sync.There are quite a few career-best performances to be found here: Jack Nicholson at his growling best, Demi Moore as a true legal ball-buster, but it's Tom Cruise who deserves the most praise. His character, Daniel Kaffee, is a wise-cracking young lawyer who's in for the trial of his life. But the way Cruise infuses his character with slight nuances and cocky grins make him seem very charming, plus all the witty one-liners uttered by Cruise should keep you chuckling every time he and Demi Moore's Lt. Galloway face-off at each other.The script is a fantastic courtroom drama, the kind of movie I love where as an audience you get to participate because you want to solve the case as well. This proves tricky, because early on, you know who's the guilty party, but the momentum of the film is carried by trying to prove that fact. Made trickier, when your case involves the U.S. military, where terms like God, country and code make up their daily life.A consistently smart legal thriller, one that I continue to watch at least once every second week. Love that Tom Cruise wit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polished drama from Reiner.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Young upcoming Navy lawyer Daniel Kaffee is assigned to defend two Marines who are accused of murder. On first glance it seems to be a clear cut case of bullying gone wrong, but with Kaffee's colleague, Commander Joanne Galloway, convinced that more shady dealings are afoot at the Cuban army base run by Colonel Nathan Jessep, the case could have far reaching consequences for all involved.Directed by Rob Reiner and adapted from a hit Broadway play written by Aaron Sorkin, A Few Good Men is a quality drama boasting some of the 90s major A list stars. That it never quite reaches masterpiece status is purely down to the predictability of it all, from Kaffee's father inherent peer pressure, to Galloway's tough woman in power softening as each quarter roles on, we really do know what the film's outcome will be. However, it has to be said that it's one hell of a well written ride getting to the wonderful court room finale, military rules and codes are stripped bare by Sorkin and Reiner threads it all together perfectly to raise the bar in court room practices.The cast are uniformly good, Jack Nicholson as Jessep gets to eat babies and burn people at the stake, not literally you understand! But his ferocity is marvellous and it's this barnstorming turn from Jolly Jack that brings out the best of Tom Cruise as Kaffee. Cruise of course can play the cocky upstart better than most, but as we enter the final quarter here he puts a smart layer into the role, especially in light of Nicholson's scene chewing bravado. Demi Moore is solid and very watchable as Galloway, it's not her fault that the character is written as a tough nut who weakens the longer the picture goes on, it's still only a minor complaint in what is a very accomplished piece of cinema. Support is excellently good value courtesy of Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh and a deliciously grumpy turn from Kiefer Sutherland, while the editing and sound departments were rightly nominated for Academy awards.Good value entertainment across the board 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insight into how the military prosecute their personnel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as The General's Daughter is my favourite military criminal investigation film, A few good men is my favourite military courtroom drama film. It is also the only film I like that Tom Cruise has been in. I have to say, I'm not into his films at the moment, I do try my best not to be judgemental but can't help myself.The basic story is two Marines Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) and Downey (James Marshall)accidentally kill a fellow marine and it looks like they will go to jail for a very long time. The victim was not cut out to be a Marine and in fact, begged to be taken off the base he was stationed at. It isn't till Lt. Kaffee (Tom Cruise) and Lt. Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) from Jag and Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) from Internal Affairs are assigned the case and probe deeper into the murder that they find out that a code red was ordered by the superior officers and when it went wrong, they cut Dawson and Downey loose and covered up their involvement in the crime. The code red being ways Marines use to mold a inferior Marine into the type of soldier that is expected and one who also respects the code the Marines live by: Unit, corp, god and country.I just love the characters. Tom Cruise's character is very likable because he is a very cocky character and believes in himself but throughout the movie goes through a positive change where he comes to see the only reason he was given the case was that he wouldn't see the inside of a courtroom and decides he will try and get Dawson and Downey off. The audience also see him struggle to live up to his father's reputation but ends up realising that just because he is different from his father, it doesn't make him any less a great lawyer. I cheered when Kaffee finally stands up to Jessep and calls him a son of a bitch. My best part. I also like Demi Moore's character too because she is the only one who stands up for the two Marines and looks out for their interests.The film is filled with tension especially the scene at the end of the movie where Kaffee decides that he is going to ask Colonel Jessep (Jack Nicholson) if he ordered the code red. That scene more than any other has me on the edge of my seat, wondering if Kaffee will succeed. It just drags on and on and there is a moment when you think it will not happen and by the end of it, you can't help feeling that your stomach has been on this huge roller-coaster ride.It also has a serious message about how civilians can be judgemental about the armed forces and that they have never put their lives on the line like our military personnel who we owe a debt of gratitude for defending our country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I want Nathan Jessup defending us</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notwithstanding any fine acting or well written drama, I am always left with a bad taste in the mouth after viewing this movie. For me, the last moments has Tom Cruise observing the vacant courtroom with a "I finally defended a case &amp; won &amp; Dad would be proud" giving purpose to his life. And as viewers, we see the drama unfold through the eyes of the main character so instinctively, we side with him. But, as Jack Nicholson states, who would you want defending the borders? A weak link dies &amp; no doubt a strong link will replace him. One person dies but many are potentially saved. Its OK to kill during war (morally &amp; legally) but not in peace time. The courtroom may have won out but I will sleep better if Nathan Jessup types are protecting the borders doing whatever it takes to make it safer. The real let down in this drama is the portrayal of the legal side. They are honorable &amp; have righteousness. Anyone who has dealt with them in real life will know that this is a cartoonish version portrayal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tense, absorbing, well acted courtroom drama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Courtroom dramas are a favorite of mine and sometimes they work, sometimes not. A FEW GOOD MEN works, thanks to a fine script by Aaron Sorkin from his play, Rob Reiner's taut direction, and the extremely effective performances from a solid cast.Not surprisingly, in a role that is tailor-made for his talents, JACK NICOLSON almost walks off with the film. Not quite, but almost. At least, he's the one who makes the deepest impression as the extremely bigoted, controlling officer who is never at a loss for explosive and sarcastic comments. He doesn't have that many scenes in the film, but when he's on camera, the fireworks are the strongest--and you know that there will be a final confrontation for the wind-up that will have him and TOM CRUISE face to face in a shouting match.TOM CRUISE does well as the lawyer defending two young marines on a murder charge and DEMI MOORE is satisfactory as his assistant. But their performances never quite reach the degree of power that Nicholson's does, restricted as they are by less showy roles.Discovering the story behind the marine's murder and the facts surrounding that mystery is what holds audience interest from start to finish. Facts are revealed, little by little, and we know we're in for a final showdown between the rather callow young lawyer and the hardened marine officer with the chip on his shoulder. Compelling drama, well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I have seen and heard many comments about "A Few Good Men" extolling its virtues while some point to its negative attributes (which, by far, IMHO, are in the vast minority), the message this flick tries to deliver, at its most banal level, is truly one for the ages. Without going into any fine or even course details about the film - suffice it to say that it deals with a search for the absolute truth in a courtroom murder trial - the film to me triumphs in one very simple way: how corruption through power can always be quite successfully exposed and dealt with by the judicious application of human intellect and logic. I propose that it be required viewing for all power-hungry humans, especially in a "pecking-order" environment, like those pursuing a military, medical, or business career. In fact, I believe to be most effective, the number of times an individual is required to watch it should increase in a directly proportionate manner with that individual's promotion level and rate....And the truth will set you free!... but first, it'll tick you off!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly entertaining; this film delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very entertaining military courtroom drama. The script is packed with witty dialog. The film seems to have an all-star cast, but I suppose some of these actors came into their own after this film, such as Noah Wyle and Cuba Gooding Jr. The main cast, Cruise, Pollak, Moore, Bacon, and Nicholson all shine. Sure, there are a few plot holes, but all movies have them. The outrageous sexual harassment that Lt. Com. Galloway (Demi Moore) has to endure seems a bit over the top these days, post-Tailhook, full-political-correctness. Did women officers really have to deal with that? If so, I apologize on behalf of my sex. Anyway, it was smart of Sorkin and Reiner to have that as just a sort of background and never let the movie be about that. One more thing about Demi Moore. It was interesting that there was absolutely no romantic stuff at all between her character and Cruise's. There was some speculation that the part was originally written as a man. But even though Demi Moore at no time tried to make her character hot, she was totally hot. Everyone knows she is beautiful, but when I first saw this film and realized this, I came to see how special she really is. Grade: A Oh, and to the guy from London who can't stand "flag saluting, chest pounding bloody American rubbish," well, he's lucky he isn't writing that in German. You're welcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film stinks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I felt the script was very bad. Unrealistically verbose dialogue permeates. Much cringing by the viewer ensues, assuming the viewer is of normal intelligence. It's not a good deal.It's always hard to properly apportion blame in a film like this among script, acting, or directing. But it's pretty clear that some combination of all three were at work here.Amongst the performers, Demi Moore was particularly bad. Over-dramatic often, barely able to articulate some of her longer lines, she was notably substandard, in part because some of her lines were just kind of stupid. Tom Cruise, not a particularly great actor by any measure, was not particularly great here either, again with the script issue not helping. Even Nicholson appeared to have a little twinge of unnaturalness in the famous courtroom scene near the end. Ultimately, the director should have shot some of these scenes over again. But, in fairness, it would have been difficult to make a good film out of a script like this.The courtroom scenes are jarringly unrealistic, in terms of legal procedure. The judge character had some of the dumbest lines of the film. The courtroom scenes are so bad that they almost appear to be a parody of the many notably unrealistic courtroom scenes in Hollywood films throughout the years. Even if intended as parody, it still missed the mark, because it's not funny, intentionally or otherwise.The plot was totally dumb. I don't want to spoil anything, so I can't get into the details of the plot here, but it's just really dumb. Combined with the overly dramatic dialogue that no human would ever actually say, the film just seemed, all-in-all, like it was intended for an audience of children or stupid people.There is really nothing of much value here, and you should skip this film and use the 2 hours to watch a different movie. It does have some value however as a litmus test. Be wary of recommendations from those you know who claim that this is a good film, or even an acceptable one. There is nothing acceptable about garbage like this. I have enjoyed some of Reiner's other films. I can't believe this one has such a high rating here at IMDb. Yet another example of IMDb.com's ratings meaning nothing, at least some of the time. This film totally stinks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is a very nice film with great actor performances. However, if you go deep two issues don't make much sense.1. I don't think the issue of if the colonel ordered or did not order Santiago's transfer from Guatanamo base is that relevant. Obviously he did not order his transfer and lied about it. But what if he admitted that he did not order his transfer? It is not a crime. The only relevant issue is: did he order code red or not. Let's assume he did order his transfer along with a last day code red, this would not change the story of the film too much2. Even if the colonel ordered code red. This would still not be a major crime (a small crime). After all as we understand from the movie code red is common practice, it is a kind of punishment without the intent of significant harm. This real issue for intentional homicide is the presence or absence of poison. It is obvious from the movie that there was no poison, but this truth is not finalized at the court; the Dr. said yes about the poison and the court accepted his judgment. So if I was the judge the issue should be the poison and only the poison. Did the colonel order code red with poison? Or did the accused soldiers on their own decided to use poison with intent to kill. As mentioned, it is obvious from the movie that there was no poison and the Colonel did not know that Santiago was sick he wanted only to punish him and not to kill him. So I do not consider him a criminal even if he ordered code red. So for me the only real criminal in all of this is the Dr. who insisted on the presence of poison to protect himself at the expense of the two soldiers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Handling Honor and Truth...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinating exposition of Military Law and Jurisprudence. This is a film that easily rivals 12 ANGRY MEN in gravity and tone. I can count up to thirteen actors whose performances were riveting and memorable. Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson head a wonderfully diverse ensemble and go mano-a-mano in an unforgettable ending that casts their characters in sharp relief from one another. This is a thought-provoking and probing character study of men who represent the values of two different generations coming to loggerheads over the primacy of Honor, Truth and Duty to National Security.This is a tense, expertly graduated suspense thriller that raises questions about good and evil and the consequences of human choice and judgment. Despite Nicholson's swaggering and roaring and declaiming he does not come across entirely as a spawn of the devil any more than Cruise comes across as the spotless Knight in Shining Armor. It becomes clear how the careers of both men hinge on a practice and decision that went South when countless times before it had went North and proved to be an aid albeit questionable in building the character of newly recruited marines.I was reminded of the film 'IMITATION OF LIFE'. How Juanita Moore and Lana Turner banded together as working women to make a go of Life. Each one prioritized their values slightly differently. Juanita Moore raising a young daughter placed the value of family before any personal concerns and Lana Turner did the exact opposite, putting her career as an actress first and subordinating her duties to her daughter to this overarching goal. The permutations of consequences that evolved and to some extent devolved from this were poignant to observe and experience.The situation is similar for Kaffee and Jessup here, with the difference being that here the drama takes place in the almost exclusively masculine domain of the Unites States Marine Corps. But the entire piece revolves around the concept of 'judgement call' rather than men with designs of evil intent pitted against men of sterling virtue. This is an adult story where a spectrum of reality is presented rather than a tale of black and white that resolves neatly into easy answers.This brings me, as ultimately it must, to the final encounter between Kaffee and Jessup, where Nicholson utters the line that ranks with Brando's "- I coulda been a contender -". I don't think I have ever heard a speech in the cinema that has made me reflect upon how the consequences of character and action relate to fate as much as this speech has over the years. You know Kaffee is in the right and yet there is something compelling and perversely logical about Jessup's point of view. He demonstrates a profound self awareness of the exact nature of the forces that have warped and rubber stamped him into the misogynistic, anti-Semitic, fascist he has become. There is a depth of feeling or passion to his tirade and the sense of a person caring deeply about something to an ultimate fault, that quite frankly makes Kaffee's character seem at times shallow and self serving by comparison.Kaffee wins the minds of the ladies and gentlemen of the court and jury, but in Jessup's admission of guilt he steals pieces of their heart and anyone else who has sacrificed in error to the call of duty.</fullReview>

Special nod to Wolfgang Bodeson who was a location scout on the film and was chosen by director Rob Reiner to play one of the defendants. He mostly sits and looks mad but when he does speak, he is incredibly real, especially for a non-actor! Several of the cast members look familiar and are in some of their earliest career appearances.

		<shortDescription>A Few Good Men (1992)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Few Good Men was part of a trend of stylish courtroom dramas made in the 1990's. What sets it apart is the setting of a military court and an incident involving U.S. Marines stationed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. PFC William Santiago (Michael D. Lorenzo) is an outsider at his assignment as an infantryman. He writes letters begging for a transfer and a last letter to the NCIS Office promising information about an illegal fence line shooting into Cuba catches the attention of high ranking officers: Col. Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson), commander of the Marines in Guantanamo; Lt. Col. Matthew Markinson (J.T. Walsh), Guantanamo Marines' base executive officer; and Santiago's platoon leader 1st Lt. Jonathan Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland)), all USMC. Jessup orders Santiago to be disciplined. L. Cpl. Harold Dawson, Santiago's squad leader, and PFC. Louden Downey are the ones to institute the discipline. They pull Santiago from his barracks room at night and put a gag in his mouth with the intention of shaving his head. Santiago, however, asphyxiates as a result of ketoacidosis. Lt. JG. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) and Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak), both USN, are appointed lead and co-counsel respectively. Kaffee sees this case as an easy opportunity for career advancement. Kaffee meets Lt. Cmdr. Jo Galloway (Demi Moore), also a lawyer and legal investigator, who travels with Kaffee and Weinberg to interview Jessup, Markinson and Kendrick. Their efforts to collect information is met with latent but polite hostility. Kaffee also learns from Galloway about the practice of "code reds," a tradition of enlisted men physically disciplining each other, synonymous with hazing. This causes Kaffee and Weinberg to have reservations about the case they've been handed. It becomes even more tense, when Kaffee and Weinberg are offered a plea bargain by Capt. Jack Ross, the Marine Corps prosecutor, which includes a reduced sentence and charge for their clients, otherwise they'll be charged with murder. As the case unfolds, Kaffee, Weinberg and Galloway are embroiled in the concealment and cover up involving Santiago's death. Kaffee is caught between ambition, guilt, and trying to live up to his father's legacy as a former US Attorney General.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent courtroom drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of better Tom Cruise movies ever made and an excellent movie for Jack Nicholson as well. A story about what it means to follow orders, what can be justified in the name of defending one's country and the laws of beasts lurking within us.This movie has entered our cultural subconsciousness because of its speeches. We cannot handle the truth, indeed. And those speeches are truly great. Whenever the movie is in the courtroom and either Cruise or Nicholson says something aloud, the movie is beyond captivating. My full respect to both of them for their performances and to the writers for their poetry.Yet those courtroom scenes are almost too good. Because the rest of the scenes simply do not match up. They seem almost banal in comparison. There's nothing outright wrong with them, but I have a hard time remembering what happened in them. I could almost quote the courtroom scenes word for word, but I'm less certain how Cruise even got pulled into this whole mess in the first place. Something about a grudge or proving himself to someone... or something.That doesn't ruin the film, however. Let's make that clear. The rest of the scenes are fine, they keep the plot going, the supporting characters are interesting enough and the technical aspects of the film are just great. It's merely the difference of it being an above average film with great aspects, and it being an all-around great film. Now it's the former, though it had the potential of being the latter.See A Few Good Men, if you haven't already, if you have a thing for great performances and/or courtroom dramas. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent film with great performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read some of the bad reviews for this movie and the hardcore, military reviewers pointing out the little mistakes and saying, "this could never happen" or "this was way over the top". To that I say, it's a movie! Sure there are going to be factual errors but sometimes things have to be done for effect and to get a rise out of the audience. This is not a movie that claims to be based on a true story. The final courtroom scene that has become so iconic may be over the top and have mistakes but I guarantee you will stay glued to your seat. On top of that, Nicholson's lines have become a part of pop culture so obviously something was done right with Aaron Sorkin's script. I like Tom Cruise in movies like this and while he's not an Academy Award winner, he does a good job in this and definitely holds his own against Nicholson in the final scene. I like the other supporting actors such as Demi Moore, whose character doesn't try to take over the movie but adds just enough. Kevin Pollack only has a few lines but as usual, he does a great job and delivers some funny lines. Kiefer Sutherland is awesome in his role and in the scenes he goes up against Cruise, you really believe the two don't like each other. Wolfgang Bodison, who plays Dawson, wasn't even up for the role and was an assistant to Rob Reiner on the movie but Reiner decided he "looked" like a marine and had him audition. His performance is incredible. In my opinion, you don't go into movies like this trying to dissect all the little things that aren't quite correct. You go into it to be entertained. This is one of those movies that whenever it is on, I watch it. (I once watched it 5 days in a row and was entertained every time). If you haven't seen it, rent it and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very good performances in a memorable movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Greetings from Lithuania.You can safely call "A Few Good Men" a true cult movie. It's a very memorable movie because of great performances, very solid script, and some unforgettable speeches and quotes (with "You can't handle the truth" coming first in to the mind when remembering this picture). It's has interesting story and basically it's a court room and procedure drama. What standout here and makes this movie some sort of classic is great performances by probably all involved (especialy by leads), some terrific lines and scenes. NOt everything here works, but it's a solid movie.Overall, 8/10 for "A Few Good Men", if you haven't seen it, you can safely check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After a Marine's hazing ends in his death, the two men accused with murdering the soldier must put their hopes in lawyer Daniel Kaffee</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the eyes of the public, a United States Marine is the embodiment of toughness and physical prowess. They are disciplined, code-oriented, and courageous. But what happens when a Marine is not up to par with the others physically, and he wants to transfer to another base? According to Colonel Nathan Jessup (Nicholson), he needs to be "trained", which, in Jessup's mind, is hazing. This is the case with PFC William Santiago, a young Marine who repeatedly applied for a transfer because of his being bullied and tormented. During his "training," Santiago died from a towel being shoved down his throat, and the two men have been arrested. The fate of these two men, who were just following orders, must be decided soon. Enter Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee (Cruise), a young and ultra-confident lawyer 9 months out of law school. He was assigned as the lead counselor in the case, in front of Commander Joanne Galloway (Moore). Just as Kaffee is wild and energetic, Galloway is serious and does her work with the rule book in hand. After meeting with the two Marines in custody, LCpl. Harold Dawson and Pvt. Louden Downey, Kaffee can already tell that this will be a tough case. With Jessup claiming that he never ordered the hazing, there is no evidence that Dawson and Downey were ordered. All of this has set the stage for the showdown behind the facade of a murder trial.I had seen this movie once before, about 6 months ago. On my first viewing, I thought it was relatively slow, and the climax came too late. However, this time around, I found it generally well-paced, and Jack Nicholson's performance stood out more as well. The key to watching this movie is to stick with it. Put down the laptop, put your phone on silent, and avoid any other distractions, because they will take away from how the film plays. Nominated for 4 Oscars (Picture, Film Editing, Sound, and Best Supporting for Nicholson), the Academy agrees that this is a film worth paying attention to. The movie's director, Rob Reiner, has possibly one of the most diverse and well-rounded directorial careers to date; in the director's chair for such films as The Princess Bride, Misery, When Harry Met Sally, and Stand By Me. His work on this film is no different, and to me it is definitely one of his best works behind the camera. Jack Nicholson. He is the most Oscar-nominated actor in film history (12 times), and he still holds a presence in our society today. Winning Academy Awards for One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest, As Good As It Gets, and Terms of Endearment, Nicholson is tied for most wins for a male nominee. He turned in one of his signature performances in this film, and his monologue is legendary. I leave you with my one negative remark about this film. I have never been a fan of Tom Cruise, and I doubt I ever will. I would say that his performances while playing a jock or a hot-shot are great, but he plays it in every movie I've seen him in. In this movie, his attempts to be passionate come off as a brat who only cares about what he wants. Had it not been for Nicholson's screen- time in the courtroom, the film's most famous scene would have failed miserably. I had to take off a point because of Tom Cruise, but I have to. As the lead in the story, it is hard for me to look past him and not let him influence my views.www.sportsandcelluloid.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't handle the truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Getting somebody to spit out the truth has been proved to be a challenge in Rob Reiner's "A Few Good Men." This is a political and law thriller that stretches beyond typical boundaries with regards to debriefing a case, but isn't gritty enough to wow you and move you. What "A Few Good Men" excels at is testing your ability to form a conclusion and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin delivers a fine script with one of cinemas most famous lines; "you can't handle the truth!" LT Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), a Navy lawyer who has never seen the inside of the courtroom, defends two stubborn Marines who have been accused of murdering a colleague. Cmdr. Galloway (Demi Moore) represents him. Also on the legal staff is LTJG Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak). The team rounds up many facts and Kaffee is discovering that he is really cut out for trial work. The defense is originally based upon the fact that PFC Santiago, the victim, was given a "CODE RED". In Cuba, Col. Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson) and two senior officers try to give all the help they can, but Kaffee knows something's fishy. In the conclusion of the film, the fireworks are set off by a confrontation between Jessup and Kaffee. This is perhaps the finest example of a courtroom thriller that really tests the mind to discover the truth behind this military crime case, rather than confuse you or just put a bunch of facts in your face to just watch. Tom Cruise transforms beautifully as a clueless law man who becomes obsessed with finding the truth behind a case. This is Cruises most militant performance. Demi Moore is very irritating in this film by not showing much energy in her performance and not having chemistry with Cruise. Jack Nicholson is gritty and dark and by far the most daring performance in this clean film. What director Rob Reiner shines at is making you one of the investigators in this case and really allows mystery to come in contact with character development and social themes such as corruption. A fine job of directing by Reiner. Aaron Sorkin needed more grit and more darkness in this story since it falls kinda clean and innocent with a happy ending. I would have liked a more dark and mysterious film with an ending that leaves you open to your own interpretation. Nonetheless, Sorkin creates a solid story that's fun to discover. The law can be a risky business to get into, especially when in relation to high-ranking military officials. This is a terrific representation of determination, new changes and honesty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson steals the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two Marines Downey and Dawson are accused of murdering fellow marine Santiago in Guantanamo Bay. Santiago had been pushing for a transfer and was willing to snitch on Dawson. Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) suspects it's a 'Code Red' and wants the case. She's all passions but no streets smarts. The case is given to LT Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) who settles all his cases in plea bargains. Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) is forced into being the co-counsel. Col. Nathan Jessup (Jack Nicholson) is the commander of the base and is up for bigger appointment. Lt. Col. Matthew Markinson (J.T. Walsh) wanted to transfer the troublesome Santiago. However Jessup had other ideas and directed Lt. Jonathan Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland) to push harder. Capt. Jack Ross (Kevin Bacon) is the prosecuting attorney.Great actors with great writing is going to give great scenes. Jack Nicholson literally crackles with energy. Tom Cruise was the perfect brash young turk at that time. That courtroom scene has gone down in movie history. First there is the amazing writing from Aaron Sorkin. It's like music when it's done right. Jack Nicholson knows how to do it right. He steals the movie. Director Rob Reiner keeps the story pretty simple. There isn't really any truly shocking surprises or reveals. It's not very twisty for a courtroom drama. The characters are played very straight with obvious bad guys. That is its main weakness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever since its release, whenever "A Few Good Men" is referenced (be it the evening news, interviews, what-have-you), it's that little third act exchange between Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson that's always shown: "You want answers?""I WANT THE TRUTH!""YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!"So I was genuinely surprised at just how restrained this movie is, save for its bubbling undercurrent of menace while we get to the bottom of the crime in question. "A Few Good Men" is a finely-crafted story, featuring unbelievably good trademark Sorkin dialogue. It boasts one hell of a great cast, with two grade-A performances from Cruise and Nicholson. Cruise is playing the cocky jackass again, but unlike "Days of Thunder", there's characterization here; something to grab onto. And Nicholson, though his character is a pompous ass, commands the screen. His is quite a presence. And that last line ("You don't need to wear a patch on your arm to have honor"), man, what a heartfelt ending. 8.5/10</fullReview>

Many of his movies are classics that can be watched over and over again.

		<shortDescription>Seeing different Tom and Jack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can you image what is going to be like that Tom Cruise performs a non-fighting or non-agent movie, seems kind of boring right? Many people go to Tom due to his tensive mission movie. Sometimes you cannot just miss a couple of seconds. However out of my imagine, it looks good to have Tom in this movie, I mean he didn't screw it at all. This seeming like careless and casual young lawyer just suits here. On the other side it's Jack, who is already an old man here plays a sophisticated general. It is also different with his other roles. In this movie he needs to be decent and serious as well as ruthless and arrogant. And his personality expressed going through the whole movie is so important that it decides the fate of this movie. Fortunately he kind of made it, although in my opinion he should give us more clue about his arrogance earlier.Actually at the beginning Tom is really a careless and casual lawyer, easy to compromise, kind of coward. But our leading actress functions, which makes a man be man. The whole story is so simple talking about how three powerless army lawyer beat the corrupt and lawless military. The end is actually sort of dramatic, I still don't believe a experienced general like Jack can be stupid like that. Anyway if you are either a Tom Cruise or Jack Nicholson fan, go ahead it's not gonna waste your time.</fullReview>

This movie was so memorable that I forgot the name of the movie we went to see that night, but vividly remember the stellar performance by Tom Cruise as Lt. Daniel Caffee.There has been other notable court room dramas such as "The Anatomy of Murder" or the "Twelve Angry Men", but none had as much fire as this movie.The brilliance was Tom Cruise's performance as the defending lawyer. It sure blows away Jimmy Stewart, or Henry Fonda in the Anatomy... or Twelve angry.. That's saying a lot considering the company this movie is in.Jack Nicholson's phrase "You can't handle the truth" became part of the American clich that's still with us today.I never seen Tom Cruise or Demi Moore look so good on screen. The movie was shot perfectly with not a wasted scene in the entire movie ( maybe with the exception of the part Jessup ranting macho BS to disband the troops at Guantanamo and ordering Keefer Sutherland to notify the president ).Exciting court room drama that perhaps can only be made in America where people can be so direct, and follow their belief system. A classic that stands on its own.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rob Reiner directs this exciting courtroom drama about a PFC Santiago, who was mysteriously murdered in his barracks. Navy lawyer Daniel Kafee(played by Tom Cruise) is assigned to defend the two marines accused with the crime. The evidence seems overwhelming against them, but instead of a plea bargain, he charges ahead and interviews their commanding offer, Col. Nathan R. Jessup(Jack Nicholson, superb) who is a supremely confident, even arrogant man who insists he knew nothing about it, but also admits that Santiago was an inferior marine. When Kafee learns about a "code red", which is an order for private discipline, he confronts Jessup in a memorable courtroom showdown.Exciting and very well-acted drama presents a powerful story about personal responsibility vs. duty to one's country, and how pride can cometh before the fall. "You can't handle the truth!" has passed into movie quote legend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A better understanding of the code of honor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is especially easy to find excuse for perceiving political elements in the movie "A Few Good Men"; reviewers jump at the chance. Those quick to approve of a basically US Military bashing screenplay will say such as "There is a code by which a good Marine must live and die, and it is: Unit, Corps, God, Country. But to be valid, that code must also include truth and justice; and if they are not present, can the code stand?" Exposed in this perception is more than an acceptance of an anti-Military stance agreeing with the underlying intent of the screenwriters and director. The perception also admits either no understanding of a concept of God, or an intentional degradation of that also. If a code of Honor includes God, it automatically includes a commitment to truth and justice. This assumes the concept of a God doesn't innately include a doctrine of lying as a core tenet. So, a dismissal of US Marines as somehow deficient of strong commitment to truth and justice is a deficient review.Further, the movie rightfully portrays a commanding Officer giving an illegal order as adhering to the code by freely admitting his order, although believing it correct and above the written law, even to his own destruction. However, the movie shows its anti-American, anti-US Military bias by having two instances of Marines following the Code intentionally deciding to lie. First, we have the prosecuting Officer intentionally mislead the process of justice by lying to undermine a valid point made by the defense. Second, we have a highly committed (to the Code) Marine Officer lying on the stand as to not giving a direct order to two enlisted Men to engage in a "Code Red."Careful thought allows that this type of distortion and contradiction of any Code of Honor in our highly Honorable Military is a slick attack on America. Men are not perfect. Men will be in error. However, this was not the central issue of the film. The central issue of this film was to portray a system of honor long cherished and established, based in God, as lacking the very foundation of wisdom endowed by our fathers. Thankfully, the film does portray an epiphany of personal responsibility also inherent in the Code, that of the enlisted men actually having to realize their own betrayal of the personal strength demanded in the Code. This is why it gets a 6, instead of a 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid, if not original, courtroom drama, served by impeccable acting, directing and writing ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From a decade rich in courtroom dramas, Rob Reiner's "A Few Good Men" stands as one of the most memorable. Should all the credit go to the iconic "You can't handle the truth!" delivered with fierce confidence by Jack Nicholson? After all, the quote is so full of meanings that anyone could have had the opportunity to use it in real life. But I believe it takes more than one line to stand the test of time, so let's examine what "A Few Good Men" offers.The film itself is a composite of many archetypes of the courtroom dramas and to be fair, it doesn't bring anything revolutionary to the genre. It has an all-star cast with the same 'commercial' aspirations as Stanley Kramer's "Judgement at Nuremberg": Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, even the 'lesser' actors give more than 'standards' performances: J.T. Walsh, Kevin Pollack, Christopher Guest and a young Cuba Gooding Jr., to conclude on the acting department, even the two accused Marines were played by dbutant actors, and could incorporate in their eyes, their voice and their body language the 'innocence' of men blinded by the Marines' code to the limit of psychosis.The two Marines, Lance Corporal Dawson and Private Dooney, from the Guantanamo Bay Base, are accused of having murdered a fellow Marine named Santiago, notorious for being a 'black sheep', and to make it worse, who was about to divulge some embarrassing secrets about a military mishap. They didn't want to kill the him, they only obeyed to a 'Code Red' order, a charming euphemism defining the extra-judicial punishment Marines give to each other, just like the 'soap in blanket' treatment in "Full Metal Jacket". This one had tragic consequences since the private died of poisoning, and those who ordered the 'Code Red', Lieutenant Kendrick (Sutherland), himself obeying to an order from Colonel Nathan Jessup (Nicholson) denied all responsibilities. Their malevolent involvement is obvious but naturally, Jessup is a politically influent, thus untouchable, much more, he will not tolerate any tarnishing of the Marine Corps' prestige. And the case is so touchy that the defense is assigned to a young unexperienced lawyer from the Navy, Lieutenant Kaffee, played by Tom Cruise. Kaffee is another typical figure of the courtroom films, the lone rider ? la Frank Galvin, Paul Newman in "The Verdict" or Al Pacino in "? And Justice for All", who embodies the 'David against Goliath' fight, when Goliath is a big and powerful institution. And as usual, Tom starts as a cocky and obnoxious character to better redeem himself at the end, when he realizes that the scope of the trial exceed his limitations. He's seconded by a Lieutenant JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) and Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollack). Naturally, Tom Cruise and Demi Moore's looks are so distracting, that we'd all expect a romantic subplot to bloom at any moment. Thankfully, the screenplay is thick enough not to be polluted by useless conventions, although I do wonder if it was that realistic that they never flirted? Anyway, we have a powerful cast, a terrific script, a character's arc following the coming-of- age structure, the young boy who'll try to get off the shadow of his father's legend, and we have the 'David' vs. Goliath, although this time, the fight is even more meaningful since it questions the excesses of the Marines' Code. I mentioned "Full Metal Jacket", well, Jessup is a 'villain' ? la Gunnery Hartman, one who believes that a Marine is such a sacred figure that no one should interfere with it, an order is an order, anyone who's not with his unit, is against it, and Nicholson is so good he might even convince us. The film puts in perspectives such words like 'honor' and weighs them enough to prove that they are not abstractions, and even honor can end where fanaticism starts. On that level, it reminds of another exemplary military trial film "The Caine Mutiny". Here, a a disobedience would have spared a life, this is how intelligent and thought-provoking Aaron Sorkin's script is. "A Few Good Men" is a really well-made, well-acted, well-scripted film that ends with a powerful conclusion even more because it comes from the accused Corporal Dawson himself, and the directing is so subtle that at that time, you can see the reaction on Pollak's face, and if you have seen the film and remembered what he said about the Marines, you can guess his exact thought. And Tom Cruise delivers one of his finest performances along with Jack Nicholson, who's never exuded such a scary aura of authority. The kind of nut that you think would be hard to crack if it's not for a magnificent display of perseverance, and a desperate quest for justice, at any cost, even the job. That's also honor, risking losing everything for our beliefs, for the same reason Dawson refused to plea guilty and compromise himself, at the end he and Kaffee are in the same wavelength.There was one flaw though Roger Ebert noticed about the script: why the director included a scene where Cruise told exactly how he would tease Jessup to provoke the climactic confession. I agree it does deprive the film from a sort of 'surprise' effect but if it's not brave, it's not unrealistic either. Cruise's tactic was to awake Jessup's darker side and let him be the architect of his own demise, just like Captain Queeg in "The Caine Mutiny", and that's what contributes to one of the most delightful ironies of the film: "A Few Good Men" is build on a series of misleads, twists and manipulations, and at the end, flirting but never reaching the 'Deus ex Machina', the villain perishes by his own sword.The film is so well-written I didn't think at any second the exchange was unrealistic, and seriously, why dismiss the only bit of originality the film ever had?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've always been searching for such movies, to imitate in my real life, I think this movie is one of them. If I want to praise this movie that would be for the sense of reality in the movie and the cast appearances. Tom Cruse and Demi Moore were in the best synchronization, more or less their way of acting are monotonous in every film but in this movie they were in the harmony. For a great thing to happen it requires a series of desired chain event and I saw that in this movie. Plot is based upon two lawyers who are trying to defend two soldiers from Cubian base camp accused of murdering their fellow batch mate and how ups and down in the hearing trail leads to the conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is the Truth......Handle It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It must be very frustrating to work with Jack Nicholson. In your heart--you must know--the best you can hope for, is second best. He is a sort of freak of nature. His acting is predictable. Its always GREAT. And...once again in A Few Good Men...he makes it all look so easy. A Few Good Men is not an average movie. It is much more than just a court room drama --it is also about honor, courage, character, and moral fortitude. It is intelligently directed by Rob Reiner. Performances by Kiefer Sutherland (who finds it second nature to be sinister) and the wonderful J.T. Walsh add even more acting polish.The way Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) breaks down the self-assured Col. Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson) in a gripping finale --is pricelessIt is well written and will stay with you---longer than you may--imagine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review Of "A Few Good Men"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Few Good Men" is a 1992 courtroom drama film Directed by Rob Reiner and starring Tom Cruise. The story follows a young lawyer's plight to defend two marines accused of murder. Now I know just about everyone's heard of this film. If they haven't, they've at least heard of the line, "You can't handle the truth!" That line is just a snippet of the greatness that is weaved into this film. Starting off on a related note, the script is fantastic. Aaron Sorkin strikes again with his rapier wit and compelling dialogue. The story is a very compelling look at the military definitions of honor and loyalty and how they can sometimes become misinterpreted. Some of the lines in this film are also spectacularly memorable. However, while the screenplay is decidedly impressive, the most imposing aspect of this film is the performances within it. Every single actor in this film brought their best to the table, and it's because of the unbelievably captivating performance from Jack Nicholson that everyone else raised their bars. Nicholson's really only in this film for about 10 or 15 minutes, but man does he make those minutes count with his caustic and snide portrayal of Colonel Nathan R. Jessup. Again, it's his performance that caused everyone else in this film to bring their a- games, and holy crap did they. Tom Cruise, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh, Kiefer Sutherland, Demi Moore, all did unbelievable jobs with their respective characters. Even Wolfgang Bodison, a stagehand who had never acted before in his life, did a really beautiful job with his role. The aforementioned fact is a real testament to the seemingly limitless talent of Rob Reiner. After watching the special features of the film, you really get a good idea that Reiner forged an effective relationship with his actors and offered some acting tips of his own for their performances. Because this is such a character driven story, Reiner made a great choice in offering some of his own acting expertise to his cast. Overall, I felt that "A Few Good Men" was a really masterfully directed, beautifully written, unforgettably performed coatroom drama that is sure to impress anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The best courtroom dramas are not simply cases of justice being served against all odds. The best courtroom dramas also say something much wider about the nature of freedom or some other social issue. The innocent and the guilty are representatives for types of people. That's the theory at least. A Few Good Men takes on the military courts to explore the kind of ideas that are normally the reserve of war movies. It's almost a matter of course that courtroom dramas will be filled with impassioned speeches and grandiose statements, and as such they are fertile ground for the trite and the corny. The screenplay, adapted by Aaron Sorkin and William Goldman from Sorkin's play contains its fair share of clichd lines, such as Demi Moore saying she thinks a lot of marines because "they stand on a wall and say 'nothing's gonna happen to you'". Tom Cruise's amateurism ("So this is what a courtroom looks like") doesn't quite convince, and isn't as endearing as Sorkin seems to think it is. Still, structure-wise you can't fault A Few Good Men ? three-dimensional characters, an even-handed approach, a natural progression and some great moments of truth and poignancy.The director here is Rob Reiner, a versatile filmmaker albeit never an outstanding one. For this movie he directs with pace and attack, often having characters walk as they talk. He reduces certain key scenes (the code red, the suicide) to a series of hand and foot close-ups to give them a certain stylised impact. For the dialogue scenes the focus is always on the faces, and he takes a simple yet effective approach of alternating between very plain-looking mid-shots and close-ups as the intensity rises and falls. But I can't help feeling sometimes that Reiner lacked competence ? sometimes the shots just don't seem to add up properly. At the end of the scene where Cruise and Kevin Pollak discuss the trial while Pollak walks his baby, as a parting shot Cruise reveals what he has heard about Kendrick. He appears to be a good thirty feet away but he's still speaking at a conversational level. That looks wrong and it's distracting.The role of Daniel Kaffee is one that the young Tom Cruise is completely suited too, and that is half the problem, as Cruise has this tendency to grab the characters a little too firmly. He does a fair job of making Kaffee likable, but all-in-all it's a hideous bit of overacting. Showing him how it's done is a sublime Jack Nicholson. Nicholson is a bit of ham himself, but he knows how to do it with such commanding presence you don't notice how over-the-top he's being. When he belittles Cruise, the supreme stature and confidence Nicholson had by this point in his life really pays off, and he makes the audience squirm along with Cruise. A very honourable mention must go to non-professional Wolfgang Bodison as Dawson. Bodison gives a flawless performance, powerful and moving, and as a figure upon whom so much of the picture's humanity turns, the quality of his performance is integral.And it's things like this that make A Few Good Men work. It may have flaws in some pretty big areas, but in the places where it really matters it pulls together. And really, it's the fact that this isn't a simple case of the guilt or innocence of a few individuals but a story about the nature of honour and obedience in military that gives it a greater resonance. This allows for a few choice lines of dialogue to shine over the clichs, the strong performances to overrule the scenery-chewing. As a whole movie A Few Good Men is greater than the sum of its parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the heart of the nation's capital, in a courthouse of the U.S government one man will stop at nothing to keep his honor and one man will stop at nothing in finding the truth.At the U.S Naval base at Guantanamo Bay Cuba there has been a murder. Pfc Santiago is announced dead and the cause of death noted as Lactic Acidosis. Lance Cpl Harold Dawson and Pfc Louden Downey are being tried for the murder and if found guilty will be dishonorably discharged with certain jail time. Their seem to be something out of place about all of this and Lt Cdr JoAnne Galloway sense something foul and wishes to represent the accused herself at the courtroom. Respectfully denying her request Lt Daniel Kaffe a U.S Navy Lawyer is handed over the case. Lt.Kaffe who has no previous courtroom experience is an overconfident Harvard Law school graduate who has a brilliant track record of his career of nine months! Little is he aware that by accepting this case he would be going up against a man who is confident of himself as he is. A man who has his breakfast daily just 300 yards from 3000 Cubans who are trained to kill him. Introducing Col Nathan Jessep!The testosterone levels are off the charts in A FEW GOOD MEN. Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollack, Cuba Gooding Jr, Keifer Sutherland and the rose amongst the thorns, the beauty amongst the beasts ; Demi Moore. Mr. Rob Reiner and the casting department are on their games and have the horse by its reins and are in full control of this mean machine overflowing with talent. Without even a moment's hesitation I am rating this one a thumping 4 Stars! Why not 5? I would like believe the best of the best is yet to come. You need to watch the best to know the greats when they arrive. If by some chance you have not watched this; head out right now to the nearest video store and grab yourself a Blu Ray/DVD.Wolfgang Bodison, James Marshall and Kiefer Sutherland had me at GO. I have watched Kiefer Sutherlands hit TV show 24 and I am a huge fan. I believe he is even better in FEW GOOD MEN. Their performance as U.S Marines is powerful and hard that I was taken a back and every appearance they made had my respect. Tom Cruise on the other hand is supposed to come off as this cool newbie who is too smart for his own shoes and he sure does come through with it well. There is a careful development in his character that he plays very wisely. He comes from a Harvard college boy to being Lt. Daniel Kaffee who goes head to head with the heavy weight Col Nathan Jessep. This character development is where the inspiration of the movie is to me. How anyone can become anyone they want to be if they put their heart into it. Jack Nicholson is my man of the hour. Actors like Jack Nicholson, Anthony Hopkins, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino are players that you can fearlessly throw in front of a camera and they will get nods from the whole world. I am yet to see that in any other actor of today. Can you name one other? Coming back to Jack Nicholson, he truly lived up to a Colonel who commands the U.S Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay. The best is yet to come. The whole movie that is intense all the 2 hours through explodes out of the screens when Col Nathan Jessep is taken on head to head by Lt Daniel Kaffee. This is Lt Daniel Kaffees first courtroom experience and he is taking on the scariest man who walks Guantanamo Bay! The outcome? The outcome is magical; it's whimsical, brilliant and magnificent. Need I say more?This is how I see it nothing more nothing lessTitle: Few Good Men Directed by: Rob Reiner Starring: Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland Rated: R for Language Rating: 08/10 138 Minutes</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All cynicism aside - other than a preachy ending and a not very convincing love angle, which, thankfully, is not taken very far, there's little to dislike here. The script is superb, one of the best courtroom dramas ever written, and Sidney Lumet could have done wonders with it, but it's in equally good hands with Rob Reiner - it's Reiner's last great film, and his only solid attempt at a straight drama. Reiner's skill is easily seen in the performances he drags out of his actors, both leads and small roles - A Few Good Men boasts a list of big-name decent actors, none of which is very versatile, but all are casted to perfection and do wonders with their parts: Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Pollack, J.T. Walsh, James Marshall (of Twin Peaks fame), Christopher Guest - all deliver perfectly. Also worthy of mention are as-of-yet unknown Noah Wyle and Cuba Gooding Jr.Then there's Jack Nicholson, whose role can be likened to that of Anthony Hopkins in Silence for the Lambs - with barely 15 minutes of actual screen time, he completely steals the show from everybody else. Nicholson gives a powerhouse of a performance, that renders the rest of the cast useless and pale. His scenes alone are reason enough to watch it - even if you despise courtroom dramas as a whole, and find the rest of the film utterly boring despite its slick and intelligent dialog and passionate, realistic acting, these few short minutes make A Few Good Men a cinema classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprise Of A Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this dramatic courtroom thriller, Lt. Daniel Kaffee, a Navy lawyer who has never seen the inside of the courtroom, defends two stubborn Marines who have been accused of murdering a colleague. Kaffee is known as being lazy and had arranged for a plea bargain. Downey's Aunt Ginny appoints Cmdr. Galloway to represent him. Also on the legal staff is Lt. Sam Weinberg. The team rounds up many facts and Kaffee is discovering that he is really cut out for trial work. The defense is originally based upon the fact that PFC Santiago, the victim, was given a "CODE RED". Santiago was basically a screw-up. At Gitmo, screw-ups aren't tolerated. Especially by Col. Nathan Jessup. In Cuba, Jessup and two senior officers try to give all the help they can, but Kaffee knows something's fishy. In the conclusion of the film, the fireworks are set off by a confrontation between Jessup and Kaffee.I Admit The Only Reason I Saw This Was Because I Discovered The Recommendations List And This Came Up Because I Liked "Mississippi Burning". I Decided To Give This A Go With An Open Mind Because Usually I HATE Tom Cruise But In This Film He Pulled Off A Descent Performance. However The Best Performance Was From Jack Nicholson. He Played The Perfect @sshole And Did It Very Convincingly.This Is Also A Movie That DRIPS With Conflict Against The Protagonists. To Explain To Get Nicholson On The Stand And It Failing Would Get Cruise A Court Marshall, The Only Evidence They Had Defending The 2 Marines Were Their Own Opinions (And The Last I Heard That Wouldn't Qualify In ANY Court Of Law And I Am The Farthest From Being A Lawyer As Anyone).Overall I Was Really Surprised With This Film And I Also Recommend This Film To Almost Anyone Because Usually I Hate These Sorts Of Movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over recent years there has been a lack of really good court room dramas. There is nothing more inspiring than seeing the underdog inexperienced lawyer win the war of words with the Fat Cat Barrister. Although A few good men is not set in a conventional court it ticks all the boxes above. Tom Cruise looks about 12 in this movie yet he plays then role of Lt Daniel Kaffee really well. Demi Moore is not quite as convincing but the star of the show is without doubt , Jack Nicholson. He's cocky , short tempered portrayal of Col. Nathan R. Jessep is fantastic and he's not even on screen for very long. It's interesting looking at this nearly twenty years after i last saw it and the the fact that is is set in Guantanamo Bay considering what has gone on there in the last 8 years. This also stars one of the most underrated yet prolific actors of the last 50 years and that is J.T.Walsh. A few good men , stands the test of time and is still pretty good all these years later.</fullReview>

The movie doesn't really say anything nice about marine life, especially when our murdered soldier was unable to adjust to it, due to health concerns. There are some very terrible cover-ups made in the course of a soldier who should have been transferred to begin with.Jack Nicholson, as always, steals the picture with a terrific supporting Oscar nominated performance, as an over-the-top colonel, who is in the thick of the situation. Arrogant beyond belief, Nicholson is absolutely mesmerizing in the scenes that he appears in.Demi Moore, as Cruise's boss, adds plenty to the fireworks of the film as well.

		<fullReview>A young, inexperienced Navy lawyer is charged with defending two Marines accused of murder. The story is contrived but it's also quite entertaining, thanks to an engaging script by Sorkin (adapting his own play) that crackles with good dialog, including the famous exchange between Nicholson and Cruise in the courtroom scene. Cruise is surprisingly effective as the cocky young lawyer. Nicholson is ideally cast as the macho general who disdains punks like Cruise (and who doesn't?). Moore holds her own against the two male stars. The supporting cast is solid, including the two young actors playing the accused. Reiner's direction has rarely been as effective as here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Unit. Corps. God. Country."Legal dramas aren't usually too high up on my "must see" list, but A Few Good Men intrigued me with it's great cast and completely won me over with some fantastic performances.The story is a pretty standard tale of military misconduct and those in power protecting themselves at the expense of others, but it's the great interactions between the characters and the riveting courtroom exchanges that made this such an enjoyable flick. Tom Cruise stars in the kind of rakish, devil-may-care type of role that he excels at, but does a great job of getting across the fact that under his boyish charm, Kaffee is a damn good lawyer. His camaraderie with Demi Moore and Kevin Pollack, his respectful rivalry with Kevin Bacon, his explosive confrontations with Nicholas and Sutherland, and his complicated relationship with two defendants, all ring true. And that's all testament to how good Cruise was in this role.&nbsp;I'd recommend this to fans of legal drama, as well as those who don't really get excited at the prospect of courtroom showdowns. A Few Good men is the kind of movie that you don't have to be a genre fan to enjoy.</fullReview>

Kiefer Sutherland fits well into his role of a no-nonsense self righteous Marine .Demi Moore is good in parts though her character has some ambiguity in the movie , thereby leading to confusion as to her real nature in the movie.Jack Nicholson , a remarkable actor who doesn't disappoint in this one too.

The presence of code red in the army conduct, is likely to be real, even today.Further more, the main character Lt. Kafee (Tom Cruise), is a very interesting individual, a plea-bargain lawyer who refuses to go on trial, scared of loss. Well, this situation is about to change because he receives the case of Dowson and Downey accused of murdering their colleague, also member of the USA army, at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Their defense? They said they simply followed orders, a code red, to be more specific. From now on pushed by Lt. supervisor JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) and helped by his friend Lt. Sam Weindberg (Kevin Pollack), Kafee tries to take the case to the court.However the case is more deep than it actually seemed, and highly respected Col. Nathan R. Jessep becomes involved in this cover up.Col Jessep (Jack Nicholson) gives this film exactly what it lacked before his presence: a little bit of pride, ego, along with the attempt to obstruct the justice.One of the best trial films I've ever seen.

		<fullReview>Navy lawyer Lt. Kaffee (Cruise) attempts to defend two marines who have committed murder at an American army base whilst overcoming personal agendas With its collection of a list stars and provoking a strong passionate controversial messaging Rob Reiner's courtroom drama may be mistaken for a film bid to win fans through it stars, but thankfully this is a thought provoking stab at rules and regulations when in war and doing national duty, and with some splendid performances and an array of fantastic settings, this is a very good picture.Opening with a sensational formation of formality by soldiers in an orchestra and the mood and tone leads us into a political warfare as two soldiers are charged with conspiracy to commit murder on another solider. What follows are a heavy detailed investigation involving numerous witnesses and the big boss and this all comes together for one of the most recognized confrontations in courtroom film history."You can't handle the truth" and "You need me on that wall" are all perfect displays of the revolution of how America is protected and how the pressures and rules of defending a country go beyond niceties. And who better to make us all believe it than Oscar nominee Jack Nicholson? The man from New Jersey has and always will be a scene stealer a charismatic actor and once more he sweeps the board with anyone he partners on screen. The smirk, the knowledge, the sophistication he simply generates it all and from all the films I have had the pleasure of seeing him in, he delivers one of his best in the climatic courtroom scene.Tom Cruise leads the picture, giving as good as he gets from those around him. Cruise thankfully generates a good deal of comedy which is a wonderful masterstroke given the seriousness of the plot. Demi Moore is slightly annoying as Galloway when Cruise's character could have benefited more from a stronger minded and more decisive character. It is the supporting cast who lend the story a greater perspective. Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollack and Kiefer Sutherland lend some added drama to the grand scheme of proceedings whilst Nicholson is the most obvious stand out in a supporting role.The plot is brilliantly intelligent, tackling all possible ways of approach to the law in regards to the operations within the army. The scripted dialogue doesn't hold back and though I'm usually against swearing some moments could have used more scripted passion. Cruise's retort against Ross when the latter gets up to leave out of the pub is ridiculous. "You're a lousy softball player!" despite never seeing him playing.There are some problems, a major one being Galloway obvious infatuation with Kaffee though thankfully not major. Cruise's story with his father's reputation is too Top Gun for the film's own good but regardless this is a passionate exploration of the law that boasts Nicholson's talents to the full, a passion filled drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is a great combination of Hollywood greats and giants in a highly anticipated military investigation and court martial story. All the actors in the movie played a very gripping and powerful part at own behalf.They all really created an environment where one can feel itself being a part an ongoing investigation about a homicide in the vicinity of Us marine core in Guantanamo bay, which leads to a trial of 2 suspects serving in the unit and victim is itself a fellow marine. Here there a twist of bizarre events and speculations about how the chain of commands is not working under the standard military procedure and the others who are following orders of their superiors are forced to take such measures which are out of the book and military rule of law. When the plot enters inside the military court the drama becomes much more intense. In reality the death of the marine soldier was in connection with a code red being issued but every accused and witness here is trying to protect his honor and lying to hide the facts. Tom cruise , Demi Moore in this movie played naval investigators and they are representing the 2 accused as defense council , they jut want to prove that the suspects were following orders not intentionally performing their own set of rules , but it is also very difficult for them to blame the commanding officer in charge of the base played by Jack Nicholson and his most forward man Keifer Sutherland while Kevin Bacon is The prosecution by the US government who is a marine and a close friend to Tom cruise himself. All these actors have made it an extremely fabulous drama and They have performed more than well. By watching this film i understood a lot about military rules and set procedures.

		<fullReview>Top Ten best reasons why 'A Few Good Men' is one of the best movies ever made.#10 Direction: Reiner perfectly paces a 2+ hour film, giving all the cast freedom to actually act and develop the story beautifully without any scene dragging.#9 Cinematography and score: excellent scenes and music; making you believe you are there.#8 Despite your feeling on Cruise (God, I hate people who judge his couch-jumping to his talent on film) he delivers a perfect transfer from 80s hot-shot/top-gun to real acting. Watch him challenge Jessep in the closing.#7 It simply had the unfortunate timing of coming out the same year as 'Unforgiven' and 'Scent of a Woman' and lost best pic. Both of those were excellent movies and it would be tough for any voter.#6 All actors given time to show depth, creativity and originality. I absolutely loved Moore, Bacon, Sutherland, Pollak and Cruise.#5 In addition, even though everyone's performance was spectacular and Nicholson's was a brief one, he still stole his scenes and strongly deserved an Oscar. (I mean, c'mon?'You can't handle the truth!' scene was worth an award.)#4 The Dialogue. Please, the main characters were good enough at bantering back and forth, but just witness the conversation between Cruise and the newspaper man.#3 Chess = Courtroom. If Cruise's Kaffee performance wasn't evidence the direct correlation between chess and courtroom, I don't know what will. (i.e. Where's the mess-hall?)#2 How many movies since 1950 have you seen end with "The End"? They seemed to know this would be a classic, without excessive violence, language, no sex or nudity.#1 Everything, and I mean EVERY THING in this movie worked?but simply judge it on one of the BEST SCENES of any movie ever: "You can't handle the truth!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Marines Build Character and Character's Character is the Mystery of This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers This is a story of two marines Dawson and Downey, on trial for having killed a fellow marine during a code red (Code reds are group actions or beatings by fellow marines to assure discipline within the ranks). They will be jailed for life if they lose the trail. They get Kaffee as their lawyer. He has never been in a courtroom throughout all his years as a navy lawyer. The questions that the movie circles around are Who is Dawson? Who is Downey? Answers given along the way - Weistein "They Beat up a weakling, that's all they did!" Jo "They stand on that wall and say nothing's gonna hurt you tonight." The story was a tremendous study of characters.In the end we find out who they are: Downey - "We did nothing wrong! What did we do wrong? We were following orders! We did nothing wrong!" Dawson - "Yeah we did, we for supposed to fight for those who can't fight for themselves. We were supposed to fight for (the victim) Willie" Along the way we also find out who Kaffee really is, which he also finds out. He has always been a lawyer who finds ways to plea bargain every case and never goes to trail. Perhaps he is afraid of going into a courtroom. Perhaps he does not think he can live up to his father's reputation. Now he has to go to trial and to win the case he has to try to crack a tough person's lie, Dawson and Downey's commanding officer Kendrick (Played by Sutherland). Then because he can not get him to crack and tell the truth, he goes after the top man, the one who ordered the Code Red beating of the marine who was killed, Colonel Jessup. Jessup believes in the marines. He believes that they can not just transfer a substandard marine. They have to train the lad and considers Code Reds a valuable part of training. Caffee gets Jessup into the courtroom and in the climactic scene, he sets a trap on the stand, and he get Jessup talking. Jessup begins to feel trapped and does not want to hide his decision. Jessup wants to say he ordered it. In the climax, Kaffee ignores the judge holding him in contempt and the objection of the opposing council Ross, and he goes at Jessup full force. Kaffee (Shouting) "Colonel Jessup Did you order the code red?" Judge (Shouting)- "You don't have to answer that! Kaffee Consider yourself in contempt!"Ross - "Your Honor, I'd like a moment to confer with my client?"Jessup - "I'll answer the question! You want answers?"Kaffee - "I think I'm entitled!"Jessup - "You want answers!"Kaffee (Loud shouting) - "I want the truth!"Jessup -(Shouting Equaling Kaffee's Volumn) "You can't handle the truth!"(Jessup's Volumn goes down)Jessup - "Son we live in a world that has walls..."Kaffee -(Very Loud shout) "Did you order the code red?"Jessup (Far More Intense - the loudest shouting in the movie)- "Your ----amn right I did!"(Dead silence and everyone has a stunned look, except Jessup).Jessup cracks on the stand and admits he ordered the code red and is arrested. Downey and Dawson are dishonorably discharged and sent home. They did not want to be discharged but because Dawson recognized he did wrong, Kaffee let's him know he still has honor.Kaffee in the end looks at the courtroom and realizes his character, he knows now he belongs in a courtroom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Code</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1992 drama "A Few Good Men," directed by Rob Reiner, unfolds in a Naval Base courtroom in Virginia, where a courtroom battle, resembling David vs. Goliath, is carried out. The story is of a marine murdered at the hands of two fellow marines on Guantanamo Bay, a Naval Base in Cuba. Marines Corporal Dawson and Private Downey are charged and on trial for the murder of Private Santiago, a fellow platoon member. Dawson and Downey are charged with executing a 'Code Red,' a form of hazing, which was ordered indirectly by the chain of command.The two marines on trial have been assigned Lt. Kaffee (Tom Cruz), a lawyer who has never seen the inside of a courtroom, to plea bargain instead of going to trial. Kaffee is struggling to escape the shadow of his infamous father. The most seasoned marine Col. Jessup (Jack Nicholson), who has worked his way up the brass ladder, takes every opportunity to remind Lt. Kaffee of this inability to be equal to his father.The defense team, which includes Lt. Daniel Kaffee, Lt. Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) and Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollack), must show amidst overwhelming evidence that Dawson and Downey were ordered to administer a 'Code Red' to Private Santiago. Lt Galloway's courtroom strong arm tactics shows she will seek fairness and justice at all cost, eventually losing a critical ruling from the officiating judge.The two marines struggle with breaking the marine's code of loyalty and honor, while obeying the film's most formidable marine, Col. Jessup. The climax to the Kaffee and Jessup courtroom show down puts the audience on the edge of their seats, wondering if Kaffee will be able to push Jessup to confess to the illegally ordered 'Code Red.' Jessup's larger than life ego allows Kaffee to retrieve his confession.While the movie brings to the forefront, that most people struggle with values such as good, evil, honor, loyalty and commitment, all the while, revealing that relaxed checks and balances, will endure as status quo, in the armed forces</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Military Court-room Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Only America can seem to do good courtroom thrillers, no other country even seems to try. The courtroom drama has a long history with films like Twelve Angry Men and To Kill A Mockingbird to more modern films such as the Runaway Jury and The Exorcism of Emily Rose. A Few Good Men has the twist that it focuses on the military.A Few Good Men is about the legal investigation and trial of two marines accused of murdering another Marine at Guantanamo Bay. Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) wanted to represent the men but whilst known as a good investigator she is very slow at cases. Her superiors bring in Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), a young member of the JAG team who has a reputation to settle cases out of court. Both Daniel and Joanne take an instant dislike to each other and have different views on taken on the case. But whilst investigating their discovery a culture of abuse being used at Gitmo where superior officers use recruits to force people to shape up and that the dead marine had requested a transfered numerous times.The film has an excellent cast, Tom Cruise in my mind is a good actor and he should do more serious films and he has a real claim in this film where you grow to like him. Demi Moore was decent and believe as Joanne, the military lawyer who has a passion for justice. Jack Nicholson is a strong present even with his short amount of screen-time. Other supporting actors were also very good in the film including Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollak, J.T. Walsh and Wolfgang Bodison.This is a film of themes about justice and the military, especially the culture and difference between officers. The theme of military has always been an issue and still is today all over the world. The abuse theme also reminded me of Full Metal Jacket. The film also relates to the American military's role in the War of Terror with American soldiers abusing detainees.The writer of the film was Aaron Sorkin who based it on his own stage play. To me Sorkin is a genius, giving the world The West Wing and he is a talented writer, mixing in serious topics and some good moments of humour. He made a wonderful screenplay and made his play cinematic.The direction of Rob Reiner was pretty standard, he knows how to handle to camera and got good performances from his actors. He too was able to mix serious and humour. Reiner is the man who also gave the work This is Spinal Tap and Misery.Whilst the film is good, there is a few too many grand speeches and the ending was a bit to sentimental. But it is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Court Room Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner's most thought provoking film is A Few Good Men and probably Tom Cruise's best film as a leading man. Not to mention being one of the better films, if not the best, Demi Moore has been a part of. It also showcases one of Jack Nicholson's most powerful and memorable roles, which is remarkable given his legendary career.A Few Good Men that begins with blame of two Marine grunts for the accidental murder of a fellow Marine. They claim they were ordered to, others call that nonsense and the hunt for the truth is on.A Few Good Men focuses largely upon Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, and Kevin Pollak as they are wrapped up in seeking the greater evil behind the events. All the while the individual responsibility of the two Marine grunts within an arena where individuality is purposefully limited, is largely ignored until the very end. Unforantely it is handled a little sloppy and is the one misstep by Reiner.It is a shame that the film couldn't manage to deal with both concepts, the hunt for those above while examining the guilt or innocence of those below them. Nevertheless the film is a well made court room drama that has far more going for it, than against it.I think one very intelligent move made by Reiner, is he builds a sexual tension between Cruise &amp; Moore but he refuses to allow it to overcome the film and turn the movie into a prime-time soap opera.</fullReview>

Tom Cruise plays the idealistic lawyer who attempts to find out the truth in an apparent military suicide. Basically it's a slick courtroom drama with decent performance from everyone. Kevin Bacon is also very good as the opposing lawyer. The way Cruise finds out the truth is a bit predictable, and the script could have been better written.

		<shortDescription>A right-wing film that left-wingers can love!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Few Good Men is unusually morally complicated for a military drama, because it doesn't make the usual choices for you. While the act that drives the plot - the unintentional killing of an inadequate US Marine by two of his comrades, who intended only to discipline him roughly for informing on another comrade's misconduct - is obviously wrong, we are clearly shown that the soldiers on trial, underprivileged members of the American working class, are decent and honourable men.Defending his subordinates against US Navy lawyers Tom Cruise and Demi Moore, Colonel Jessup (Jack Nicholson) is a macho monster whose religion is the Marines' book of rules (and some rules of his own), but his business in life at Guantamano is, essentially, the protection of other people's lives. By the superbly dramatic end of the film, we're really not sure whether he's the hero or the villain.Like it or not, Western liberals and lefties like myself have to recognise that all our rights and freedoms depend on people who volunteer to put themselves in the way of harm, even if we don't always agree with the causes and campaigns that they're ordered to serve in. To deny that would put you in the position of those who, in the words of Rudyard Kipling's poem, enjoy "making mock of uniforms that guard you while you sleep".Well, that's how I feel about this highly enjoyable and superbly scripted piece of film entertainment. Put it this way: whom would you rather have defending your home and family - the US Marines, or brigades of arts and humanities graduates such as myself? Before I go, though, let me point out an enormous hole in the plot: in real life, an officer in Colonel Jessup's position would have ordered the victim, Santiago, to be discharged from the services as unfit for duty long before the story even got started. The Marines don't want 4Fs, do they? But then there wouldn't have been a film ...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Few Good Men leaves you feeling the power of storytellingThis is a movie that combines fascinating character development in a courtroom setting, and it does so very well, though not spectacularly.The lead characters are very good in this movie, though I may disagree with the analysis that the plot itself was superb (it was not). Evaluating any acting is difficult with Nicholson on the same screen. Cruises's character did not really go anywhere in this film, though he does play the role well, the growth is not present. His explanation for his actions is not sufficient, and the reality is the courtroom portion of the movie is fairly generic and somewhat uninteresting. Taking the script without the acting, this movie would certainly not rank as high as it does. While, in some cases, the role makes the actor, it is indeed the opposite in this film.Overall, a good watch, if only to see Nicolson's breakthrough performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One good reason to watch this film: Nicholson!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Few Good Men", directed by Rob Reiner and based on the screenplay by Aaron Sorkin, should easily make anyone's list of the top 50 films ever made. However, the film does take certain liberties in its portrayal of Marine culture and military justice. As a civilian myself, I am certainly not an authority on the subject. However, it doesn't take Einstein to figure out that no Judge Advocates General attorney speaks to their superiors the way Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) does and gets away with it. While I realize that Cruise aimed for a comic approach to his "boy entering manhood" trademark role, I was disappointed to see the rest of the cast seeming to play along with his irreverence. Nevertheless, his cavalier attitude towards authority figures sets up a few stellar rebukes from his costars, notably Lt. Com. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) and of course, the crowd favorite Lt. Col. Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson). While Cruise probably had the best performance of his career (along with a strong supporting cast in Moore, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh, and Keifer Sutherland), Nicholson steals the show. His "you can't handle the truth!" monologue alone is worth the price of admission. The cinematography of this film is absolutely mind blowing, except for one matte shot of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba that looks very fake. The Windward Division barracks reminds me of a base I saw in Key West, Florida. The courtroom is shown from all angles, almost like being there yourself, and you feel a real sense of history in the place. Pay attention to the lighting. Reiner mentions the lighting in his director commentary, and yes, it does make a difference in how you experience the film. The widescreen special edition of "A Few Good Men" has the obligatory extras. Reiner is not very talkative in the director commentary, which is disappointing. However, there are a few bonuses, such as a special documentary made for the DVD, production notes, spoken language selections for French, Portuguese, Spanish, and plenty of chapter selections (for those who prefer to skip to their favorite parts). All in all, a great movie. I give it three stars for factual accuracy, four stars for cinematography and musical score, and five stars for the over the top performances of Nicholson, Cruise, and Moore. These average out to the four star rating. Buy it, forget about the flaws, and enjoy the performances of an A-list cast.</fullReview>

This film had me from the first few moments of it. I never lost interest. The plot is so interesting and intriguing, you can't help but watch, often at the very edge of your seat. I will say that I found one twist somewhat predictable, but maybe I've just seen too many later movies before watching this. There is a lot of suspense in this film.The writing is solid. At times, there seemed to be a little too much humor and some scenes were maybe a tad long, but apart from that, there was not really anything with this film that was flawed. The score is great. The pacing is incredibly good. The acting is really good all-round. I was completely into this movie all the way. The humor is very good and surprisingly tasteful for the theme.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stand-out performances make up for running time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Few Good Men is one of the better courtroom dramas in recent memory, filled with terrific performances and strong dialog about the difference between following morals and following orders. Tom Cruise gives one of his better performances as a high-energy, pompous lawyer from the Navy who is assigned to defend two Marines who have been accused of murdering one of the soldiers in their unit on the base of Guantanamo Bay. Demi Moore plays one of his assistants, and one of the bright points of this movie is that there is no love sequence between Moore and Cruise, which is refreshing after so many clichd bits like that. Jack Nicholson is in only a few scenes, but he is terrific as Colonel Nathan Jessup, the man in charge of the Marine base. In the film's most famous scene, Nicholson explains his reasons for giving a certain command and it is impossible to not listen intently to him. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by Aaron Sorkin, this is a well-made movie that is not very original and runs about 20 minutes too long. Still, the performances are great all around, especially the three leads and Kevin Bacon in a supporting role. If you like courtroom dramas and plenty of dialog, A Few Good Men will work for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Generally Compelling and Intelligent Courtroom Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PLOT: A naval lawyer (Cruise) defends two marines accused of killing a fellow soldier on orders from an unwritten edict called 'code red'.THE POSITIVE: Cruise is terrific here. His energy and charisma completely propels the film from beginning to end. His ad-libbed impersonation of Nicholson is completely unexpected and funny. Demi Moore is also really good and she works well off of Cruise. It is really nice to see a male and female characters working together without it having to slip into a sexual relationship. The buildup to the eventual trial confrontation between Cruise and Nicholson is generally riveting and compelling.THE NEGATIVE: Although Cruise gives a great performance his character at times seems too irreverent especially when he mocks the marines he is defending for their regimented and formal soldier like behavior even though the Cruise character is supposedly from the navy and therefore would have had many of the same regimented disciplines instilled into him as well. The Nicholson character also has some flaws. He is a man that prides himself on discipline and yet spews out some very crude statements to a lady officer that just doesn't seem realistic. It is also hard to believe that such a veteran officer would allow himself to have such a complete meltdown in court and then be so utterly oblivious to its consequences. The final little 'spat' that he has with the Cruise character seems much too contrived and 'Hollywoodish'. Also the scene at the beginning were Nicholson gives out the crucial order that becomes the crux to the whole story should have been cut out entirely and only revealed at the end, which would have then given the plot more intrigue and tension. There is also a scene where the Moore character takes Cruise out on 'a date', which should also have been cut since it doesn't propel the story at all nor the characters.THE LOWDOWN: This is a generally good and compelling court room drama that is intelligently written and executed. It is hurt slightly by some obvious Hollywood contrivances and a Nicholson character that seems more like a caricature than a real person.THE RATING: 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A Few Good Men" is neither a high-paced action movie nor a hysterically funny comedy, but boy does it entertain me. Tom Cruise is at his best here, and watching him try to win over this courtroom case in this film is engaging and even inspiring. His conflict with Jack Nicholson (in a role than should have won him an Oscar) is easily the movie's best scene. The film injects a ton of little bits of humor that give the film its light and entertaining side. Like other great courtroom dramas, the film becomes intense and exciting as it reaches its climax. Not only does the film contain the famous quote "You can't handle the truth!" but it also includes one of my personal favorites ("Are we clear?" "Crystal!"). I can't completely explain why I love this film, but it is a must-see, and a personal favorite for me.**** out of ****</fullReview>

Demi Moore is good in this. This is even one of the better efforts to act by the much over-rated Tom Cruise. How Reiner makes Cruise less wooden then he is in many of his movies is to me a miracle.Still, the story &amp; the rest of the cast carry Cruise in this movie as their acting puts the film over.

		<fullReview>A FEW GOOD MEN **** In this powerful courtroom drama, Naval Defense lawyer Lt. Daniel Kaffee (someone you wouldn't call a true conformist) takes his first dive into a courtroom case. He is assigned to convince the jury that two marines - evidently murdering a fellow soldier several weeks before - were acting out of orders and not out of a motivation to kill the former officer. Though he gains help from his legal staff - including the more dutiful associate played by Demi Moore, Kaffee's struggle to win his case is eventually hindered by another break point, Col. Nathan Jessup. 'A Few Good Men' delivers some great lines and features an excellent ensemble of actors: Tom Cruise gives a stand-out performance as Kaffee and Jack Nicholson is at his growling and intense best as Jessup, both serving equally commendable support to the film.

That's the truth.Strong performances, great dialogue and a story with plenty of flow, intrigue and entertainment to boot.Tom Cruise, is cast well as Kaffey, the cocky lawyer trying to defend two soldiers arrested for the murder of a fellow soldier at their base. Demi Moore is also good as Joanne Greenway an internal affairs worker who thinks Kaffey isn't good enough, but seems to admire his nerve, and his unorthodox approach to his case. But best of all is Jack Nicholson, as a general who is not only powerful but tenacious. He is more than he seems, and appears to have more responsibility in this murder case than you'd imagine.But I won't spoil it.With a great back up cast with the likes of: Kevin Bacon Kiefer Sutherland J.T Walsh (On amazing form) and Kevin Pollack This film can't help but impress me.

		<fullReview>This Tom Cruise/Jack Nicholson film caught my attention the moment I saw the posters promoting its upcoming release back in the fall of 1992. Rare as it was ? even back then ? I went with a date and saw it opening night.First and foremost, I need to set the record straight on one matter: My youngest brother spent a year and change in Rifle Security Company at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and he thought the movie was Aaron Sorkin bull. While I think Sorkin has his own agenda, I can only speak from my perspective as both a former Marine and as one who takes a closer look at movies after I've seen them a couple of times.Adapted from the play which Sorkin also wrote, yet there were some subtle differences where necessary liberties were taken in order to capture the appeal of a film audience.Cruise plays Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee, a Navy JAG (Judge Advocate General) officer (military lawyer), and the son of Alistair Kaffee, who had also been a JAG officer and former U.S. Attorney General, who has a well-known track record for making plea bargains. All of a sudden, he gets a murder case dropped in his lap by Division in the hopes it will just go away, and Kaffee wants to know why.Being one who likes to make her presence known for its sake alone, enter Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway ? played by Demi Moore in one of her rare decently played roles ? and we have the potential for some real explosive personality problems, at least at first. Kaffee is new on the block, Galloway is a desk jockey whose skills are shall we say overly specific, and after they get past the kinks. They build up a mutual respect.What appealed to me the most in this move ? despite what I felt was an unjustified R rating ? was that there was no desire on the part of either Cruise's or Moore's character for the gratuitous or obligatory sex scene that proliferates R-rated movies. There was no innuendo either; these were two professionals ? military officers ? working with a third officer played by Kevin Pollak that busted their chops in getting their clients acquitted.The showdown in the courtroom, coupled with the shocking twist during the film will make you a fan of this film and enjoy it with repeated viewing. For a directorial debut, Rob Reiner makes a noticeable splash with style and some measure of substance.Not for children, A Few Good Men joins the ranks of the modern American classics.On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this film a 9/10. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't count the times over the years that I have watched A,Few Good Men ever since I first saw it in 1993 I said now here is a great movie. I must have been right because network TV and both basic and premium cable channels continue to give A,Few Good Men numerous showings. Rob Reiner did a great job directing along with superb writing from Aaron Sorkin was what made this movie so interesting that your eyes are glued from start to finish. The acting just blows me away to start you have a great performance from Tom Cruise maybe the best of his career. Cruise handles the role of Navy lawyer Daniel Kaffee great he shows his ability to work so well with others. I know with the way Cruise showed that Daniel Kaffee can roar away that is exactly the kind of defense lawyer that two Marines accused of murder needed. Tom Cruise was perfectly cast. I'm just getting warmed up on the talk about good acting Jack Nicholson was once again his brilliant direct to the point self again. I came to love Jack with his performance as The Joker in Batman and in The Shining but I must say his performance in A,Few Good Men as Colonel Nathan R. Jessup, commander of the U.S. Marine base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba showed once again just why Jack Nicholson as a actor is in a totally different league. That being a league of select legends and all-time greats. Jack suited the role of the hard and wise Colonel so well you love ever scene he had which was only four. I always remember this intense courtroom sequence starting with Cruise: "I want the truth". Nicholson: "You can't handle the truth". Many times that quote holds true to life the truth is hard but believe me always remember the truth conquers all and is the most important thing that matters when everything is said and done and A,Few Good Men proves that very point. This movie is now a classic so be sure that you either own a VHS copy or put a tape in the VCR to record when you have time because A,Few Good Men is always a must view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Hollywood gets together...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in awhile there are certain films that bring together Hollywood's elite or young hot stars in order to make a crowd pleaser. Certainly director Rob Reiner did exactly that but on top of this he made a top film that critics and fans loved equally which is no easy feat.A Few Good Men is the story of two young marines who are charged with the murder of a fellow marine after they seemingly punished him and he died from the result. It seems like an open and shut case and the Navy brings on board hot shot young attorney Lt. Daniel Kaffee who is renowned for plea bargaining a case and never arguing. With the help of Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway, who believes the boys were ordered to perform this brand of punishment on the victim, Kaffee is convinced to bring the case to trial. As they push further through the evidence and witnesses they begin to unfold what truly happened on the base and who was truly responsible for calling out the order that took the Marine's life.What an unbelievable collaboration of a cast. Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Pollack, and an amazing supporting cast as well of lesser known but nonetheless amazing actors. This is perhaps the Oceans Eleven of the nineties except much, much better. Bringing together a cast like this, with such a powerful storyline is pure gold which it was!! Some of the best points of the film is the dialog between the characters, almost soliloquy type speeches from Cruise and Nicholson and of course the infamous if not overused "You Can't Handle the truth." I admit I wasn't overly impressed with Jack Nicholson but his character wasn't bad. Demi Moore also was a little withdrawn but in a film with this many heavy hitters it would be hard for every star to shine. Tom Cruise is truly the star of the film turning in an emotional and turbulent performance as Kaffee. For a legal film, A Few Good Men is one of the smoothest moving, easy to follow, and well put together of the bunch. Rob Reiner truly did an amazing job making a mainstream yet critically acclaimed film. This is a film that everyone should see because it's one of those films that Hollywood thrives for...incredibly star power in an amazing film. You won't be disappointed. 9/10</fullReview>

The plot develops, and the conspiracy surrounding the case becomes apparent. And its up to Cruise to lay his career on the line to find the truth.Its good when cruise gets Nicholson wound up and he admits it and there's just shock for 1 minute then cruise dismisses the jury and requests a court martial or something like that.Nicolson says " I'm going to rip the eyes out of your head and p!$$ in your dead skull, you fu(ked with the wrong marine".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb film, very well acted by everyone involved. Tom Cruise plays an excellent character, a cocky navy lawyer who is determined to go through life on his looks and his brains. However, he suddenly finds himself in a situation where much more is being demanded of him. A case that he judged to be a throwaway exposes the shortcomings and insecurities he had so successfully hidden away. He can't get away with smirking, charming and half-stepping his way through this one.A well-told story. Tom Cruise hits just the right note as the smarmy, but frightened lawyer who must step up and deliver.Well-acted by a great cast, and a strong directing performance by Ron Howard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Perfect Example of a Courtroom Drama!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Few Good Men (1992) is one of those examples of a perfect courtroom drama. The movie stars Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, and Keifer Sutherland in one of Rob Reiner's best films yet! Cruise plays Lt. Daniel Kaffee, a hotshot, baseball loving Naval Attorney who must defend two Marines stationed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba who are accused of assaulting and murdering a fellow Marine. In Cuba, the base Commander, Colonel Nathan Jessup (Nicholson), states to his senior officers (J.T. Walsh; Sutherland) that PFC Santiago (the dead Marine) will not be transferred off GitMo Base and that Santiago will be trained by Lt. Kendrick (Sutherland). Lt. Colonel Matthew Markinson (Walsh) thinks that transferring Santiago off the base is a good idea, but Jessup tells Markinson that Santiago will be trained and that he (Santiago) is staying at GitMo. Meanwhile in Washington, Kaffee meets with Lt. Cmdr. JoAnne Galloway (Moore) of the Naval Internal Affairs Division, who just became the attorney for PFC Louden Downey (James Marshall), one of the accused Marines. Kaffee then meets with Capt. Jack Ross (Bacon) who states that he is representing the United States if there is a Court Martial. During the movie, Kaffee, Galloway, and Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) make up the defense team and have to prove that someone at GitMo ordered a "Code Red" on Santiago. The movie leaves you on the edge of your seat up until the courtroom showdown between Kaffee and Jessup, when the action takes place. A Few Good Men is one of best military films ever made. This movie deserves a perfect ********** stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of my friends don't like Tom Cruise, but I don't really care what they think because this is a great movie and Tom Cruise is awesome in it. Same goes for the other characters as well, especially Jack Nicholson. If you are the kind of guy that likes court room thrillers this is absolutely the movie for you. Great acting, a great script and just in all a very entertaining movie from beginning to end. Tom Cruise plays Lt. Daniel Kaffe, a navy lawyer who gets the case of his life when two army guys get charge with murder of a fellow soldier. In the beginning it looks like a straight forward case, but is it? I am not going to spoil anything else so go ahead, rent it or buy it. You won't regret it. And if you do, something is wrong with you :P I rate this movie 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Following Orders Is No Excuse</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Slow moving but interesting court drama about what one in the US Armed Forces should do when faced with an unlawful order and if he executes that order is he, or she, as guilty as the person who gave it. Tom Cruise, Lt. Dan Kaffee, and Jack Nicholson, Col. Nathan Jessep, are excellent in their respective roles as the hunter and the hunted in the jungles of the military courtrooms in Washington D.C. Demi Moore, Lt. Camdr. JoAnne Galloway in one of her best and at the same time controlled roles that showed how good she can act besides having a pretty face and gorgeous body. The movie builds up slowly until it reaches it's explosive conclusion with Col. Jessep's arrogance and sense of self-importance exposing him for what he really is. A dangerous and psychotic egomaniac who's more of a danger to the safety and security of the United States then an asset to it. Both James Marshall &amp; Wolfgang Bodison, PFC Louden Downey &amp; Lcpt Howard W. Dawson are fine as the two Marines on trial for the hazing death of fellow Marine PFC. William T. Santiago, Michael DeLorenzo, on the Guantonamo US Military base in Cuba. You can see by their actions how dangerous it is to blindly follow orders in the belief that your superiors know better and are always right in what they say.Watching "A Few Good Men" now, in 2004, makes you think about the prisoner abuse going on now in Iraq as well as he aforementioned Gitmo. Also how those who were ordered to commit those abuses are no more guilty then those in charge of those prisons who gave the orders to commit them. The movie starts with the fatal hazing of a Marine at Gitmo in Cuba and ends with the commander of the USMC on that base losing it in a military court in D.C because of that incident. We go through the long and painful process of first having those responsible for the deadly hazing arrested tried and then sentenced for that crime. We also see all the behind the scenes activities that led to that crime, as well as those actions after the crime was committed to cover it up. Seeming to be an open and shut case by the military court Lt. Cmdr. Galloway feels there's more to the death of Marine PFC. Santiago then just a case of simple revenge on the part of Lcpl. Dawson and his friend PFC. Downey.Together with Lt. Kaffee as well as his assistant Lt. Winberg, Kevin Pollak, Galloway feels that the men in such a tight-nit organization like the USMC would not have committed such an action without the approval or without being ordered by their commanding officers. Galloway goes first to the Marine brig in D.C to interview the accused Marines Dawson &amp; Downey. Then to the Marine base at Gitmo to talk to the Marine commander Col.Jessep to find out if the accused, Dawson &amp; Downey, actions were ordered by a higher up and not done on their own. Admittedly the ending was a bit over-the-top with the tough and hard as nails Marine Col. Jessep making a complete fool of himself by him feeling that he was above the law and that whatever he did or ordered other to do was in the best interests of the United States. It was very good theater and most of all it worked. "A few Good Men" also didn't cop-out in totally exonerating the two Marines who followed Col. Jessep's orders by having the majors charges against them of the killing of PFC. Santiago dropped and having them not serve any time in prison but were kicked out of the Marine Corps with dishonorable discharge. Being thrown out of the Marines was a fate worse then death itself for both Lcpl. Dawson and PFC. Downey.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a typical Hollywood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone stated this was a typical Hollywood anti-military movie. Not so. This movie is about men being told they must do something that they do not beleive in. but must follow a code they are taught to follow. Taught and retaught over and over. Follow the CODE. Yet, as they come to find out they do NOT follow the code for it's intent. They follow the code for their superiors. This story line could have a thousand different places, but this was placed in the american military. Their code. If in business, it could have been trading stock, selling funds, trading futures, copyrights, whatever. It just happened to take place within the military framework. It is a very good movie and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants more than shoot-em-ups or special effects. Don't expect them here. Just expect real people dealing with a really big problem. And the one single thing I enjoyed was one of the marines asking after hearing that he would not be in military jail because of his actions was, this is all he ever wanted to do. And because he followed orders without question, he could no longer be a part of where he truly belonged...</fullReview>

It's a dream cast, really... Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Demi Moore, Keifer Sutherland, J.T. Walsh, Cuba Gooding Jr, the omnipresent Kevin Bacon... The cast isn't short of it's A-listers. Cruise, Nicholson and Walsh are all good, Moore is solid enough, although a little monotonous. Bacon turns in a convincing performance as the prosecution lawyer.There's nothing about this movie that is outstanding or phenomenal, but it's rather a well-made, well-written, well-acted movie that is well worth watching.7/10 -- Recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting moral issue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a quick glance at the movie's poster and you are in no doubt as to the fact that the producers wanted this movie to be a big box office draw. You have Tom Cruise, Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson on the same bill thus guaranteeing them strong support from audiences. The supporting cast are not pale by comparison, but do not have the pop star iconic appeal of the main cast. Kiefer Suthurland and Kevin Bacon are frontmen in their own right, but their relegation were by no means a substantial drop in status. Their characters were important to the story and needed actors of this level. This is indicative of the success the producers were hoping to attain. Top movies require top actors and we were not disappointed.The conflict between the two central characters of the opposing sides, that is, Cruise and Nicholson was not initiated strongly enough, at least from Cruise's side. His reaction to Nicholson's condescending reply to the news of his father's death did not seem realistic enough. Cruise is living in the shadow of his father and is rebelliously responding to peoples expectations by ?treading water' until he can get out of the navy and live life his own way. This burden on him should have been evident during this scene rather than the brushing aside that occurred. Although Cruise developed the character, Nicholson was consistent throughout and his performance was the more memorable of the two.It is easy to believe that the Marines would have strongly disliked the idea of being tried by the Navy boys and this issue was exploited almost flawlessly. The accused not fully co ? operating to their detriment may not appear to be feasible to some, but it is realistic since there would have been animosity between the parties due to the status of the two corps within the American culture. Nicholson's dislike intensified throughout and boiled over in the climatic scene. He kept his rawness as sophisticated as possible thus proving to be a formidable adversary for Cruise. Sutherland also tried hard to display the hatred between the corps without overacting and he succeeded. This was not carried through by Bacon's character, perhaps because the filmmakers wished to create a stronger case for the moral issue that they were presenting. It meant that Bacon was less of an obstacle thus diminishing interest for the audience.Demi Moore did not do enough with the complexities that her character was given. She was an emotional monotone, much unlike which was required which was a lawyer with an idealistic outlook determined to give her defendants the best chance possible whilst being sympathetic to them since they were in the line of fire without much credit. She was the one who was supposed to shake Cruise up to take the case seriously and to step out from under his father's shadow thus meaning that she had to be the spark igniting the conflict between the characters and give impetus to the story. It was a demanding role and the challenge was not taken up fully.The moral issue, which is the core to the plot, is how much leeway society can to the army with regards to human rights so that they can develop men capable of defending America. Nicholson leaves us in no doubt that he believes in hard tactics to produce hard results. They need to be tough enough to protect a system ? a system that does not recognise the human rights transgressions that are seen as legitimate by Nicholson. He sees the system as na?ve. It expects him to keep America safe ? a task which requires the toughest Marines and harsh methods make for harsh men, the kind that are necessary for the life and death situations that they will face in the field. The message in the movie is that human rights must be entrenched no matter what the situation. There are many out there that justify amoral acts on the basis that they must overcome a threat or suppressor. The way we react to a threat shows our true moral foundation and therefore a democratic society wishing to remain so must protect human rights under all situations.The movie has an obvious inclination to this message and does not try to build up a strong enough case for the opposing view. This would have made the conflict more complex and hence the movie more entertaining. Perhaps Bacon could have believed in the point of view that the army had a right to train the men as hard as necessary as long as life was not under threat. I am sure that in reality, a lot of military personnel think along these lines since trends in modern society take longest to permeate the military system. Top brass is usually stuffy and hard ? line not taking much liking to outside meddling, as I am sure this would have been perceived. Instead he knows that the army is wrong and he is just doing his job ? the lawyer who acts on the facts of the case to prosecute for his employer. The obstacles that were given to the defenders were lack of facts and witnesses. Although these do provide many problems for our heroes, the added obstacle of the fervent belief of the army officials would have tensed up character relations, especially between Cruise and Bacon. Part of giving a good message is providing valid arguments for both sides of the story. There was sufficient opportunity for this, which was not taken.Lawyers always make for entertaining viewing. The drama of the courtroom, the injustices that prevail, the moral issues that are tackled and the conflict between parties create opportunities for moviemakers. Add this to the military where life and death issues are daily regimen and a solid base for storytelling is founded. There are many movies which utilise these elements and a good example is ?The Generals Daughter' and the TV series ?Jag'. Box office success of movies such as these will ensure that the quality that we were given in ?A Few Good Men' will prevail. </fullReview>

Watching now, 10 years after it came and after the Afghan and Iraq attacks by US marines makes me do what the base colonel wanted: live in fear. Cruise in this movie is better than Hanks in Saving Sgt Ryan, at bringing the script alive with the necessity of knowing what we all hold dear and where we owe our allegiance. It is not living in fear, as Michael Moore (He can leave his clothes thanks) has shown us so well in Bowling.You don't have to have a badge on your arm to know honour, says Cruise to the sgt he gets off the murder frame-up. so true.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, But only the Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very, very well done courtroom drama, that moves beyond, but is still somewhat constricted by, its theatrical origins.The story is fairly simple and straightforward. Two marines in Guantanomo Bay, Cuba, internally and physically discipline a wayward marine, who then dies. The marines are then tried for murder as the COlonel in charge of the base heads a conspiracy to deny that the junior marines were acting under orders from their superior officers. What has occurred is very clearly spelled out in several introductory scenes, so the main suspense is whether the truth will come to light.The main star is Aaron Sorkin's screenplay which, as is his style, positively crackles with many memorable exchanges and witty banter. The only shortcoming is mentioned below. Tom Cruise is fairly good as the junior lawyer who everyone expected to plea-bargain the case, and Jack Nicholson is brilliant in only four scenes as the iron-willed Colonel who reserves the right to order soldiers in his own way. The supporting roles are the best of almost any movie of the last 20 years : Kevin Pollack, J.T. Walsh, Noah Wyle, Cuba Gooding Jr., Christopher Guest, Xander Berkeley. Kevin Bacon is very underrated as the prosecutor with a conscience and radiates a powerful magnetism in a negotiation with Cruise outside a basketball game.All of which brings me to the single but glaring shortcoming of the movie - Demi Moore's character. For starters, Demi Moore simply cannot act very well. I have not liked a single movie that she has ever been in with the exception of this one. However, the blame for her role must be placed at the feet of Mr Sorkin. Moore's character is one of the most disappointing female leads in recent memory. She is portrayed as overly emotional, unconfident, as having 'passion but no street-smarts'. Through the course of the movie she is clearly shown to make two major blunders through the course of the trial. This would all be forgiven if it was part of a major character arc, but her character does not change at all throughout the movie. At the end, she simply gazes adoringly at Cruise, presumably because he rescued her from her own incompetence. I suppose she was meant to provide some sort of moral compass for Cruise's character, but it escapes me why passion must so obviously be married with incompetence.Still, an extremely good, well-written and well-acted film.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In spite of myself, I love this film! A bit like 'The Untouchables', I know I should be laughing at the cliched dialogue, the poor acting, the overblown patriotism - and yet...The dialogue - In between the cliches there are some absolute gems - 'OK, but you gotta ask me nicely', 'one more and I get a set of steak knives' and, of course 'you can't handle the truth!'. The acting - Nicholson is superb and steals the show despite having only a handful of scenes. And Cruise is surprisingly effective as Caffey, although he does play the same basic irresponsible-but-talented-young-man-finally-grows-up role seen in Top Gun, Color of Money, Cocktail, Rainman etc.But what I love about this film is the way it builds to the final courtroom showdown - we know it's got to happen, we know he's going to have to make him say it, but until we actually get there, we don't have a clue how. It is truly satisfying to see the frightening, smug and utterly self-confident Jessop destroyed by his own arrogance and misplaced self-belief.Never underestimate the power of words.</fullReview>

Upon hearing the nouns Tom and Cruise the suspected snob will turn blue and green; only for a moment though, snobs have a remarkably big resistance, and then answer: "Magnolia". "Magnolia," you'll ask semi-surprised, "isn't that the one with the falling frogs?" "Aaah, the frogs," the now unmasked snob will sigh and his gaze will wander to a place where bones turn into spaceships and dirty old men die on beaches.This to make clear that I really hate all those Tom Cruise bashers. He has made some great movies over the years, but this is easily his best. It's great to see he holds his own against force of nature Jack Nicholson. It's great to see he cuts mild summerbreeze Demi Moore some slack.The script is smart and witty, the photography uses beautiful autumncolours,...

The tension and drama this movie had enthralled me. It also proved to me that Tom Cruise is a Hollywood star and that Jack Nicholson is one Hollywood's legendary actors.One man is dead, two are accused of murder. The entire Marine Corps is on trial. This movie is a drama about the dangerous difference between following orders and following one's conscience. Brilliant Neo military lawyer, Alistair Kaffee has been assigned to help prove two army officers not guilty of murder. With the help of Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway and Lieutenant Sam Weinberg, Kaffee is going to prove that he is the best lawyer in town and is someone not to be wreaked with. I will come straight out now and admit that I am not the hugest Tom Cruise fan. Sure he is a great Hollywood celebrity and all, but he has done some pretty ordinary films. None more so than that of The mission Impossible series. These films were just slow and lacked a good story, with the second movie almost a complete bore all the way through. But seeing Cruise in this movie role, made me stand to attention and take notice of what a fine actor he really is. He was superb as the smartass lawyer, showing that he will do whatever he can to bring out the truth. This role is almost as good as the one he had in Rain Man, alongside Dustin Hoffman. I guess the other problem with Cruise for me is some of his offscreen problems, which for me make him look a very arrogant man. Perhaps I am being a bit harsh though?This movie has a great back-up cast. Jack Nicholson, although he has a very minor role in this movie, is brilliant in the parts that he is in as the corrupt colonial. Nicholson is anther Hollywood legend, with some great films to his name including As Good As It Gets, Batman (as the unmistakable Joker), One Who Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest and The Haunting. Demi Moore is one actress that I have had a hard time keeping up with. Of course her rocky marriage to Bruce Willis was hard to follow, but her movie career has been one that is very unpredictable. She was great in the movie Ghost, but has done some terrible movies, with one of her worst being Striptease. Moore was ok in this film, but nothing spectacular. Finally you have two minor roles, which belong to Kevin Bacon and Kevin Pollack. Bacon was brilliant as the attorney for the government, with some of the confrontations between Cruise and himself, unforgettable. Pollack was also great as the person backing Kaffee up on his case. His role in the 1999 movie ?End of Days', was also very good. The script for this movie was top notch. It was written by Aaron Sorkin, and was a script that had a lot of tension and drama. This then leads me to the director, that being Rob Reiner. He did a wonderful job of giving the audience the chance to feel as if they were part of the courtroom, because I know I certainly felt like I was part of it, with the final courtroom scene just brilliant. So taking all this into consideration, I have seen a wonderful courtroom drama, that also has a tinge of suspense and humour. I feel this film is a much better courtroom movie than that of Rules Of Engagement, though that film was also very good in my view. If you are bored one night, duck out and hire A Few Good Men. Trust me, you will not be disappointed that you did so.Rating: 4.5 Stars or 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great character piece+good trial suspense=great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After renting "A Few Good Men" I asked my mum if she could buy it. Apart from having the energy and tensity of a good trial movie, it is an excellent character piece. This is the story of a boy who was given a case he didn't want because of his relations and in the end surprises everyone, even his roots. another good thing is how the plot is made. the way the truth unfolds, the way they defend what they believe in and how orders are made. Another good thing is how the actors contributed, all giving 100% (specially in the courtroom scenes)and how they showed their talents (specially Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson). If Rob Reiner wasn't behind this, the movie would be a dud, for he is a master of bringing out the best in people.To sum it up, it is a story about justice, honor and overcoming the obstacles. It is a film that I will always Recommend to everybody.</fullReview>

Cruise provides a top-notch acting job, and Demi Moore isn't TOO annoying.Rob Reiner, although a bigot and a hypocrite, knows how to direct and does his job well--it's just unfortunate he has to continually speak his mind about politics and show how his "All in the Family" 'tolerance' was nothing more than a sham (tolerance is only given to those on the left, eh, Robbie?)After Sept. 11, it is quite interesting to struggle with the vaguely anti-militaristic sentiment that runs through the movie. The man down below calling this "chest=pounding, flag-saluting bloody American..." blah blah blah obviously did not actually watch the movie or realize that the main basis of the plot has nothing to do with America at all, but rather deals with the potential for corruption in the upper levels of the military and just how far is too far in the line of duty...

		<shortDescription>Jack Nicholson under scrutiny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the space of a few days I had the luck (I did not say `good luck') to see `The Postman Always Rings Twice' (1981), `Blood and Wine' (1997) and `A Few Good Men' (1992) in that order. The common thread here, evidently, is Jack Nicholson. This actor has become rather stereotyped for me ? though not necessarily for other people ? inasmuch that I sometimes feel that he does not need to act or anything, but just plays himself: but how well he plays himself! He has that ability usually, and in these three films specifically, to play the mean b*****d, or the loose-liver, or the shady double-dealer or in all cases, a hard type, and quite often the camera captures that glint in his eyes that makes you feel that he has gone crazy. I can first remember seeing him in Rafelson's `The Postman Always Rings Twice' with Jessica Lange, the type of film based on a book which, the same as Truman Capote's `In True Blood', has become a classic in the North American genre. The story is powerful, and Nicholson, more than Lange, is up to the mark. However this film has always ? about three times, now ? left me asking myself what went wrong: there is something more convincing lacking. A wonderful job with preparing the 30s scenario and all those old trucks and buses. Almost reminded me of an early rendering in black and white of John Steinbeck's `The Grapes of Wrath' ? possibly still one of the greatest US novels of all times. It's worth mentioning John Colicos as the Greek petrol-station owner, whose apportation is pretty decent.If in 1981 Nicholson held his own very well with the other principal actors, he had a more difficult job with Jennifer Lpez (who only has to appear on the screen to beat allcomers) and Michael Caine, who in `Blood and Wine' just was not up to his level in `The Cyder House Rules' (1999), also seen again very recently. A much more complex story here as everyone tries to hang on to a near-priceless necklace, though in the end Stephen Dorff does the only honest thing open to any of them. An interesting story: but too stereotyped to Rafelsonian formulas, and with a bit more violence thrown in than really necessary for my liking. The story ? and the acting ? was not bad; it was even very nice to see that Miss Lpez is even able to give a rather good performance and is not there just for her pretty face and lovely hair and beautiful eyes and fantastic ???.. Whoa! I'll try to keep to the film??.. However the film left me unamused as Rafelson's directing has lost the (little) charm it had in 1981. And it is pretty obvious that he is not up to Rob Reiner when it comes to getting absolutely the maximum of possibilities out of the Actors.Reiner's `A Few Good Men' is one of the few court-house dramas to keep me interested to the very end. Arthur Miller's `Twelve Just Men' is the only other film of this type which comes to my mind at this moment. Under Reiner's directing Nicholson probably plays one of his best rles, certainly the most convincing one I can remember seeing him in. His playing of a Colonel in the Marines is spot on; you feel you identify with that kind of upper-crust navy man. But opposite him he has Tom Cruise excelling himself as a young military lawyer partnered by a magnificent Demi Moore in perhaps the best part I have seen her in. Really good stuff here: gripping story with superb directing. I have seen each of these films at least twice, and with confidence feel I can say that `A Few Good Men' is not only the better film, but also it is where Jack Nicholson redeems himself and comes up trumps ? amen better directing and excellent camera-work; the ending scenes are highly memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good courtroom drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A FEW GOOD MEN was even better than I expected. I thought that Tom (Cruise), Jack (Nicholson), and Demi (Moore) gave dazzling performances. Also, I was deeply moved by this movie, AND it made me feel good. The most moving thing about it was the trial. This was because two Marines (whom I thought Wolfgang Bodison and James Marshall portrayed very movingly) were on trial for their lives. I got a little scared at some parts -- Especially when Colonel Jessup (Jack Nicholson) was on the stand. This was because he got a little aggressive and scary. In my opinion, the music score was absolutely spellbinding -- Especially the march that played at the beginning and end of the movie. If I can find the soundtrack in the record stores, I'm buying it. When Lieutenant Kaffee (Tom Cruise) said, "AAAAA. I'm sorry, your time's run out. What do we have for the losers, judge? Well, for our defendants, it's a lifetime in exotic Fort Leavenworth. And for defense counsel Kaffee... that's right... it's a court martial! Yes, Johnny! After falsely accusing a highly decorated marine officer of conspiracy and perjury, Lieutenant Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career teaching typewriter maintenance at the Rocko Club School for Women. Thank you for playing 'Should We Or Should We Not Follow The Advice Of The Galactically Stupid?'" I laughed my head off! That was a REALLY funny quote! This is a REALLY good courtroom drama. Having said that, I give A FEW GOOD MEN three out of four stars.</fullReview>

You immediately get the impression that he is a sharp defender but only wanting to breeze through his obligation to the Navy by doing as little as possible.

		<fullReview>This film, while entertaining, takes on the typical Hollywood attitude of 'Bad Military!' (background sound of a nose being swatted by a newspaper) and is 'Top Gun' with different characters, but a redundant story line.(Naval Officer trying to live up to his fathers legacy) Don't get me wrong; I liked the film. It didn't contain needless sex, violence (not pertaining to the story line) or gratuitous profanity, and provided a decent mix of drama and comedy. However, it is Rob Reiners disgruntled view of the United States Military, typical of the liberal '60's views. Yes, the armed services teach that the cohesiveness of the unit depend on every man following orders, but stating that soldiers are taught not to think, and are robots is irresponsible and laughable. I speak as a US Navy veteran. I think that Col. Jessup's monologue regarding 'sleeping under the blanket of freedom I provide, and then questioning the manner in which I provide it' says it all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strone male leads save A Few Good Men from being a standard Hollywood courtroom affair.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The courtroom is an ample and inexhaustible well that provides Hollywood with enough dramatic material just, just in case movies scribes run out of good ideas. But it seems that the writers of this genre themselves have run out of good ideas for this genre, turning courtroom drama into melodrama.The formula has often gone this way: defendant has no case, long and overdrawn character cross-examination, vital witness and/or evidence pops up, accused is found guilty, case close and everyone lives happily ever after.It is no different in Rob Reiner's A Few Good Men. We knew Lt. Caffey's clients' backs are against the wall. We know that during the course of the next fifty minutes or so, we will be shocked at every evidence that surfaces and, refusing to believe anything we see firsthand, we will be on an emotional and mental tightrope till the jury's out. We see Col. Nathan Jessep's face and we suspect. We see Col. Markinson's face and we're very certain the devil's just around.The film's contrivances though, are in relation to plot, which doesn't mean a lot in this film genre so A Few Good Men atones itself handsomely through top-notch acting. (Dialogues are also A-grade in poetic sarcasm but I don't know if it is to the writer's credit or to the actor's delivery.)There's nothing more anybody could say about how the actors fit perfectly well in their roles. Among the three defense attorneys, nobody essays that unworded reluctance better than Kevin Pollack. The usually nasty film villain, J.T. Walsh convinces us to offer his guilt-stricken character sympathy this time, and we do. Two of the bratpackers are given acting baptisms of fire here, too. Sutherland's shady lieutenant and Bacon's 'strictly business' gentleman/lawyer are welcome transition from their boy-next-door images. Unfortunately, the lone female lead played by Moore doesn't really shine in this testosterone-saddled film. Either the role wasn't so difficult to cast or there were just too many excellent performances.Now, for the two leads. At the onset, there's nothing really new for Cruise to work here. Boyish arrogance, huge chip on his shoulder, wisecrack, we've seen Tom do this before and even an intelligent script doesn't really save him from the thought of being stereotyped on this film. Everything changes however, when he gets into the ring to trade barbs with Nicholson. If Caffey stunned the court audience while he systematically leveled Jessep to submission, Cruise stunned the movie audience with a never-before-seen onscreen bravado. If Caffey proved he deserved to play in the big league, Cruise proved his acting deserved to be paid notice. Remember, in the history of Hollywood, being in Jack Nicholson's face is not an enviable position, let alone getting into his head but only a few, like Cruise's Caffey, tames the beast Jack and convinces the jury -- the audience -- that he can overcome.As for Jack, his colonel appeared in only a third of the film but the kind of phobia his role induces is a toast to the kind of ubertalent Nicholson is. If anybody has any doubt about Cruise's acting in this film, look at Tom's lieutenant slugging it out with Jack's colonel. One has to be an exceptional actor not to flinch at Nicholson's evil eyes or his sick grin.Who says Mr. Nice Guy can't look straight into the devil's eyes?</fullReview>

My favorite movie of that year at the time was Aladdin, but hey, I was 12. Anyway, as I watched the Academy Awards for the first time (for the year 1992), I noticed the film "A Few Good Men." Immediately, I was interested. I had been a Tom Cruise fan since "Top Gun" and Demi Moore was great in "Ghost," but this one guy seemed really cool. His name is Jack Nicholson. "A Few Good Men" is one of those few movies that features acting at its absolute best. Great work by Kevin Bacon and Kevin Pollak was just icing on the cake! The fact that the Academy felt "Unforgiven" was better that year makes me sick. This is one of those movies that I watch at least 3 times a year because it is so good and it never gets old.

		<fullReview>As I watched this run of the mill courtroom plot unfold I kept wondering. What is the incredible appeal of Tom Cruise and Demi Moore? Both of them did do some fair acting in A Few Good Men but just as often they just looked good. The camera loves them, especially with the fine direction and photography in this film.There is much more here than just good looks. Behind Demi and Tom is a great performance by Jack Nicholson. It is terrific acting moving from charm, then contempt to flaming anger. Nicholson alone really helps this movie. This is not to take away the efforts of the film makers who do their job well. And by focusing on the pretty faces or emotions of the actors we can overlook the movie's shortcomings. Speaking of emotional performances, I was moved by the one by the corporal accused by the military played by Wolfgang Bodison.Don't expect an insight into military life here. The depth of many of the characters is pretty thin. Also, this has all been done many times before and in more exciting ways (See the Caine Mutiny or No Way Out). Still, there are more positives than negatives with A Few Good Men and it is certainly worth watching just to hear Nicholson say, "You can't handle the truth!".</fullReview>

Demi Moore co-stars as his tough but patient sidekick--and SHE makes such a good Navy woman (see G.I. Jane.) Of course Jack Nicholson is one of the most entertaining actors alive today; his malicious facial expressions are beyond comparison. If it wasn't for the army fatigues, I could almost see that little dog from As Good As it Gets yipping at him. Kevin Bacon also sneaks in a quaint, nicely-played role as the friend-but-prosecuting-attourney. The acting here was extremely well-done, but our big scene in the courtroom, which reaches new levels of emotional intensity is practically thrown away because the Big Moment is revealed to us in a preceeding scene!! That's a pretty noticeable flaw. But even so, it's a charged, heated scene and the actors here milk it for all it's worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superior courtroom drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is, quite simply, a great film. Strong characters, great performances all around, a wonderful script. Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise's exchange in the courtroom is already a film classic. What strikes me most, though, is the casting. Rob Reiner was either brilliant and inspired in his selection of actors for this film, or he was completely nuts and got damn lucky. Tom Cruise and Nicholson...no big deal. Pretty obvious choices. But Demi Moore as Jo? Never before or since did she play such a heavy role, or one where her sexuality really plays no part. Kevin Pollack? Other than "The Usual Suspects" I never saw him in anything but comedies. But to take the risk of casting Wolfgang Bodison in the key role of Harold Dawson in his first film, Reiner shows incredible inspiration. The thing is- they all work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must take exception with those who thought the plot was corny. I found it extremely suspenseful. Such a story could really happen, which makes the movie that much easier to relate to. Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, Jack Nicholson, and the late J.T. Walsh gave commendable performances (especially Jack Nicholson when he's being interrogated on the stand). If you like court room dramas that pertain to the military, A Few Good Men won't disappoint you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killer film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Except for a few blatant flaws in military protocol, this is one of the better films about the marines that I've seen. It conveys more than gung-ho, heavily armed soldiers; in A Few Good Men, we see the, to quote Tom Clancy, "ethos" that characterizes members of the Marine Corps. You might call it fanaticism, you might say it's a kind of cult. This is true, but more to the point, it's about honor, discipline, and doing the things that this country needs done without most of the citizens having to get blood on their own hands.In addition, Reiner snagged himself a kick-butt collection of actors, and even did a half decent job of directing.The only things that bothered me were that Marines and Naval personnel kept saluting indoors; only the Army and Air Force do that. The Marines, as part of the Navy, follow the regulation that no personnel salute without their "covers", or their hats, on their heads. They also don't wear their covers indoors. Therefore, they don't salute indoors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can't Handle The Truth!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While films like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and 12 ANGRY MEN are often considered the best courtroom dramas, I put it to you that A FEW GOOD MEN is the cr?me de la cr?me. The story centers around a team of JAG lawyers, led by Danny Kaffee (Tom Cruise in his finest role), as they attempt to save two Marines on trial for murdering a fellow soldier. Everything about the film is superb, from the spot-on performances and the rapid-fire dialogue to the luscious camera-work and fast-paced editing style. While Jack Nicholson, as Colonel Nathan Jessup, is often praised for his work in the film, I'm quite surprised that Tom Cruise didn't get more accolades. For those of you who've only seen Mr. Cruise's more recent (and admittedly crappy) work, go back to this film to see what he was capable of before stardom took over. And despite what some detractors have said, this film is NOT an anti-military movie. As a matter of fact, while it does portray certain soldiers are being potentially insane and power hungry, there is a deep respect for those who serve in the armed forces. So if you haven't seen this movie yet, what's stopping you? Semper Fi!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, bad, bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite its success at the box office, A Few Good Men falls flat because of Cruise's weak acting, the melodramatic and overly-mechanized plot and the clich characters. The film is also plagued with military errors--for example, Cruises's angry rants at Moore and her failure to tell him what's what are not consistent with the fact that she is his superior, and she has presumably worked hard to achieve the rank she now holds. Wouldn't she logically rebuke him when he screams in her face? Another major flaw with the film is the fact that soldiers do not have the duty to obey an unlawful order--so, the defendants should have refused to obey the order in the first place. The fact that they caved in under emotional pressure probably wouldn't be enough to get them off the hook in real life, making the plot of this movie inaccurate. The most painful aspect of this film, besides Cruise's infantile and unprofessional rants, is the scathing villainy of Nicholson's character, who has the blackest of hearts and the coldest of glares. Although it may be a good way to pass the time when you're confined to a hospital bed or locked up in a jail cell, this movie is 138 minutes of guaranteed suffering and should be avoided at all costs.bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Normally a courtroom drama movie sounds quite dull &amp; dreary to most of us...even the most hard-core movie buffs amongst us might be from time to time lured away by movies full of visual effects &amp; wise-cracking humour...It is an extremely difficult job to conceptualise &amp; create a movie where the climax is a tense, court room scene and the rest of the movie is either in the same court room or deals with events leading up to it...not many of us are able to comprehend legal terms &amp; would prefer to steer clear of such endeavours...However if such a film is crafted masterfully, peppered with crisp dialogues &amp; brilliant acting, watching it becomes a very enjoyable experience...I have come across a few such movies...A Few Good Men is definitely one of those movies which I would heartily recommend to all movie aficionados...A friend of mine, whose judgement I trust &amp; whose taste in movies I share recommended it to me...I downloaded it from the internet &amp; watched it one evening after getting home from work...trust me the movie has a few scenes, which I rewinded &amp; watched several times...after a couple of days, I watched the movie again...it just kept on getting better &amp; better...The premise of the movie is this - Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) is an inexperience US Navy lawyer, entrusted with the defence of two marines accused of murdering a fellow marine of their unit...Naval investigator JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) is his senior officer &amp; co-counsel...Kaffee gets the case as he has a penchant for plea-bargains &amp; at first glance, this looks like an open-and-shut case...but is it really so un-complicated or are there deeper secrets lurking?Jack Nicholson, as the Commanding Officer of the Marine detachment, gives a powerful performance which crackles every time he is on the screen...Tom Cruise has done a commendable job, though some of his lines are too dramatic &amp; don't ring true...Demi Moore turns in a subdued performance...the surprise package is Keifer Sutherland, who you get to see only a couple of times, but packs quite a punch...you also get to see Cuba Gooding in a short cameo...This movie was remade in Hindi as "Shaurya", although there are slight alterations to the basic plot...I have not seen the Hindi version, but have heard it is very good...unfortunately due to lack of hype &amp; publicity, it was not very successful commercially...the fact that the cast did not include any major filmstars, but consisted of talented actors such as Rahul Bose &amp; Kay Kay Menon did not help either...I would still recommend it over the so-called mega-budget &amp; multi-star block busters, which are quite often so full of style, but no substance... Do watch either of these movies (or both) &amp; write to let me know if you agree...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reiner's finest moment...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1992, director Rob Reiner brought forth his most powerful and electrifying film of his career, A Few Good Men. Reiner puts together a star studded cast, all bringing some of the best performances of the 90's and their careers. Academy Award Nominee Tom Cruise stars as Lt. Daniel Kaffee, a crack-shot lawyer asked to defend two young Marines, both accused of intentionally and viciously murdering a fellow comrade. Both claim to have been acting under orders. Working by Kaffee's side is Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) and Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollack), two Marines with opposing views on their clients' innocence. Going head-to-head against Kaffee is Capt. Jack Ross (Kevin Bacon), a long-time friend whom seems to have an open and shut case against the defendants.Cruise gives one of his best performances, even now in his later career. He lets Lt. Kaffee engulf his soul and pour from the movie screen. Cruise doesn't let up in his powerful defense. The stunning script by Aaron Sorkin, adapted from his own play of the same name, allows Cruise to deliver some of the most powerful lines of modern cinema."I want the truth!" The line, one-half of modern cinema's most ceaselessly potent lines for movie watchers everywhere, lays infinitely the history of 1990's films. Demi Moore, whom showed much promise in her earlier works of films, has this on her top tier of career portrayals. As the sensitive and determined Galloway, Moore shows heart and beauty, miscellaneously combined and completely available to the viewer. Kevin Bacon is assertive and established in one of his great supporting turns. Pollack, whom some might consider one of the most underrated and undervalued actors of the past twenty years, is adequate and balanced in a role that doesn't require much of an actor. Kiefer Sutherland, in another strong villainous role added to his resume, is as unlikable and hateful as ever.As the two marines on trial for their lives, Private Downey (James Marshall) and Corporal Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison), both show a beautiful humanity in their respective roles. The late and great J.T. Walsh, is utterly brilliant in his role as Lt. Colonel Markinson, a long time Veteran of the Marine Corp who knows more than he would like to. Walsh ignited the screen, especially in his final scene, rendering all power to the viewer like a mastered Sensei.And the best in show and surely one of the best supporting performances of the last twenty-five years is Jack Nicholson as Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, a Marine with an overflow of power. Nicholson not only shutters the viewer to near paralysis, but delivers the other half of modern cinemas most tantalizing lines that will lay in the eternal mind of movie goers everywhere."You can't handle the truth!" Nicholson, much like the brilliance of Meryl Streep, gets lost and found in all roles he acquires. Whether he's playing the villain, hero, or the misanthropic Melvin Udall, Nicholson remains true and raw at all times.A Few Good Men remains one of the best courtroom dramas of film history. A sure-fire emotional ride that remains bare and simple, while keeping fill and complex. Nominated for four Academy Awards including Best Picture under the production of the late David Brown, Rick Kline, and Robert Eber, Best Supporting Actor for Jack Nicholson, Film Editing, and Sound, Rob Reiner's epic picture is one of the finest films of the 90's.****/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first masterpiece written by the creator of the West Wing television show was a 1992 movie directed by, actor turned director, Rob Reiner. A Few Good Men, is a military/court drama about two marines accused of murder. This film has always been a personal favorite and is one that is a good one to watch multiple times.Daniel Kafee (portrayed by Tom Cruise) is a young navy lawyer working for the NJAG (Navy Judge Advocat General). Known for plea bargaining Kafee is handed a murder case about three young marines at Guantanimo Bay in Cuba. Assigned with Kafee is his friend, fellow NJAG lawyer, Sam Weinburg (Kevin Pollak), and Naval investigator Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) who has an odd attachment to the two marines on trial, Dawson and Downey. The situation on the night of the murder was; PFC William Santiago was in his room asleep when in the middle of the night Dawson and Downey came into his room, tied his hands and feet, and stuffed a rag into his mouth. Suddenly Santiago started to bleed from his mouth, so they untied him to see what was wrong. An hour later he died at the hospital and Dawson and Downey were arrested for murder. The only reason they weren't sentenced straight away to 20 years at Leavenworth is because Galloway heard their story and thought that the case sounded very similar to a "code red" (a code red is where the members of a squad or platoon gang up on another member to teach him a lesson. i.e. if a soldier dropped his lesson during drills he would get his hands glued together). Also appearing in the film are; Jack Nicholson as Colonel Nathan R Jessup, Kevin Bacon as the prosecuting attorney, Keifer Sutherland as an officer at Gitmo, and J.T. Walsh as another officer at Gitmo.The writing in this film is basically as good as it gets. Aaron Sorkin (also known for his work on the West Wing and the American President) wrote the play the film was based on and also wrote the screenplay for the film. The film is also very visually appealing and although it lacks the action of many modern movies it has a similar quality to 12 Angry Men in how the writing provides all the action the film needs. Overall I give it a ten out of ten and it is an amazing film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ensemble Cast led by Cruise and Nicholson help Raise the Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can see there's a lot of seriousness, vigor, and vitality in the performances of most of the cast in A Few Good Men. The Plot and Story are sort of run of the mill and almost TV-show drama-ish, but the cast help let you forget this. Tom Cruise who lately has been avoidable brings his energetic self bouncing his energy off Moore, Pollack, and Bacon. He is a good fit for this movie and is definitely focused. Nicholson although first billed is more of a guest star coming in sporadically but full of his usual fire. The bravado court-room scene is nothing less than acting fireworks while leading up to that there are some twists and turns and as said earlier great support from smaller roles. I recall Luke-warmly enjoying A Few Good Men out of the theater, but older now and more attuned and appreciative to good acting, A Few Good Men is better than Luke-warm, it's a solid effort and a great finish, mostly what you'd like out of a movie. Recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The island of Guantanimo base, in Cuba is one of the most stringent areas under guard the military has. The enemy some forty years ago would have been the reason for the twenty-four hour surveillance. However, at present, the only reason for its armed appearance is to remind Americans the War on Terror has replaced the War against Communism. Nevertheless, when an incident happens like the 'fence-line shooting' it is taken extremely serious. Other factors like the use of 'Code Red' are seen as myth by outsiders and 'very necessary' by active duty personnel. Nevertheless, this hazing is the foundation for the film called "A Few Good Men." Tom Cruise plays Lt. Daniel Kaffee, an exceptional lawyer with a frightful ability to plea-bargain every case he is assigned. That is until two Marines are accused of murdering a fellow marine and despite his efforts to reduce their imprisonment to six months, they will not accept it. Jack Nicholson is Col. Nathan R. Jessep, Commander of the base who believes the case will go away and he'll move up to Chairman for National Defence. Kevin Bacon is Capt. Jack Ross, the Prosecuter, who is ambivalent enough to settle the case quickly. Kiefer Sutherland plays Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, who believes the crime to be a slam dunk for the DA. Kevin Pollak is Lt. Sam Weinberg, second chair to Kaffee, who also thinks the murderers are guilty and should go to prison. J.T. Walsh plays Lt. Col. Matthew Andrew Markinson, who will back up defense counsel if he goes after Jessep. Finally there is Demi Moore as Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway, who insists Kaffee, should take his case more seriously. The courtroom drama which follows is terrific as Kaffee is determined to bring Jessep into the courtroom, even if it costs him his future. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jacks Demoted, Cruise Promoted? Bizarre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Decent movie, liked most of the acting, even the annoying Tom Cruise character, who I felt like slapping around. Particularly good were Kiefer Sutherland &amp; Kevin Bacon. It is the usual Hollywood bashing of our military, but it did not fool me one bit. I guess Rob Reiner wanted the audience to feel the triumph of the snotty JAG lawyer over the talented but uncouth Marine Colonel. But I found it in the totally opposite vein. Obviously Col. Jessup is a very highly skilled commander to be considered for a seat on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. So I guess this is what the USA has come to. We lose one of our obviously best active military commanders for disciplining his unit, to a spoiled brat wannabe lawyer who finally "found himself." Pathetic. The same nonsense happened in real life to Gen. Patton for the "slapping" incidents. He was nearly relieved and sent home. When Americans start realizing the huge difference in civilian life and life in the military, perhaps we can quit denigrating our military leaders who are probably more honorable than most ordinary civilians. The "truth" that the left cannot handle is the fact that the military unit (any military) is formed through group cohesion and not individualism. The betterment of the "whole" instead of the kowtowing to "individualism." Perhaps if they read "Sun Tzu" they might accept this basic command tenet. Despite the obvious "leftist" spiel going on in this film, I still liked it. But only because I could separate the "message" and just watch it as entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really deep, insightful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I started watching this movie with no great expectations. I was bored, to say the least, and it just happened to be showing on the channel I was watching. When I saw the opening credits and names like Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Jack Nicholson and Kiefer Sutherland showed up, my interest was piqued and I started watching this film in the hopes that these great actors would deliver. And they definitely did. This was a courtroom drama, but it was also about the marine corps. It was an enthralling movie, and really got you engrossed and wondering, "Are they telling the truth?, Are they going to go to jail?" etc etc. The high points of the movie for me were the private accused of murder (I can't remember his name now) and the way he was devoted to his superior, Hal. I also enjoyed the sexual tension between Tom Cruise and Demi Moore, and would have enjoyed to see it developed a bit more in this movie. However, the ULTIMATE thought-provoker/tear-jerking scene was one of the last, when the accused are pronounced NOT GUILTY on counts of murder but GUILTY on counts of behaviour unfit for a Marine (or something like that). Then the private says, "Hal, (Jack Nicholson) said he ordered a code red, we didn't do anything wrong!" and Harold says "We were supposed to be fighting for those who can't fight for themselves. We should've fought for Willy." ANd he walks out of the courtroom with his head high. This simply goes to show that principle, rules can only take you so far, but conscience, right and wrong, are what we ultimately have to deal with. Wonderful movie, I will not soon forget it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Really Great Movie, that has held up quite well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The direction, the acting, the editing, everything worked wonderfully.First off, Jack Nicholson dominates every second he is on screen, but his performance alone is too brief to hold up the entire film. Cruise gives a good performance, as does Demi Moore in what was probably her last legitimately GOOD performance.The basic plot is a couple of marines are charged with murder when a case of hazing goes wrong. Cruise is chosen as their lawyer because he is well known as the Plea Bargain king in the JAG division. When they don't get an easy plea bargain things get complicated as Moore pushes Cruise into pursuing this as an actual court case.Cruise really was a good actor in his younger days, now he just stars in Big Budget Action Movies that bring in the paycheck. It would be interesting to see the guy take on another dramatic role, same for Demi. While Demi and Cruise are no longer in the game, Nicholson most certainly is. The man STILL turns in brilliant performances, he is as relevant now as he was in the 70s.Anyways this is definitely a film worth watching, I hadnt seen it in maybe ten years and it was worth the revisit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Few Good Men is about three military lawyers who are defending two men who accidentally murdered one of their own (Santiago) in a 'prank'. The three military lawyers, Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Cruise), Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway (Moore), and Lt. Sam Weinburg (Pollack) try to get information off of Col. Jessup (Nicholson), but he is stubborn and sees himself as 'untouchable'. The two accused (Harold Dawson (Bodison) and Pfc. Louden Downey(Marshall)) say that they got an order for a 'Code Red' from Jessup, so to say that they were just following orders, and that this murder was accidental.In the court room, they go throughout the trial and in the end, Jessup admits in court that he ordered the Code Red. They escort him out and soon the verdict is read. The two men's sentence is to be dishonorably discharged, which they are both extremely unhappy about.Lt. Daniel Kaffee is a very sarcastic and laid back kind of guy. He is a lawyer who is in the navy and in his spare time he likes to play baseball. Though with this life style and personality, in the courtroom, he rules. He does keep up his funny attitude, but he puts it to good use to help him serve justice. He seems to care about his job and what is for the better for his clients. He shows this by getting frustrated with his case. I don't think this character changed much throughout the movie. I think, the more in-depth you go with the movie, the more you get to see his character shine. He is probably my favorite character with his sarcasm and his humor.Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway is pretty much the opposite of Kaffee. She is strict and wants everything to get done the right way and in proper order. I do think that this character changes throughout the movie, because as the movie goes on, she becomes more laid back and seems to respect Kaffee more than in the beginning of the movie.The legal concepts and matters that are examined in this movie are that Dawson and Downey killed a man on an issue of a Code Red. So, they were being tried for murder. Their defense team was explaining to the jury that, yes they accidentally killed a man, but they were working under the order of a superior, and the two accused being such good military men, had to follow orders of this Code Red.I guess this movie is arguably realistic, yes it could really happen, but I think that most people would know better, to say no, to an order of this sort, so I don't think it would be a very common crime.It was a very good movie, despite it wasn't my 'type' of movie and many memorable lines came from it!

		<shortDescription>Well done, but full of military protocol gaffs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A riveting plot, a well-written script, and superbly acted. But full of a number of technical military protocol gaffs. First, there was an inordinate use of first names. Even peers in the enlisted ranks of the Marine Corps, unless they hang out and party together in small numbers, seldom use first names, even among themselves. And, while officers often used first names among themselves, they would NEVER do so with enlisted personnel, regardless of the personal relationship.Second, the movie contains a spate of improper military titles. For example, the two accused Marines were a PFC and lance corporal respectively. PFC (private first class) and "private" are not the same rank, and PFC Downey was constantly demoted when he was often addressed as "private." That would never happen in the Marine Corps. And on at least one occasion, Lance Corporal Dawson (a non-NCO) was promoted into the NCO ranks when he was addressed once as "corporal." In fact, at one time, LtJG Kaffee made reference to LCpl Dawson not being promoted to "full corporal" (taken, presumably, from the term "full colonel" in officers' ranks), but an enlisted term never actually heard outside of Hollywood.Finally, at one point Tom Cruise's Lt.JG Kaffee said, "Don't look at me like I just asked you to clean a latrine?" (or words to that effect). There are NO latrines in the Navy OR the Marine Corps. Those facilities are called "heads" and only heads. At least this movie didn't repeat the most common inter-service gaff by using "AWOL" instead of "UA." Explanation: AWOL (absent without leave) is an Army and Air Force term while UA (unauthorized absence) is the Navy / Marine counterpart. All of these notwithstanding, it's still an outstanding production!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Cruise's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't a fan of Tom Cruise until I watched this movie. He was so full of energy and desperate, that I couldn't help but love every reaction, every pulse that his character had in him. It made me, as an actor, want to someday live up to playing this kind of role. Of course, my favorite scene was the last courtroom scene. He fulfilled my dream within the movie, he yelled, he screamed, and poured his soul out in his effort to win that case! He took us all the way. This has to be Cruise's best work, and if I might add, his greatest victory and probably most memorable moment on screen. The character he created for the film will live on forever and will always be talked about by film fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a story with compelling actuality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are many aspects and quotes and good acting that make this movie worthwhile to watch. But there is that one thing Col. Jessep says in the court scene at the end that makes this movie special to me. Jessep: "Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. [...] deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall. [...] I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it."Now, aside the fact that Jessep uses this to explain an inexcusable death, there is more to this statement, and even in 2006 it has compelling actuality: Everyone in the free world lives under the blanket of freedom that is being provided by military forces fighting for our values. And even though we may not like every measure taken by soldiers abroad, we need to rethink what would happen if they were not guarding that "wall" wherever they are. Let it be Iraq, let it be Afghanistan. These soldiers are providing our freedom. And even though this does not justify things like they happened in Abu Ghareib, anyone who judges these men should not forget, that there is sometimes a thin line between what is acceptable behavior and what is not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Involving court martial story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well scripted, expertly developed mystery story regarding the suspicious death of a Marine serviceman at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Evidence implicating two fellow soldiers of the dead man piles up suspiciously easily, and military lawyers appointed as their defense counsel reason there is much more to the incident than originally perceived. The plot is interesting, it moves well, and pertinent facts emerge in an effective manner to keep the intrigue high.Jack Nicholson, in a supporting role, steals the show. He plays the hard-line, no-nonsense, "don't question me" commander of the base. Most of the cast do very well; Kevin Bacon as a prosecuting attorney (and a Marine himself) is especially strong. Demi Moore is ill-used as an attorney who acts like little more than a cheerleader and love interest for the lead defense attorney, Lt. Kaffee (Tom Cruise). His arrogant and grossly cheesy line, "You love me" had me searching for a barf bag. To illustrate just how dreadful this romantic pairing was, consider the fact that Moore had 1,000 times as much chemistry with her lover in "Ghost," and that guy was dead. Cruise has no concept of playing a lawyer, and portrays this supposedly brilliant attorney like a little kid whining about being put on "time out." One scene has Cruise throwing a temper tantrum; the delivery is comically over-emoted, and looks even more ludicrous when compared to Nicholson's brilliantly delivered court speech which occurs not long after.However, the mostly strong supporting cast and interesting script are effective enough to make the movie, Cruise notwithstanding, and it turns out to be a powerful courtroom drama. The movie conveys some thought provoking messages, and the explosive resolution of the story is riveting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to Sustain a Reputation On Great Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unless Agatha Christie were the pen behind this courtroom drama, Aaron Sorkin's A FEW GOOD MEN is nothing to call home about. Even when its focus is the investigation of a soldier's death by hazing at a Guantanamo military facility, and even when it lets the audience in on that the proper authorities knew more than they were letting in on, it's a story that is much too explicit, much too spelled out in capital letters to garner a sufficient amount of suspense. Where Christie's script for WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION didn't allow anyone to see its denouement, making the final sequence a smash ending for a pretty tense movie, Sorkin's script is, while good, tight, and filled with the requisite drama, too pat. It does manage to draw the audience in -- it did so when I saw it in theatres in Dominican Republic -- but solely on the strength of the performers, including Tom Cruise, who wasn't yet on his power trips to Mars and beyond and wigging out on Oprah. I did appreciate that the script did not give into the more soapy elements of romance, a thing that would have been a pre-requisite in any courtroom drama in the Forties and Fifties, even if the military was the background setting. Demi Moore's character, as such, is written as an efficient woman, we know nothing more about her, and that is fine. If the role would have been conceived as a man in the initial drafts it might as well stayed that way; her presence, while in gender a woman, is extremely masculine, but not overpowering. Call her a strong woman, like many women working in either the militia or law enforcement divisions. There are many like her. I know several.Now, the problem lies in the casting of Jack Nicholson. While he's a fantastic actor, his presence early in the movie alone already spells the movie's climax. Unlike his uncredited cameo in the movie BROADCAST NEWS, his character here is a force to be reckoned with, and because this is a movie about an investigation that has to, by the laws of simple storytelling, produce a disclosure of information and thus vindicate Lt. William Santiago from his tragic death, it's inevitable that Nicholson will be called to testify in court. It's then when the movie becomes a one-track road leading to this one moment that asks what will happen when Nicholson takes the stand. What is surprising is how ferociously he wigs out, and so convincingly. So where there is this rising anticipation of a moment where these two men will collide, when it actually happens, while it was to be expected, it still manages to instill a sense of awe. Not because of its dramatic power -- it has it in droves -- but because of the performances. Of the three main actors, Nicholson is the one with the least screen time but the one audiences remember, particularly for his line "You can't handle the truth!" Not surprisingly this would be the only acting nod the Academy would give A FEW GOOD MEN, and as an end-note, this is also one of the few movies released in the recent years to feature the words "The end" at the beginning of the end credits.</fullReview>

Its really difficult to write this kind of dialog delivery. Fantastcit and never seen performance like this from tom cruise. Dammie more was sweet and simple.

I like the dialog at last :Jessep: You want answers?Kaffee: I think I'm entitled to them.Jessep: You want answers?Kaffee: I want the truth!Jessep: You can't handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the Marines. You have that luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: that Santiago's death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don't want the truth because deep down, in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall. You need me on that wall. We use words like honor, code, loyalty... We use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide, and then questions the manner in which I provide it! I would rather you just said thank you and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to!Kaffee: Did you order the Code Red?Jessep: (quietly) I did the job you sent me to do.Kaffee: Did you order the Code Red?Jessep: You're goddamn right I did!!</fullReview>

He gets an awful lot of stick from the critics often but I think he is a great actor and, lets face it, if you play alongside Nicholson you have to be able to pull it off and he did. I loved the movie from start to finish. What I liked best is the fact that one can enjoy the movie without having to like the army or marine or something along those lines.

		<fullReview>A Few Good Men features a wonderful story, a fantastic cast and crew, and pivotal portrayals. It is gritty, edgy, and tense. It generates suspense, gives you a moment or two of righteous indignation, and leaves you feeling triumphant.All in all, I found it wonderful entertainment in spite of Cruise's involvement. For some reason I've enjoyed most of his movies right down to Legend and Risky Business, but I've never been fond of HIM. Honestly, his parts (all of them) could have been portrayed by anyone and (if given the same budget, direction and treatment as with Cruise) would have been just as enjoyable. He has been pretty lucky so far with his decisions. Of course, regardless of which studio, producer, or director with the name Tom Cruise attached to a work, the budget flows a bit more freely than with...well...say Viggo Mortensen. (Sorry, Viggo, but it's the truth.) In spite of these facts, this is a GREAT movie primarily due to Jack Nicholson and his brilliant performance. Wow!It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great movie but another goof to add to the long list (I guess to be expected with a military movie.) Caffey is referred to and refers to himself as Lieutenant Caffey or Lieutenant Junior Grade Caffey instead of the proper Navy rank of Ensign. The character-as identified by his insignia-was an Ensign "JG" or Junior grade-the first level of officer in the US Navy. Ensigns in the Navy correspond to Lieutenants in the Marine Corps and Army, Lieutenants in the Navy correspond to the rank of Captain in the other services. Confusing perhaps for the laymen but pretty easy for someone doing background research for the movie. Perhaps they felt "Lieutenant Caffey" sounded more dramatic than "Ensign Caffey."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my list this is the top movie of all time. The character of Colonel Nathan Jeseps takes the highest points in the movie. Most of the time army movies just talk about war stories. A true portrayal of the strong personalities of army officers ( forces ) has never received the the kind of attention I think this movie has done. Strong dialogues and good language make this movie a piece of art. This is a good portrayal of how things actually work in the forces. Even the uniforms worn by the actors deserve a mention - immaculate in every sense. The director has made sure the environment reflects on the culture and strong beliefs of the men who serve. Each character is distinct, well thought off and strongly portrayed. Most movies tend to stray away from the fact that men in this position have a demeanor to be reckoned with. Even though the character of Colonel Jesops is negative his stature is in no way belittled. This movie does bring out the difference in the mentalities of civilians and the people who lead a life in the army by a certain code and says and demonstrates these differences really well. A must see. Will definitely watch this movie again and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Snot-nosed punk outfoxes arrogant tough Colonel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This courtroom military drama comes across as almost riveting on first viewing because you're distracted by the lengthy theater dialog you need to concentrate on. The plot involves a 'code red' incident where a weak marine inductee was accidentally killed by two other marines (Bodison &amp; Marshall); writer Sorkin based it on a real incident he'd heard about. If you think about the film's scenes afterwards or watch a 2nd time, many of the scenes may come across as a bit contrived. A good example is the point at which Cruise's character, the hotshot young lawyer (a role he mostly repeated in next year's "The Firm"), is ready to bow out of the case, despite Demi Moore's fondest hopes; his co-counsel (the excellent Pollak) compares the 2 defendants to Nazis. Cruise conveniently jumps on Pollak's extreme statement, falling back into the snares of Moore's wishes. Was Pollak baiting Cruise? It seems unlikely as his character genuinely disapproves of the 2 marines they're defending (itself a very unprofessional attitude for an attorney). This melodrama reminds one of an above-average TV movie, though it's enacted by a superstar cast. If anything, you're drawn not so much to the story but to the opportunity of seeing Cruise, Nicholson, Moore, Bacon &amp; Sutherland chew the scenery. On top of them, there are some of the finest character actors - Pollak, Walsh - and even tiny roles for up-an-comers like Noah Wyle &amp; Cuba Gooding Jr. Then there's Bodison, in his first acting role, who has as much presence as anyone in the film.Here was Cruise in his prime snot-nosed, smart-ass weasel mode (he would finally mature out of this in about 5 years). The story turns out to not revolve around military court cases, military corruption, cover-ups, or top brass, but the concept of a weaselly brat suddenly maturing into an adult lawyer. Most viewers may consider it faint praise when Cruise turns into that mature lawyer; I mean, this idealistic perception of what constitutes a 'good' lawyer may have no play in real life. The movie sort of depicts such a lawyer as an ultimate goal of civilization ('making an argument'), when most people feel civilization should do without such creatures. What exactly is Cruise's character aspiring to, besides trumping a dead father and tricking arrogant, narrow-minded officers on the stand? It's no doubt entertaining to watch Cruise attack Nicholson's character, and you'll always remember Nicholson's pontificating and rapidly escalating from annoyance to furious wrath. You wait for that, you anticipate it ('I'm going to put Jessep on the stand!'), and when it happens in that last 20 minutes, you enjoy the hell out of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Few Good Men is Aaron Sorkin's film adaptation of his play about a court martial preceding involving the murder of a low-ranking soldier in a unit in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

He is a hot-shot marine defense lawyer who is given the case of the accidental murder of a young soldier involving an order from a high-ranking colonel, Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson). The film is a lot like the play and the dialogue is the same in a lot of cases. Jack Nicholson steals the film as the tough-as-nails marine colonel with a smart mouth and a attitude to never take crap from anyone. Demi Moore is average at best (she's also annoying), while the supporting cast including Kevin Pollack, Kevin Bacon, J.T. Walsh, Kiefer Sutherland and Christopher Guest is amazing. If you are looking for a spellbinding courtroom thriller, and don't mind some poor performances from Tom Cruise and Demi Moore, you can't go wrong with 'A Few Good Men'. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is well acted. The bad guys, career military, were not very complex, while the good guys (young and innocent) knew what was best. As courtroom drama, I found the scenes exciting, particularly with the restraints the military defense attorneys have to work under, one cannot accuse an officer who is testifying of lying. What I found most interesting is that the military is not really put in a good light. The heroes were the attorneys, who were well educated and seem to come from good families. The military, however, the guys on the line were either gong ho men willing to lie about the death of a soldier, enlisted men who are robots or mysterious officers with secret backgrounds who did not have the nerve to stand up to illegal orders. Notwithstanding the apparent liberal slant, it was still a good movie to watch and very entertaining.</fullReview>

The political statement of the movie is very American, and if you don't like it you will like the movie anyway, cause the dialog's are so interesting. The final is superb there at court. Jack Nicholson is just perfect and so is Cruise. It even has a thrilling final for a lawyers movie. Lt. Daniel Kaffee is a military lawyer that doesn't give a damn about the army, he is just there because of his father and in return for college paid. Two marines are accused of murdering another and he is selected to defend them. He intends to avoid court by arranging sentence but he will find that there are more things in life than results, as these two soldiers will show him. Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi More's character) convinces Kaffee to work for the truth and take them to trial, for that he will have to face Col. Nathan R. Jessep to try to blame him of the death of Pfc. William T. Santiago taking their carers at the stake. So if you like lawyers movies you will love this one, arguments at court and dialogs between Jessep, Kaffee and the Judge are superb. If you like Army movies you will love the ending also. Really worth watching it</fullReview>

Even if you're a little slow, like I was when I first watched the film, the dramatic punches and boiling hot conflict are clear and powerful enough to keep you utterly gripped. The final showdown between Cruise and Nicholson is a textbook example of genius film-making.What amazes me about Reiner is his excellence in any genre he picks. He is a director who works very hard. Look at his two preceding films - Misery, one of the very best horror/thrillers ever. When Harry Met Sally, possibly the best romantic comedy ever and the only one a man can completely enjoy. And here he tackles courtroom drama with the same obsessive commitment to perfection - and succeeds.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the play at the Curran Theater in San Francisco. Michael O'Keefe was superb as Danny and Paul Winfield was the judge. I remember anxiously awaiting release of the movie and I was NOT disappointed!At first I thought the idea of Tom Cruise in the lead role was a mistake, but he made it work admirably. Sparks flew between Cruise, Moore and Pollack on the defense and of course, Nicholson was a force to be reckoned with. Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, J.T. Walsh and J.A. Preston as the judge all served to cement the cast into a cohesive unit that meshed like a well-oiled machine.Some of the smarmy garbage uttered by Nicholson is quite corny and is part of the comic appeal of the picture. His condescending manner and demand for "some f***ing courtesy" would have been laughable if they hadn't been so regrettably true-to-life. Danny's running exchanges with Luther at the news stand and his flippant exchanges with Jo and his Commanding Officer definitely bring lightness to the seriousness. Best of all the running jokes about Danny's bat, his record as a litigator and his "set of steak knives" were the safety valves that kept the heavy parts from dragging the plot down.Make no mistake; this was a serious situation handled in a mature manner by the writer, the cast and the entire crew. The bits of humor injected only served to make it all the more entertaining.In the end, Lt. Daniel Alistair Kaffee won his set steak knives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Good Men takes a routine legal conflict, packages it in a formula film, and brilliantly makes it into a great legal thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is quite often the case with legal thrillers, A Few Good Men starts off by showing the act of violence that the rest of the movie tries to justify. It is a taut legal thriller that keeps you breathless from beginning to end as the case slowly unfolds, going into startling detail and even more surprisingly maintaining the audience's attention throughout the entire ordeal. Tom Cruise stars as Lieutenant Daniel Alistair Kaffee, a smart-ass young lawyer, barely a year out of law school and taking on a case that's much bigger than anything he's ever attempted. He has already compiled an impressive list of successful cases, hence his appointment to this rather intimidating case. Demi Moore stumbles over her role as Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway, who is supposed to be sort of supervising Kaffee's performance in this case, but anytime she lectures him in what is supposed to be an authoritative dialogue, it's not hard to see why he talks back to her so much. I am not what you would call an expert on Demi Moore's iconography, I can't say that her roles in films like Striptease or G.I. Jane affected her role in A Few Good Men, because at the time I'm writing this review I've never seen either of those films, but there is something about her that makes her completely unconvincing as a threatening superior officer. Her dialogues are strained and over-rehearsed, but luckily the strength of the rest of the cast and the story itself is more than enough to make up for any weakness on Moore's part. Jack Nicholson also stars in a role that he seems to have been born to play, although as the film plays out you realize that the role doesn't do him justice as an actor. Oddly enough, it is the ultimate fate of Nicholson's character that turns out to be one of the few things that brought the quality of the movie down. Obviously this is not because of Nicholson's performance in the film, but because of the way his character was written. As we approach the end of the film, and Kaffee takes the biggest risk of all (putting Colonel Jessep (Nicholson) on the stand and making an accusation that better be true or will result in Kaffee being court-martialed, which he drunkenly acknowledges in what is arguably the most hilarious scene in the film), the plot starts to jump through hoops just to get to a conclusion.(spoilers) The legal case presented in the movie is so intricate and entails so many people and so many different morals that it's hard to determine who the real bad guy is. This is certainly not an open and shut case. But the thing that brings the movie down is that it has the guts to present a case that is not easily solvable, but then has such a copout ending. As Kaffee has a final brainstorm to put Jessep on the stand, he is fully aware of the consequences that he will face is he fails to get the necessary self-criminating information out of him, but decides to go along with the plan, completely convinced that he will admit his guilt in the case so we can all go home (`I think he WANTS to say it!'). Sure enough, in the courtroom when Jessep is on the stand, Kaffee eventually asks him if he ordered the Code Red (after the now-laughable `You can't handle the truth!!' scene), to which Jessep brilliantly responds, `You're damn right I did!!'Okay, we know what really happened (even though we had known pretty much since the beginning, so the movie's over, right? My concern here is that throughout the entire movie up to that point, Colonel Nathan R. Jessep is NOT portrayed as the kind of man that would accidentally admit something like that in a military court of law. What he IS presented as, on the other hand, is the kind of man that WOULD know that letting information like that slip would certainly result in him going to prison. Well, at least they left out the part where he nervously scans the courtroom and says, `I?hope I didn't say that out loud just now?' with a weak smile.In keeping with the overly-intricate legal content of the film, A Few Good Men realizes that it is not a simple legal thriller that can be ended as cleanly as a Scooby-Doo cartoon, even to the point that it ends with Kaffee and his rival lawyer, played expertly by Kevin Bacon, discussing their next moves in continuing this case in other directions, similar to the ending of Rules of Engagement, another deeply involved military thriller. The question that A Few Good Men approaches is the moral conduct of the military officers that stand on a wall at the edges of our nation and provide us with the freedom that we enjoy, how much civilian law applies to them, and even, on the outside, whether or not it is really them alone that provide us with freedom, or at least protect it. Certainly flawed, but A Few Good Men lives up to the expectation of being a star-studded military legal thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat for almost two and a half hours, with plenty of comic relief thrown in that is amazingly able to not take away from the seriousness of the film at all. Rather than cheap laughs, we are given an amusing personality that makes us like the main character, Kaffee, even more. The acting and the story and the direction certainly deliver what is promised, but the movie ultimately pans out to be something that should have been better than it was. The ending was open-ended and complemented the complexity of the moral content, but still came about entirely too conveniently.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Palpable courtroom realism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't talk about the plot. Everyone already knows it. What I was most impressed with is the degree of realism Tom Cruise brought to the screen as a trial lawyer. Any lawyer who has ever tried a case has declared the same self deluding air of confidence as did Cruise when, after Moore asks him how he feels that morning, he replies that the witness "is gonna have his hands full today." He says it with that scary thought lurking in the back of his mind that the witness just might possibly blow him out of the court room that day. But you gotta put on the game face. Then when Jessup is on the brink of waltzing out of the court room, Cruise takes the plunge and orders the Colonel back to the stand. Cruise's mouth at that moment is full of cotton, and his hand shakes as he gulps a drink of water. This witness is terrifying, but Cruise presses on. The climax of course is when the lightning bolt hits - Jessup screams out that he ordered the Code Red. The world almost stops turning. Demi Moore can hardly breathe - her Adam's apple lurches as she gulps in disbelief. Cruise, the brilliant warrior, is momentarily stunned by this revelation. But to his credit, he gathers his wits about him in only a millisecond and turns to the judge, urging the dismissal of the members for an immediate Article 39 session - "The witness has rights." This is remarkable. He has just crushed his arch-enemy, and he immediately moves to preserve the legal status of all the parties. The judge of course recognizes the propriety of the request and asks Bacon if he has any objection. Poor Kevin. He is thunderstruck. His Mighty Casey has struck out. Bacon numbly acquienses in the suggestion. This is great court room drama. It is exceeded only by Marlene Dietrich's screaming damnation of Charles Laughton in Witness For The Prosecution. Every trial lawyer will enjoy this movie. We have all known those moments of fear and trepidation. Few of us however, have ever scored such a smashing victory as did Cruise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gripping, suspenseful story of a brash young Navy lawyer with a track record for plea bargaining who reluctantly takes a case to defend two loyal Marines who may or may not have murdered a compatriot during a routine exercise. Soon, his investigation and determination to find the truth leads him into conflict with their hardened commanding officer (Nicholson, in a powerhouse performance). Engrossing and provocative the story unfolds in skillful fashion, anchored by excellent performances and a finale that's completely over-the-top. An impressive showing for all those involved, especially newcomer Bodison who exerts a powerful screen presence as the more fanatical of the two Marines. ***</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With humor and explosiveness, Tom Cruise delivers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rated this movie a 10 on this site because I enjoyed every moment from start to finish. It's rare that I want to see a movie over and over again just to anticipate the dialogue. There was not a wasted moment in the entire film. The best scene unmatched in my opinion from any other movie is the exchange at the end between Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson. Tom Cruise feels the challenges of not living up to his late father's expectations in this film and goes for broke to prove to himself and everyone else that he is up to the job. He has an explosiveness that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Demi Moore does an excellent job pushing Tom Cruise to reach his full potential in this film. The film also does a good job showing the consequences of blindly following any order no matter what the illegalities may be. Thinking of the consequences of one's actions is a broad theme throughtout this film. I also thought that the humor and one liners fit in perfectly and added a sense of reality and balance to this movie. It doesn't get any better than this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is, in my opinion, one of the best American films of the 90:s. Sorkin's well written dialogue must have been an easy task for Reiner to direct. Everything works! This story rises tough moral questions but do not serve us the answers on a plate. And that's a good thing because it makes us think. Cruise does a good job doing the immature Kaffee with his father's heavy reputation hanging over him and Nicholson is, like always, outstanding. And the encounter between the two in the court room in the end is a classic. Cruise, in this scene, really proves to be not "just another pretty face". Another good thing is that in the closing scene, the flirty talk between Kaffee and Galloway is stricken. It would have been too cute a finish, unworthy a drama like this. Top marks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't count the times over the years that I have watched A,Few Good Men ever since I first saw it in 1993 I said now here is a great movie. I must have been right because network TV and both basic and premium cable channels continue to give A,Few Good Men numerous showings. Rob Reiner did a great job directing along with superb writing from Aaron Sorkin was what made this movie so interesting that your eyes are glued from start to finish. The acting just blows me away to start you have a great performance from Tom Cruise maybe the best of his career. Cruise handles the role of Navy lawyer Daniel Kaffee great he shows his ability to work so well with others. I know with the way Cruise showed that Daniel Kaffee can roar away that is exactly the kind of defense lawyer that two Marines accused of murder needed. Tom Cruise was perfectly cast. I'm just getting warmed up on the talk about good acting Jack Nicholson was once again his brilliant direct to the point self again. I came to love Jack with his performance as The Joker in Batman and in The Shining but I must say his performance in A,Few Good Men as Colonel Nathan R. Jessup, commander of the U.S. Marine base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba showed once again just why Jack Nicholson as a actor is in a totally different league. That being a league of select legends and all-time greats. Jack suited the role of the hard and wise Colonel so well you love ever scene he had which was only four. I always remember this intense courtroom sequence starting with Cruise: "I want the truth". Nicholson: "You can't handle the truth". Many times that quote holds true to life the truth is hard but believe me always remember the truth conquers all and is the most important thing that matters when everything is said and done and A,Few Good Men proves that very point. This movie is now a classic so be sure that you either own a VHS copy or put a tape in the VCR to record when you have time because A,Few Good Men is always a must view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Behold The Power Of Cheese</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aaron Sorkin &amp; Rob Reiner...now THERE'S a team you can count on to give the Marines a fair shake, huh? Actually, as bashing the military (especially white male officers) is as standard-issue these days as the tough-as-nails-but-soft-and-feminine-too Strong Woman Lawyer and the Christ-like noble suffering African-American character, it's not the plot of this film that irritates me. I mean, a courtroom drama involving a right-wing martinet officer really does have entertainment potential - at the very least, you usually get bravura performances and lots of square-jawed nastiness. On this count A FEW GOOD MEN delivers: Kevin Pollack is terrific, Cruise and Moore try hard and don't trip over their own feet, and as for Nicholson....well, he's riveting. He's now at the point where the audience can see the pleasure he takes in a performance, and watching him enjoy himself adds to their pleasure watching the movie. All that said, this is typical Sorkin/Reiner. They're not skilled enough to give us great leftist films like a De Sica or a Costa-Garvas and they know it, so they give us mediocre liberal TV instead. (The kind that seems script-doctored by opinion poll.) From the creamy, butter-on-the-lens cinematography to the manipulative music to the date-movie approach to conflict and resolution, this movie rings as authentic as a McDonald's commercial during the holidays. Dramatically, every big moment is telegraphed and milked, in Dorothy Parker's phrase, until it moos with pain. The characters all come with prefab Quirks-Which-Define-What-They're-All-About, not to mention showy monologues that remind less of actual lawyers and investigators and more like rock musicians taking self-indulgent looka-me solos. As for political correctness, AFGM ladles it out wholesale. We're not trusted to be clever enough to figure out The Military Is Evil on our own, so no chance is missed to pile on reminders. (Snidely Whiplash never gloated as much as the bad guys in this movie.) If you're not rolling your eyes in disbelief that a movie that insults your intelligence this constantly could be praised for its SCRIPT, your eyebrow-ring may be affecting your vision. My favorite lame moment, though, has nothing to do with ideology; in fact, it's right out of ROCKY. After hounding Tom Cruise to risk his career cross-examining Nicholson for most of the movie, Demi Moore turns to him just before they enter the courtroom, wet-eyed with concern, to try to talk him out of doing what she'd badgered him all movie to do. It's the standard 'Adrian scene' Stallone used to shoehorn into every Rocky movie. As Demi pleads with Tom, I yelled at the screen, "ROCKY, YOU CAN'T WIN!" That's the level of subtlety on view here. Maybe Sorkin and Reiner should team up with Sly on that Edgar Allan Poe biography he's always threatening to make. Now THAT I'd pay to see!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of its kind by far.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has produced many court room movies. However, it has also produced a few court martial movies. The difference in these court martial movies is that it has the advantage of being appreciated by anyone who likes court room movies because these movies do not deal with war or army that much but try to stay focussed on the court room case. This is the subject which feeds the script for A Few Good Men. The other part of the script is more the lines you have to walk to win a court martial without becoming subject to one. This involves walking on a very thin line and sometimes trying to move it to your benefit without being stopped by the man in the big chair.  These two key elements are greatly mixed by Rob Reiner's masterful direction and Aaron Sorkin's excellent script. Furthermore, Reiner has a first rate cast allowing his direction to be. This cast includes Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Bacon, Kevin Pollak, Kiefer Sutherland, and Demi Moore.  The story is simple. Two marines are arrested after the death of a fellow marine which they have supposedly murdered. They are transfered to Washington by the orders of Lieutenant Commander JoAnn Galloway (Demi Moore), a gung-ho navy officer, who smells a code red behind this murder and asks that division assign someone to represent the two marines hoping she will be assigned. The two men are moved up to Washington but Commander Galloway is not assigned to represent them. Instead, Lieutenant Daniel Kaffy (Tom Cruise)is the one who is assigned. Kaffy is young and has been in the navy for a little over a year. He is a very good attorney but has only one problem. His specialty is plea-bargaining. So when Division assigns him to this case, Kaffy's boss has Lieutenant Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) act as Kaffy's co-counsel.  Kaffy does what a lawyer has to. He meets with Galloway and immediately, the two of them develop a hatred for one another. He pays a visit to his clients who were marines stationed in Cuba and starts to believe that the case that he has is hopeless. He decides to go down to Cuba with Weinberg. Before leaving, he bumps into Captain Jack Ross (Kevin Bacon) who at first refuses a plea-bargain for twelve years and after a one minute talk agrees to the deal. But Kaffy's visit in Cuba is the critical element of his case. The marines down there are all fanatics and will do as they please on their base. At the head of their base is Colonel Nathan Jessip (Jack Nicholson) and with him are Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson (J.T. Walsh) and Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick (Kiefer Sutherland). Jessip and Kendrick give monster impressions but not Markinson. Upon his return to Washington, Kaffy goes to court with the word of his two defendants to prove their innocence but with the intention of putting up one big fight. The best part of the movie is what follows, the whole court-room scenes and what surrounds them. Cruise delivers an excellent performance and deserved an Oscar nomination for his role and I believe that in the final Cruise vs. Nicholson scene, Cruise makes the scene more powerful than Nicholson for he must take some huge risks. Other terrific performances come from Kevin Pollak, Kiefer Sutherland (in a smaller role), and especially Kevin Bacon. The scene in which Bacon cross-examines James Marshall is almost as powerful as the Cruise vs. Nicholson scene. I think he deserved a nomination as well for his role here. The only sour touch in the movie comes from Demi Moore who, although giving a good performance has a very annoying role and sometimes slips away from her character. But even so, this is one movie you will not want to miss.</fullReview>

I am amazed at the cast that was assembled for this film. Most big-budget movies would be lucky to grab even one of these talented actors (Cruise, Nicholson, Moore, Sutherland, Gooding Jr.) but somehow the film makers were able to put together a script - provide enough bankroll - to attract this spectacular ensemble. Cruise plays the part of Kaffee brilliantly, and his interactions with Nicholson are some of the most riveting ever captured on the Hollywood screen. I have seen this movie many times and it never seems to wear thin or become boring. To me, this is a sign of a great film. Loaded with suspense, drama, intrigue, humor, and excellent performances, I give A Few Good Men a huge 10 out of 10!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly so many lines are memorable in this spectacular, old-fashioned designed court movie. It is a depiction of a plausible fact taking place today, but it reminds us of the best milestones of the genre, from the 40's classics, to "12 Angry Men", from "The Verdict" to "Presumed Innocent".All the screen writing is smart and captivating, with a texture of sentences so thoughtful and sharp to make me wanting to see the theater play.All the film is a conversational path in which the two main characters are fated to clash, at the very end. In this sense, the Nicholson's performance is both powerful and deceiving: in the diapason scene, the long "tire" that he displays is really convincing and the audience, even if only for a second, is brought to believe that, the man is right after all. Only, the whole thing has nothing to do with the men charged with murder, and with the murder itself. That's exactly where the trap works.All in all: great film, perfect built narration, convincing trial scenes, memorable lines. A notable work by director Reiner and especially by screenwriter Sorkin.Definetely, a great piece of cinema: 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Courtroom Dramas Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the tradition of "The Caine Mutiny" comes "A Few Good Men", an excellently written, acted and directed military courtroom drama exploring the themes of honor, loyalty, courage, and the truth. This film is not the typical Hollywood "murder mystery", an overproduced version of an episode of "Matlock", as we know from the outset who is directly responsible for the death of a marine at the U.S. Navy base in Cuba. However, was it murder or accidental death? And who else was involved and why? The tension arises from the struggles of young Navy lawyer Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) overcoming his own self-doubts to answer the above questions and bring justice to those indirectly involved. Tom Cruise's performance is right on the mark, better than any of his previous work, realistically demonstrating Kaffee's stumbling as the accused JAG defense lawyer and his fear of his professional prospects as a future civilian lawyer if he is wrong. Generally considered the brightest JAG lawyer in the office, Kaffee has been in the Navy as a JAG defense lawyer for eleven months and has "successfully plea-bargined 44 cases" without having to step into a courtroom. One more plea-bargined case, we learn, and he "gets a set of steak knives". Demi Moore, as Lt. Cmdr. JoAnne Galloway, the JAG character with the strongest belief that the two young accused marines were acting under anothers orders, shines in her role demonstrating Moore really can act. Kevin Pollack, as Lt. Sam Weinberg, the final member of the JAG defense team, also turns in a wonderful performance as a man who believes the two accused beat up on "a weaker kid" and has to overcome this to provide the best defense possible for the defendants. And Jack Nicholson, portraying Col. Nathan Jessup, the divisional commanding officer of the marine who died and of the accused, is fantastic. All supporting actors and characters provide wonderful performances and are realistically written. For a fun "courtroom night" at home, heat up some popcorn, fill the pitcher with cola, and have a double feature of "The Caine Mutiny" and "A Few Good Men". You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While mostly enjoyable, Rob Reiner's idea of good direction appears to have been "Pump up the volume." To express emotion, any emotion, Tom Cruise, Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson shout. That's great acting? Not in my book - that's a great example of over-acting. The plot isn't predictable because it isn't given the luxury of even that: about mid-way through the film, Tom Cruise's character outlines on a chalkboard how the rest of the movie will go. Then, the plot follows Cruise's outline to the letter. No suspense there. Not the great film that the Oscar nominations might lead one to believe, rather a reasonably fun trifle. (And the actors who don't shout, particularly Kevin Bacon and Kevin Pollack, are excellent.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a lot for me not to like. Tom Cruise's charm is wafer thin as it is, and barely present here. Demi Moore is one of the blandest actresses ever, she brings absolutely nothing to a movie. Sorkin's smug, sarcastic dialogue is grating, and the film's messages are not at all subtle or clever. The formulaic plot mechanics of the courtroom drama are in full effect, and Reiner's direction is artless as usual, relying on hacky montages, musical cues and trumped up emotional moments (in one particularly groanworthy scene, Cruise whines about his daddy issues). And yet, I will admit I was somewhat entertained. I guess it's that certain comfort that comes from the courtroom drama... you don't know exactly what the turning point will be, but you know it's coming right when the hero seems down for the count, and justice will prevail. And that scene (certainly the movie's most famous scene) is a satisfying one. It doesn't ring true in the slightest, but it's a dynamite exchange. Oh, and I'm pleased to have made it through this review without any hackneyed "You can't handle the truth!" jokes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose the plot has been covered in other comments so I will mostly skip it except to emphasize that a Marine private who is both innocent and physically ill is killed in the course of an attempt to bring him up to Marine Corps standards and to teach him not to squeal on his buddies for harmless infractions. Extra ecclesia nulla salus. There is no salvation outside the church, Maggot.Tom Cruise plays a cocky young lawyer who is insubordinate, self-confident, and otherwise obnoxious. Demi Moore is his earnest superior who wants to save two young Grunts who are accused of conpiring to kill the innocent private. She thinks they were "just following orders." Cruise doesn't care at first whether they were following orders or not. He just wants to plea bargain and get them off lightly without a trial. Jack Nicholson is Colonel Jessup, deep into his "ironic" mode here, not putting much into the role of an initially charming but ultimately prideful commander of the Marines at Guantanamo Bay. J. T. Walsh is his sympathetic Executive Officer, a humanistic weakling according to Marine norms.I've tried to like the movie and I can't do it, not even after several viewings. The same things bother me, each time a bit more than previously. The movie is contemptuous towards the authoritarian command structure of the military. Reiner and his writers simply cannot get inside the skins of the Marines, or the Navy for that matter. (Cruise is nothing more than a civilian putting in his obligatory three years before going on to greener pastures.) Make no mistake. (I love to say those words -- "Make no mistake".) In four years in the military I met people who ranged from the ironically distanced to the sadistically personal. Both the military and I rejoiced at my separation. (Later I taught for a few years at New River Marine Corps Air Station in North Carolina, where I had some of the sharpest students I've had anywhere.) This movie is unfair and propagandistic. The innocent private's death is the result of a rather complicated link of commands, hints, and innuendos, all of them involving gung-ho Marines. The one person who thinks "Code Reds" -- an informal punitive act that accidentally results in the private's death -- are wrong is Walsh, who is forced by his sense of guilt to off himself in the prescribed military manner.The only character development to speak of is shown by Tom Cruise, who changes from a carefree kid to a defense counsel who is determined to bring The Truth to light. Aye, there's the rub. "The Truth". Cruise takes the big chance of putting Nicholson on the stand and harrassing him until he explodes with anger and screams his big speech -- "The Truth? You can't handle the truth." This is absolutely predictable in movies. The guilty party breaks down on the witness stand at the end and, either defiantly or remorsefully, shouts out, "I DID IT! I DID IT!" In Nicholson's case, he does it defiantly. In the old Perry Mason TV series, the ratio was about half and half.As for the iconic speech itself, it's treated by Reiner as one of those jaw-dropping well-written revelations, but it's nothing we haven't heard before. The line, "You can't handle the truth", has become a well-known tag line, but it leads nowhere. Nicholson's big speech is hot air. It boils down to the argument that nobody who hasn't been in the front lines doesn't understand the importance of the job that Nicholson and his men are doing. Sure, it's hard, dirty work sometimes, but somebody's got to provide you with protection. "You need me on that wall!" A million cop movies have made the same point, usually leaving it illustrated but unspoken. "A Few Good Men" makes "Dirty Harry" look like a work of art in comparison.Now this is essentially unbelievable. Nicholson is nothing if not a severe case of self-discipline, and very clever, a man used to commanding himself as well as others. He's given no redeeming features. Early on, he makes sexist remarks to Demi Moore. He has no family that we know about, no sense of responsibility for the death of the innocent private. Not only does he pop open under some shouting by Cruise, but he's stupid enough to shout that, yes, "You're damned right" he ordered the Code Red. And then, after insulting the court, he stomps off the witness stand without permission and is SURPRISED to find that he is restrained by MPs! The two grunts who carried out the lethal Code Red under orders are severely punished. We have never really solved the conundrum of the "I was only following orders" defense, have we?What are we supposed to make of all this? The military is a vast right-wing conspiracy liberally sprinkled with smug, strutting fascists and that superior humanistic civilians will eventually root out the evildoers. What other conclusion is possible? There is only one redeemable career officer shown in the movie, Demi Moore, and she is the equivalent of the "good German" of the post-war combat movies. And as a lawyer, she doesn't come near measuring up to Cruise's hot-shot Harvard graduate.Anyway, it's a middle-brow movie because it isn't obvious garbage, but it doesn't provoke any new thoughts in the viewer either. It confirms what Reiner seems to think we already believe about the military. So we can all sit back and bask in the glow of our own self-righteousness. There's no challenge in that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated MELODRAMA</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sorry to disappoint this movie's multitude of fans, but, even though I like it on the whole, there is NO WAY this film deserves 9, much less 10 stars.As a law student, I appreciate the attention paid to courtroom tactics and the film's honest depiction of a trial: the preparation, arguments over strategy, trying to put the pieces of your case together, and, most prominently, the lawyer vs. lawyer battle juxtaposed against the other courtroom players.HOWEVER, the central showdown of the movie is UTTERLY PREPOSTEROUS!!!1) No military attorney would ever behave so recklessly as Cruise did in barking at Col. Jessep, especially with no facts on his side.All the painstaking effort used to construct an accurate and interesting film here crumbles into typical Hollywood nonsense, and Cruise's change of heart (his decision to accuse Jessep) is all the more ridiculous for it, especially considering how trenchantly he had already spelled out to Moore's character for the entire first half of the film the utter futility and senseless risk of doing so.2) NO WITNESS WOULD EVER BEHAVE LIKE JESSEP WHILE ON THE STAND. In particular, no Colonel would:--insult the judge, --walk off the stand before being dismissed,--make sarcastic and condescending remarks to the questioning attorney,--and he certainly WOULD NOT admit to the "Code Red" or turn the witness stand into his own personal soapbox about "men on a wall." The latter is what really sours me on the film--when Nicholson's character opines with such memorable tripe as: "Ever put your life in another man's hands, asked him to put his life in yours?""We follow orders, son. We follow orders, or people die. It's that simple.""Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns." "You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, you NEED me on that wall." Give me a break. This movie is dripping with melodrama.7/10JEM</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Good Eyebrow Closeups</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First let's start with Jack Nicholson. He simply plays himself, mean, slightly deranged, demented and angry. Demi Moore's role is totally pointless, other than you can't have a Tom Cruise movie without a female in a supporting role.Just search Rich Hall's stand-up routine on Youtube about Tom Cruise movies for a better explanation... "He's a cocktail maker, a pretty good cocktail maker too. Till he has a crisis of confidence and can't make cocktails anymore. Then he meets a good looking woman who talks him into being a better cocktail maker.... Then he's a race car driver, a pretty good race car driver too. Till he has a crisis of confidence and can't race cars anymore. Then he meets a good looking woman who talks him into being a better race car driver... Then he's a jet pilot, a pretty good jet pilot too. Till he has a crisis of confidence and can't fly jets anymore. Then he meets a good looking woman who talks him into being a better jet pilot... Then he was a sports agent...Anyway, I'm glad the screen I watched this on was only 32". Even at that size, the constant incessant series of closeups of his eyebrow (singular) were so extreme, one could count the hairs. I can't imagine having to witness his eyebrow on the big screen. But this film does leave food for thought. It makes you step back and ask yourself... Why doesn't somebody buy Tom Cruise a pair of tweezers? Why doesn't he buy a pair? Why wouldn't an actor who makes millions not be able to afford a hot wax to clean things up a bit?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How movies like this get nominated for best Picture is beyond me!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unit, Core, God, CountryEvery once in a while a movie comes out that receives tons of hype, even gets nominated for best picture, and yet is totally non-deserving of either of these. A Few Good Men is such a movie. It attempts to make a serious movie about the army and responsibility for one's own actions, but comes off as a rather laughable attempt. Don't get me wrong, the movie has its moments. However, these moments only occur when Jack Nicholson (Col. Jessep) is on screen, especially during the final court scene. Besides Nicholson, the only other performance in the movie that was at least decent was by Kevin Bacon (Capt. Ross). Both Tom Cruise (Lt. Kaffee) and Demi Moore (Lt. Gallaway) were horrible, in a pathetic, cheesy sort of way. Every time they tried to create some kind of emotion, my reaction was "Oh no, not again." That is, of course, besides the final court scene. While the last scene was not much better, Nicholson's wonderful performance forced me to even slightly enjoy Cruise. What made Cruise' acting so horrible for me was not only the actor himself, but also the part he was playing. I found the script, again with the exception of the last scene, to be laughable at best and utterly unbearable at worst. The attempts made at the witty repartee between Kaffee (Cruise) and Gallaway (Moore) came of so childish and sad that I could hardly keep my finger away from the fast forward button. Cruise' role was almost exactly the same as the one he played in Top Gun; and while the pampered, smart-ass, pretty boy attitude worked in the action movie, it was totally out of place in a drama. Moore's role was not much better. Instead of keeping up the tough as nails, feminist image that she had in the very beginning of the movie, she degraded herself by becoming yet another of Cruise' flings, hardly ever standing firmly on anything. Too bad, because had her character not fallen for Cruise, she might have actually been an interesting alternative to Cruise' "all women worship me" attitude.The story itself isn't bad, having to do with two soldiers accused of killing their teammate after following something called a "code red", apparently some extreme form of hazing. Were the soldiers acting under their own initiative, or were they given orders; and if so, can a soldier judge the manner of the orders given, or must he/she follow them implicitly? These are all interesting question posed in the movie, and when in the final court scene we are faced with the totally elitist mind of Colonel Jessep (Nicholson), it actually feels like we are getting something out of the movie. Although the screaming between Cruise and Nicholson might seem a little melodramatic, it is what the movie needs to give itself a little credibility. In the end, the movie is not really quite as bad as it comes off in this review. If you can stand Cruise' and Moore's extremely annoying dialogues, and look rather at the issues being discussed, you might actually enjoy this movie. And of course, at least for me, every moment with Nicholson on the screen makes up for Cruise. So if you are up for a melodrama version of Top Gun with a few good moments, then watch this movie. If you are really looking for something serious however, this movie probably isn't your cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood Liberals vs the BAD White Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie. Interesting plot, big name stars and an over that top Jack Nicholson. And the famous " You Can't Handle the Truth". A lot to like about this movie and yet there has always been something that just didn't feel right about the casting.Ever watch a lite beer commercial? Ever wonder why it's always 4 guys, 3 whites and a black? Ever wonder why the 3 whites would always invite a black to watch football with them, and why that black would want to spend his free time with none of his own people? Well that's because someone on Madison Ave has decided that every commercial, regardless of product, must have a token black or the world will come to an end. And now we are seeing that the Garcia's bought a Buick.Cruise is the Great White Christian Hero that must be at the center of all movies for the movie to sell, but he is a flawed character. So he needs better people around him to get his head on straight. Thus we are given a Jew and a Female co-councils. The victim is, of course, an Hispanic who was given a Code Red by the guy who is the real hero of the movie, a Black Marine. His sidekick is simple- minded so of course he's white. The judge at the trial? He's of course Black.And who are the bad guys? Jack is very white. Keifer is white and Southern - all that was missing was the hood. Markinson is a coward so he's white too. And the opposing lawyer is Bacon, who's also very white. In the end, the flawed Christian white male wins with the aid of the blacks, Jews and women, defeating all of those bad white men.Yes, it's a Rob Reiner film. This was 1992. If Rob was making this movie today, they'd have to have a gay co-council as well, or perhaps simply replace the Jew. That's how liberalism works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A project for a screen writing class that went above and beyond the rubric</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Few Good Men is the first film written by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who also penned the screenplay for the Broadway play and later for Oscar-nominated films such as Moneyball and The Social Network. The latter films are two I'd consider to be some of the strongest dramas of recent years, while A Few Good Men I'd consider to be one of the more overrated. This is a film that proves that if something easily-digestible, spelled out enough for the audience, given a reasonable amount of believability and unbelievability, and have some A-list stars at its core, that it can make American audiences mistake an adequate movie for a great movie.With the high-praise the film has garnered, it would seem that Americans want recognizable faces, long-winded dialogs that come off as rants, unrealistic behavior in a mature setting, and redundancy in their court films rather than a film that relies on plausible characters and wasn't so reliant on trying to get their actors to spew out the next monologue that feels as if it should be concluded by a deafening applause.The story concerns the death of a marine at the Guantanamo Naval Air Station on account of a hazing incident. Two Marines are in custody and Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) is assigned to the case, along with the lazy, back-talking Navy Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), who just happens to have a polished record of settling court cases. Lieutenant Kaffee is certain they could settle this dispute out of court, with the additional help of Lieutenant Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak), until they discover that the hazing incident may've been ordered by the strict and self-assured Colonel Nathan R. Jessup (Jack Nicholson). The film details the proceedings on the side of the defendant as well as the lengthy trial, where Lieutenant Commander Galloway and Lieutenant Kaffee go up against Kevin Bacon's Jack Ross, a Captain in the Marines.The scenes that concern planning the trial and formulating arguments range from intriguing to monotonous, depending on Sorkin's focus at the time. When the three Marines look to analyze their arguments and hunt for witnesses make up the film's strongest hour, combined with the energy provided by the cast. When Lieutenant Kaffee throws a fit because Galloway and Weinberg are going in a different direction from him is when the film stalls and goes nowhere. Don't get me started on the drunken fit of rage he has towards the end, which is nothing but a tacked-on obligation in storytelling. I can't believe I'll ever say such a thing about Sorkin's writing style, which is usually subtle and very conversational.Unsurprisingly, the most intense work comes during the court scenes, but they themselves have an odd staged feeling to them. Simply put, the characters don't seem to talk like real people in court, but rather people putting on a show for the courts and an audience, as if the trial is being televised. It's also safe to say that Kaffee's behavior is not only something that becomes grating on a particular viewer, as it does the characters in the film, but it is also one of the more unrealistic elements of the movie. I'm not wholly knowledgeable on the military, but I have enough to make the inference that a Lieutenant Commander would likely not tolerate the verbal cockiness and disrespect provided by that of a lower Lieutenant. Especially a female Lieutenant Commander, who likely had to prove herself to be granted such a position.It's that and the utter nonsense the film puts us through, such as the film's conclusion, which makes no mistake at a flag-waving moral that attempts to make us shed a tear. What comes before this, on the contrary, is a very solid speech by Nicholson that has some truth and honesty to it (was I not supposed to side with him in the long run?) By the end of the film, I found myself liking Colonel Jessup a bit more than our protagonist Kaffee. Unlike Kaffee, who talks in the condescending way that he knows everything, Jessup could pass for knowing everything, being older, being more experienced, and more intelligent in the long run. I'm not saying Cruise does a poor job at portraying Kaffee, it's just his character is made a grating, unrealistic Marine stereotype instead of a person we can find appealing outside his shell of arrogance.A Few Good Men does have one subversive quality and that is it's able to refuse adding a relationship subplot between Lieutenant Commander Galloway and Lieutenant Kaffee, unheard of for a film as mainstream-Hollywood as this. At the beginning of the film, based on what I thought was downplayed mutual attraction between Kaffee and Galloway, I was fully expecting a relationship to brew between the two, but one never brews. This is a delightfully mature element for Sorkin, who provides just a taste at what he'd do later in his career. He would later become more skilled at handling numerous characters, events, subplots, and small instances that take place over a long period of time. In A Few Good Men, he feels like he's doing ample work on a project for screen writing. The more I watched the film, the more I wished for a documentary on how military men and women are able to twirl their weapons and perform drills, marches, and stances with incredible precision, which is what the film opens with.Starring: Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Pollak, Jack Nicholson, Kiefer Sutherland, and Kevin Bacon. Directed by: Rob Reiner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I dd nothing wrong, he gave Me an order and I followed it"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aaron Sorkin's Left (West) Wing Ideology has never been in doubt. In this Screenplay from his Play, it is noteworthy that the Military here is given a great deal of respect. Much verbiage is spent on Pride, Unit, and Duty. There are commendable Lifers as well as Heartland Patriots that are shown as good Men, following orders and saluting Flag and Country. But therein lies the rub and the Heart of the Story.It is an old and ambiguous question. Does it all break down if in the Chain of Command someone questions an order by a superior and fails to act upon such orders? Nuremberg and Mai Lai are some recent examples that were used by Defendants that DID NOT question, followed orders and the results were perhaps Criminal and certainly tragic.This Movie is populated by many fine Actors and it is shot with an excellent clean sheen that makes for an atmosphere of Armed Forces ambiance. There have been quibbles from Soldiers, and Lawyers about said professional behavior. Chalk it up to Artistic License. Because what is here is smoothly handled Movie renditions of regimented and strict procedures. Never boring and all engaging, it is a testament to the Writer, Director, and Actors that all come together for a rewarding and enticing look into some very guarded quarters.</fullReview>

All the way through I kept thinking, OK this is good, I like the underdog against all odds thing but I want a convincing ending. What we got was indeed a convincing ending, but a disappointing one. Seeing as how the two officers went down for what they did anyway probably seemed honourable to a lot of people, but to me it was just annoying, it made the rest of the film seem pointless. Also it did take a bit too long to get going and went on for a bit too long, but it was OK to watch and I did enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great court room drama that is a fantastic character study of personnel in the forces as well as an intriguing mystery. Tom Cruise is 'Lt. J.G. Daniel Kaffee', a Havard graduate assigned to defend two marines accused of murder. The two claim they were only carrying out orders, but the commanding officers deny this vehemently. 'Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway' (Demi Moore') is Kaffee's assistant, and together they bring 'Lt. Johnathan Kendrick' (Kiefer Sutherland) and 'Col. Jessop' (Jack Nicholson) to the stand to challenge them......The cast (including Kevin Bacon) are outstanding but the fascinating plot could have been better worked. If director Rob Reiner had kept us guessing longer he would have really wowed us in the end. Still great stuff.Friday, January 1, 1993 - Hoyts Surfers Paradise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classy corps courtroom drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It looks like it might be one thing: Tom Cruise (1992, of course) means stirring if stock melodrama; Demi Moore means sexual promise at the very least; Jack Nicholson bellowing a trailer-friendly line about the truth is likely to be heading a parade of grandstanding A-listers.In fact it turns out to be a much broader, thorough courtroom drama. Not whodunnit so much as whydunnit it already has many fully formed traits of Aaron Sorkin's TV dramas. It's not really bad guys against good guys but high-pitched ethical arguments in what appears to be good-v-bad-guy language. It's very watchable for a film with no action sequences or violence. It's even conspicuously chaste - Demi Moore's appeal is perpetually played down throughout and a planned love scene with Cruise was dispensed with. Thank goodness.In addition to the marketing triumvirate (Moore less good than Cruise or Nicholson, but only because they're on top form) there's a long supporting cast with Bacon, a prostheticised Sutherland, Noah Wyle and even Cuba Gooding Junior taking their turns. 7/10</fullReview>

Jessup would have known that simply keeping his mouth shut would have dropped Kaffe right in the brown stuff.A good movie spoiled by Hollywoodization! 7/10</fullReview>

Everyone is concentrating on the officers in Gitmo and the victim is suddenly unimportant. And why don't those two guys, Downey and what's-his-name-again?, think for themselves?

And Col. Jessup is nothing but a walking clich: he can deal with blood and bullets but not with other people's emotions. In his world soldiers don't have feeling. Feelings make them weak and who is then to guard that wall? This contrast, Jessup and Kaffee, makes the movie interesting. The viewer needs to pay attention to the plot and the dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A court room drama like you may have seen many more before</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though "A Few Good Men" is situated in a military context, it still is a court room drama like you probably may have seen many more before. Despite it's setting it isn't really original, but thanks to the strong performances of actors like Kevin Bacon and Jack Nicholson this movie is certainly worth a watch.A young marine has been beaten to death by two of his comrades in his bed because he didn't always follow orders perfectly. They never intended to kill him, only to teach him a lesson (called a code red), but because the young marine died, they will have to stand trial. They are defended by a young lawyer who doesn't want the case, who doesn't know anything about the facts and who doesn't stand a chance, but gradually will do everything to prove their innocence.As I already said, this is a court room drama like you probably have seen many more before. The acting is OK for most of the actors and only magnificent in Kevin Bacon's and Jack Nicholson's case. The script isn't really exceptional and neither is the way everything is portrayed. However, that doesn't mean this isn't a good movie. Especially when you are a fan of this genre, this is a movie that you shouldn't miss. For the others: watch it, you won't be disappointed by it if you don't expect too much of it in advance. Personally I give it a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Did John Wayne ever produce counterculture, druggie, and socialist flicks?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Then Meathead and ole LSD Sorkin should not meddle in affairs of which they have no clue? After all, who does A Few Good Men describe as the real heroes in the military? Not the soldiers, they're just manipulated pawns or bloodthirsty nuts, take your pick. The real brave and faithful are...........The Lawyers!!!! All in the Family (the left's perspective of the ideal household) or The West Wing (the left's perspective of the ideal executive branch)espouse ideas that I happen to disagree with, but they are alternative ways that might be fitting for many Americans, who knows. On the other hand, if Reiner and Sorkins vision of how the Army/Navy/Air Force/Marines/Coast Guard should operate was put into practice, this country would be overrun faster than most of Europe was during the days of Attila. The US base on Guantanamo has been one of many crazy historical paradoxes, but with the collapse of the iron curtain only several years before the film's release, I guess a communist country to serve as the film's token victim was difficult to find. How amusingly ironic that the same location would serve as a detention spot for the most radical enemies of the U.S. a decade later (and a rallying point for the equally radical opposition to sensible national security policies). There is style in A Few Good Men: The rifle drills at Quantico, perfectly tailored uniforms (though unrealistically brand new, as Hollywood tends to feature clothing and hardware when depicting the armed forces), Demi Moore (she's got the look and brains, just crappy taste in scripts), and Jack Nicholson, whose tremendous acting ability, though almost entirely wasted here, is worth watching. It is not an exagerration to say that Tom Cruise's whiny substitute for acting pretty much makes A Few Good Men look like Top Gun without the airplanes. "You can't handle the truth" ranks up there with "What we've got here is failure to communicate" and "Get busy living or get busy dying" as the most inane yet mystically praised movie quote. Some of the reviewers here agree with me, but others are absolutely smitten by this movie. Oh well, it could've been worse, as the spun-off TV series JAG illustrated a few years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best all-around film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw it again and wondered how it wasn't the Oscar winner. Then I read a comment how it seemed disjoint to somebody. Think "all-around." This is Tom Cruise in his "Top Gun" smart-ass heyday, so "disjoint" was intentional. These days he's a choirboy, because once you go after Jack Nicholson, you hang up the cleats and take a front office job. You've taken on the Everest of sarcasm. Sarcasm starts with feeling too big for the room, which he was with Demi Moore and Kevin Pollak. But to see Cruise "and" Nicholson break stride in the same movie, against each other of course, was worthy of some kind of Oscar on its own. Call it the Simpson's Award for Outstanding Purposeful Irreverence. It showed like no other film, or cartoon, how important irreverent sarcasm can be to show command, control, and power, or to dismantle these attributes when they get into the wrong hands. And nothing can place power firmly into the wrong hands like sarcasm. Strange, it's a movie with ridicule about wartime mentality during peacetime, yet if NORAD had a "Damn the ridicule, let's train for American planes to be hijacked to fly into American buildings," September 11, 2001, might have been another routine day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than "You can't handle the truth!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**Minor Spoilers Ahead!**"You can't handle the truth!"--Jack Nicholson as Colonel Nathan Jessup, from 1992's "A Few Good Men".On any list of the most memorable movie quotes of the last 25 years, probably of all time, this one makes the cut. You may not have seen the film, but you've definitely heard the quote, even if you didn't know the source. The line is also a good summary of the entire film, even if it too often overshadows an excellent motion picture. Yes, the courtroom scenes are Hollywood-ized, but isn't that why movies exist? Adapted by Aaron Sorkin ('Sports Night", "The West Wing") from his stage play, "A Few Good Men" merges a coming-of-age story into a military courtroom drama. Tom Cruise stars as Lt. Daniel Kaffee, a smart-aleck JAG lawyer whose career is on (ahem) cruise control until he runs into Lt. Cmdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) and her relentless, over-achieving work ethic. Together with Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak), they are sent to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, where a Marine has died under suspicious circumstances beneath the command of Nicholson's Col. Jessup. As Kaffee and company investigate, they unearth continually deepening layers of ethics and questions that lead to answers that perhaps should have been left covered.Although the aforementioned quote is the most famous part of "A Few Good Men", the film is much more than just that explosive exchange between Nicholson and Cruise. The first act of the film could almost be classified as a comedy, due to Cruise's spot-on performance of the young Kaffee and his laissez faire demeanor that prefers the softball diamond to the courtroom. But over two hours, the tone seamlessly coalesces into a drama filled with legitimate moral questions. The remarkable mixture of humor and poignancy sinks its teeth into you and refuses to relent, demanding repeat viewings. Go ahead, try to flip the channel when this movie is on (which is often). You'll find yourself entranced, watching and waiting for the climactic final scene, when Nicholson spews the thunderous trademark line.The fantastic content is accentuated by a cast that is stunningly strong from top to bottom. Cruise and Nicholson headline with their powerhouse performances, even though Cruise is playing his normal role as a brash young gun who faces adversity and learns about both life and himself. He deserves credit not only for one of his best turns, but also for ceding to Nicholson when necessary, permitting the veteran actor to dominate the film, despite appearing in only three scenes. Moore and Pollak transform roles that are only slightly more than one-dimensional and often thankless into stellar supporting work that softly complements Cruise's to-the-max attitude. J.T. Walsh and Keifer Sutherland also hit their notes perfectly, and even the small supporting roles are filled well by now familiar names such as Cuba Gooding, Noah Wyle, and Christopher Guest. The camera work in a courtroom drama is rarely noteworthy, but cinematographer Robert Richardson ("Kill Bill", "JFK") provides an exception. Utilizing a dramatic 2.35:1 aspect ratio, Richardson fills every inch of the screen with smartly lit images. You may not notice initially watching the widescreen edition, but view a fullscreen or television version, and you'll get seasick following the faux pans that struggle to keep up with Richardson's superb work. The music of Marc Shaiman, who commonly collaborates with director Rob Reiner, is similar to that of television's "Law &amp; Order", minimalistic but suitable, driving but not overpowering, and appropriately uses known songs like "Stars &amp; Stripes Forever" and "Hound Dog". Speaking of Reiner, this is his last great film, and it concluded a remarkable run that included "This is Spinal Tap", "When Harry Met Sally...", and "The Princess Bride". Although the film is vastly different in tone than his previous work, Reiner's cinematic sense remains evident in the well-placed humor, the consistent pace, and the building drama. For many, "A Few Good Men" is little more than "You can't handle the truth!" But if you watch the entire film, you will be impressed by the overall quality, and it may even strike a deep chord within you as well. When I first experienced it, I was contemplating a law career, possessed by a strong desire to seek justice in all cases. In part because of that, the film clicked with me immediately, as it pointed out both the clarity and the vagaries of the law. But the ethical dilemmas and Nicholson's line linger long after the verdict has been rendered, providing one of the great movie quotes wrapped inside a complex and compelling film.Bottom Line: One of the best of the 1990s. 10/10, which I know is generous, but this is just one of those films that strikes a chord with me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the sophisticated films ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was 20, I thought "The Godfather" was the best film ever made and I was convinced, that this movie is unsurpassable. When I got 30, I saw "The Shawshenk Redemption" and thought this is the first film, which could challenge that movie. Now, when I got 40, I saw this movie on TV and I was surprised, that I haven't seen this jewel of movies before. The plot is quite simple, an American soldiers has been killed but the army is interested to burke the murder by offering benignant punishment to the accused delinquents. What happens is, that the typical David vs. Goliath - situation arises, but the turnarounds, which occur, the savvy with which the characters act is incomparable. I wonder why this movie has not received any academy awards as this movie, with the 'artistic' highly performing actors as Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Jack Nicholson is one of the best I have ever seen. This is an unforgettable movie. See it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Marines-Hollywood Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of the court martial of two marines based in Guantanamo Bay. The story revolves around the actual court martial trial and the naval defense team who defend the marines. Jack Nicholson does his usual great job as the Lieutenant Colonel who commands the base and Kiefer Sutherland is superb as Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, the two marine's gung-ho company commander. Tom Cruise does an adequate job as the sardonic Lt. Daniel Kaffee the head of the defense team. So where do we begin with this review? The most striking thing to me about this movie is how bad it makes the United States Marines look, which is not surprising since it was directed by the ultra-leftist Rob Reiner. From some of the dialog in the movie it's clear that whoever wrote the screenplay has not a clue as to what it's like to be in the Armed Services. One of the funniest lines in the movie, though it surely wasn't meant to be by the screenwriter, was when one of the two marines, they had just been dishonorably discharged, remarks how as marines their job was to help the weak. HELP THE WEAK? This is the Marine Corps they do a lot of things but helping the weak ?give me a break.. Only Hollywood could make up tripe like this. Rob Reiner is notorious for thrusting his political views into his movies (An American President) and done right and with subtlety it can add some color to a movie but Reiner clubs the movie viewer over the head with his extreme views and this usually makes his movies and the actors he directs little more than cartoon caricatures. Bad Movie-save your money or go out and rent a good John Wayne movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Analysis of plot confusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen the film more than once and again last night, I remain confused, and if I'm just being dumb, missed something, I wish someone would point it out. I'm talking about the plot, now, not the performances, which I thought were great. But the plot? Now, I take it that the soldier victim was murdered by having a poisoned rag stuffed in his mouth, during the act of what was supposed to be a hazing. And the 2 marines who did it certainly had a motive, because the victim was reporting one of them for unauthorized acts with a gun over the border of Guantanamo into Cuba. OK. Well, if it was a poisoned rag, and an expert witness, a doctor, said it was (despite the usual expected denials of the defense attorney), then are we to believe that the POISONING was ordered from the top? Hardly. We're led to believe that the HAZING was ordered from the top (the Code Red order). Would these marines have hazed without the so-called Code Red? One might think so, except for the fact that we are told they were completely duty-bound to military discipline, and would not execute a hazing without authority from above. Well, why introduce the rag as poisoned in the first place? Murder is not part of military discipline, is it? Authority does occasionally turn its back on hazing as sometimes beneficial, and whether or not Nicholson's General authorized it or allowed it, or even ordered it, does not seem to me to be such a horrendous act. But if the marines did poison the victim, then they should have been convicted of murder, and not have gotten away with it.Was the Doctor giving false evidence under oath? Can't believe that he was part of a cover-up conspiracy. So the ending simply left me feeling very frustrated (and limp), that the writers had not thought this through. And more, how was it that the victim was on his way home at the time on the grounds that he wanted out of military service? Is the military usually so permissive towards unhappy soldiers? No, this 3 hour movie became all trees at the expense of the wood. In entertainment, the established wood should always be perfect, everything else is detail.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding performances dominate this legal thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Few Good Men is absolutely my favorite film. The drama of the plot is definitely compelling but the greatness of this movie comes from the performances. Tom Cruise plays a carefree and somewhat cocky young lawyer, something that he does with ease. Most of the breaks of comedy in this film come from Cruise and his interaction with costars Demi Moore and Jack Nicholson. Jack Nicholson is perfect as Jessup - forceful, stern, and intimidating. Keifer Southerland is also perfect as Kendrick, rightly described by Jessup as a "weasel." Demi Moore and Kevin Bacon also shine. Another reason that I enjoyed this film is because it is an exciting thriller that contains little to no violence. People who liked this film will probably also like the TV series Law &amp; Order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. This is a great film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now I can see why Tom Cruise &amp; Jack Nicholson get $$$$$$$$$$$ per movie. Actually, I first saw this film at the cinema in December 1992. I'd gone down to London one evening to sleep in my brother's (empty) flat and then catch an early morning flight. When I got there, horror, I'd forgotten the key. After walking around and panicking for an hour I slipped into a cinema and saw A Few Good Men. Seriously, after a few minutes I'd completely forgotten about the mess I was in. It's THAT good. (MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!!) This is not the best film I've ever seen but, God, it made me THINK more than any other. 11.5 years later, I still am :) A young Marine has died under suspicious circumstances in Cuba. Was it an accident, or negligence, or Murder? He was certainly attacked by 2 other marines, but how far up the 'chain' does it go? Navy lawyers Tom Cruise and Demi Moore must find out. This film has (literally) an all-star cast, and it shows throughout. I particularly loved the scene where Tom Cruise "loses it" and the sporadic scenes where we get glimpses of the supressed violence in Nicholson's character. Wonderful. I only have 2 criticisms of this film, and they're both minor ones. Firstly, I don't believe any Lt Cdr (Moore) would tolerate such insurbordination from a Lt (Cruise). Secondly, the character of Markinson (though stunningly portrayed) was a bit unrealistic. The USMC are probably the toughest soldiers in the world and I don't think a Lt Colonel would let himself be bullied by ANYONE; even a superior officer. That aside, it's sheer entertainment throughout. This movie really challenges the audience too. If I were Pte Downey or Cpl Dawson or Col Jessup (in real life &amp; with the information they had) I actually think I'd have done the same. Pte Santiago was a 'sub-standard' Marine and a 'snitch'; didn't he deserve to be punished? After all, the Medical Officer (incorrectly) said there was nothing physically wrong with him. Yes, this film will really make you think. Well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the audience is robbed of the element of surprise for Kaffee's strategy toward Jessup in the climatic scene because we are informed of it beforehand, I nevertheless found that scene to be a great finale to a fine legal drama. The cast is spectacular not only where the headliners are concerned but even down to actors that had only one scene or two (eg. Noah Wyle, Cuba Gooding Jr). As for the story itself, I was hooked from the opening frame. This was a walk of life I had only a very vague passing familiarity with. In the end, although Kaffee is right, there has to be a certain sympathy for the position of Jessup. Great story and very strong performances, 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I am speechless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie for more than 5 times and I can never get tired of it. The tension in this movie is absolutely incredible. Although, I can't comment on the accuracy of the US army and marines, I'm certain in reality, we don't get such humorous, sexy, dramatic lawyers prancing around in tailor-made suits. As mentioned before, the tension is absolutely delicious! It's not the plot, but mostly how the speech is delivered that really makes it sound convincing. In addition, it's more about the fast-paced repartee between characters like Demi Moore/Tom Cruise (batting scene at the park), Cruise/Nicholson, Cruise aggressively defending his client/making his cliched speeches etc.. which is analogous to a serious bunch of hard-core academics with real work ethics that makes the film so appealing. I personally think the plot and whole storyline is completely irrelevant, and the characters closely resemble what most would aspire to be in real life.I am quite surprised by Demi Moore's performance, which I think she should play more of to strengthen her versatility as an actress. I personally think she was chosen for her stoic attractive looks, kind of like gillian anderson in x-files or jodie foster in silence of the lambs but I think she really surprised us with her outstanding performance. Maybe the outstanding bit is due to the fact that I've never seen her in this role.Cruise on the other hand, is quite good. I didn't say outstanding in this instance, is because we are so used to seeing him play many intense, dramatic roles ie. fourth of july, vanilla sky, minority report that his roles began to lose their novelty. I wonder if we will feel the same way with Russell Crowe. One thing about Cruise is that he seems to have perfected his cocky, humorous, sexy character which was also seen in days of thunder (I might have gotten this movie title wrong but where he played a pilot) and this formula seems to work well for him in many of his roles.Nicholson is a seasoned actor. He's capable of playing convincing parts but I just didn't think he was brilliant in this movie.All in all, I rate "a few good men" a classic because the delivery is something that I can hear over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're a fan of great acting, this film should be on the top of your list, or close to it. Every single cast member, lead and supporting, is incredible. I haven't seen the film in a long time, so I was mainly looking forward to seeing Jack Nicholson's performance, since I'm an avid fan of Jack's. Well, he only appears on screen for about 20 minutes total. I would say I was disappointed, but my anticipation to see Jack kept growing and growing, until he blew me away with the climactic courtroom scene. "You can't handle the truth!" has become such a signature line that you can't help but shout it along with him when the scene pops up. Tom Cruise is also great, perfectly cast in the lead role. I always feel that Cruise is underrated, as people regard him as a pretty boy movie star first, and an actor next. There are some actors who have nothing else to go on but their looks, but Cruise is not one of them. And I can't help but give kudos to the supporting cast which includes Demi Moore, Kevin Pollak (not playing the center of comic relief for a change), Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland, the late J.T. Walsh, James Marshall, Cuba Gooding Jr. (in a cameo appearance) and many others. The script is tight and powerful, filled with wonderful dialogue by Aaron Sorkin. As a matter of fact, now I feel like purchasing a videotape of the play from which the movie is based on. And in the midst of all the drama, the film never neglects to have a sense of humor. Rob Reiner shows that along with being a fine comic actor and comedy director, he can direct a fine drama (as he's shown with "Misery" and "Ghosts of Mississippi"). The score is wonderful as well. My score: 8 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`A Few Good Men' is a riveting, exciting and ultimately compelling courtroom drama. While a lot of similarly themed movies have a tendency to be complicated and often lose their way long before the end, this is pure, straightforward entertainment. It maintains the same pace throughout and remains thoroughly engaging. With a star-studded cast including Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland and Jack Nicholson, the movie promises big and delivers even better. There are brilliant performances all across the board. Nicholson was the only to receive the Oscar nomination but he deserved it. Tom Cruise is great as the slick, rookie lawyer while Demi Moore gives one of her best performances before she was just too expensive to cast in any film.`A Few Good Men' also has one of the most famous scenes in Hollywood history. `You want the truth? You can't handle the truth'- the courtroom climax was an excellent way to finish an already superb film. With top-notch acting, script, narrative etc. `A Few Good Men' is a classic if there ever was one. If you haven't yet seen it, I urge you to check it out. My IMDb rating: a whopping 8.5/10.</fullReview>

The supporting cast includes Demi Moore, Kevin Pollack, Wolfgang Bodison, Kevin Bacon, Keifer Sutherland, J.T. Walsh, and Cuba Gooding Jr.The acting is mediocre. Not very good. The script is written poorly as the movie is not very suspensful, but yet it is still aired on TV almost every week out where I live. I find it hard to believe that this movie got nominated for several Academy Awards and yet, the far superior RULES OF ENGAGEMENT did not win any. There is some bad cinemetography and some cheesy wannabe suspense scenes which make this seem almost like a made for TV movie, but still the film is good. I like the way Cruise always manages to give off some sarcastic one-liner and how he gets them out of trouble in the very end. The whole thing is very typical and even predictable. But, it still makes for a good movie.A FEW GOOD MEN gets 4/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OUTSTANDING Movie, captures the very essence of the CORPS!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie does for the Marine Corps what Top Gun did for the Navy. An excellent example of the Corps is all about. Hopefully the "public" will understand what Espirt De Corps is all about.The one thing that seemed to stand out, at least as far as Marines' are concerned, is the term "CODE RED". The closest thing to a "CODE RED" that I can come up with is what's referred to as a "blanket party". An example of a "blanket party" can be seen on FULL METAL JACKET.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The American President before seeing this one. Mr. Sorkin's work is amazing. His speeches are capable of inspiring anyone, whether it be Michael Douglas's "My name is Andrew Shepherd and I AM the President of the United States!", or if it is Jack Nicholson screaming at Tom Cruise about the truth: "You want the truth?" Kaffee: "I think i'm entitled." Jessup: "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!" Now this line has been parodied a lot but when you watch it, it still strikes you as very emotional. I gave this movie a ten on the imdb ratings, and I gave it an A+ on my own scale. This is definetly a can't miss thriller!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Few Good Men is one of the best dramas ever. The acting is first rate, Tom Cruise, Demi Moore,but Jack Nicholson was the best. I usually don't sit through movies this long without stopping it, but this movie was so interesting and the story was so engrossing that it seemed like 20 minutes and it was over.

		<shortDescription>watch this again and be amazed. one day, this could be the great american film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i watched this again because i wanted a 13-yr old kid in my charge to understand that heroism is about making the right decisions in precious moments, that there are certain inviolable limits to the subordination of individual responsibility, and that his country, our country, is a great nation founded on great principles. i was not disappointed.i have always regarded mr. reiner and mr. sorkin's masterpiece as a better allegorical comment on the nazi question (how could this happen? who was to blame? how can we stop it from happening again?) than any directly philosophical drama. it addresses the relations of man to country and of man to man in a purely american way, complete with conservative litany, judicial review, and the possibility of honor in private life. this movie may very well grow to replace john wayne westerns and wwII movies as peak american patriotic cinema.i should say that i do not enjoy mr. nicholson or mr. cruise in any of their other works (not a single one), and i often have trouble with ms. moore's artistic sense and mr. bacon's depth of characterization. mr. guest and mr. sutherland have never been favorites. in this movie, no doubt thanks to mr. reiner, i would not hesitate to give each actor a standing ovation.as good and as celebrated as mr. nicholson and mr. cruise are in this movie, the crucial work is from the supporting cast: ms. moore's dewing eyes -- what more can society give to the hero when he risks it all for what is right? mr. sutherland's annoyance at having to undergo moral examination and his confused self-righteous anger as lt. kendrick, "did you give the order?", "no I did not," -- see how he looks away? mr. bodison's sympathetic treatment of lance corporal dawson, whose thoughts and feelings are so clearly announced with barely a word, who desperately wants to resolve the conflict between being a good marine and being a good man -- he represents us in this script of course.would this movie work if even one of the interlude shots of an american monument were removed?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every so often a film is released which gets better every time you watch it. A typical example of this would be Monty Python's 'The Life of Brian'. Although of a completely different genre to the 70's comedy flic, 'A Few Good Men' fits this category perfectly as well.It's a shame that people aren't more open minded when they go to the cinema because, although 'A Few Good Men' is a real gem of a film, the plot doesn't really sound that fascinating.Tom Cruise plays Lt. Daniel Kaffee, a young navy barrister, who only needs "..five more cases for a set of steak knives." Kaffee's next case isn't going to be straight forward though. He is called in to defend two marines accused of murdering a fellow soldier, although they claim to have been acting under their Colonel's orders.The unmistakeable Jack Nicholson plays Col. Nathan R. Jessep, a tough-talking Vietnam veteran, who doesn't take kindly to Kaffee snooping around his base.Whilst the audience learn to hate Jessep as the film progresses, Nicholson's performance is one of film legend. During the infamous trial scene Nicholson splurts out, in the space of about five minutes, approximately 15 quotes that would feature in any film buff's vocabulary. Cruise isn't bad either, although Demi Moore's performance as Lt. Commander Jo Ann Galloway is less than impressive. Kevin Pollak makes one of his small appearances as Kaffee's sidekick and Keifer Sutherland impresses as tough marine Jonathan Kendrick.Definitely one to own on video and watch with your mates at least every six months. Come to think of it it was about six months since I saw it last so if you'll excuse me I'm going to find the video now and poison my brain with even more movie dialogue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The search for the truth.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent courtroom drama, with the U.S. Military used as a backdrop. When PFC Santiago is found dead, a dramatic trial eventually begins to try the men who killed him. However, all is not as it seems at face value.This is a very entertaining movie, with some superb acting. I mean, hey, Jack Nicholson's in it! In actual fact, while he is a top-billed actor in this film, Nicholson doesn't have a whole lot of on-screen time here. But that's not to say that he doesn't add to the movie... the scenes where he IS on-screen are some of the best ones.Tom Cruise is also admirable in this film, especially during the climax. Kevin Pollack good too; in fact, I think that he is an extremely underrated actor to begin with. Demi Moore's performance is average, as usual, and Kevin Bacon and Kiefer Sutherland turn in their usual supporting role type performances.Overall, this movie has a good storyline, and increasingly kept me on the edge of my seat for the duration. There are a few classic scenes in this movie, and for that reason alone, it isn't a film to be missed. In particular, the climax of this film is superb from all angles... well acted, somewhat surprising, and actually a tad bit humorous, from my perspective. There is definitely an on-screen adversarial chemistry between Cruise and Nicholson. If you like "courtroom drama" type films, give this one a look-see, especially if you are a fan of Jack Nicholson or Tom Cruise at his best.My Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

Outstanding direction by Reiner, great script, and strong if not excellent performances by Cruise, Moore, Pollak, and the late Jt Walsh. Jack Nicholson gives perhaps his most powerful, if not best acting performance as the crooked Nathan Jessop. How he didn't win best supporting actor for that role is beyond me.The plot develops well. Demi Moore and Tom Cruise have good chemistry.. and even Kevin Pollak and Demi Moore's characters dislike for one another is done well and helps strengthen the story.I believe this is a must-see flick. Id love to see Reiner hook up with Jack and Tom Cruise again, as i think they make an excellent combo.On a scale of 1 to 10, i believe this movie is a 10!

Demi Moore, ex-wife of Bruce Willis gives her definite best performance, though I feel they could've gotten someone better to play the character. Kevin Bacon delivers a force on screen, such as never before, and Kevin Pollack gives a definite best performance. Jack Nicholson, of whom is in the film not much, but enough not to be listed as a cameo, gives a pulse pounding performance, with those ever famous words, 'You Can't handle the Truth!'The director of A FEW GOOD MEN is Rob Reiner (the Princess Bride), and he does a wonderful job directing this all star cast. He truly delivers just what we want as the screen moves on, as such he did with THE PRINCESS BRIDE.If you're looking for a solid, rock hard movie delivering some of the actors best performances, then I definitely recommend A FEW GOOD MEN to you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Skewed Depiction of The Military</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rob Reiner's production provides a very skewed view of the United States Marine Corps.While misconduct occurs in any branch of the U.S. military, Reiner makes a caricature of of a Marine colonel, who is on track to be selected soon for his first star.There are obvious holes in Colonel Jessup's character, which would have emerged long before becoming a full colonel. Nicholson's characterization in the courtroom borders on Jack Torrance from "The Shining". No officer in a position of command and responsibility, puts on such a show in the courtroom. Emotional, over-the-top types do not get command of such a critical post. As others have mentioned, Colonel Jessup, while not demurring, would certainly have shown the utmost in courtesy to peer and subordinate officers and NCO's.Tom Cruise comes off as he usually does, stiff and overly emotional, occupying the middle of the scene.It's no wonder that the U.S. Navy, and U.S. Marine Corps did not cooperate with the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without Jack Nicholson, in a relatively small on-screen role, this would be an average movie. As is, it's barely above average. With Nicholson this would go on to receive 4 academy award and 5 golden Gobe nominations including a Best Picture nom in both. There's no way that this is deserving of best picture. This has a unique distinction of being being written as a play but it's film rights sold before it was ever staged. As a play it would go on to a successful Broadway run and is still being staged in revivals around the world. I could see this being a play with plenty of dialog and character interaction enhanced by the confines of the stage and minimal sets but as a film it kind of falls flat as being slow paced, implausible and predictable. Two Marines(Wolfgang Bodison &amp; James Marshall) stationed at Guantanamo Bay are to stand trial in the death of a fellow enlisted man. A Naval JAG team of Lt. Daniel Kaffe (Tom Cruise), Lt. Com Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) and Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) are sent in as the defense team to offer the accused a plea bargain. Galloway senses there is more to the story than meets the eye and convinces Kaffee to investigate further. Col. Nathan Jessep (Jack Nicholson) is an aging, bigoted Cold War warrior with one last promotion around the corner. He is suspected by the Naval law team sent in of ordering the murder of the Marine in collusion with his aide Lt. Col Markinson (J.T. Walsh) and the dead Marine's platoon leader Lt. Kendrik (Kiefer Sutherland) in covering it up. Capt. Jack Ross (Kevin Bacon) represents the government in prosecuting the two accused Marines. Kaffe and company want to turn the tables on Jessup. directed by Rob Reiner from the play's author Aaron Sorkin's own screenplay. Courtroom drams are always popular but since its so predictable there is not much drama here. Nicholson is memorable. Cruise is over the top in over acting. Moore is uninspired and seems on the verge of weepiness throughout. Pollak is along for the ride. Sutherland and Bacon have underdeveloped roles. J.T. Walsh is good. So despite it's big name cast there aren't many shining moments. Not bad but more like a made for TV move. I would give it a 7.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A real movie of two halves. When a US Marine is killed in his bunk, it is up to two hot shot young military lawyers to get to the bottom of what happened. Along the way, they must fight against the machismo of the Marine Corps and their code of values, as well as a hard as they come Colonel played by that master of the over acting, Jack Nicholson. Fairly lengthy, clocking in just under the two hour twenty mark, this takes a while to build up a head of steam and, in truth, the first half is hackneyed Hollywoodese of the worst kind. All of the protagonists are 'The Beautiful People' and each has a sharpness of wit to rival their good looks. Problem is though, you simply fail to believe that any of the characters are real, in particular the Cruise / Moore characters. You get the vague impression that there is supposed to be a little sexual chemistry between the pair, but it simply never convinces. Then the halfway mark strikes, and suddenly the court case begins, and everything changes. Tense, taut, with a razor sharp script, this is top drawer movie making. It's just a shame the first half took so damn long to finish. First half: 1/5 Second half 5/5. So overall, 3/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best dramas ever made, especially about military law, as it shows perfectly that the system doesn't work. The military courts often result in people being punished for a crime they didn't commit. The system doesn't work because it's based on minor details. This movie shows very clearly that this form of "justice" doesn't work. It's very well-made, the acting is all top-notch, even for most of the minor characters, and the script is well-written. The plot is good, and moves at a great pace. You never lose interest in the story, after it attracts you within the first five minutes. The acting is nearly all perfect, with perfect performances by each of the big names in the cast, and even several of the lesser known actors. The characters are well-written and credible. The dialog is some of the best written and most quotable in any film ever. The court scenes are well-filmed and interesting, and some of the best I've ever seen in a court drama. Overall, it's one of the best, most well-made court dramas I've ever seen, and it's worth seeing for any fan of such films. I recommend this to fans of dramas in general, but specifically fans of court dramas, especially those who have an interest in military law. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All in all the movie was entertaining, however the heated exchange between Kaffee and Jessep seemed a bit over the top, when you consider the fact that the solider laid in his bed, died from a heart attack, with a rag crammed in his mouth. The hearing never revealed any poison placed on the rag. The commander of the base, Col. Jessep has to report a death. In his report he describes how the soldier died. Basically of what appears to be natural causes. However as the commander of the base I have to report to head quarters that the deceased had a rag found in his mouth at the time of the discovery of the body.Why would the commander send this report to headquarters knowing he gave the order to have the man disciplined? The order did not call for death. Never! So Private Santiago died, but not of anything violent. The rag was the only thing peculiar in his body at the time of his demise. A code red turns out to simply be that of stuffing a rag in the mans mouth. Simply opening up the individuals mouth, inserting the rag and the soldier dies off. I'll let you figure it out from there. Great movie, however if I had to put my life in the hands of an attorney, I would not put it in the hands of Tom Cruise or Demi Moore or the other gentleman, somehow these people ended up sending a commanding officer off to prison who never gave the actual order to kill Private Santiago. The code red simply was to discipline, and the rag was a form of discipline, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Harold, you don't need to wear a patch on your arm to have honor." ? Lt. Daniel Kaffee What's special, or even topical, about this movie is it speaks to how military honor can be so readily suborned by the authoritarian impulse. And second, how the same honest pride?not to mention competence?is necessary to bring such posturing would-be tyrants to justice. No, I"m not going to launch into another angled criticism of the Bushoviks; but the facts are apropos: in the name of a notion of high-minded military protection the Cheney-Bush Oil Junta (CBOJ) performs criminal acts of the highest, deadliest, and most treasonable nature.CBOJ's acts are much worse in scale than what Colonel Nathan Jessep (Jack Nicholson in an Academy Award-winning role) is ultimately accused of, which is ordering a "Code Red" that winds up killing a Marine in his barracks on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (Gitmo). But what he's accused of is of the same essence, bred of the same perverse conceit of absolute power. This movie originates from a stage play of the same name by the same author, and it's based on actual events. A young, Judge Advocate General Corps (JAG) Lieutenant Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise) intends to coast thru his service time playing softball and pleading cases (so they don't have to go to trial). Nonetheless, his higher ups select him to defend two Marines charged with a hazing death at Gitmo. It's an important case to Lieutenant Commander JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore), who feels many of the explanations don't add up. Though an attorney with an elevated position in what is the Navy's version of internal affairs, she lacks the confidence and acumen of Kaffee?son of a famous trial attorney who had a decorated career in the Marines. Kaffee is supremely capable as a trial attorney, yet is immature, hiding a deep anxiety that he can never measure up to his late father. This is the basis for character development as the plot moves forward. Lt. Weinberg (Kevin Pollak) is appointed to assist Kaffee, and provide a nice comic balance to the grueling Marine Corps gravitas.The three attorneys travel to Gitmo, interview several officers and enlisted men: Jessep, his CO Lt. Col. Matthew Andrew Markins (J.T. Walsh), and Jessep's true henchman on the base Lt. Jonathan Kendricks (Kiefer Sutherland).......For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fantastic mix with the army and a courtroom drama, from Golden Globe nominated director Rob Reiner (Misery). Basically two army soldiers are convicted of a crime that no-one is sure they committed. The victim had a towel or something (possibly poisoned) pushed down his throat, and he bled inside till death. Lt. Daniel Kaffee (Golden Globe nominated Tom Cruise) along with Lt. Cdr. JoAnne Galloway (Demi Moore) are determined to prove their innocence. On the other side of the argument, acting as a friend Capt. Jack Ross (Kevin Bacon) who knows that they are short on facts, but they'll have more eventually. Kaffee discovers from one of the involved (witnesses) that their was a secret flight for the victim, and many phone calls arranged by Col. Nathan R. Jessep (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jack Nicholson). Towards the end is the most gripping as to Jessep's confession, and eventually an arrest. Also starring Kiefer Sutherland as Lt. Jonathan Kendrick and Cuba Gooding Jr. as Cpl. Carl Hammaker. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. Tom Cruise was number 32, and Jack Nicholson number 6 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Cruise was also number 81, and Nicholson number 71 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, Nicholson was number 63, and Cruise number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Nicholson was number 7 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 29 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes ("You can't handle the truth!").

		<shortDescription>The blanket of freedom; A thoughtful courtroom drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Few Good Men, is a thrilling courtroom that will leave you thinking very heavily at the end of the film. It is one of the best court room dramas i have watched till now, though my favourite is still Inherit the Wind. You'll come out of this film questioning things like the dogmatic nature of the army and whether reason and compassion are inapplicable in an environment of dogmatism. of course, there's the accountability of the US Government and its ability to cynically shift the blame to individuals, safeguarding its key personnel. what struck me most though was the issue of whether a soldier has rights, and should be treated like another human being or is he simply a serf of the government and so an automaton. a film like this illuminates these intriguing and contentious issues especially in the wake of the increased prisoner abuse scandals in recent years.Character wise, the film is full of exceptionally strong personalities, and while Jesep embodies the unquestionable commitment of a soldier and his status as someone greater than the average citizen, Kaffee epitomizes the average citizen who according to Nicholson, doesn't understand the what it takes to provide for his freedoms and rights. here essentially is the rub; as much as it is true that soldier garner immense respectability for what they do for the common man, helping provide his rights and freedoms; does it mean that a soldier then has to sacrifise his or her inalienable rights not forgetting that he is still an American citizen? Accountability therefore is the main question in this film.the crackdown of the case to the "truth" is very well constructed and the intervening discussion scenes between Kaffee, Galloway and Wienberg highlight the inner struggle for Kaffee and the dangers of this unprecedented risk he takes. the intensity of the court cases keep u glued and i must say now finally i am willing to accept that tom cruise can indeed ACT! he shines in the courtroom scenes though Nicholson's brooding intensity is still unmatched. the strong cast deliver good performances. pace is crucial in a courtroom drama, to keep the viewer focused and here, the pace is focused, rapid and intense. it keeps u glued to your seats and eagerly anticipating the outcome.technically, the director did a brilliant job not adding any superfluous scenes (extra comedy, sex, etc) and this helps keeps the viewer focused on the proceedings of the court case. background music is reduced to a modicum very much in tune with the setting of the film. cinematography is good, though not outstanding.in a nutshell, if u have about 3hrs to spend and wisely, this film is worth watching. it may not be exceptional or award-winning but definitely a very good film with a strong cast and a well-constructed plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Tom Cruise, Jack Nicholson and Demi Moore star in Rob Reiner's unanimously acclaimed drama about the dangerous difference between following orders and following one's conscience," according to the DVD sleeve description, "Cruise stars as a brash Navy lawyer who's teamed with a gung-ho litigator (Moore) in a politically explosive murder case. Charged with defending two Marines accused of killing a fellow soldier, they are confronted with complex issues of loyalty and honor - including its most sacred code and its most formidable warrior (Nicholson)." The is the film to see for Nicholson's amazing "You can't handle the truth!" supporting actor performance; he may lose the argument with Cruise, but wins all acting honors. Indeed, leading stars Cruise and Moore pale in comparison to nearly everyone else in the cast - but, admittedly, they have the more challenging hero and heroine roles. The script, which Aaron Sorkin adapted from his own hit play, and Reiner direction are strengths. "A Few Good Men" should be a lesson in box office power - polished production, star director, powerful cast, and intelligent story.******* A Few Good Men (12/9/92) Rob Reiner ~ Tom Cruise, Demi Moore, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Bacon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Woof.... this is a good movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the first problem with the movie to be Demi Moore and Tom Cruise. Their acting and characters were just horrid. Almost everyone else surrounding them was quite good to excellent. The two mains were stiff, stilted, unappealing, and illogical. That whole "rich white slacker" thing was so comic-booky it ruined any suspension of disbelief. Overdone. Overacted too often. The only thing it missed was a scene of Cruise dancing by himself in the street with a transistor radio blasting pop music.Then there was the lack of a good hook in the first half. Every character aside from Jack's was bland or over obvious, obnoxious or pure plot-device. It began to turn a little more appealing as the turgid court scenes began and rolled on.Next, the lack of logic. Enough threads and reviews here have covered how un-courtly many scenes are, also how it makes little sense how the witnesses were motivated. Most court dramas are pretty sad, because in order to make a good court drama you have to get drama in a court. Courts are orchestrated to present plain testimony and evidence, not to have surprise evidence and emotional outbursts.Ultimately, the only memorable thing in this movie is Nickolson's riveting acting. The plot wasn't particularly clever, the premise average, the characters forgettable (aside from Jack), and the ending comically convenient. Jack N. made the movie, and thus made Sorkin. Nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good court room drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is just a good courtroom drama, nothing else. The military fails to meet minimum U.S. Marins Corps standards for authenticity. Why? A prisoner has lost the privilege to salute a superior officer, but in the movie he does salute twice: in the brig and at the end of the movie. Another failure, the rank insignia of Marine Corps officers was way out of alignment. Also, when they raised the flag in the movie, it was done silently! No way!! Also, you learn early in Boot Camp not to follow illegal orders. A 'Code Red' is obviously an illegal order; therefore, you do not follow that order. And to think a former member of the military wrote this as a play before selling it to Hollywood! I am very surprised and disappointed in the movie. It does not represent the military; but as a courtroom drama, it does very well. I rated it accordingly: this should have been a TV drama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still don't understand the popularity of A Few Good Men. The story is formulaic, the acting is average (save Nicholson's performance), and the film looks like a TV show from an aesthetical basis. Tom Cruise and Demi Moore have no idea how to act, and their good looks are quite out of place in a film of such a nature. The only good scene is Nicholson's famous yelling toward the end of the film. But it seems to me to be a waste of time to watch a movie just to hear one lousy line that we've all heard so many times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mostly harmless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The hype surrounding this film is nearly as windy as the film itself. It's really more like a made for TV drama, apart from the big name cast. The soundtrack underlines that impression in me at least. The dialogue is bombastic, with acting to match. The characters are pretty one dimensional with the usual A to B motivations and it really shows itself to be much ado about nothing by the end. For all the apparent machinations and guilt and so forth, there really isn't much going on. Even on the first viewing the intrigue was minimal and the whole "military morality" angle was forced. Sure, I know it's the central theme but the second half of the film practically has it in captions under the screen. The subject matter is relatively small though; an accidental death at a US military base; the old "It's impossible through words to describe what is necessary..." school versus the rights and privileges of a civil society in peace time. Normally I'd applaud that, something that straightforward sets the stage for a good morality play with insights into an arcane institution. But this is, for want of a better word, preachy. Oh well, it did it's job I suppose; the cast performs valiantly and it ignited the "My, isn't military jurisprudence interesting" genre (and let's face it, it is interesting; the authority works in a completely different way to the usual cop drama) probably inspiring the TV series JAG and a slew of more recent films. And, although I'm ragging on it, I've seen it several times. It's surprisingly entertaining and I'll probably watch it next time it comes on TV. Which is where it belongs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Good Moments Is More Like It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Few Good Men" is a deep, courtroom drama that is neither deep nor dramatic. The film deals with a young JAG officer (Tom Cruise) who is trying to get to the truth about a young soldier who was killed by his own men for an unknown reason. Throughout, the film tries to do something special but never does reach the mark. There are some real dull moments throughout and the viewer wonders where the film is going on several occasions. When the film finally reaches its destination, the viewer feels somewhat cheated by what he/she has seen. The performances are uneven, the direction is suspect, and the screenplay is not as smart as it would like to be. Tom Cruise disappoints. Demi Moore, Kevin Pollak, Kevin Bacon, and Kiefer Sutherland all seem to have trouble with the questionable material. With that said, Jack Nicholson (in his 10th Oscar-nominated performance) and J.T. Walsh carry the film as far as it can go. The film shows signs of life only when Nicholson is on screen, which is not often enough. A few good moments and a few good quotes by Nicholson make this film better than it should have been. A very sympathetic 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie totally scrubs the real chain of command for Marines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The flaw in this movie is its portrayal of a Marine Corps with no senior enlisted men ("Gunny" Sergeants) to train the troops, and also train junior officers. And, when necessary?to get in the face of an abusive or crazy Lt or even a Col. This changes the whole texture of the Marine Corps "chain of command" and necessitates Military Lawyers and Judges rescuing the "troops" from crazed officers.So the movie's plot hinges upon the cynical actions of a couple of senior Marine Corps officers, and one junior officer being turned loose on a couple guys in the "E-4 and below" pay grades. The idea of a Colonel getting in the details of disciplining a fragile and marginally performing Pfc tests credibility. Yet, without these pieces in the plot line, there's no conflict, and no story. This is not a knock on the acting performances of all the stars and supporting cast. Their work was great. It's the screenplay that is seriously flawed and misleading.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a load of rubbish!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can lend a completely different perspective to my review: not only did I serve with the Marines, but I was stationed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. There are so many gross inaccuracies in this film. Never did I remember a colonel having a waitered lunch in a private area that looked like it was in a villa! I don't remember my superior officer calling me by my first name, as Nicolson did to Keifer Sutherland. Tom Cruise's performance was over-the-top and he was a poor officer: he put his hands in his pockets, he carried items in his right hand and he went into a superior officer's office eating an apple? And oh yeah, the Marines and Navy personnel do not salute indoors either, which was depicted in the cheesy final scene. But the thing that bothered me most is the anti-military bent that penetrates this film. As a leftist writer like Sorkin knows, you have to make your views subtle or else it will look like you are preaching. You also have to throw in some humor in order to off-set the preachiness. They used the same tactics on "All in the Family" which starred Rob Reiner, who directed this film. Sorkin was responsible for "The American President" in which the president was a card-carrying member of the ACLU, an organization that was founded by a member of the Communist Party USA.The Marines are described as "fanatical", Sutherland's character is predictably cast as an uptight, quasi-racist, Bible-toting officer from the South. And who are the heroes of this film? The lawyers! Gimme a break!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cruise in his most flashy role up to that time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How could anyone not be entertained by this movie. It pulls out all the stops to make sure that everything that happens is laid out with big hand gestures and Tom Cruise gets to be in virtual every scene and chews the scenery so completely that even Jack Nicholson is put to shame.Too bad that none of the other co-stars, like Demi Moore or Kevin Bacon, who are big stars in their own right, gets to have a moment here and there. Bacon is a cog of the plot and Moore must have been sedated through most of the court room scenes. She must have been kicking herself afterwards just to see if she was still breathing.The late, great J.T. Walsh is also on board although this time his role is slightly more sympathetic than usual. He holds the key to all the answers of the plot and is willing to spill the beans to Cruise without provisions. His later fate (minor spoiler) is rather poetic to say the least but is quickly forgotten to make room for the more exciting final battle in the court room between Nicholson and Cruise.By the way, Nicholson does only have two scenes but it is not hard to see that what ever the other actors do will pale in comparison to him and Cruise at the end.So is this worth seeing? Definitely, if you have never seen a courtroom drama before. The pace is fast and furious compared to the rather similar Tommy Lee Jones vehicle (I forget the name of it). See if you can spot any real surprises though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In which Mr Cruise and Ms Moore run the Nuremberg Defence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Demi Moore is an easy target.For a start the intellectual snobs who have the arrogance to think their opinion matters more than the next person's i.e. the broadsheet critics ,would never take her seriously unless she changed her name to some derivative of Katherine or displayed an uncanny ability with various foreign accents and hadn't been married to their bete noir Mr Bruce Willis.Unfortunately none of those conditions apply. Consequently she is not well regarded and it is assumed from the start that she will bring very little to a film other than a certain elfin charm.This is doing her a serious injustice for in "A few good men" she plays a naval officer promoted to a rank she doesn't feel entirely comfortable with.Consequently although she may appear to be confident and "together" this is in fact far from the case.She knows she is not accepted by the long - service officers but is not prepared to either be "one of the boys" or sleep around in order to gain their acceptance. Miss Moore conveys this uncertainty and stubborness perfectly. Her eyes constantly reflect her deep doubts and the fragility behind the facade.It is a performance unjustly overlooked in the slightly ridiculous rush to praise Jack Nicholson for trotting out another baleful -eyed Great American Actor cameo.You can almost watch the scenery disappearing before your eyes. Tom Cruise is totally unconvincing as the lazy spoiled Ivy League Naval lawyer whose epiphany turns the case around.Well,I could certainly believe he was lazy and spoiled,but the rest didn't work for me. The Nuremberg Defence?Well,it didn't work for the Nazis,but perhaps Military Law has become more sophisticated in the intervening years. "I was only obeying orders" is perhaps the ultimate military cop - out. If a Court Martial were to find in favour of a service person whose counsel resorted to such a line,no one would be safe and the whole Military Establishment would be out of control.Imagine that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom Cruise and Demi Moore play uniformed Navy lawyers assigned to defend two Marines charged with murder after an illegal hazing results in death. Was it murder or just a prank gone very wrong? That's the crux of the plot, which culminates in the military courtroom. Jack Nicholson plays the Marine commander intent on keeping what happened very hush-hush.With this kind of cast and Reiner in the director's chair, you expect fireworks. Fireworks between Moore and Cruise, and fireworks of a different kind in the courtroom. Absolutely nothing of the former, and not nearly enough of the latter.A Few Good Men hosts an all-star cast and director, but fails to deliver the goods in the end. Not a bad movie, but I expected much more and in the end was disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cruise Control</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Cruise is an interesting case. He has built a veritable empire as an actor while somehow rarely even attempting anything resembling real acting. Instead, his approach is more of a sort of anti-acting. What I mean is that he does everything he can to divert attention away from his apparent lack of acting skills. This film is a perfect study.Try this. Watch this one while paying attention to Cruise and try to find a single line delivered where he doesn't occupy himself physically. You'll find an almost pathological pattern of wild poses and physical activity that he employs during his dialogue. He disguises his ineptitude with a combination of exaggerated gestures and poses, if not while more completely engaged in the physical, such as the two(!) scenes in which his delivery includes shagging baseballs.With the exception of "Eyes Wide Shut" (Kubrick worked a miracle), nuance and subtlety are non-existent to his career. When faced with a real acting challenge (such as professing heartfelt love for his wife) he opts for the misdirection move of jumping up to the chair to yelp out his uncontainable joy.It's the perfect gesture-ized acting style for a tele-evangelist, which happens to be Tom's side job.Anyways, after suffering through this for about 1/4 of the film, Nicholson appears to make a fool of Tom by putting on a clinic of nuance. I've noticed a few recent films like this where a bad actor was cast alongside real talent, and the result is never a good one.By this point in his career Tom can play only one character, and any producer wishing to hire him knows exactly what he is getting. Check out "Magnolia" for a rare apt use of Cruise's antics.But don't look for it here. Instead, watch this film with the sound off, then try not to laugh out loud. The mute button serves to remove the distractive plot, to isolate his portfolio of outrageous gestures.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A surprising amount of time, money and energy was spent here on what is essentially a "Perry Mason" rerun in which the ultimate malefactor breaks down on the witness stand to confess all. The major characters' overblown caricature-like personalities only further the sense that the plot is very, very weak. The performances themselves are cartoonish and childish without even a touch of subtlety. We all know that Jack Nickelson plays Jack Nickelson very well. The soldiers were portrayed as either upholding the mighty code of the Marines or just following orders. Really? Even Cruise says that did not work at Nuremburg or My Lai. Are these people saying those sentiments still live in the Marines? If so this movie did nothing at all to document such a notion. The overall cinematography were good, but even that seemed out of touch with the subject nature of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overlong unimaginative courtroom drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Big-name army courtroom drama, obviously based on a stage play and despite attempts to open out the scope of the action, never getting away from its set-bound roots. It's also not helped by clunky overacting from the three A-List leads and some of the hokiest dialogue ever heard this side of "Pearl Harbour". There's barely a sentence uttered which sounds natural and unforced. Ironically there's a Reiner-ian attempt at humour as Cruise converses in little vignettes with his news-vendor talking purely in clichs, not realising in fact that everyone on board already talks in clichs. Cruise is excruciating in his "maverick" role as the green defence attorney up against big bad Jack , refusing of course to give in, before smartening and toughening up to win a sort of victory for his two young Marine defendants. He acts like it's Risky Business, overacting fit to jump up on Oprah's couch some 15 years early and is completely implausible from the off. Nicholson I can't stand in anything so apologies for the bias - here we get the same trademark mannered domineering, deranged performance he's adopted ad-nauseum since "The Shining", he gets his obligatory "big line" - "You can't handle the truth", and the whole film is obviously set up for his fall from grace at the climax. Moore acts the sensible sidekick cipher to Cruise's off-beat lead, clocking up more clichs to the dozen than anyone else as she naturally overcomes her initial frustrations at his unconventional callowness to of course become his head cheer-leader in his showdown with Nicholson. It's a wonder they don't get physically involved just to complete her "journey"! That's the big names summarily dealt with although there are some half decent performances in their considerable wakes, from notably JT Walsh, Kevin Bacon, Kiefer Sutherland and the actors playing the young marine defendants, but on the whole I found it easy to predict scenes in advance (for example, Walsh's appearance in Cruise's car, Moore's rapprochement with Cruise on her day-off) - in fact I was sometimes able to pre-guess some of the dialogue in advance. Rob Reiner directs stolidly inserting symbols of American virtue every five minutes or so (The White House, The Capitol Building, The Stars and Stripes, okay, Rob, we get it!) with music used like exclamation marks to punctuate every major plot development but it just looks like what it is - a filmed play and to make that really work afresh you either need to be an innovative original director or be working with exceptional material. This film has neither and suffers accordingly.</fullReview>

Nicholson and Cruise are in top form, but the seem to be energizing pretty tedious material, the plot is just too simple to carry a movie for 2 1/2 hours. It seems people like this movie so much due to Jack Nicholson's cornball speeches "Can You Handle The Truth?", its not all that impressive. Demi Moore is actually the biggest embarrassment to this film, she should never be allowed to act again. Tom Cruise is pretty cornball as well, all of his silly monologues seem to go nowhere. Its frustrating how good this film could have been with say, a better script, different direction, and maybe different leads such to replace Moore and Cruise. I dont understand all of the great reviews for the film, these people must have been brainwashed somehow. I cant give this film any more than a 5, and thats being generous.
